1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,350
Five four,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,513
three,

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,353
two.

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,183
Oh Shit.

5
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,970
We're back my all time favorite
kind of podcasts by companions.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,620
Eddie,

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,590
come on through fucking Bravo's house.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,490
Thank you for having me.

9
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,590
Brendan.

10
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,040
Mother fucking kid.

11
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,130
Kido Quito tee shirt on.

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,200
I told the dude to make
a kid Quito tee shirt.

13
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:22,621
He fuck it.

14
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,131
Jumps on.

15
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,830
That Shit is an entrepreneur.

16
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,230
The kido kids stuff.

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,300
What does that Ketogenic
ketosis a bad for a while.

18
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:33,914
I'm a forest.

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,200
No,

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,271
no,

21
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:34,410
no.

22
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,050
He got me on.

23
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm obsessed with it.

24
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,180
Last night I was in a Phoenix
walking by restaurant.

25
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,103
This girl,

26
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,170
maybe 18 goes Shahab I'm I keyed.

27
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,900
Okay.

28
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,733
Head

29
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,280
a bunch of older dudes to like,

30
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,550
who the fuck is she talking about?

31
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,570
Larry is,

32
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,900
that's so fun and just shot
the documentary sugarcoated.

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,651
Oh my God.

34
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,160
Have you seen it?

35
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,940
It's terrifying.

36
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,773
Holy Shit.

37
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,510
Mother on that sugar movie
seen that sugar movie.

38
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,790
Jesus.

39
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,740
Jesus fucking Christ.

40
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:04,580
Sugar is terrible.

41
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,090
I'm just a conspiracy theory here.

42
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,910
I had no idea it was right
in front of my fucking face.

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,950
It's not everyone's on everyone's table.

44
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,960
What it is,

45
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:13,320
man.

46
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,500
It's a drug and people are addicted
to it and it's in everything.

47
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,681
No,

48
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,100
but what I'm talking about is there
was a conspiracy to pay off Harvard

49
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,910
scientists and professors here we go
to keep sugar according to that movie.

50
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,451
I'm gonna stop movies.

51
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:24,860
Bullshit.

52
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,070
No,

53
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,903
I'm sure it works.

54
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,100
Then when we talking about
the sugar association,

55
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,240
they didn't want it to be labeled
as for what it really was,

56
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,840
uh,

57
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,081
uh,

58
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,430
an addictive toxin.

59
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,540
They want her to keep it.

60
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,210
It ain't that bad in
moderation and ain't that bad.

61
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,680
It makes things taste sweet.

62
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,514
It's about love.

63
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,383
So they,

64
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,850
they paid according to this documentary,

65
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,590
they paid out Harvey now
cause everyone's like,

66
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,424
I'm science,

67
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm a science.

68
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,301
This,

69
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,450
I'm science that says it's beautiful when
people do that because then all you do

70
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,580
is buy up all the scientists
and you got everybody.

71
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,600
I love some sugar though,

72
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,350
man.

73
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,250
Everybody loves sugar.

74
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,084
That's the thing about it.

75
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,960
It tastes awesome.

76
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,920
I mean it doesn't,

77
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,921
it's not a drug that works because the
effects aren't pleasurable like sugar.

78
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:05,060
It's very pleasurable.

79
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,050
It also has its benefits too.

80
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,460
Postworkout stuff like that.

81
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,930
Certain athletes need that stuff,

82
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,070
so it's different than a lot of

83
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,490
sense that there's arguments against that.

84
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,630
Let's say there's more for it.

85
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,740
I don't know that's a sugar coated
because I know about the conspiracy.

86
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,060
Brendan is about that.

87
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:21,750
Exactly.

88
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,360
I always thought when people ask
me about sugar gets bad for you,

89
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,970
but as long as you don't get
too crazy with it and you don't,

90
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,170
you don't have nothing to worry about.

91
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:28,980
You're not fat.

92
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,080
Only fat people have something
to worry about as long as,

93
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,510
but according to this documentary,

94
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,830
people that are in shape are getting
adult onset diabetes because they think

95
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:42,831
that apparently according to this doc
one coke a day increases your chances for

96
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,340
diabetes by 30% if she,

97
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,250
if that Shit's true.

98
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,280
It's a lot of coke and one coke a day is
some insane amount of 50 grams of sugar

99
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,400
sugar,

100
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,820
40 40 it's only supposed
to have 25 in a day.

101
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
It's ensuring,

102
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,020
yeah,

103
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,220
that's including fruit.

104
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,160
Lactose.

105
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,061
You're only,

106
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:06,061
you're only supposed to get sugar and no
more than 25 grams and actually nobody

107
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,530
deals with fuck that noise.

108
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,730
As a kid I was balls deep.

109
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:11,790
200 grams a day.

110
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,143
Watch.

111
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,900
That's what it's about.

112
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,200
We bring it back to the postworkout
shit cause mark Sisson was talking about

113
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,320
actual gains that your body has more
gains if you wait up to an hour after a

114
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,980
working out before you supplement,

115
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,050
before you take anything
for you taking any food.

116
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,620
And I started doing it and he said that
there's a like a reaction that your body

117
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:31,630
has where it produces more um,

118
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,640
hormones because your body is just had
like this brutal workout and your body

119
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,290
hasn't had a replenishment.

120
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,400
So because it has an end,

121
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,121
a replenishment,

122
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,950
I guess during that time period,

123
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,870
if you replenish,

124
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,010
I think the sign,

125
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,350
the sciences or the your according to him,

126
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,591
I mean,

127
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,150
I don't know what studies smartest done.

128
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,260
It does a very smart dude.

129
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,150
I'll take his word.

130
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,460
Yeah.

131
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,470
That it's better to do it that way.

132
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:58,471
You get more results hormonally than
you do if you immediately glycogen load

133
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,780
because otherwise your body
stops doing what was going to do.

134
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,051
Right.

135
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,240
Because let's slow it slows it.

136
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,631
But you know,

137
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,500
it's so hard to,

138
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:05,981
oh,

139
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,670
how the fuck do you know exactly
how someone got their gains?

140
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,271
You know,

141
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,440
you're talking about athletes,

142
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:11,621
right?

143
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,350
So you're talking about
people all work out hard.

144
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,420
There's some of genetic
freaks and you know,

145
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,110
most people are on slightly varied diets
and slightly varied sleep schedules.

146
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,700
So it's super hard to say like,

147
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,070
if a guy didn't do it that way,

148
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:28,690
how much of a game he would calculate?

149
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,100
I had some silly bitch telling me forever
to drink chocolate milk mail that was

150
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,810
supposed to be the craze for get them
off the time that was supposed to be the

151
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:35,310
craze.

152
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:35,530
It's,

153
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,240
it's a good excuse to eat chocolate milk.

154
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,103
Hell yeah.

155
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,071
Hell yeah.

156
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,780
It was so Nestle Quik,

157
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,520
so with a fight that's about to start.

158
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:43,241
Bruce Bruce,

159
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,870
buffer looking slick as always is
Josh Berkman verses Paul Felder.

160
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a fucking amazing fight.

161
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,331
Great.

162
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,140
First of all,

163
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,960
Josh Berkman has fought
as high as two oh five.

164
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,090
Josh Berkman fought Jeremy
Horn one day and uh,

165
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,330
Jeremy Horn choked him out and
spit on him and his aggressive.

166
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,191
Oh my God.

167
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,980
They must have said some really dark
shit to each other before that fight.

168
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,580
That's aggressive.

169
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,010
But Josh Barkman is a
bad motherfucker dude.

170
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,850
And at one 55 he's so God damn strong.

171
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,790
If he can do it and do it successfully,

172
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,290
he's a bully at this weight.

173
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,310
He's just a tough,

174
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,710
tough motherfucker and he's slick.

175
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,920
But this Paul Felder kid
can crack a lot of tools.

176
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,560
I feel like it has more tools
I think standing he does,

177
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,020
but Berkman is down dude,

178
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,090
that guy with his board game.

179
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,130
But I feel like the game,

180
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,480
it's evolving fast and filters more
evolved them accent and younger and less

181
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:34,920
miles.

182
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,790
What I like about this
less miles for sure,

183
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,230
but what I like about this fight is,

184
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,240
this is essentially an old real fucking
crafty veteran in Berkman who is a dog.

185
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,380
I mean he's a fucking bull dog.

186
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,890
Game is they comp and
you have less other yeah,

187
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,611
fuck him.

188
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,031
And he shut.

189
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,650
Heck Act along bowed down to one point.

190
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,380
One word was on Tuesday and
Lavard was juiced up and you know,

191
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,214
Lombard

192
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,410
kept swinging at him
and Berkman kept moon.

193
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,060
But Berkman was cracking him a little.

194
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,390
Yeah.

195
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,810
And it got lumbar to a point
where Lombard slowed down his,

196
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,290
uh,

197
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,260
his attack because he kind of knew that
he wasn't gonna Take Burke Mountain.

198
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,820
He was going to have to do the long haul.

199
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,380
Like our Feldman TKL.

200
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,890
Do we have to say man?

201
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,840
Oh yeah,

202
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,720
it's four 50 right now for 48,

203
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,250
four 47 first round.

204
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,084
Paul Felder,

205
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,110
Josh Bergman,

206
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,910
a fight that I've been
really looking to for this.

207
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,700
I feel like this whole card
is totally under the radar.

208
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,330
I mean Hanan Barao was
fighting Jeremy Stevens,

209
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,030
the fucking,

210
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,110
the Khomeini.

211
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,751
It's incest,

212
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:31,380
the combing.

213
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,230
I think it's more,

214
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,691
you know,

215
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,230
there's no,

216
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,390
like for the average fan,

217
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,800
there's no huge draws.

218
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,080
But as far as Joe Silva and those,

219
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,030
and Joe Silva,

220
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,570
who's the other dude
who does the matchups,

221
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,470
Sean,

222
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,190
Sean Shelby,

223
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,550
Bro,

224
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,170
they got their money's worth.

225
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,621
You know what I'm saying?

226
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:49,610
Like they paid them exactly what they
should do because these matchups,

227
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,010
these aren't matchups that
you can go like five or six,

228
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,340
right?

229
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,120
Two verse three there are amazing to
me it's the best card of the year.

230
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,970
I'm pretty sure Sean handles the match
ups for the lighter weight fighters.

231
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,360
Correct.

232
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,871
And then,

233
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,470
I dunno what,

234
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:00,681
what?

235
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,360
Wait a silver takes over,

236
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,340
but we,

237
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,940
both of them are doing
a fucking awesome job.

238
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,221
And this,

239
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,054
this card,

240
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,380
this card show,

241
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,851
you look at it,

242
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,780
you're like Jesus Christ.

243
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,643
They just want the matchups.

244
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,461
I wouldn't think about it.

245
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,420
They just went shinny Shin.

246
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,860
Let's pay attention to the year though.

247
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,280
No,

248
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,391
no,

249
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:13,520
no.

250
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,390
Really good cars.

251
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,430
As far as match up match up wise,

252
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,780
it's an amazing card.

253
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,920
It's a really good card.

254
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,581
It's way,

255
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,310
way better than people
are giving it credit for.

256
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:22,990
I mean this is a,

257
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,490
this is the first UFC I ever saw.

258
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,801
I'd be like,

259
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,634
Holy Shit,

260
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,840
what a nutty sport.

261
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,060
I'll call this UFC just fucking watch.

262
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,960
Just like straight up.

263
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:30,800
Just watch it man.

264
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,790
I know you don't know the guys,

265
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,400
but this is going to be a great night
of fights and if you're betting it's can

266
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:37,460
be tough to pick man for experts.

267
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,420
Try picking this card.

268
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,980
I'd like to see someone just go,

269
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,850
whatever,

270
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,390
uh,

271
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,200
eight for eight.

272
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,033
It's going to be a beast.

273
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:43,761
Yeah.

274
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:44,594
You know what man?

275
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,310
This is a sneaky fight.

276
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:46,941
Oh good.

277
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:51,140
Nice front kick to the body
by Felder and Josh returns it

278
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,763
perfect.

279
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,540
Felt has got a lot of tools
when it comes to standup.

280
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,560
He's a real sneaky,

281
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,310
he does a lot of weird shit like
cowboy man training at the ranch.

282
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,860
Real similar in some ways,

283
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,830
but also because he's got
a taekwondo background.

284
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,480
He throws more spinning
shit than cowboy does.

285
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,660
Cowboys like straight Moy Tai who these
guys are straight forward a couple of

286
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,021
times.

287
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,040
Man had a lot of checking.

288
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,341
Good,

289
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,930
good defensive skills here.

290
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,133
Yeah.

291
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,260
Felder's off fucking attack or two man,

292
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,220
he's tough as shit.

293
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,800
Berkman went to a belt or
before that Raymond had kids.

294
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:27,291
He got caught,

295
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,570
went to world series of fighting.

296
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,561
Any choked out.

297
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,191
John Fitch.

298
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:30,890
Remember that fight?

299
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,630
Yes.

300
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,120
Do.

301
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,100
That was a huge fight.

302
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,491
Yeah.

303
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,350
He choked out Fitch and real quick fit.

304
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,610
Shot in for a single.

305
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,601
Was that the fight one?

306
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,650
Fitch tested positive?

307
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,610
No,

308
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,470
that was the Paul Horace fight.

309
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,370
Boom.

310
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,930
Paul has got that knee.

311
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,230
He got him to pour as
his fucking leg locks.

312
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,070
I mean maybe Fitch was like fucking,

313
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,050
I know this guy's on it.

314
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah.

315
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:50,950
Yeah.

316
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,850
Understandable.

317
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,660
Yeah.

318
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,230
Who knows?

319
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,700
Did you see bars get wrecked?

320
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,311
Yeah,

321
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:56,700
I daddy got Merk got wrecked.

322
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,220
Wrecked by some viking dude.

323
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,520
Fuck the one named Mick like 50 seconds.

324
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,200
I don't even know the
name of the show dude.

325
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,750
It was the show where mayhem.

326
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,250
Uh,

327
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,090
weight in 20 somethings rounds.

328
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,060
Burke too.

329
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,840
He got submitted.

330
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,231
Yeah,

331
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,760
I would think that's a fatigue thing.

332
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,700
I think it's more he just
don't want to be there.

333
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,790
It's like self sabotage.

334
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,390
Need the money.

335
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,160
Ma'Ams ground game was so legit.

336
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,420
Super legit.

337
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,780
It'd be real hard to tap that
guy for doing black belt.

338
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,081
Yeah.

339
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,040
Well rolled with him a bunch.

340
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,910
He's a monster.

341
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,744
Yeah.

342
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,860
Jason's no joke.

343
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,581
I remember,

344
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:26,880
uh,

345
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,241
when,

346
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:27,900
uh,

347
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,630
Jason fought Jake shields and had his
back and had a fully locked in Vernon

348
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,000
naked choke in the fucking bell rang.

349
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,230
I mean he had a,

350
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:35,520
I believe he had gable grip,

351
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,140
but he had it under the
Chin and everything.

352
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,873
It was a tight,

353
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,750
tight squeeze.

354
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,950
Oh Shit.

355
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,371
They're going home.

356
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,990
Wore Nike.

357
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,041
What's some good movement?

358
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,340
You see?

359
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,680
But this is what Berkman wants.

360
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:45,990
Fell down.

361
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,920
He's a not do this.

362
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,880
He's more technical.

363
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,710
Boom.

364
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,860
We get some guys back.

365
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,330
Oh it fell.

366
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,140
Just take them.

367
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,420
Failed is in a bad place here because
on the ground Berchmans a beast.

368
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,490
Super fucking strong again.

369
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:00,780
You gotta think about Berkman has fought
successfully at one 70 and all the way

370
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,420
up to like two oh five we get
that old man strength through.

371
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,060
He just tossed as youngness.

372
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,610
He's just a guy who's been
around a long fucking time.

373
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:09,840
He's a smart dude too.

374
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,471
Yeah.

375
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:10,671
And that,

376
00:10:10,671 --> 00:10:12,810
that Hector Lombard fight
shows how smart he is.

377
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,160
He was never really in the pocket.

378
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,760
He just avoid all his is.

379
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,520
He doesn't lose his shit.

380
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,141
No.

381
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:18,390
Like,

382
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,460
like the fire will be hot as fuck and he
sits in there and doesn't lose control

383
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:22,651
man.

384
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,370
Exactly.

385
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,760
He can do what he can do and
he's not going to fall short.

386
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,650
Psychologic stays in his lane to,

387
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,060
he doesn't try anything too crazy.

388
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:30,210
You know,

389
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,540
I can see you have fricking stupid
Chris Weidman bullshit spinning kick or

390
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,180
something like that.

391
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,350
Yeah,

392
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,090
we never saw that from Weidman here.

393
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,370
He did.

394
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,940
Well let's not see it ever again as crazy.

395
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,540
Crazy.

396
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,650
It costs you the fight son.

397
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,070
Yeah.

398
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,510
The Art of getting back up is,

399
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,150
I mean it's so deep.

400
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,090
It's the fence crawl.

401
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,880
Some is really good at it.

402
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,700
Some guys are okay and who's
the best I've ever seen who?

403
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,773
Keith treading.

404
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,290
Really?

405
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,980
Oh my God.

406
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,550
He's tried to do things.

407
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,720
God Damn Animal Dude.

408
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,440
He would always go,

409
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,640
go,

410
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,420
go straight to the cage and walk,

411
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,373
go walk.

412
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,400
He was just such a beast.

413
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,440
Straight to the Cajun way.

414
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,170
Wherever you work,

415
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,180
you got to get to the case.

416
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:04,230
That was his thing and
that's what I started doing.

417
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:04,951
That people like no,

418
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,350
what are you doing?

419
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,750
Like I doesn't a pound your face and,

420
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,550
but that was Keith thing really.

421
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,460
So he was one of the first guys to
figure out to use the case to get up.

422
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:11,940
He,

423
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,601
that was his thing.

424
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,920
As soon as you get taken down.

425
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,940
If the guy had your hips,

426
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,490
you are scooting to get to the
cage to use it to crawl up,

427
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,200
and then he was so fucking good at it,

428
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:19,500
man.

429
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,480
None of us get holding down.

430
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,300
Hmm.

431
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,133
Interesting.

432
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,801
Yeah.

433
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:26,370
Keith Jardeen is a guy who doesn't get
the credit he deserves and a lot of ways

434
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,420
that's fight with chuck.

435
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm going to fight with trial.

436
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,640
What a fight.

437
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,631
Lift that leg up,

438
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,380
man.

439
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,830
Yeah.

440
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,010
Keith was real smart with the application
of leg kicks and he hit him with that

441
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,670
big right hand.

442
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,870
So awkward man.

443
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,380
This,

444
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,530
this whole like I rang a Tang jump,

445
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,373
jiggy hands,

446
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,141
so offered.

447
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:42,600
He wrote Turang and tank style.

448
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,493
Ooh.

449
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,820
Berkman cracked him.

450
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:45,310
Here we go.

451
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,920
This oh sidekick.

452
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,391
Boom.

453
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,490
Straight left lunging sidekick.

454
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:50,791
Yeah,

455
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,450
he's doing that.

456
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,070
A lot of guys are doing
that till legs now.

457
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,551
Dangerous.

458
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:55,930
Jon Jones loves doing that.

459
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,650
Dangerous.

460
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,550
You mean for someone's knee?

461
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:57,960
Look,

462
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,450
you see Berchmans willing these exchanges.

463
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,881
What would you,

464
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,290
I'd rather have someone
do that to my knee.

465
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,850
Then someone Shin kicked me in the head.

466
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,310
Definitely dangerous.

467
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,340
It's more dangerous than that.

468
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,110
It's totally agree.

469
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,620
100% totally good point.

470
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,493
There's good.

471
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,151
Yeah,

472
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:15,151
but the idea is that we're used to
being able to tap from knee injuries.

473
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,541
So,

474
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:16,721
uh,

475
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:16,931
you know,

476
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,190
because of like a knee bar.

477
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,760
So when people look at a strike to a
naval go all that's not fair because he

478
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:22,570
can't tap.

479
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:22,991
But Eddie,

480
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,430
you made the perfect point.

481
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,510
It's the perfect point.

482
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,530
That's a fight.

483
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:26,711
Yeah.

484
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,000
Because if you kick somebody in the head,

485
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:29,110
it's fucking way worse.

486
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,130
You can't tap to that.

487
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,630
Let's,

488
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,630
let's just pull up,

489
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,411
but let's just go over the,

490
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:36,520
so if you knocked me out by head kick on
what spending six months you kicked me

491
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,070
in that front knee,

492
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,320
you blow blow my ACL.

493
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,681
NCL.

494
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,970
I can't work for a year.

495
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,750
At least I,

496
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,580
we'll come back.

497
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's be totally honest.

498
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,880
If you get,

499
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,040
never heard of that ever happening.

500
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:45,874
I've never heard of it.

501
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,750
It's like,

502
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,310
just start with just the new thing.

503
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,290
Give a title in the UFC it's always,

504
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,491
no,

505
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:51,551
no,

506
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:51,760
no,

507
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,571
it's been legal.

508
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,080
But Jon Jones is really the
first guy to start doing it.

509
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,110
Act upon felt to just cracked him.

510
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,230
Guys getting kicked like that.

511
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,150
Like does one five eggs break.

512
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,030
There's one finance Miguel Torres,

513
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,620
Miguel Torres gets um,

514
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,710
he get an oblique kicked on the knee
and is this was in a legacy kickboxing

515
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:11,021
fight?

516
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:11,854
I think it was.

517
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,880
It was pretty recent,

518
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:13,990
like within two years.

519
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,580
And Miguel Torres,

520
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,040
his knee just went fucking sideways.

521
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:23,041
It was nasty and he screamed and fell
down and got back up and kept fighting.

522
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,030
I don't know how the fuck he did it.

523
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,300
That's one guy that I thought it was the
Sharon Woods would still be at the top.

524
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,900
Miguel.

525
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,733
Miguel.

526
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,173
Well this is what,

527
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,621
this is what I was going to say.

528
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,370
Knockouts,

529
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,203
man,

530
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,260
you're not,

531
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,770
it's not just as simple as you get your
ligament repair and you do your rehab

532
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,251
and your back.

533
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,070
Nine months later you might
not ever be the same guy again.

534
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,020
Talking about the dot count.

535
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,211
Yeah,

536
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:44,330
like a real knockout,

537
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,700
like a real knockout.

538
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
But that's what you sign up for.

539
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,910
You expect concussions now.

540
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,490
I don't expect get my
need blown out in a fight.

541
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,840
But it's a part of your body.

542
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,580
Like if someone can attack your head walk,

543
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,840
shouldn't he be able to attack your knee?

544
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,260
Will same.

545
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,140
Seems crazy.

546
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,130
Fell let's same reason the NFL.

547
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,230
Like you can't attack the
idea that sells a sport.

548
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,780
Yeah,

549
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,150
let's use,

550
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,560
this is a sport,

551
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,380
but this is the sport of fighting what?

552
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,230
With rules?

553
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,561
Yeah,

554
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,880
but the rules are stricter.

555
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,680
Rules are already really brutal.

556
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,250
Like the idea of taking out a rule of
kicking the knee when you can kick a guy

557
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,840
in the fucking jaw face.

558
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,260
But I can't kick him in the face if
he has three points on the ground.

559
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,120
So there are rules.

560
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,680
So you can't say it in that sport.

561
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,760
Well honestly I don't
agree with that either.

562
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,900
I don't agree with that either.

563
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,110
I think this,

564
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,900
you see where that UFC line is?

565
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,720
See where the outside logo
is and this is the line,

566
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,920
the inner rock to guys.

567
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,100
What I say is everything
outside that octagon,

568
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,770
you can't kick him in the face
because it's too close to the cage.

569
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,470
The only problem with kicking someone in
the face when they're down is that the

570
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,770
cage could prevent you from moving and
you'd get kicked with something that you

571
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,540
couldn't normally have prevented.

572
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,140
So there's a an obstacle and that
obstacle is sort of artificial.

573
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,780
And since we can't just an enormous
basketball size playing field,

574
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:54,950
which is really ideal,

575
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,100
the ideal way to do MMA
is not to have any walls.

576
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,140
There's something stupid
about having walls.

577
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,361
Well,

578
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:04,490
we really should have is a
large like football size arena.

579
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,841
Put a guy and I said,

580
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,141
why not?

581
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,100
You have it for football,

582
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,380
but a guy,

583
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,571
he put it,

584
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:10,180
God guys,

585
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,790
look and feel it.

586
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,340
That's the only way you're
not having this bullshit.

587
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:13,941
See,

588
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:17,360
there's nothing wrong with learning how
to clinch and fight up against the cage.

589
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,540
It's super important
because you use a cage.

590
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,190
But in reality a real fight should
not have anything to do with the wall.

591
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,260
You press the guy up against in a sport,

592
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,880
you have to have a structure,

593
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:29,080
bro.

594
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,390
No,

595
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:29,780
you,

596
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,770
you stay in bounds.

597
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,790
This is your boundaries.

598
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,624
You have a big ass,

599
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,460
terrible experience at Disney babies.

600
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,590
But you wouldn't have this shit.

601
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,840
You wouldn't have this
pressing against the wall.

602
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,820
It is an art form,

603
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:47,000
but it's an art form that's
artificially created by an obstacle.

604
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,860
This obstacle should not be there.

605
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,560
You shouldn't be.

606
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,140
Shouldn't be able to
press people against it.

607
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:51,621
But no,

608
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:51,950
that's,

609
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,820
it shouldn't be.

610
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,500
But that shouldn't be a part of fighting.

611
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,310
So there's,

612
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,150
there's water everywhere to you.

613
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,040
Free treason.

614
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,333
He can't do it.

615
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,190
I'll put it in football.

616
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,220
That's like saying well there
should be no out of bounds.

617
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,054
You guys just run.

618
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,940
Football has bounds.

619
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,070
They have plenty of room
cause you never larger.

620
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,070
They have a large arena but oh fell
to just cracked him on the left hand.

621
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,111
This man,

622
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:15,810
I said second round,

623
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,340
just hill.

624
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,720
I think offenses are artificial and
I think they should fight in large

625
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,450
unenclosed areas and
if you hate viewership,

626
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,063
money,

627
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,760
purity.

628
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,930
I want no gloves,

629
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,191
no more gloves,

630
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:29,060
no more hand wraps,

631
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,511
no risks,

632
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:30,680
shapes Dr own shit.

633
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,851
No more.

634
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:32,490
No,

635
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,440
this is nonsense.

636
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,370
He's gloves are stupid.

637
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,413
These gloves,

638
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,210
these gloves only exists for
people to watch at home day,

639
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,044
brother.

640
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,850
Only for people watching at home.

641
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,410
If you're a real martial artist,

642
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:44,360
you would not want gloves because gloves,

643
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,100
gloves give you this artificial idea
that you can hit someone as hard as you

644
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:49,970
want with your hands,

645
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,380
without them exploding on you,

646
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,690
but you got everything
taped up wrapped up.

647
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,250
Unless you're going to Nelson,

648
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,770
that gangster ass motherfucker
doesn't even wear wraps.

649
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,933
He's just good.

650
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,893
I'm just going to

651
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,390
punch you and choke you.

652
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,931
He's like,

653
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,220
I'd like to fit in my hands.

654
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,990
I could fit it better.

655
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,040
You're not getting on Fox with no,

656
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,920
no gloves.

657
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,530
Fuck you know this case fell.

658
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,130
Felton was getting hit by
Barbosa with those kicks.

659
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,023
Felder,

660
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,300
Feldman,

661
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,550
the no fucks,

662
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,860
no blocks.

663
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,683
The

664
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,840
he said he just walked in with a bottle
of wine and two fucking goat cheese,

665
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,271
milk,

666
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:32,550
cheese.

667
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,383
Everyone.

668
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,470
Good enzyme.

669
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,390
Get it at whole foods.

670
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:35,901
Fuck yes.

671
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,860
I got it from whole foods.

672
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,270
You son of a gun and a lot of money too.

673
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,350
They were like ha that much.

674
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:39,740
I was like,

675
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,341
that's right.

676
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,040
I have a successful podcast and
I'm friends with Eddie Bravo.

677
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,570
They said you have that
last powerful cheese anyway,

678
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,410
no gloves.

679
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,080
You're crazy.

680
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,160
Don't wear Shin Pads.

681
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:50,990
How come you,

682
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,190
how come you don't wear Shin pads
means you have to wear gloves.

683
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,083
That's stupid.

684
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,620
And why it impedes grappling.

685
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,960
Keeps you from getting chokes.

686
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,090
Do you want no gloves boxing to
know if they want to do that?

687
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,080
That's their nonsense.

688
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,380
So if it's combat,

689
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,703
combat,

690
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,470
silly,

691
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,310
there's no kicks

692
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,663
man.

693
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,250
Crazy.

694
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,430
I guarantee you,

695
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,720
I don't know what you smoked before this,

696
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,560
but you're crazy.

697
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,900
It's not a good way to do it.

698
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:19,900
I mean box,

699
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,720
they're doing wonderful sport.

700
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,220
It's wonderful sport to watch it.

701
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,270
But as far as like fighting,

702
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,590
it's not a good way to do it.

703
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,210
Like this is the only way to do it.

704
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,960
This is fighting.

705
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,231
Okay?

706
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,730
So if we represent real fighting,

707
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:30,960
and this is what this represents,

708
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,180
this represents what happened when
guys are led to do everything,

709
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,370
when they'll have to do knees,

710
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,981
like that step,

711
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,980
and he fell to just slander.

712
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,020
Take kick to the body.

713
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,710
Fellow just landed.

714
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,550
Oh see this is,

715
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,510
this is a real fight.

716
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,890
This is what you do when
you can do everything.

717
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,723
You do everything.

718
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,170
So I love boxing,

719
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,510
but it's rough.

720
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,600
It's only a sport.

721
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,913
This is fighting.

722
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,850
So if we've got,

723
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:48,930
if this is real fighting,

724
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,191
why,

725
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:50,370
why are we wearing gloves?

726
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:50,931
Why?

727
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,880
Why do we have wrist tapes
and all that nonsense on?

728
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,960
I got a question for you.

729
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:55,830
If somebody doesn't get cut.

730
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,131
No,

731
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,540
it's so you don't break
your hands as easy,

732
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,031
but you,

733
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:59,580
you shouldn't be doing
things that break your hands.

734
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,160
Why don't we put knows protectors on it
cause you want to head butt each other

735
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:02,994
with our faces,

736
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,631
you know,

737
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:06,780
oh my nose is getting broken too much
every time I headbutts well don't head,

738
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,090
but then you'd have to figure
out what it actually does work.

739
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Even artificial surface over your
hands that protects your hands.

740
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,100
As far as I'm curious.

741
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,930
As far as the Pearson a pure fight,

742
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,980
you're probably right as far as a sport
and growing it and getting kids to get

743
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:20,640
involved in,

744
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,290
you have to have some sort of structure.

745
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
I think one day they're
going to figure it out.

746
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,140
They're going to have no gloves.

747
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,370
We're going to look at
this and then go to say,

748
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:28,590
this is silly and guys got
hit with a lot more shots.

749
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,080
You're,

750
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,930
we're going to see more,

751
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,800
more shit.

752
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,480
You're gonna see probably bigger gloves
you see from the head gear or some shit.

753
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,320
All that would be worse there.

754
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,820
The science says just like football,

755
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,773
but just like football,

756
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,060
but bigger gloves is actually no better,

757
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,290
worse.

758
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,670
Correct.

759
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,170
That's why.

760
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,090
And so to the science doesn't support it.

761
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,970
And even headgear,

762
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,860
they're thinking now,

763
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,341
oh,

764
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,810
we just tagged them with a right hand.

765
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,021
Hey,

766
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,854
gear does nothing.

767
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,520
Headgear actually can can give you
a larger fulcrum point apparently,

768
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,590
and he can spin your head around more.

769
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,010
You know what I like about the
gloves is that they can fucking punk.

770
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,030
Full blast.

771
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,933
That's true.

772
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,980
And you don't cut your headline,

773
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,800
but how come he can't take from here?

774
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,560
Shannon's like you could
just hit them harder.

775
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,440
Why can't you tape up your insteps and
you shins like they doing Muay Thai

776
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:08,010
fights?

777
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,640
They should,

778
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
but then it's up.

779
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:10,501
Well,

780
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,540
granted you can say the
gloves or hindrance grappling,

781
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,810
but if you have shin pads on
you're going to move as well.

782
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,560
Dude,

783
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,660
you ever see like some of those really
good guys who do their Shin and ankle

784
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:19,861
ankles?

785
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,320
Like I was in Maurice's corner once,

786
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,580
Maury Smith when he had a
kickboxing fight and uh,

787
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:25,891
you know,

788
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,570
he's taping his ankles up and shit.

789
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,990
You know when those guys do that mean
they make that thing like almost like a

790
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:31,824
cast,

791
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,280
you know,

792
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
it's all protected in their,

793
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:34,560
they layered in there.

794
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,850
Some dude's more than others.

795
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,710
I mean some guys don't wear shit.

796
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,460
You see a lot,

797
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,700
even the top guys in glory and lion
fight and those kinds of things,

798
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,810
they don't wear shit.

799
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,650
I'm psyched that bell towards going
to have that kickboxing organization.

800
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,360
Beltour kickboxing.

801
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,930
Yeah.

802
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:50,810
That's awesome man.

803
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,730
Dude Felder would that beautiful
combination still get that,

804
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,790
that he's taking with the hands
and that the smoother with that,

805
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,770
that switch kick on the front leg.

806
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,010
Then the back leg kick his
[inaudible] so pretty man,

807
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,300
he's fun to watch.

808
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:04,601
Yeah,

809
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,434
it really is.

810
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,600
And fucked and decisions a bunch.

811
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:07,991
You know what,

812
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,350
man,

813
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,230
he's just fought real tough
guys and had real tough fights,

814
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,290
hard being the crazy clothes.

815
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,620
But when people get upset,

816
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,460
hey man,

817
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,900
that's just reality.

818
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,000
That's where you stand
and you got to get better.

819
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,751
Like he looks right here.

820
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:20,620
It looks better right here.

821
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,150
Right?

822
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,020
And why don't you say
[inaudible] go for a finish.

823
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,831
No Man.

824
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,740
He just needs to keep training and
fighting and being Paul Felder,

825
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,700
he's going to get better.

826
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,031
Oh,

827
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:28,750
look at that knee,

828
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,021
dude.

829
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,280
He's already getting better.

830
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:30,461
Like,

831
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,240
look at this fight.

832
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,490
He's performing
spectacularly in this fight.

833
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,630
He's smooth.

834
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,960
His timing looks excellent and
he's fighting a fucking animal.

835
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,220
It's for an older guy too though.

836
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,480
Fighting an animal though.

837
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,120
He's very good.

838
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,920
Bob Dale.

839
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,660
He's not.

840
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,081
It's not,

841
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,840
I guess it performances and slacked.

842
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,870
He might be older,

843
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,760
but he doesn't look bad.

844
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,160
Berkman hasn't looked
tired or weak in a fight.

845
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,001
Gentleman,

846
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,740
this is a 2010 boy Yak and joy.

847
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,240
This what's a boy?

848
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,570
Jaak Brian [inaudible].

849
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,161
It's a French.

850
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,560
It's a French Gooch who
just took his ass down.

851
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,430
Oh,

852
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,170
you're this gentleman.

853
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,453
Cheers my boys.

854
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,750
Cheers.

855
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,440
Thanks buddy.

856
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,861
We're back.

857
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,800
Put your headphones on right now.

858
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,371
It's a rule.

859
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,031
Ladies and gentleman.

860
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:11,050
We made rules for you guys.

861
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,220
One of them is we try not to chew into
the microphone cause I don't know that

862
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:15,941
it's so annoying.

863
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,980
Especially if you're at the
gym and you have headphones on.

864
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,823
You're mcing.

865
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,360
Yeah.

866
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,650
If you have headphones on,

867
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,460
it's even more rude because
it's like in someone's ear.

868
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,703
That's a nice wine.

869
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,050
So Bergman's cut.

870
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,220
Um,

871
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,450
he just landed to take down.

872
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,540
We were talking and I didn't get a
chance to see what the fuck happened.

873
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
But he's got a pretty nasty cut.

874
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:38,830
There's a lot of blood I can't see.

875
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,960
I think it's as nose man.

876
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,090
It might be as nose.

877
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,883
Oh,

878
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,750
nice knee to the body filter beneath the,

879
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,260
yeah,

880
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,320
it looks like the forehead.

881
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,030
Maybe more than one cut.

882
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,070
It looks like there's something
coming out of the nose.

883
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,720
The bridge of his nose and his forehead.

884
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,380
Does this kind of blood make the
sport more popular or less popular?

885
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,970
That doesn't have an effect on it.

886
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:58,350
Just like,

887
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,550
I don't think that sponsors
had an effect on it either.

888
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:01,960
I don't think anybody
looked at it and goes,

889
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,500
this shit is how come they don't
all have the same clothes on.

890
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,290
Nobody looked at it and said
it needed a uniform like that.

891
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
That's more of the UFC brass doing
it for a corporate to try and be like

892
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,674
everyone else,

893
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,903
but it didn't matter.

894
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,661
It doesn't matter.

895
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,470
I like bud and manner well in
pro wrestling and just tuck down.

896
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,470
Fell,

897
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,380
got paid on blood,

898
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,210
fell on his back and the other round.

899
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,640
Wow.

900
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,473
Fucks twice.

901
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,550
But it helps him up.

902
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,960
He is a fucking stud.

903
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,701
Yeah,

904
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:30,730
he is man crush.

905
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,461
Yeah.

906
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:31,731
You,

907
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:32,210
you do.

908
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,300
How does a beast man fucking animal?

909
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,590
Uh,

910
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,630
I think he's probably 36 37 amazing.

911
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,643
Let's find out.

912
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:39,641
Oh,

913
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:40,770
that's what it is as elbow.

914
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,070
Elbow bridge of the nose.

915
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,033
Yeah.

916
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,110
Oh my God.

917
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,680
It's beautiful.

918
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,130
Hey Vegas,

919
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,600
let's get more fucking came on the job.

920
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,920
That's know what that's going to win him.

921
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:51,150
The fight too because
they're replaying it.

922
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,490
Felder so durable.

923
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,730
When Barboza was kicking him in
the side and you could hear it,

924
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:57,500
it's like having a gun
shot and he just didn't,

925
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:58,880
he never stopped.

926
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,380
He just wondered how somebody can take
that kind of a beating in the Bible.

927
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,941
Let me tell you something.

928
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,721
He hit Barboza.

929
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:03,730
What's some good shots too?

930
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:04,731
It felt,

931
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,340
but Barboza is just so God damn fast,

932
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:07,970
too quick fluff,

933
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,050
and that was just one of his first
jaunt into the higher echelons of MMA.

934
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,550
And what's going to happen is Felder,

935
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,020
as you see in this fight,

936
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,710
I think you looked as good in this fight
is he's ever looked and he's going to

937
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,710
continue to get better.

938
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,540
He doesn't even those other fights he did,

939
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,040
but I think he looks even better now.

940
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,371
I mean,

941
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:22,730
he's,

942
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,481
he's a young kid,

943
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:28,460
he's improving and he's smart and he
works hard and he's got Donald with them.

944
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:29,000
I mean,

945
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,430
having Serone as a training partner,

946
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,840
you so goddamn gigantic
when you got a guy who was,

947
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:36,291
first of all,

948
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,081
is an animal,

949
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:37,790
a fucking fight.

950
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,623
Anybody,

951
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,250
he'll fight if they
call them up to fights,

952
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:40,721
deep paid me.

953
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:41,270
Oh check as well.

954
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,103
What I gotta do,

955
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,070
he'll fucking hot right a bull over
to steepen the whole camp over there.

956
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,760
He'll ride a bull

957
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:50,600
wild man.

958
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,650
He's a total legit while my men
super successful as an MMA fighter.

959
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:59,651
So for a guy like Felder to have a guy
like Donald and have them be a colleague

960
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,050
and the two guys be able to train with
each other like that and work with each

961
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:03,310
other.

962
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,620
God,

963
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,453
it's giant.

964
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,300
You know,

965
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,700
it's like those camps that have uh,

966
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,790
other great guys like look at core me,

967
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,600
Aa and nothing.

968
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,630
And then [inaudible] and then Habib,

969
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,970
Nigga met off and you look at these now,

970
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,500
your boy animals,

971
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,221
the kid,

972
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:22,070
the k one champions
there now trying for MMA.

973
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,293
What's his name?

974
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,350
Oh Rico Verhoeven.

975
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,963
Oh my God.

976
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,940
He's the best out of all of them.

977
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,240
Good luck with that.

978
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,690
Is your a miracle one with ground
and pound his first MMA fight.

979
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,590
But he is a fucking athlete.

980
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,490
You might be the best
bodyweight striking athlete in,

981
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:42,410
in combat sports.

982
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,400
He's a real big,

983
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,840
he's just like two 40
solid viking genetics.

984
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,450
How many Japan in this
Cup there before we do

985
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,363
let's go and piss them.

986
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,470
Stop sign you up for the UFC.

987
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,070
Mel Hollin guys don't get cal Bro.

988
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,440
Those Holland guys don't
mind taking steroids.

989
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,440
Is Yoda marrow?

990
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:07,431
No,

991
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:10,010
it's not a lot of raw milk.

992
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,260
Raw Milk and horsemeat right.

993
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:12,530
Yeah.

994
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,950
It's not a single person
is more of a fan of a,

995
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,960
of Dutch boy tie fighters in May.

996
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,400
Like Ramon Dekkers oh come on man.

997
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,050
Rob came in the best.

998
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Who's so that greatest combat sports
athletes of all time with Dutch kickboxers

999
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,840
there's so many animals.

1000
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,040
I guess Melvin men who've
got robbed for in Bellator.

1001
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,980
I didn't watch the fight,

1002
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:34,390
but dude,

1003
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,870
people were calling me up saying,

1004
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,490
do you see that shit were furious.

1005
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,821
I can't.

1006
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,470
Apparently even Scott Coker
was pissed and manhood.

1007
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,240
He's another one man.

1008
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,110
Jesus Christ.

1009
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:42,983
See terrifying,

1010
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,903
scary

1011
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,870
his and he's a regular training partner.

1012
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,940
Badr Hari's another fucking psychopath.

1013
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,380
Literally Psycho.

1014
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,850
Literally cycle and fuck with that.

1015
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,720
God Damn,

1016
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,360
he's good.

1017
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,010
He knocked out Dan over it.

1018
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,873
Yeah,

1019
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,930
like that horrible.

1020
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,320
Fred's matches the past.

1021
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,700
Those were the days.

1022
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,950
The best rematch with
him with Baader is uh,

1023
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,330
Stefan Leco cause he fucks
deaf on Lek on Stefan that go,

1024
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:09,510
knocked him out with a
spinning back kick to the body.

1025
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,310
So he came back and knocked,

1026
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:13,830
let go out in the next part of the
spinning back kick to the head.

1027
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,850
He got him with the same kick and he
was like almost like a turning sidekick.

1028
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,070
He was real skinny Badr Hari back then.

1029
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,120
He wasn't Jack Butter horror as he
got older and got involved in gangs.

1030
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,290
I mean now that I'm a little more educated
on the steroid use and legendary is

1031
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,670
when I go back and watch a lot
of these guys fight in MMA.

1032
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,541
I go,

1033
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:33,721
Oh,

1034
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:34,200
you're,

1035
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
you're an absolute giant and there's zero
reason you should be that bulky and no

1036
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,820
and no body fat and somehow
or another can go on forever.

1037
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,990
How interesting.

1038
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,801
Maury Smith,

1039
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,940
Fuck Kevin Randleman.

1040
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,270
Uh,

1041
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,991
rest in peace.

1042
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:46,890
Who was a great guy?

1043
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,701
Kevin Randleman.

1044
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:48,311
Really truly,

1045
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:52,740
it was a great guy and he was one of
those guys that was probably like one of

1046
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:57,120
the freakiest freak athletes
that's ever fought in combat sport.

1047
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,070
The best athlete to
ever compete in the UFC.

1048
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:00,820
He looked,

1049
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,150
he looked like a better
looking Mike Tyson,

1050
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:06,480
like a prettier Mike Tyson
when he was in his prime

1051
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,110
plucked eyebrows.

1052
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,943
I promise you

1053
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,430
it's not and dyed hair and beautiful died.

1054
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,000
It's a beautiful and guy with blonde hair.

1055
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:21,450
Dude.

1056
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,320
He's a beautiful man.

1057
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,943
Stolid

1058
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,430
um,

1059
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,600
where was I going with that?

1060
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,171
That oh,

1061
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:28,661
he's fine.

1062
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:30,500
He thought Marie Smith and a,

1063
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,271
after the fight more,

1064
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:31,561
he said,

1065
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,394
okay,

1066
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,170
freak of science are freaking nature.

1067
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,340
What is it that was what more,

1068
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:36,931
he's calling me out.

1069
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:37,471
That's great.

1070
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:38,304
What do you think?

1071
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:38,911
And I said,

1072
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:39,181
man,

1073
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,470
there's really no way to tell.

1074
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,990
There's Maurice and a roundabout.

1075
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,260
It's tough to tell.

1076
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,950
He said they got got,

1077
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,783
never got tired.

1078
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,660
He said he never got tired.

1079
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,471
That's a different,

1080
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,304
well,

1081
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,791
no,

1082
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,451
cause he was in,

1083
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:49,740
in college at Ohio state.

1084
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,640
He was a freak to it.

1085
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:50,881
There's,

1086
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:52,170
there's legendary stories,

1087
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,131
so it's easy,

1088
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:53,431
you know,

1089
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,620
you could say how's he
tried them in his life?

1090
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,191
Maybe,

1091
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:57,720
but that's not why he's such a freak.

1092
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,820
I don't like when people
discredit guys like that.

1093
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,770
He's a fucking man.

1094
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,570
When you look at how muscular he
is now that you know a little bit.

1095
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,890
He definitely had to know.

1096
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,060
You got to see me call caught like high.

1097
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:06,601
There's pictures.

1098
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,040
I mean the High School Jack,

1099
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,060
like he's just,

1100
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,680
he's a free Brock Lesnar was that way.

1101
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,970
He was in high school.

1102
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:13,350
He looked like a like a freak.

1103
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,880
There's this definitely freaks.

1104
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:15,240
Yeah.

1105
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,730
I'm not saying that there's
not a chance they dabble.

1106
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,080
Neil bags again,

1107
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:20,010
supplements let's,

1108
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:23,400
this thing is a guy like random and you
have to have two things to look like

1109
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,390
that you couldn't take
a guy like a account.

1110
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,600
I was going to say,

1111
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,520
I was going to say somewhere else.

1112
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,121
How do you even,

1113
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:33,570
not that I'm not even talking about
like just shit like just shoot it.

1114
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,643
Let's be honest.

1115
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,450
We take you.

1116
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:35,760
Yeah.

1117
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
Okay.

1118
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,260
You would,

1119
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,540
there's no way you're
going to look like that.

1120
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:40,950
It's just no supplements on,

1121
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,900
there's no,

1122
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,370
he's out of the frame
and this frame is insane.

1123
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,020
Look at the Moscow
there is in high school.

1124
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,400
He's just stuck to college.

1125
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,971
Is that college,

1126
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,480
but look at him.

1127
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,160
This is ridiculous.

1128
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:52,690
He Moscow stud wrestler.

1129
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,040
I mean just in a really powerful
athlete and there's guys that are just,

1130
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,210
they're just more
mesomorphic another balance.

1131
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:00,923
The steroids.

1132
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,220
I don't think it was not,

1133
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,971
you know,

1134
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:04,690
he was not fuck you.

1135
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,990
He was when he was like 14
when he was 16 years old.

1136
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,003
Gentlemen,

1137
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,671
hold on.

1138
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:14,671
When he was 16 years old and looking
the same and knocking dudes into a coma,

1139
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,910
like a grown man,

1140
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,640
Mike Tyson was a freak of nature.

1141
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,361
I'm with you.

1142
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,240
I'm not discounting that her
is like band or Holyfield.

1143
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:22,541
It's like,

1144
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:22,961
all right,

1145
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:24,070
what are we doing here fellas?

1146
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,590
Like Evander Holyfield could we
got first and Mister Olympia?

1147
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:26,771
Oh,

1148
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:27,131
of course.

1149
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,590
And Tyson was obviously on some shit too.

1150
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,940
Well why do you think he was on some shit?

1151
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,260
He's willing to do everything else.

1152
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:34,270
He had no problem with any other drug.

1153
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,633
You know what I mean?

1154
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,310
Pictures and not take steroids too far.

1155
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,630
Crack.

1156
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,331
Oh No,

1157
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:40,481
no,

1158
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:40,631
no.

1159
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,040
I wouldn't think about for health.

1160
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,970
I would think about it.

1161
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,003
As a matter of fact,

1162
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,060
there's apparently very little evidence
that with all of the steroid use that

1163
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:53,110
people do all the crazy bodybuilders
like not that many are dying.

1164
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,340
That's true.

1165
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,173
There's

1166
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,440
fester or watch.

1167
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,890
Wwe is dealing with painkillers,

1168
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,410
you know that and I know that
pain killers and steroids,

1169
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,800
steroid use shore but it's the
painkillers that are killing everybody.

1170
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:06,371
My boy Chris,

1171
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:06,971
Ben was like,

1172
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:07,510
Huh?

1173
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,230
He was on some shit.

1174
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,120
That guy also had some serious CTE.

1175
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:13,870
Probably good Jay and all those dudes
are still blaming each other and hitting

1176
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,100
each other with chairs and shit.

1177
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,410
What about all the time bodybuilders
like if they're still alive,

1178
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,661
they are,

1179
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:17,990
aren't they?

1180
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,980
Most of them are still alive and there's
some of them were really abusive.

1181
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,870
Like definitely there are
endocrine system is shutdown.

1182
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,640
Definitely they have to take hormone
replacement therapy but that's available.

1183
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,503
You can do that.

1184
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,580
What you look at them though and you're,

1185
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:35,581
you're not looking at like a old boxers
or old like you go to like Muhammad

1186
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,700
Ali's era,

1187
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,590
which is the same I guess maybe,

1188
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:38,861
you know,

1189
00:31:38,861 --> 00:31:42,280
he predated Swartz and by a
little bit like 10 years or so,

1190
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,473
maybe more,

1191
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:43,960
more,

1192
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,680
more when he,

1193
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,840
when sourcing our first
burst onto the scene.

1194
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,011
So if you,

1195
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:50,620
if you look at Sally and you look at,

1196
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,460
um,

1197
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,690
obviously he's in a bad,

1198
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,381
bad place,

1199
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:53,830
right?

1200
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,340
But you look at Joe Frazier before he
died and you look at a lot of those older

1201
00:31:57,341 --> 00:31:58,420
boxes from that era,

1202
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,320
they're fucked.

1203
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,603
They're fucked.

1204
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,860
But the older bodybuilders,

1205
00:32:02,861 --> 00:32:04,500
there's a lot of them that
are still a restaurant.

1206
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,450
Arnold doing physics,

1207
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,100
he's fine.

1208
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,931
He's a chill in the,

1209
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,230
had had a panel at its heart,

1210
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,180
heart surgery,

1211
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,820
but he's fine.

1212
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,440
And that was that valve issue.

1213
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:11,890
But yeah,

1214
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,170
they said that was
something that he was hard.

1215
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,970
They said that was something
that he was born with,

1216
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,390
right.

1217
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,950
That it was a a condition.

1218
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,641
Yeah.

1219
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:18,851
There's,

1220
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:22,630
if there's no evidence that steroids into
special is terrible for you is like we

1221
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:22,901
thought,

1222
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:23,081
right.

1223
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,420
Because it started with is
Zeto remember that he was like,

1224
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,440
oh I have this cancer,

1225
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,330
this brain tumor cause I took steroids.

1226
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,870
But there's the scientific research to
back problem is some people just get

1227
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:32,651
brain tumors.

1228
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,830
So you got to wonder like how come
everybody's not getting a brain tumor?

1229
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:36,100
Right.

1230
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,260
Are we sure that the
brain tumors from that?

1231
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:39,080
Like it's theirs.

1232
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
There's very

1233
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,120
individual cases apparently it's really
hard to tell what's the ultimate cause

1234
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,170
cause you're dealing with all sorts of
environmental and also look at broad

1235
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:50,810
trends like they were
talking about cell phone use,

1236
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,730
cell phone use has gone up a great deal.

1237
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,940
But since 1992 from the
last statistic I just read,

1238
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:56,780
which was yesterday,

1239
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,550
the Gliomas,

1240
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,413
brain tumors,

1241
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,120
the really dangerous one kind have not,

1242
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:06,150
they've stayed pretty steady since 1992
so you'd think with all that solution.

1243
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:07,483
Yeah.

1244
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,213
Yeah.

1245
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,300
No,

1246
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,540
that is interesting Brian.

1247
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,680
That's interesting.

1248
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,220
Yeah.

1249
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,320
So you would see a huge market
rise over the last 20 years,

1250
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,470
the massive course,

1251
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,550
but you just haven't,

1252
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,000
but the 26 years you haven't,

1253
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:21,920
it stayed very steady.

1254
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,880
Maybe it takes like,

1255
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,990
maybe it's like cigarettes for awhile
they said cigarettes don't cause lung

1256
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:27,490
cancer.

1257
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:27,950
Yeah,

1258
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,030
50 years to figure it out,

1259
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:30,890
but it's not ionizing radiation.

1260
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,300
It's radio frequency.

1261
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,300
It's not ionizing ionizing like
which would be x rays and gamma rays,

1262
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:38,721
that kind of stuff.

1263
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:39,531
That's ionizing,

1264
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,800
so what that does actually is it changes.

1265
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,611
It knocks Adams,

1266
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:46,280
I guess off the DNA or
if screws with your DNA,

1267
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,280
which can then lead to cancer itself,

1268
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,490
but it doesn't mean that
it necessarily will,

1269
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,990
but what happens is like if one
guy dies of whatever cancer,

1270
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:58,730
he's took steroids and he accused that,

1271
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,271
then we liked,

1272
00:33:59,271 --> 00:33:59,391
oh,

1273
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,320
that's what steroids do.

1274
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,580
If there's one example,

1275
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,301
the media,

1276
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:02,900
Russia's,

1277
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,920
here's an important point.

1278
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:08,921
Crispin Rob was just a bad dude with
some CTE and for a lot of things wrong,

1279
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:09,980
he was on drugs,

1280
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,460
all kinds of painkillers.

1281
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,220
Who's on steroids to steer those things?

1282
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:13,641
Also,

1283
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:14,840
when you're taking painkillers,

1284
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:15,680
certain painkillers,

1285
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,930
they react really badly to other
drugs and of course alcohol.

1286
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,170
If alcohol is involved,

1287
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,004
I don't know if it was,

1288
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,690
but then they react even worse.

1289
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,480
It could've been just a shitty person too.

1290
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,940
You don't like maybe he's a bad dude and
they got all high and did some fucked

1291
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,330
up stuff and he could've,

1292
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:30,770
you know,

1293
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,431
gone crazy.

1294
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,264
Who the fuck knows?

1295
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,610
But uh,

1296
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,900
the Lyles adal an important
point is that lie allows,

1297
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:40,520
ido was taking human growth hormone
hormone and a time where they were getting

1298
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,750
it from cadavers,

1299
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,851
they would get there.

1300
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:46,190
We're getting human growth hormone in
a different way than they gather it.

1301
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:46,640
Now.

1302
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,110
The way they gather it now as they produce
it with bacteria that they use yams

1303
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:51,620
and stuff.

1304
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,250
That's for testosterone can,

1305
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,060
it's also for estrogen.

1306
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,570
There's,

1307
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,640
there's steroid,

1308
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,130
uh,

1309
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,780
fucking soaked yams,

1310
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:00,980
it sounds so crazy,

1311
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,690
but they get testosterone and they can
get a female birth control out of why

1312
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,240
Mexican wild yams

1313
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,800
yams are super good.

1314
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,473
Super good.

1315
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,140
So like everybody that is on testosterone
replacement therapy is getting it from

1316
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:19,724
yams.

1317
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,640
Yeah.

1318
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,730
It's a problem with it now according
to what Novitsky is that they're,

1319
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,320
they seem to have figured out
a way to get it from animals.

1320
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,460
So you're going to get testosterone from
animals and it will be because the Carl

1321
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:32,171
identical.

1322
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:32,300
Yeah.

1323
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
Cause the carbon and they
figure it out cause there's a,

1324
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,620
it has a different carbon
ratio or something.

1325
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,240
Carbon Isotope ratio keys on it.

1326
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,010
I'm sure he still figured that shit.

1327
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,570
He's a fucking altimeter
when it comes to that shit.

1328
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,423
Snitch.

1329
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,580
Golden snatch,

1330
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,490
the whole golden showers.

1331
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:48,900
You know,

1332
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,260
ultimately we are finding out
what really does and does not,

1333
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,070
what's really real legit and
we didn't know as well works.

1334
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,780
You mean how as far as who's on what?

1335
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,140
Oh yeah.

1336
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,250
Cause everybody was lying.

1337
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,743
But look,

1338
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,650
but look it over,

1339
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:02,341
reign over.

1340
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:02,671
He was like,

1341
00:36:02,671 --> 00:36:02,791
yeah,

1342
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:03,481
I'm not on Shit.

1343
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:03,780
Look at me.

1344
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,860
I'm fighting for a world title.

1345
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,071
Well,

1346
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:05,850
how about uh,

1347
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,480
my man,

1348
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,470
Tim means the dirty bird got busted
for taking some creek fucking dirty for

1349
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:12,810
crazy creative and they
tested his creatine and it's,

1350
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,050
it's,

1351
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,290
it pisses hi stew found some
shit right off the shelf.

1352
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,930
They tested it and it pisses hot.

1353
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,421
I'm taking.

1354
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:19,050
Craig goes,

1355
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,261
well,

1356
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:19,370
it,

1357
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:19,860
listen,

1358
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,820
you can take it,

1359
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:23,190
but you got to realize that
most of the stuff you're buying,

1360
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,550
if you're buying things from
like GNC muscle building,

1361
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,300
they there,

1362
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,440
they put steroids in them.

1363
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,040
Wow.

1364
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,730
There's a list on the EU
side of it is massive.

1365
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,880
There's a list and Usada all
these testosterone boosters.

1366
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,830
How many of you make you
piss hot in the Olympics?

1367
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,680
It's like thousands of cat dude.

1368
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,793
Like we,

1369
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,260
Jamie and I went over to the other day.

1370
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,330
We tried to just get through the letter
a a is hundreds and hundreds of stories

1371
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,930
and a Bowlick animal.

1372
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,700
I'll take any steps to
whey protein basically.

1373
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:58,320
And this is what they do apparently
a quarter to a friends that are,

1374
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,980
uh,

1375
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,470
that are in that world than
in the supplement world.

1376
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,170
What they're allowed to do is
they can take something like,

1377
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,350
it's why when you buy a gas station,

1378
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,190
boner pills,

1379
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,290
they have viagara and steroids in them.

1380
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
Who's buying the really Brian Red Van?

1381
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,140
He buys them all the time.

1382
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,730
Hey man,

1383
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,340
he lives off on,

1384
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,120
I don't have friends.

1385
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,931
He doesn't even test them.

1386
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:16,301
Just fuck.

1387
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:19,420
It takes two or three throws
with that goes towards rock hard.

1388
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,370
So they actually know.

1389
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,041
So it,

1390
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:21,470
it's,

1391
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,620
it's a steroid to,

1392
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,071
there's like,

1393
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,690
it makes you look super horny.

1394
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,250
It makes you aggressive.

1395
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,630
Yeah.

1396
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,240
They're like,

1397
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,990
but what happens is they get caught and
then they take it off the market and

1398
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,340
then they come right back with a new name.

1399
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,440
Now it's rhino pay church.

1400
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:34,980
They don't,

1401
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,371
they change.

1402
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,010
I can molecule if it is on the bay.

1403
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,400
This change of different names.

1404
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,600
So she had some friends,

1405
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,950
it's not banned list.

1406
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,420
They just lie about what's in it.

1407
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,620
They don't go that far,

1408
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,970
but it's like legit.

1409
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,580
Nobody's paying attention
by fake marijuana.

1410
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,510
That's what you're talking about it.

1411
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,260
That's what they do.

1412
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,570
No,

1413
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:49,741
no,

1414
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:49,821
no,

1415
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:49,951
no.

1416
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,420
He's talking about bass salts.

1417
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,830
Bath salts is what they do when
they take Mtma or anything.

1418
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,040
It's usually crystal meth and they
fuck people jump out of windows.

1419
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,160
Is it fake marijuana as a plant though?

1420
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,630
How they want to kids come by.

1421
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:05,330
Wait,

1422
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,100
that's sold it.

1423
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,530
What?

1424
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,460
So how do they do that?

1425
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,323
What do they do?

1426
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,270
They would distribute it and
like the people that would,

1427
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:11,451
yeah,

1428
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:11,801
the story.

1429
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:12,470
They're wanting it.

1430
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,980
They would get hit up by the FDA
or wherever it was against it,

1431
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:15,531
the DEA,

1432
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:18,200
and they would tell him what
specific chemicals were illegal.

1433
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,100
They would then go back to the lab is
to take that specific molecule out.

1434
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:23,750
Change the number like from CLL.

1435
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,110
Right,

1436
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,700
but how can they do that with weed?

1437
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,241
They did those.

1438
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:26,870
Andrew Stevens.

1439
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,441
How we'd,

1440
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,370
it's that spice.

1441
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:32,240
They're spraying fake THC on it
so people think they're getting

1442
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,360
oh yeah,

1443
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:34,960
yeah,

1444
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,400
yeah.

1445
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,740
Okay.

1446
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,040
Okay,

1447
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,770
so [inaudible] is like a legal,

1448
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:39,604
anybody could buy it.

1449
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,903
Whoa.

1450
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:41,681
Havana is,

1451
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:41,800
hey,

1452
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,400
we tried it.

1453
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,590
You were trying to get the fuck would I,

1454
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,410
would anyone try?

1455
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,911
That's what they do.

1456
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,540
And then they change it 15 and busted
out and then they go back and the same

1457
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,030
company makes it and they
twisted a little bit past salts,

1458
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,590
bath salts.

1459
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,030
If you,

1460
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,821
if you've seen videos,

1461
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:55,900
kids freaking on that.

1462
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,930
What the funny thing about people still
doing that he's these pills from the gas

1463
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:02,164
stations is there,

1464
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,130
it's not like a similar stuff to Viagara.

1465
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:08,570
It's the fucking throw
Viagara in it and steroids.

1466
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,610
You're taking that Barry bonds.

1467
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,031
Yeah.

1468
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:12,550
You take it all kinds of shit
and fuck girls hit baseballs.

1469
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,384
You know what I'm saying?

1470
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,970
I can't believe you have a
friend who takes that shit.

1471
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,400
I always looked at it like

1472
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,720
he's out of his mind.

1473
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,210
Does he buy fuck those lot lizards.

1474
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,330
We never met Red Ben Brandon,

1475
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,200
he never met red man.

1476
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,350
Met him very briefly at our,

1477
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,220
at our first live show
at the comedy store.

1478
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,054
Cause uh,

1479
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,250
Rogan and uh,

1480
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,131
him came through there.

1481
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:41,320
But I often we talk to
each other on Twitter,

1482
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,100
but I've never,

1483
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,750
I've never had a
conversation with them shit,

1484
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,280
which is weird cause he's just friends.

1485
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:46,640
So you think we'd link up but no,

1486
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,680
he's ridiculous.

1487
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,090
He'll take those things all day.

1488
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,600
Some people don't care really
is carbon nichrome systems.

1489
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,070
Mushrooms just shatter.

1490
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:54,880
It doesn't give a fuck.

1491
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,601
Smokes a lot.

1492
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,190
Smoked cigarettes and drinks.

1493
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,090
That's like my friend was like,

1494
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,050
I want more energy.

1495
00:39:59,051 --> 00:39:59,320
Can,

1496
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,153
can you help me?

1497
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,210
I go,

1498
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:01,560
I go,

1499
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:01,910
I go,

1500
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,920

1501
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,903
And he goes,

1502
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,211
yeah,

1503
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:04,820
I go,

1504
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,720
you gotta Stop Smoking before
I start talking to you.

1505
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:07,450
He goes,

1506
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,283
no,

1507
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,790
I can't do that.

1508
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:10,740
I was like,

1509
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,400
then I'm not going to have
a conversation with you.

1510
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,021
You can't like,

1511
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:14,820
what the fuck do you know
that you're talking to?

1512
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,080
And you said you've got to stop smoking.

1513
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:16,560
The famous,

1514
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,191
he's a famous,

1515
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:18,070
he's a famous director,

1516
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
no doors.

1517
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,230
Okay,

1518
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,150
but he's a famous director and I was like,

1519
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:22,381
yes,

1520
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:22,690
I smoke.

1521
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:22,961
He goes,

1522
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:23,551
no.

1523
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:23,721
I go,

1524
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,560
can I go?

1525
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,421
You're going to die.

1526
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,020
He goes,

1527
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,540
why the Hell I've never,

1528
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,610
I've never fucked with by
ag or anything like that.

1529
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,420
Good for you.

1530
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,590
You have no,

1531
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,790
of course.

1532
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,240
Really.

1533
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,080
I took it once.

1534
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,830
It gave me a headache.

1535
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,663
I'm on it right now.

1536
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,610
I knew this podcast is going to be strong.

1537
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,700
Well,

1538
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,350
11 that right,

1539
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,170
and see that rhino 12 the
graphic is so intense.

1540
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,003
I'm not taking that.

1541
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
I don't want to blow.

1542
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,940
It makes sense that what
kind of pussy picks up rhino?

1543
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:54,783
Seven.

1544
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,301
Damn,

1545
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:58,450
I wasn't gonna write to Rhino 12
I'm taking that rhino 11 I'm like,

1546
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,551
well,

1547
00:40:58,551 --> 00:40:59,384
we hit a party.

1548
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,771
See.

1549
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:00,281
I'm like,

1550
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:00,580
you know what,

1551
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,040
Rhino seven leaks were
bitches rhino 11 I'll take.

1552
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,080
It's interesting that just
having might be for girls,

1553
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,313
it's almost

1554
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,510
Jesus Christ means he's
getting ready to party,

1555
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,691
time,

1556
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:15,131
size,

1557
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:15,641
and stem.

1558
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,421
And he's not kidding,

1559
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:16,601
man.

1560
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,010
He really does take those headache,

1561
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,430
dude.

1562
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,840
There's some dude did a review of those
things online and he said they fucking

1563
00:41:22,841 --> 00:41:23,231
work.

1564
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:23,981
Not only did work,

1565
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,360
it's like they're crazy good.

1566
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,100
Maybe he's getting
sponsored by or something.

1567
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,350
And every day,

1568
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,230
I'm only kidding when I say every day,

1569
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,880
but he takes it a lot,

1570
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,991
Brian parties.

1571
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:36,720
But then once you don't,

1572
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,630
w when you stop taking
as your Dick not work,

1573
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:38,811
you know,

1574
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,310
like steroids to talk to him.

1575
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:41,480
Hey,

1576
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm going to say test

1577
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,310
Lorens Larkin and Jorge Mas Brendan up.

1578
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,250
I'm not gonna say it that I've ever done.

1579
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,070
Viagara I'm not going to say definitely,

1580
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,500
but I'm saying if you ever do Mtma,

1581
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,030
you're going to need that shit.

1582
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,893
Trust me.

1583
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,310
That's all I'm going to say.

1584
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,150
Well listen,

1585
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:00,441
listen,

1586
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:00,670
let me,

1587
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,060
let me know.

1588
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,950
Let's watch this fight and
because this is a big one,

1589
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,770
Lorens Larkin and Jorge Mosfet all
this is how they're on the side.

1590
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,230
Super Skillful fight just to get to this.

1591
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,093
Okay.

1592
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,360
That's a sleeper fight.

1593
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,613
Great fight.

1594
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,030
Larkin and underdog.

1595
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,893
A little surprised.

1596
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,540
Well Larkin had that fight with tune off.

1597
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,540
It could have gone either way.

1598
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:20,991
Yes,

1599
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,420
that was super close.

1600
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,210
Fight Larkin is a slick stand up fighter.

1601
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,931
Real slick,

1602
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:30,140
but so is mosfet all remember Mossville
dolls like kind of the first Kimbo

1603
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:30,711
slice.

1604
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:33,590
He was a backyard fighter in Miami.

1605
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,453
Well he was,

1606
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:34,761
yeah.

1607
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,410
He was in the same group as Kimbo.

1608
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:36,620
Yep.

1609
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:36,960
Right.

1610
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,110
Yeah.

1611
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,770
I mean he was in some
of those early videos.

1612
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:38,880
Yeah,

1613
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,380
man,

1614
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,460
super game.

1615
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,390
Phenomenal Ref.

1616
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,560
He's good at everything.

1617
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:42,711
Yeah,

1618
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:43,450
he's good at everything.

1619
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,390
He's a very smart guy.

1620
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,741
Very,

1621
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:46,574
very sneaky.

1622
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,511
Remember when he fought,

1623
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,770
he fought eve Edwards and
I think it was Bo dog.

1624
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,613
He had kicked him.

1625
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,321
Dude,

1626
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,071
if he's on,

1627
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:52,904
he just,

1628
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,220
I don't see how guys beat the,

1629
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,980
that was what you did that everything is
back when ease was considered to be one

1630
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:59,030
of the best in the world.

1631
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,740
Everybody thought ease was,

1632
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,000
I mean is after ease.

1633
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:05,780
I think it was after he had beat and Josh
Thompson so talented for a long time.

1634
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,643
Oh yeah man.

1635
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:06,801
Well,

1636
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:07,634
you know,

1637
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,530
father time catches up to everybody.

1638
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:10,821
Just,

1639
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,420
just people that can do things that
your body just can't do anymore after.

1640
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,010
Not just father time,

1641
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,840
but I think more importantly,

1642
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,973
beatings.

1643
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,990
Yeah.

1644
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,100
Yeah.

1645
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,871
I can't take the beans.

1646
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,040
I think it's more the reaction.

1647
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,960
Like last,

1648
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,930
like last night I was working at Shane
Mosley fight and asked him afterwards,

1649
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:27,410
I said,

1650
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:27,621
you know,

1651
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:28,401
he fought a young guy,

1652
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,234
he's 25.

1653
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:29,721
I said,

1654
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,411
what was the difference?

1655
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:30,621
He goes,

1656
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:32,210
my reaction times just not there.

1657
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,290
He's way younger,

1658
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,630
faster like I have to do.

1659
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,211
Yeah.

1660
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:35,991
He lost his decision.

1661
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:36,171
He goes,

1662
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,100
I wanted to throw something.

1663
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,030
It's just not there anymore.

1664
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,730
He was like this the first
time I've noticed it to go.

1665
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,910
And how long has it been
since his last fight?

1666
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,650
Uh,

1667
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:46,880
he felt like six months ago.

1668
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,743
Seven months ago.

1669
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,290
But he fought,

1670
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:48,570
you know,

1671
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,670
not the same caliber guys.

1672
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:50,830
He wasn't fighting getting guys.

1673
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:50,991
Right.

1674
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:51,980
It's like an older guys.

1675
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:57,130
And I fought a young hungry line and Shane
was always so quick and he was young.

1676
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,190
So quick man.

1677
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,220
But you gotta think Shane's also been
punishing his body through camps 44 yeah,

1678
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,780
for all these years level for 20 years,

1679
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,380
you know,

1680
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,430
for more than 20 units.

1681
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,390
You know,

1682
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,670
he was a stellar,

1683
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,270
a nice switch kick to the body.

1684
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,410
He was a stellar,

1685
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,930
a amateur fighter as well
as the amateur fighters.

1686
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,060
So you've got to think about all those
years of boxing and all the damage that

1687
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:21,581
does to you.

1688
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:23,990
After awhile your body just does
not want to perform anymore.

1689
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,850
He still almost beat that young cat,

1690
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,370
Larkin fight out of,

1691
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:28,910
what's it?

1692
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,691
He's good man.

1693
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:31,100
He's stands on any Jujitsu.

1694
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,340
I'm millennium MMA,

1695
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,390
but he is he a stand up fighter
first and grappler second?

1696
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,760
He's,

1697
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,151
yeah,

1698
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:36,600
he's,

1699
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:36,991
well he's,

1700
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,550
he's got skills in the ground for sure.

1701
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,300
But yeah,

1702
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,961
on his feet.

1703
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:40,840
He's super sweet.

1704
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,740
He looks for his take
down a fence is amazing.

1705
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,530
He came to rain one
time and just wrestling.

1706
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:46,951
Fuck.

1707
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:47,340
We can,

1708
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,300
people couldn't get them down.

1709
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,070
Tell him he owes Cummings myself.

1710
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,330
Why?

1711
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,030
He's a monster.

1712
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,600
What?

1713
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:51,751
Well,

1714
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,410
he fought it and high level class,

1715
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,510
he beat Robbie Lawler and Strikeforce
at one 85 people forget about that.

1716
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,200
The Larkin is legit and
at this weight class now?

1717
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:01,511
Yeah,

1718
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:03,600
at one 70 he's really,

1719
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:04,434
really good.

1720
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,770
But it just shows you how deep the
pool is because Tumen off beat him.

1721
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,431
Although I,

1722
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:09,240
like I said,

1723
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,073
it could've gone either way.

1724
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,440
He,

1725
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,440
he throws this really creepy fucking
spinning heel kick to the legs,

1726
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,710
a lot nasty.

1727
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,920
He's really good at it and he does
it on the inside and the outside.

1728
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:22,320
But he did it on the outside a couple
of times against [inaudible] and I was

1729
00:45:22,321 --> 00:45:22,501
like,

1730
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,334
Whoa,

1731
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,151
I want to see him.

1732
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,190
That Jude last fight,

1733
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:26,491
he fought.

1734
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,151
He was in the guy in the,

1735
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:27,881
and the calf.

1736
00:45:27,881 --> 00:45:29,280
It was just crazy.

1737
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,430
I was just thinking about like,

1738
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,860
these guys are so talented.

1739
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:31,981
Right?

1740
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:32,761
And you look at welterweight,

1741
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:33,420
you look at middleweight,

1742
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,201
it's like Bisbee.

1743
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,090
It took him 10 years to get a title shot.

1744
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,953
10 fucking,

1745
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,190
that's how tough it is,

1746
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:38,400
man.

1747
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:38,911
I know.

1748
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:43,500
And meanwhile if you all
were marrow didn't get popped
and if was ray didn't get

1749
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:43,950
hurt,

1750
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,300
he wouldn't have even gotten that call.

1751
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,470
Never got a title shot.

1752
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,210
It's your son.

1753
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,401
Nice.

1754
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:47,510
Not,

1755
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,780
not necessarily true.

1756
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:51,060
He could have beaten one more
guy and got a title shot,

1757
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,170
but he wasn't really in line.

1758
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,370
He's in a tough spot,

1759
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:54,041
man with it,

1760
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:54,420
with with,

1761
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,051
with this career.

1762
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,250
Physically his eye.

1763
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,950
He's tough with Joel.

1764
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,800
Go to Jackson's.

1765
00:45:58,801 --> 00:45:59,634
Is he training there?

1766
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,360
Somebody said,

1767
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,020
I don't know.

1768
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,490
I had heard something like that too.

1769
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:03,810
I don't know what they're
going to do with him.

1770
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,840
He was another one.

1771
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,180
He is another one that he had a
supplement that he took an off the counter

1772
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:11,490
supplement over the counter
supplement that was tainted.

1773
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:11,940
Yup.

1774
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,960
There's a lot of them
that are changing shit.

1775
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,610
Yeah,

1776
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,443
but it works.

1777
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:17,603
It works.

1778
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,500
There's other reasons why
this stuff has shifted.

1779
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:19,780
It is,

1780
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,010
there's reason you can't take it.

1781
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,750
Your,

1782
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,460
your friend tells me it works
and you're going to work.

1783
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:24,620
You're going to,

1784
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
you're going to next wines.

1785
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,870
Yeah,

1786
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,710
but he just makes it,

1787
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,050
I was glad to see him get a title shot,

1788
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:31,651
but it sucks.

1789
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:32,161
It's that way.

1790
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:34,410
But now I think of it's probably
the only way it was going to happen.

1791
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:34,801
Yeah,

1792
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:35,634
most likely.

1793
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,880
Mosbey dog just slandered.

1794
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:37,470
Good right hand.

1795
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,940
Well you mean it could have happened.

1796
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:39,481
He couldn't look.

1797
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:40,470
He just beat Anderson.

1798
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,150
You know they're both older though.

1799
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:44,720
July Keon some joc gray Hillel,

1800
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,530
Weidman,

1801
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,940
the eye,

1802
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,430
it's going to be tough night for him.

1803
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,633
Could be,

1804
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,501
you know,

1805
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:51,930
I mean the odds are it
won't be in my favor.

1806
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,590
The odds would be in that favorite,

1807
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:56,430
but not 100%.

1808
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,480
You know what I mean?

1809
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,280
Like this is a thing
about guys that are tough,

1810
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:02,450
like Bisping as they figure
out a way to get shit done.

1811
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,150
So he just poked his shit out of
his eyes and it looks all my God,

1812
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:06,700
Ahh,

1813
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,410
muscle can't fight after
coming back from that.

1814
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,641
Oh my God,

1815
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:12,870
I fucking hate Ipos.

1816
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,800
He knew right away too.

1817
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,131
He said,

1818
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,350
fuck nothing.

1819
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:17,850
His finger probably went into his brain.

1820
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,301
Hey Joe.

1821
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:18,460
Hey,

1822
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,320
here's a,

1823
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,020
an idea for you as off with title shots.

1824
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:22,854
You know how they say,

1825
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,161
well,

1826
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:24,840
anyone that top five needs to stay ready.

1827
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,840
If there's a title shot
and I want to see this,

1828
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,023
hello.

1829
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,640
Oh my God.

1830
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,050
To show you how fucking
effective I poke isn't,

1831
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,130
I don't think it was question that Brian,

1832
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:46,131
you get in a street fight technique
craze that chroma growth then shit.

1833
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,023
Right man,

1834
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,940
I fucking hate the openly thing guys.

1835
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,421
It looks fine.

1836
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:50,570
No,

1837
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:50,781
no,

1838
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:50,990
no.

1839
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:51,823
He's hurting.

1840
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,580
He's good.

1841
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,420
I know I'm planting my fingers
in a dry rice from now.

1842
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:57,831
Listen,

1843
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:58,310
man,

1844
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,490
do you think about when
you get poked in the eye,

1845
00:47:59,491 --> 00:48:01,040
how long it takes before you're ready?

1846
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,000
He's ready to go.

1847
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,121
Yeah,

1848
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:03,040
because they're making them,

1849
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:03,720
no,

1850
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,190
he's also got a bunch of like this.

1851
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:08,370
It feels fucked up.

1852
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,051
Do you know,

1853
00:48:09,051 --> 00:48:12,860
I would like to see statistics
on how when guys fight,

1854
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:14,780
what happens after they get time poked?

1855
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:16,910
Somebody do that.

1856
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:19,640
One of you and I made websites
and poke them in the eye.

1857
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:19,811
No,

1858
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:20,021
no,

1859
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:20,750
no,

1860
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:20,961
no.

1861
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:22,010
We're talking about results.

1862
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,530
You go through history of birding happen.

1863
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,070
So one of the MMA sites,

1864
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:25,700
please,

1865
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,140
please do something on this.

1866
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:27,990
If you have the,

1867
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:31,580
the the notion and kicks to the balls
kick to the balls are good ones,

1868
00:48:31,581 --> 00:48:33,560
but I think I poked her worse honestly.

1869
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,110
I bet you'd be surprised
at both their clothes.

1870
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,960
Maybe you get kicked in the balls and
lack of saps everything out of you.

1871
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,003
That's like,

1872
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,030
that's a good question.

1873
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,591
Remember when Chris does?

1874
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:44,960
Sure it got kicked in the nuts
by Gonzaga and they're like,

1875
00:48:44,961 --> 00:48:45,501
you good bro.

1876
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:46,430
He got kicked so hard.

1877
00:48:46,431 --> 00:48:46,880
He goes,

1878
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,181
yeah,

1879
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:47,690
I'm good.

1880
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,710
Obviously it looks like shit.

1881
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,010
He's a Douche.

1882
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,200
I had kick game over.

1883
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,670
Not that I wouldn't happen anyways.

1884
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,900
That was the worst I've ever seen.

1885
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:54,530
Yeah,

1886
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,640
it can be bad.

1887
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,840
It certainly can be bad.

1888
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,080
Is part of Congo's gables a
tricky now cause you got a cup.

1889
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,950
So sometimes like when
these guys are going at it,

1890
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,190
man,

1891
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,430
Gilbert ival and Bandera
Lake fought in pride and,

1892
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:07,900
and,

1893
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,140
and vandalize kick Gilbert and the balls.

1894
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,290
His cousin matter what his cop,

1895
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,070
his cup was caught like right
on his balls and it like that.

1896
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:17,913
I'm looking at your balls.

1897
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,850
It was a different kind of pain,

1898
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,480
still pain that he could not recover from.

1899
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,920
It was a different game.

1900
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,830
But I want to see a statistic on what
happens to guys when it's a close fight

1901
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,090
like mitre on and Travis
Brown and then it gets,

1902
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:35,720
I poked and then from then on it's a
blowout and there's a lot of fights like

1903
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:36,650
that where a guy gets,

1904
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:38,870
I poked and like it
looked towards the end,

1905
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:40,070
like mosfet all had recovered.

1906
00:49:40,071 --> 00:49:42,920
He looked like he was fighting really
smooth and well it didn't look like,

1907
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,940
like Travis and Mitch reone is a perfect
example of like metro was not the same

1908
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:47,300
after that.

1909
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,990
Hypo.

1910
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,410
You could tell he got Jack Dan poke twice.

1911
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,470
Yes he did.

1912
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,303
And they did nothing.

1913
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,821
Yeah,

1914
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:54,230
it was not a good refereeing job.

1915
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:55,330
I don't believe who did it.

1916
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,560
What do you do that way you
don't want to call them out.

1917
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,090
I just remember being upset with it.

1918
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,340
Like when a guy gets
his eye poked that bad.

1919
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,031
You know,

1920
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:05,690
like there's a real problem with making
a guy go fight when you know he's

1921
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:06,411
compromised.

1922
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:08,330
And the reason why he's
compromised as a foul,

1923
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,040
so everybody was watching,

1924
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,450
wants to fight to continue.

1925
00:50:11,451 --> 00:50:12,770
We don't want to be disappointed,

1926
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,640
but it's not like the fight is being
stopped because of a legit technique.

1927
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,410
The fights being stopped
because of a foul.

1928
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,273
Well that's where,

1929
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:20,990
or what would you do?

1930
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:21,920
I would stop the fight.

1931
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:22,763
He's blinking,

1932
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:23,750
blinking a lot.

1933
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,890
He won't stop blinking now.

1934
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,103
I would honestly,

1935
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,070
I think a guy goes down

1936
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,580
like that.

1937
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,040
There's almost a good
argument to stop the fight.

1938
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,290
It definitely changes the dynamics.

1939
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,910
I would like to see those statistics too.

1940
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,280
I guarantee you it's probably in the,

1941
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,570
the favor of the go pokes.

1942
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,540
The judges should be allowed
to see the replay and go,

1943
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:41,871
okay,

1944
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,010
that shit was deliberate.

1945
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,581
Boom.

1946
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,140
Minus a point where it's not deliberate.

1947
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:46,340
It most times not deliberate,

1948
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,140
but if it is certain guys,

1949
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,440
how are you going to judge that though it,

1950
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,323
but what if it's cleaned?

1951
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:50,780
Fuck.

1952
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,441
If it's delivered,

1953
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,370
who cares what they were thinking?

1954
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,780
If it you fucking landed it,

1955
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,850
you're going to get
penalized 100% that's it.

1956
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,980
It doesn't make me the best
way to stop it for sure.

1957
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,970
It's never going to stop.

1958
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:01,670
But because it's an instinct and
because a lot of guys trained Moy,

1959
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:06,290
Tai and so they used to
open handing people on the
forehead and push him off and

1960
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,350
then you go to do it with a
regular gloves [inaudible] time.

1961
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:09,801
They do it.

1962
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,090
If you don't get a point taken off,

1963
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,590
if like for the first shot,

1964
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,260
then a guy knows he has
one free shot at the balls.

1965
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:15,650
Right.

1966
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,710
Here's the words a while they
don't have complete data,

1967
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,870
they did find 32 I pokes.

1968
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:25,460
That led to a pause in the action from
a sample of 1,333 fights and Ramey

1969
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:29,810
estimated you're likely to see an eye
poke in three to 4% of UFC fights taking

1970
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:30,620
it at the high end,

1971
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,040
you're likely to see an pope once
every 25 fights are so conservatively.

1972
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,770
96% of fights transpired,

1973
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:36,261
devoid of,

1974
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,760
I Prokes didn't say the,

1975
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:41,150
it doesn't say the success rate success.

1976
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,800
That's interesting now to hear that.

1977
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,640
Yeah,

1978
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:43,940
it has.

1979
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,290
I figured behind that three,

1980
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:45,770
I mean three,

1981
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,341
4%.

1982
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:46,611
Well,

1983
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:47,870
how many John Jones fights?

1984
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,270
That's probably the three to 4%.

1985
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,970
I mean,

1986
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:57,230
there's some guys that just their style
and he's so long to see that rumble.

1987
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,190
John's fight because,

1988
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:58,761
well,

1989
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,100
they're not blowing enough
fighting Carmine's going to fight

1990
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,633
all

1991
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,990
over grumpy.

1992
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,650
I'm just crush can fight
mosfet all it looks okay,

1993
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:10,161
but no,

1994
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:12,560
only he knows whether or not he
got really compromised from that.

1995
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,860
Pokies definitely compromised.

1996
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:14,820
But you can still get a win,

1997
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:15,610
but it's definitely,

1998
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,520
but it's not the same.

1999
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,413
I agree.

2000
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,230
I'm with you.

2001
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,040
I wouldn't mind if they
stopped then came back

2002
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,591
to us.

2003
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:25,371
It all looks good.

2004
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,630
I'd be pissed if they stopped it.

2005
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,160
I agree with you.

2006
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,870
I'd be pissed that they
stopped it in this fight.

2007
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,430
But I think in the mitre own fight,

2008
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:32,840
there's a good argument for stopping it.

2009
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,560
That fight.

2010
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,180
He looked like way more fucked up.

2011
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:36,050
Like when he went back.

2012
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:36,321
He never,

2013
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:38,390
why he's saying it terrible man.

2014
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,790
They do ninth there's a good argument
for stopping it is cause it's almost an

2015
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,890
unfair to let it die.

2016
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:45,950
He's qualified on,

2017
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,690
I think it does qualify to get poker.

2018
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,530
If you're talking two to three times
what the fuck you gotta do and it's still

2019
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,360
an accident and even if it's an accident,

2020
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:54,194
it's still,

2021
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,131
it's still,

2022
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,210
it's still does damage,

2023
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,900
but then you have to kind of the rough,

2024
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,030
I think it's up to the ref.

2025
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,310
The ref's kind of assess
exactly what kind of an,

2026
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,070
I put too much pressure on the ref
to give them that kind of power.

2027
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,260
Mosfet I a not.

2028
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,940
Let's see if he can get
a Lorens to the ground.

2029
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,740
Lorenzo's fighting it off
cause take down a fence.

2030
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,860
Neth di Lorenzo is so slick
but so's Mazda Donald Man,

2031
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,530
I'm liking the,

2032
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,440
he's fighting here real that right.

2033
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:22,881
Bam.

2034
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:23,181
Bam.

2035
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:24,014
Look at that

2036
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:25,980
little doll

2037
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,810
some dude made that gave it to me.

2038
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,380
Atlanta.

2039
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,310
Cool man.

2040
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:29,940
Come on.

2041
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,773
That is dope.

2042
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,080
Dope.

2043
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,270
It's going to be like
an animated series man.

2044
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:36,680
I like.

2045
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,950
You'd be the star of it.

2046
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:38,940
It's hilarious.

2047
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,591
When,

2048
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:41,700
how long it took to me.

2049
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,100
It's funny cause the
UFC made those little,

2050
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:47,460
they made a lot of hotels and
they made me one of me and they,

2051
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,300
they'd given it to me whatever the
company was and I was like laughing.

2052
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:52,590
I was like that is so ridiculous.

2053
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:53,820
Doesn't look anything like me.

2054
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,560
Like didn't look anything like me.

2055
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,320
I'm like did you just like
pretend it was me just a ball.

2056
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,500
Just loving it was back when I was bald.

2057
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,660
I think I had hair back
then but it was so bad.

2058
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,070
It looks like your torso
and your arms just like me.

2059
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,910
The guy did a great job.

2060
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,800
You look a little older than that.

2061
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,341
Yeah,

2062
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,180
but still,

2063
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,990
I was going to say that's fine.

2064
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,370
You know we're all getting older.

2065
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,290
We're all getting older though cause
I just want to get out with that.

2066
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,143
Thank you.

2067
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,260
Well she's definitely getting older.

2068
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:19,831
Everybody does.

2069
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:22,470
I mean like nobody said immediately.

2070
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:22,861
Ah,

2071
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:23,551
you look all there.

2072
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,580
It took a little bit cause we all
expect us to get and that you Brendan,

2073
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:29,970
but for us in our late
forties compared to you guys,

2074
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:30,804
how old?

2075
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,720
33 Christ save every bit of it.

2076
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:34,643
Yeah.

2077
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,380
Once you hit 40 you want
those guys that had food.

2078
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:37,870
Look at that too.

2079
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,131
Right?

2080
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:38,460
Come on up.

2081
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,293
Come up.

2082
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:39,751
Come up.

2083
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:40,470
Come closer.

2084
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,460
You guys are wiser though.

2085
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,920
It's good to have friends to Larkin.

2086
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,130
Let's look in smooth hair,

2087
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:44,964
man.

2088
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,890
Maza Donald standing.

2089
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,640
Ooh Donald.

2090
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,530
That switch kick.

2091
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:50,280
Damn,

2092
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,200
I love that switch.

2093
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:52,590
How many he's to get caught here.

2094
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,270
That upper cut and them.

2095
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:54,511
Well,

2096
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:55,120
Mazda dolls.

2097
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,890
Real,

2098
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,540
real sneaky but so's Larkin.

2099
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,490
Larkin's real sneaky with this
arc and stuff to train for man.

2100
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:00,780
Yeah,

2101
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,710
so unconventional.

2102
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:02,730
His angles are weird.

2103
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,140
Is Weird.

2104
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:04,501
Boy,

2105
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:08,690
he's got a little bit of like karate mixed
in with a lot of boxing and more time

2106
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:08,921
like,

2107
00:55:08,921 --> 00:55:11,730
oh look at some of his
moves are like karate moves,

2108
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,140
but Mazda dot might have tagged them.

2109
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:14,330
They're looking at this La Rocco.

2110
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,183
Ooh.

2111
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,190
Who saw that coming when
I'm around for sure.

2112
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,250
Ooh y'all.

2113
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,890
All I was saying on those title shots.

2114
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:25,460
What if you know how they say anyone in,

2115
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:25,870
in,

2116
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,240
in the top five needs stay in shape.

2117
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,290
Just the case guy gets hurt.

2118
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,700
What if during the title shot the
UFC tells a guy he's the reserve,

2119
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,301
so find me,

2120
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:34,134
gets hurt.

2121
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,413
You're up brother.

2122
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,970
You don't have to go a training camp but
be ready because you're the first guy

2123
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:39,390
we go to.

2124
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:44,390
So we should have one around that
like laid out like on the card,

2125
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,870
like the alternative.

2126
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,680
I don't think you tell people
because why not say in DC Jones case,

2127
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:50,371
let's say rumbles.

2128
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:52,160
The alternate people
want to see that fight.

2129
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:53,700
It's like come on to hopefully get hurt.

2130
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,780
I don't think you tell anyone.

2131
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,651
You just surprise him,

2132
00:55:55,651 --> 00:56:00,270
but only up fight or nose and you start
paying people I think was the most

2133
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,080
dangerous fight in many ways because
Jones does take hits to the face and he

2134
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,790
can't do that with,

2135
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:06,840
with a rumble.

2136
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,440
I don't think you can do tomatoes.

2137
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,580
The alternate either.

2138
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,140
Either fighter might have someone
pay someone off to make sure that

2139
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,500
motherfucker,

2140
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,333
you don't tell anyone.

2141
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,610
No one's going to do that
happen in big title fight.

2142
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:20,851
You're like,

2143
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:21,061
shit,

2144
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:21,831
I want to fight that guy.

2145
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:22,320
I don't want to fight.

2146
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,050
Which you'd have to about is some
unscrupulous promoter or Sonia for sure.

2147
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,460
Like you get about Tonya Harding.

2148
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,780
I think if they told Bisbing hey bro,

2149
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,730
uh,

2150
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,330
you know Susan's out for awhile,

2151
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,370
I'll see our boy.

2152
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:34,370
Y'all was out for awhile.

2153
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,020
You're,

2154
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,930
if something happens a wide means there's
a good chance because he does get hurt

2155
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,440
Europe.

2156
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,930
So don't go to Toronto
and Phillip Film a movie.

2157
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:41,021
Yeah.

2158
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:42,130
You tell them one in five,

2159
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:43,590
you're one of five guys
were thinking about.

2160
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:43,740
Yeah,

2161
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:46,870
but don't say one to five and
they talk to you a fucking move.

2162
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,700
No one knows the,

2163
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,530
you realize you're at
the end of your career.

2164
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,550
You've got to take that movie.

2165
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:51,810
Oh,

2166
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,420
I'm not hating them.

2167
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,171
I'm just saying if the,

2168
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:55,750
if the UFC had a plan in place,

2169
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,200
yes,

2170
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,790
but then he would still
have to take that movie.

2171
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:58,661
Can you get,

2172
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:00,460
you got to take it because
it's a burden the hand,

2173
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:01,810
you know,

2174
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,780
maybe you would train a little bit.

2175
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,290
General guys aren't filming fast
and furious nine or whatever.

2176
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,124
You know what I'm saying?

2177
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,580
You remember like shale
sown and Jon Jones,

2178
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:12,910
if you had a backup in case
you still have a fight.

2179
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,130
So a Weidman is out for a while.

2180
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:16,361
Man.

2181
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:18,190
He's got some disc issues in his neck.

2182
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:20,430
He says he'll be back for that
Madison Square Garden Card.

2183
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:20,620
Yeah,

2184
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,371
he wants to be,

2185
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,770
but he's gotta be real careful because
you don't want to rush something like

2186
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:23,991
this.

2187
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:24,760
It's got a bad one.

2188
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,350
Herniated disc in his neck.

2189
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:26,770
That's,

2190
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,520
whew.

2191
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,930
God Damn Lorenzo's fast.

2192
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:30,160
Speaking of herniated disc,

2193
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,123
I go on,

2194
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,860
I go into surgery Tuesday.

2195
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,300
Oh Shit.

2196
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:34,840
Damn Bro.

2197
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,680
This replacement baby
for your lumbar lower.

2198
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,200
Yup.

2199
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,033
Wow.

2200
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,331
How bad?

2201
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,490
How bad is it in my desk?

2202
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,130
My l five s one is doesn't exist.

2203
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:50,190
That's why I'm in my lower back is in
eternal constant state of inflammation.

2204
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,570
It's just sore all always pat,

2205
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,940
just a wreck every day,

2206
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:55,481
no matter what.

2207
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:59,620
I could stop working out for two months
and it would feel like I did squats the

2208
00:57:59,620 --> 00:57:59,621
day before.

2209
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:00,920
Is there anybody you guys know?

2210
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,700
You know what I mean?

2211
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,770
For she that surgery.

2212
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:06,700
Is there anyone you guys know who trained
in Jujitsu for a long time who doesn't

2213
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,440
have some issue with their back or neck?

2214
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,793
My doctor,

2215
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,950
my doctor said,

2216
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,780
knocking on your neck
and back all the time.

2217
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,081
I mean,

2218
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:15,550
it's like it's part of the game.

2219
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,843
My next.

2220
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,550
You get girls in here or
done anything and they're 23

2221
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,553
against the cage.

2222
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:25,990
Nope.

2223
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,823
Nope.

2224
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:27,701
God Damn.

2225
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:28,534
Lorens is tough.

2226
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,373
Oh.

2227
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,350
Oh Shit.

2228
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:33,670
Woo fight dude.

2229
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,140
God Damn.

2230
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,040
Oh Ba Huh?

2231
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,393
Hmm.

2232
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,590
Oh my God.

2233
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,960
This is a fucking slobber.

2234
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:45,660
Knocker Real Dani.

2235
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,790
Oh to pass.

2236
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:49,870
Nope,

2237
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,500
he's out.

2238
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,490
Do you see what he's doing?

2239
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,180
That is crazy.

2240
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,330
He's bridging on his name.

2241
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,880
He's in trouble now.

2242
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:56,400
It's over the neck.

2243
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,810
Hand defense.

2244
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,591
That's a lot of sweat.

2245
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:00,790
Beautiful defense.

2246
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,750
Mazda dollars.

2247
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:04,580
Fucking relentless to Jesus Christ.

2248
00:59:04,581 --> 00:59:05,600
Larkins take down events.

2249
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:06,370
These man.

2250
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:06,481
Hey,

2251
00:59:06,481 --> 00:59:07,314
come to fence.

2252
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,193
It's nuts.

2253
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,080
He just went up on his head.

2254
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,620
His good team defense too.

2255
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:13,454
It was insane.

2256
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,060
Especially at this when he's this tired.

2257
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,923
Yeah.

2258
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,840
Third round of Mike Ross
started wearing rash guards.

2259
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:20,920
If they wanted to know,

2260
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,681
you should be able to wear that.

2261
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:22,700
If you want to girls wearing,

2262
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:23,071
why not?

2263
00:59:23,071 --> 00:59:25,040
Why we keep the girls are titties out

2264
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,763
takes sweat.

2265
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,210
It takes sweat out of the game.

2266
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,430
Which I think would a show more technique,

2267
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,490
especially grappling

2268
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:34,983
increase

2269
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,180
is that kind of

2270
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,050
matters accounts guy gets right back.

2271
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,520
They should make rash guards mandatory.

2272
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,713
No,

2273
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,683
no,

2274
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,570
no,

2275
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:47,830
no,

2276
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:48,030
no.

2277
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,160
I should wear sunglasses.

2278
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:49,610
No,

2279
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,570
there's benefits to it.

2280
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:51,560
And then there's negatives to it.

2281
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,650
If you're a striker you want to
keep Fabi rendering walked in.

2282
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:55,610
Yeah.

2283
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,450
Oh he tagged him with an upper cut price.

2284
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,600
This fight is amazing.

2285
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,530
Crazy nuts.

2286
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,000
Definitely not mandatory.

2287
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,870
But you got to,

2288
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:07,490
we got to remember this is
greasing illegal or illegal.

2289
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:08,600
Illegal.

2290
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,080
It's easy cause it's the Ford stuff.

2291
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:12,080
No,

2292
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,200
no,

2293
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,321
no,

2294
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:12,441
no,

2295
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:12,591
no.

2296
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:13,424
But why though?

2297
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,850
Cause it's some substance
and then what happens?

2298
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:17,961
Come on.

2299
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:18,600
Don't play games.

2300
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,830
So benefits the benefits that guy that
has it on him because he can't get the

2301
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:22,131
tannins.

2302
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:23,060
A foreign substance.

2303
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,630
Yeah,

2304
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,021
of course.

2305
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,130
But it's nothing like sweat.

2306
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:26,820
Well it's,

2307
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,770
it's nothing like,

2308
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:28,970
it's very much like sweat.

2309
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:30,500
Sweat is slippery and grieves me,

2310
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,250
sir.

2311
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,330
What is very slippery?

2312
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:33,141
It's very similar.

2313
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:33,411
It's just,

2314
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:35,190
it's just shut down.

2315
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,040
It's a lot more extreme.

2316
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,610
That brain and that pattern
just dealt double duty.

2317
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,090
And he wasn't going to do though.

2318
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:43,280
Uh,

2319
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,113
put a,

2320
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,310
we're not talking to
your back for your aisle.

2321
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,600
That's like the key argument when
I was in everybody wear a g no,

2322
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:50,570
it's just if,

2323
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,050
if,

2324
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,420
if going home is illegal
because it makes it too slowly.

2325
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,220
If Greece is illegal,

2326
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,390
if it has nothing to do with the gate,

2327
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:00,080
if greasing is illegal because then
make shit too greasy and it's a foreign,

2328
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,450
the problem is there's no tests for it.

2329
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,901
Right.

2330
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:03,520
But uh,

2331
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,350
rash guards,

2332
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,390
foreign substance,

2333
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:09,050
you can crash cart tests
because there is no test.

2334
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:09,890
But tell me about the test,

2335
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:10,220
you know,

2336
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:10,481
with,

2337
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:12,320
with the Vaseline or whatever.

2338
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,550
How do they test?

2339
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:13,791
Dude,

2340
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:17,210
you can tell you have a commission
following you around from the locker room

2341
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:17,990
till the cage,

2342
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,823
but there was no tea,

2343
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,820
there's no swab.

2344
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:20,511
And then they put it in,

2345
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,500
it's like testing in a cup.

2346
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,400
There's no official test that says
that you went over the grief limit.

2347
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:25,480
Well,

2348
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:25,810
we can't,

2349
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,510
let me,

2350
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:26,841
let me,

2351
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:29,690
let me stop this right now because
one thing you definitely could do,

2352
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:34,220
100% that has been done is you take
a mineral oil bath the night before.

2353
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,930
Yes,

2354
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,450
take a mineral oil bath the night before
she could get into that cage and you

2355
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:39,410
don't have anything on.

2356
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:40,011
You took a shower,

2357
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:40,671
you don't have anything on.

2358
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:43,010
You are so Lippert right

2359
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,220
the fucking time.

2360
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,810
There's nothing anybody can do about it.

2361
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,171
Nothing.

2362
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,120
Anyone can do official tests,

2363
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,380
but there's no official task.

2364
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:52,610
But since girls are wearing,

2365
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,990
girls were rock stars all the time.

2366
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:54,680
Hey,

2367
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,640
I need a rescue guy.

2368
01:01:56,641 --> 01:01:56,991
So,

2369
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:59,750
but I don't think he was a huge
issue where the Dana's going,

2370
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,450
holy fuck everyone's slipping missions.

2371
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,690
We'll figure something out here.

2372
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:09,610
Every year the NFL has meetings to
change stuff to make the sport more a

2373
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,120
offensive.

2374
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,030
They always,

2375
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,340
they're always figuring out a way.

2376
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,170
They're always handicapping the defense.

2377
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:15,670
Try,

2378
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,210
you know you can't hit the receiver.

2379
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,610
You're always handicap in the deep
and she wanted authentic as a league.

2380
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,650
The same thing with can be done for MMA.

2381
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,460
You get together and go,

2382
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,380
how do we improve submissions?

2383
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,130
For instance,

2384
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,870
you improve submissions by make it around.

2385
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,180
They want knocked out the one
that counts as much as they want.

2386
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:30,660
Some Mitchell.

2387
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,261
Exactly.

2388
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,850
We do something for the knockouts too.

2389
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,310
But you do something for
submissions to you every year.

2390
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:36,900
You do something a little
bit here and there.

2391
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:37,501
Girls,

2392
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:38,550
whereas cards all the time,

2393
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,210
so I can take her titties.

2394
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,520
I'll take rash guards,

2395
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,290
no gloves for a thousand hours.

2396
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,020
Damn it.

2397
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:44,490
No,

2398
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,570
no guys,

2399
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:48,841
no gloves.

2400
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:49,350
Let's do it.

2401
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,183
That'd be perfect.

2402
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,480
You wouldn't have to create this test
for this thing that you made illegal.

2403
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,231
It's illegal,

2404
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,010
but there's no test cause
it's not that big of a legal,

2405
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,850
hold on.

2406
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:00,241
Hold on.

2407
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,650
I don't think you're rice all the time.

2408
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:02,520
Don't think you're right.

2409
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,770
Cause I know that herb
dean tested someone before.

2410
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:05,371
I know her,

2411
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:06,750
talked to him personally.

2412
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,190
He took a swab off.

2413
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:10,740
Someone did is just to test it.

2414
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:11,743
It's like,

2415
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,590
listen,

2416
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,190
listen,

2417
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,720
it's a,

2418
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,553
it's a,

2419
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,310
it's a crazy event

2420
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:22,960
wouldn't horse.

2421
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,090
It's like it's a tremendous advantage.

2422
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,220
What did her upset?

2423
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,810
Try grappling with someone greasy.

2424
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:31,710
What did herb say?

2425
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,543
Punch him in the face.

2426
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,510
You said you talked to her.

2427
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,770
He said that he's done like onsite
shit where he'll like look and see,

2428
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,930
but that doesn't stop a guy along Moses.

2429
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,730
Maybe a couple months ago,

2430
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:43,050
maybe three months ago,

2431
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:44,840
and I know there was
at least I was asking,

2432
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:46,800
there's no test.

2433
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,800
They just Lorens Larkin the monsoon
because that's a good question.

2434
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,080
That's close to close,

2435
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:55,361
but I didn't,

2436
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:56,880
I didn't want you to
close enough to judge,

2437
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:59,280
but his take down definitely helped them.

2438
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:03,160
Those two take talk a little
bit more amazing fight,

2439
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,680
but we barely paid attached to,

2440
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:05,281
let's be honest,

2441
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,870
you're talking about illegal
greasing and rash guard.

2442
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,430
While I'm saying if it's illegal,

2443
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:12,750
come up with an official test.

2444
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,160
If there's no official test,

2445
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:15,203
then the symbol,

2446
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:16,920
the symbol could still expensive.

2447
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:18,900
Temple do what the girls did.

2448
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,690
The girls wear tops mean.

2449
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,780
What's interesting with sweat
is that it was sweat the,

2450
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,090
the conditions naturally change.

2451
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,230
They actually changed.

2452
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,170
They start off dependent
upon your preparation.

2453
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,230
Like that's one of the things where
Nate Marquardt fought Paul Harris.

2454
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:39,440
He wore a rubber suit backstage and Nate
like really got super sweaty and then

2455
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:41,190
when he went out there to fight,

2456
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:45,720
he was already sweaty as fuck and so
when Paul hires one for that leg lock,

2457
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:46,980
Nate was all sweated up.

2458
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,820
Nate slipped out and Pahar
started pointing at a Nate
punches fucking lights on.

2459
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,670
That was great.

2460
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,800
One of my favorites of all time.

2461
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:53,371
It was great.

2462
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:54,390
It was his greatest dude.

2463
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,900
Well,

2464
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,960
it was a great ending and he
was like Turkish oil wrestling.

2465
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:58,581
You should check it.

2466
01:04:58,581 --> 01:04:59,414
Yes,

2467
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,720
I'll Turkish oil to the rest of the,

2468
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:04,560
they look like they look
like you had mustaches.

2469
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,780
It does guys reach into
each other's pants.

2470
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,330
Then the gravity of this
deck and they usually just,

2471
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,183
Dick

2472
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,150
don't know Bruno.

2473
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:13,891
When it goes,

2474
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:14,940
the body will follow it.

2475
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:16,890
You guys want that to no gloves and Dick,

2476
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,063
what's your

2477
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,053
mustache?

2478
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,391
Handlebar mustache.

2479
01:05:21,391 --> 01:05:22,150
You'd look good.

2480
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,983
I have a question for you.

2481
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:25,150
Head gear is there,

2482
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:29,200
is that science that it actually is
worse for you when your box can be worse?

2483
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:30,700
It's not necessarily worse,

2484
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:31,780
but it can be worse.

2485
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:32,440
Why's?

2486
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,370
It makes a larger fulcrum because it's a
larger thing and you get clipped and it

2487
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:37,630
makes your head spin more.

2488
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,560
Oh yeah.

2489
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:39,670
And it's also a heavy,

2490
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,160
yeah.

2491
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,380
So you have this thing,

2492
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,030
what is a way like half a pound,

2493
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:44,740
a pound or hash?

2494
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,203
It makes your head,

2495
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,860
it's slower for your head to move.

2496
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:50,410
One of the things about
punches as you see them coming,

2497
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:53,800
you got to learn how to roll with Shit
and you can't roll with shit if you have

2498
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,510
this big ass fucking head gear on,

2499
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,700
but then you can't begin
because it's good for cuts.

2500
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:58,840
So he can't get cut.

2501
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,430
But that's just in training.

2502
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,940
It's only training.

2503
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,210
Yeah,

2504
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:02,980
it was not,

2505
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,150
I mean it's,

2506
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:04,984
it's,

2507
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,510
I think you're better off
grease in your fucking head up,

2508
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:09,520
but then there's a problem
cause they grease heads up,

2509
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,230
the grease faces up and shit.

2510
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,680
And then you take that same grease and
you put it on a dude's chest as you're

2511
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:15,640
trying to take them down.

2512
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,800
And then you grab your arms,

2513
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:18,940
you wrap it around at night
and get grease on your arms.

2514
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:20,200
Boxers aren't bottoms,

2515
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,340
Vaseline in the face up.

2516
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:25,840
You're allowed much Vaseline are they
using in the UFC these days they're using

2517
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:26,674
less and less.

2518
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,930
That's like leftover bullshit boxing shit.

2519
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,290
While it makes Vaseline all over
your fucking seeking slip punches,

2520
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,300
makes punches not cut you off.

2521
01:06:34,301 --> 01:06:35,121
So they hit you,

2522
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:40,121
but they slide off instead of instead
of them grazing and scrap by with the

2523
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:41,170
leather gloves.

2524
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:41,861
Hey,

2525
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:42,611
I'm down with that.

2526
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,660
I will say this.

2527
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:44,500
No Vaseline,

2528
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,334
no gloves,

2529
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:45,760
cheese,

2530
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,061
rash,

2531
01:06:46,061 --> 01:06:46,510
guard,

2532
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,890
no gloves and rash guard.

2533
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,350
You said rash cause you
could wear a rash guards.

2534
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,830
I don't think there's a
problem with rash guards,

2535
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,170
but I think rational idea.

2536
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:57,930
I feel like your phones would cut skin
rash guard you against that optional.

2537
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,210
This theophany Kamozi it's a bad look.

2538
01:07:01,211 --> 01:07:02,640
You could put your fucking Reebok on that.

2539
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:02,951
A big,

2540
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:05,170
can you imagine the Reebok rash
guards that can come up with,

2541
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:08,230
with the red and the black
love and closes his door.

2542
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:09,460
Vito Vito Miranda.

2543
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:11,280
This dude's a bad motherfucker.

2544
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,730
This is a serious fight here.

2545
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,080
Kamozi Miranda.

2546
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:14,760
Yeah.

2547
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,430
Yeah.

2548
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,350
It'd be a grade d.

2549
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,500
Where's he from it?

2550
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:23,510
I got a zeal Kamozi so game his name and
his game as fuck and he's been training

2551
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:24,940
with Weidman's Kim,

2552
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,710
great hair trains in Denver,

2553
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:27,960
and then he was going
out to wipe off the camp.

2554
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,390
Tough man and soul.

2555
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,330
Miranda Miranda is a little older thing.

2556
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:31,631
Miranda,

2557
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,740
I want to say he's 34 35 but he's a
multiple time kickboxing champion.

2558
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,660
He said nasty.

2559
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:39,490
You start remembering the
fraction and a Russian assassin.

2560
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,390
Even though he's from Brazil,

2561
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,940
he's not rush.

2562
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:44,890
It's like a Russian.

2563
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,140
He was a finalist in the
ultimate fighter Brazil.

2564
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:47,983
Remember Jesus,

2565
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:49,220
he's just fucking monster.

2566
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:49,831
It was babies.

2567
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:50,230
It's the best.

2568
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,520
It's a tough fight for Kamozi.

2569
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:52,510
[inaudible] to tell.

2570
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:53,550
If I click on this,

2571
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,210
click on his name please.

2572
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:56,170
Victim.

2573
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:59,980
And so you find out what his last
fights where one calle last fight.

2574
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,110
I think he's three last three fights.

2575
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,410
Three finishes in that,

2576
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:03,700
right.

2577
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:04,420
I can't see that.

2578
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:04,811
When,

2579
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:05,231
when?

2580
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:06,064
When?

2581
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:06,701
Scroll down.

2582
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:08,230
J.

2583
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,230
O.

2584
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,230
K.

2585
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,230
O.

2586
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,230
K.

2587
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,231
L.

2588
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:09,100
What's up son?

2589
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,053
Oh yeah,

2590
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,150
Masa Marcello,

2591
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,721
Gui.

2592
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:14,460
Marez,

2593
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:14,681
Gui.

2594
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:15,200
Mara's.

2595
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,160
I forget how to say that guy's

2596
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,610
name,

2597
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,660
but he knocked that dude out.

2598
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,420
It was nasty and Gomorrah was,

2599
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:20,254
uh,

2600
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:24,620
was a really good striker himself
and the clinic has to fight to woo.

2601
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:24,981
I was like,

2602
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:26,000
Jesus Christ,

2603
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,290
she's only less that decision.

2604
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,250
Ultimate fighter finale.

2605
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:29,840
And he'd just wrestled him the whole time.

2606
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:30,121
Yeah.

2607
01:08:30,121 --> 01:08:31,280
He's a bad motherfucker.

2608
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:32,730
I'll fight for Kamozi stylized.

2609
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,740
Kamozi is not a wrestler.

2610
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,421
He's not a grapple.

2611
01:08:34,421 --> 01:08:35,630
You likes to stand in Bang.

2612
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,261
He know what though?

2613
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:36,741
Kamasi.

2614
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:38,060
So God damn tough.

2615
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,590
He's just so fucking tough.

2616
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:40,251
He's one of those dudes.

2617
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:42,150
You just can't count out now unless you,

2618
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:42,830
unless it's fine.

2619
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,060
Junker a drug.

2620
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:44,301
I said,

2621
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:44,541
what?

2622
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,460
I'm gonna eat that ass up.

2623
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:46,453
Easy paycheck.

2624
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,440
I was so crazy.

2625
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:49,550
The exact same way.

2626
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,710
I'll do this shit all day.

2627
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,130
Yeah.

2628
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,190
Well I for commodes those losses,

2629
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,761
like you know,

2630
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:57,020
you recover from those pretty quick.

2631
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,030
Tap on the next week.

2632
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,160
It's all good baby.

2633
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,993
Now.

2634
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,920
That was fucked up twice.

2635
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:09,070
Short notes fights those
killer [inaudible] Shakuri
his ground game was he tore

2636
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:10,940
his meniscus or something.

2637
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:11,631
Yeah,

2638
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:12,030
he's got a,

2639
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,651
he's got a neat,

2640
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:15,110
it's a little beat up from
training camp for Vituro tour.

2641
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,730
What he did to veto was just she,

2642
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:17,564
Jesus,

2643
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,360
he should have taken a fucking
cortisone shot and jumped in that fight.

2644
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,221
He really showed up.

2645
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:22,054
I agree.

2646
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:22,580
You know,

2647
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,920
I almost failing unless
it's really fucked up.

2648
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:26,180
But I just feel like man,

2649
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,620
he's going to get a title shot.

2650
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,830
But he fought against Rockhold
and everybody knows it.

2651
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:32,900
Rockhold took that last fight with staff.

2652
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:33,980
It's staff and it's fun.

2653
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,940
It's pretty fucked up.

2654
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,350
Everybody fights hurt.

2655
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:36,981
You know,

2656
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:39,820
you're telling me like this
opportunity I guess maybe just wasn't,

2657
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,030
he was eating donuts and shit.

2658
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:45,290
Maybe just wanting to break
or maybe went on the boom bar.

2659
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,601
You didn't know what it is.

2660
01:09:50,601 --> 01:09:51,870
Do you laugh and you know,

2661
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:52,010
no,

2662
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,300
we're talking about steroids.

2663
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:53,910
Yeah,

2664
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:54,743
exactly.

2665
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,790
I don't think he did.

2666
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,780
I don't think it would drop right.

2667
01:09:56,781 --> 01:09:56,991
Did,

2668
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:57,824
but um,

2669
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,060
it sucks that he didn't take that fight
cause I think stylistically that's a

2670
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:02,480
really interesting gonna happen though.

2671
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,130
You mean,

2672
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,790
you mean it's going rock hauling?

2673
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,080
Rockhold they fought,

2674
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,420
they fought in Strikeforce
and Rockhold wanted decision.

2675
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:09,730
And I just,

2676
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:10,970
I still think,

2677
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:14,510
I still think the guy who's going to
beat both Weidman and rock hall by any of

2678
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,280
those guys is a Yoel Romero.

2679
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:20,690
Maybe he's just so Romero
barely beat Jacques hurray.

2680
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:21,590
Yeah,

2681
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:21,951
he did.

2682
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,910
But like what is,

2683
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,270
when you think about why,

2684
01:10:24,271 --> 01:10:24,950
when you think about it,

2685
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:25,761
of course it's tracking,

2686
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:27,620
but it's raising Jocko raped,

2687
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,760
beat Ramiro rather.

2688
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,870
That's why he uh,

2689
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:30,860
he was next in line,

2690
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,311
but,

2691
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:31,640
uh,

2692
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,140
when Jocko Ray beat Ramiro,

2693
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:34,820
he almost got taken out
in that first round,

2694
01:10:34,821 --> 01:10:37,310
but then he came back
in one second and third.

2695
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:37,940
Yeah.

2696
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,600
But you know,

2697
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,440
Ramiro,

2698
01:10:39,441 --> 01:10:40,270
I think we,

2699
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,600
we fucking missed out.

2700
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,070
You can keep it up here hiding.

2701
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:46,340
We'd for Ramiro missed out in that.

2702
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,690
He's like 30,

2703
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,340
late thirties,

2704
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,930
like 30 6:37 PM late.

2705
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,261
Yeah.

2706
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:55,490
If we got ahold of Romero when
he was like 26 what I mean,

2707
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:59,360
he was just a God damn
super duper athletes.

2708
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,433
All natural.

2709
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,663
He's a free,

2710
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,181
well,

2711
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,014
you know,

2712
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,760
I don't know,

2713
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:05,701
but he,

2714
01:11:05,701 --> 01:11:06,560
he did beat,

2715
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,423
um,

2716
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,060
Cael Sanderson twice,

2717
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:10,880
twice,

2718
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,301
which is,

2719
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:11,561
you know,

2720
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:13,010
you're talking about
the Olympic gold medal.

2721
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,010
He walked through

2722
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,430
the,

2723
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,980
in that finals against that
Korean guy to win the gold medal.

2724
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,240
He walked through that guy.

2725
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:18,511
He was like,

2726
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:19,290
he was just,

2727
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,290
he was just crazy man in
monsters as a wrestler.

2728
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:22,891
I mean,

2729
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:25,050
I've seen him do stuff
inside the octagon like you,

2730
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:25,261
just,

2731
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:26,094
his movements.

2732
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,410
So like when I'm watching fights,

2733
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:28,771
you know,

2734
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:31,410
up close and you watch like
thousands of them or whatever,

2735
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,580
I've watched at this point,

2736
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:36,420
do you like get you still at
certain speeds that people
move under and every now

2737
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:38,070
and then someone to move at
a speed that you're like,

2738
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:38,371
Whoa,

2739
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:39,750
my brain is not recognizing this.

2740
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:39,871
Like,

2741
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:41,520
how's like Barboza switch kick?

2742
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,660
My brain just goes,

2743
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:42,801
whoa,

2744
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:42,971
whoa,

2745
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:43,191
whoa.

2746
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:43,920
What the fuck?

2747
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:44,753
I'm good dude.

2748
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,680
And I think that one of the
biggest examples of that is Yotel.

2749
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:52,960
Yeah.

2750
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,370
Well,

2751
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,320
the way he moves when
he throws people around,

2752
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,870
it's almost like he's not
even the same thing as them.

2753
01:11:58,140 --> 01:11:58,401
Well,

2754
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:00,240
I can just toss this guys around like,

2755
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,161
like you're,

2756
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:01,411
you know,

2757
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:01,750
like,

2758
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:05,070
like he's just some crazy ass silver
bag and you're some dude in a rubber

2759
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:05,904
gorilla outfit.

2760
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,220
He lost the Tim,

2761
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:09,720
he lost a jock gray I think.

2762
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,780
Well he didn't lose the Tim but he
definitely should have been disqualified.

2763
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:13,571
Definitely cheated.

2764
01:12:13,571 --> 01:12:14,750
And I thought he loved me out.

2765
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,720
He knocked out Tim and the third round
but never made it to the third brown.

2766
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,500
They should have.

2767
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:19,951
He didn't,

2768
01:12:19,951 --> 01:12:23,460
he was not capable of coming off
his stool for the third round.

2769
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:26,160
They should have stopped the fight
and they should've given to cheating.

2770
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:26,700
No,

2771
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,700
I think he should have laundry or
per site based off that disqualified.

2772
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,280
I thought he lost her job gray.

2773
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,780
He definitely lost a jock ray.

2774
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,100
He lost a decision.

2775
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:36,751
He definitely know.

2776
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:39,150
But he was like kind
of close and they know,

2777
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:42,390
I think well he almost put joc raise
lights out in the first that's spinning

2778
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,040
back fist and then after that was,

2779
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,441
thank you ma'am.

2780
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:47,360
But I think you're crazy if
he had him and half guards,

2781
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,490
you see that when he stood right up like
you know there's something about Joel

2782
01:12:51,491 --> 01:12:54,230
morale or where's that where
it seems like Jocko Jujitsu,

2783
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,140
nothing was going to work.

2784
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:55,351
Yeah,

2785
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:56,250
it was a very close fight.

2786
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:57,810
But I mean he's the ultimate athlete.

2787
01:12:57,811 --> 01:12:59,850
He makes other athletes like fat slobs.

2788
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:01,860
He's afraid he makes like real Alec.

2789
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,070
If you saw like Chris Weidman as a study.

2790
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:04,730
Yes.

2791
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:06,900
Chris Weidman is standing
next to y'all was like,

2792
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,141
Chris,

2793
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:07,974
why don't you work out?

2794
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,360
Right.

2795
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,230
And Chris is a great
restaurant but it's wrestling.

2796
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:13,540
Chris looks like next door.

2797
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,300
It was just like super skinny.

2798
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,020
I'm bummed out.

2799
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,400
He's got a neck injury cause I want
to see that motherfucker fight.

2800
01:13:18,401 --> 01:13:19,234
It's a great fight.

2801
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,450
It's up and the rematch matched amazing.

2802
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:22,860
But that neck injuries,

2803
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:23,401
no joke.

2804
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:28,140
And I just hope he doesn't do something
drastic quickly in order to repair

2805
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:28,974
himself quickly.

2806
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,450
Tried to get from passage where it goes.

2807
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,720
Does he needs surgery for the
neck or is it just might not be,

2808
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,230
I mean it's,

2809
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,530
it sounds similar to the
exact injury that I had.

2810
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,530
What I had to do is take a log time
and you have to do decompression.

2811
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,101
I do,

2812
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:44,100
I have this neck harness
that I hang on a door.

2813
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,680
It hangs on a doorframe and
it's like I'm hanging myself.

2814
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,970
It velcros in place.

2815
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,920
I pull it down tight and I'd go like this,

2816
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,191
click,

2817
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:50,431
click,

2818
01:13:50,431 --> 01:13:50,701
click,

2819
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:50,971
click,

2820
01:13:50,971 --> 01:13:51,301
click,

2821
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:52,740
and I hang on my neck.

2822
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:54,841
How long,

2823
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:56,850
how long does it take?

2824
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:57,930
Why they need surgery?

2825
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,771
Sure,

2826
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:01,560
why he does this and in
doing that and doing that,

2827
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:05,100
what I just described over a long
period of time and Regena keen,

2828
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,660
those two things,

2829
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,470
it stopped my bulging disc and
it's sucked back into my neck.

2830
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,190
My disc stuck out.

2831
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,090
Like there was an Mri when they
looked at the disc and it was like six

2832
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:17,080
millimeter bulge.

2833
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,100
Now I have none.

2834
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,180
It went back.

2835
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,013
You can do it,

2836
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,580
but when you go to doctors,

2837
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:23,200
one of the first things
you want to do is cut you.

2838
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:27,700
Now obviously is a super important to
talk about everybody's injuries different

2839
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:28,870
because it worked for me.

2840
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:29,920
It might not work for you.

2841
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:30,131
Your,

2842
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:33,400
your injury might be worse than mine and
it might get to a point where there's

2843
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,900
nothing they can do except for surgery.

2844
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:39,901
But you don't know that just by talking
to some doctors because some doctors are

2845
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:44,020
just ready to cut you and they might be
right and they might have had success

2846
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:44,230
with it.

2847
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:47,650
But that gentleman was on TV right now
is a testament to the fact that it does

2848
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,550
not always work.

2849
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,110
And boss will tell you he's had several
neck surgeries and because of that,

2850
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,090
because of his neck injury,

2851
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:55,990
his arm,

2852
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:56,651
he has one arm.

2853
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:59,410
It's atrophy that he calls
baby arm because his,

2854
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,770
his nerves weren't firing
to his arm was impinged.

2855
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:04,380
Yeah,

2856
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:05,850
I mean serious,

2857
01:15:05,851 --> 01:15:06,700
serious shit.

2858
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:06,860
What,

2859
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,760
what they're going to ask what Chris is
decision to be based off of what's going

2860
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:11,890
to get me back faster.

2861
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:12,790
It's probably gonna be surgery.

2862
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,450
You can't,

2863
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,010
but he's got a thing called the no,

2864
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:15,401
tell him.

2865
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:15,850
Anyways,

2866
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,610
he's got to think about the future because
he's one of the baddest motherfuckers

2867
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:20,980
on the planet and I think you can
get back in action but he's got,

2868
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,670
it's an injury and you've got to let it
heal up instead of like cutting it out.

2869
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,660
Now in Eddie's case,

2870
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,950
Eddie's got a totally different case.

2871
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,030
Any disc is gone,

2872
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:28,864
it's gone.

2873
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:33,790
It's just my lower back is in constant
in a constant state of inflammation.

2874
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,980
It's been like that for maybe eight years.

2875
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,260
I've tried fucking everything.

2876
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,830
He also has finally,

2877
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,570
well finally got my Mri.

2878
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:43,990
People kept saying get an Mri
and I tried all everything,

2879
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,030
fucking chiropractor,

2880
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:46,864
all this shit,

2881
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:47,770
acupuncture.

2882
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:48,940
And uh,

2883
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,600
finally I got an MRI and Mri shows.

2884
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:56,200
I mean any fool can see there
is no distance and bone to bone.

2885
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:56,780
I know you,

2886
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,200
you,

2887
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,340
you are in a constant state
of inflammation cause I
would stop working out.

2888
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,710
Once I started having
back spasms in my back,

2889
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:04,810
felt like it was just going
to completely cut out.

2890
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,520
I stopped working out altogether and in
two months I still felt like I did dead

2891
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:10,930
lifts the fucking day before.

2892
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,260
Well,

2893
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,090
Miranda's back probably think great.

2894
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:14,960
He doesn't it these 37 yeah,

2895
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:15,530
I started,

2896
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:16,271
I have no idea.

2897
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,380
I thought he was a young dude.

2898
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:17,861
No,

2899
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:20,890
I think he was 35 when he was
on the ultimate fighter for him.

2900
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:21,201
Yeah,

2901
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:21,360
no,

2902
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,630
he's a stud and,

2903
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:23,464
but you know,

2904
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,500
hormonally the thing is
when you get to be that age,

2905
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,221
it's like you're,

2906
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:31,570
you're dealing with a reduced level of
testosterone unless you're like super

2907
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,310
vittores saying pre super on point with
your diet soup trunk point with your

2908
01:16:36,311 --> 01:16:37,090
rest.

2909
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,720
Super on point with consumption
of saturated fats and cholesterol.

2910
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,740
That's very important.

2911
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:44,710
If you want to have a natural
testosterone production,

2912
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,000
and this is something that I really get
pissed off when people start talking

2913
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:50,590
about the dangers of saturated fats.

2914
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:51,330
Like you're,

2915
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:51,690
you're,

2916
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,190
you're preaching some outdated nonsense,

2917
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:58,030
some nonscientific bullshit that
people have said and they've said it to

2918
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,490
demonize meat consumption.

2919
01:16:59,491 --> 01:17:00,040
It's right.

2920
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,150
And meat consumption.

2921
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:04,390
Look who scientifically it's not bad.

2922
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,550
What's bad is ethically and we,

2923
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:09,530
I think we all agree that
factory farming's bad ethically,

2924
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:09,980
but when

2925
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,620
it comes to like scientific conceit,

2926
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,493
consumption,

2927
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,280
saturated fats are super important
for testosterone production.

2928
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,410
Super Important for brain function.

2929
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,640
Cholesterol,

2930
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,830
not just cholesterol produced by the body,

2931
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:23,240
but dietary cholesterol,

2932
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,770
which by the way apparently barely
moves the needle on blood lipids.

2933
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:28,250
Yeah,

2934
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:29,083
that's a big,

2935
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:30,081
that's right.

2936
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,240
Does the new science new?

2937
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:31,921
Well,

2938
01:17:31,921 --> 01:17:32,181
yeah.

2939
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,130
I mean eating the yolk of the egg is not,

2940
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:36,630
is not going to move the
needle in terms of what you,

2941
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,540
you and that's where most
of the nutrients are.

2942
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:39,350
US.

2943
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,580
I just got five new chickies.

2944
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,620
Um,

2945
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:41,930
I got five,

2946
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:42,670
a little baby chicks.

2947
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,030
It's,

2948
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,370
where do you get from the other chickens?

2949
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:47,650
You had a little farm and ever seen here?

2950
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:48,513
Old Chicken?

2951
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:48,770
No,

2952
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:48,891
no.

2953
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:49,400
I don't eat them.

2954
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:49,650
No,

2955
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,483
no,

2956
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:51,620
no other pets.

2957
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,370
They're like pets.

2958
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,900
We've put them out here to
play with them and stuff.

2959
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,020
I remember one thing
about factories and shit.

2960
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,441
Oh yeah.

2961
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:58,550
There's no way we can't eat.

2962
01:17:58,551 --> 01:17:59,360
You can't even,

2963
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,193
they've died.

2964
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:00,860
They've died.

2965
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,310
We don't eat them shot.

2966
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:02,781
No,

2967
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:03,210
I don't even know.

2968
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:03,770
Wow.

2969
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:04,603
Now they're pets.

2970
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,430
Amazing.

2971
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,770
While I can be nice there,

2972
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:10,280
patty mandated standards
like about like her own food,

2973
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:11,920
chickens,

2974
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,640
you raise them to eat 'em to do it.

2975
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:16,300
Like I thought that was the
ethical way and he's going,

2976
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:16,850
shit,

2977
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,050
I hardly ever eat chicken.

2978
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:18,963
You're using them.

2979
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,570
But I wouldn't,

2980
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,120
I wouldn't eat them because we have
a different kind of relationship.

2981
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:26,330
The relationship that I have with them
is that they're egg layers and there are

2982
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:29,970
little friends like we go in there and
my daughter picks them up so they still

2983
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,300
pay him off from personalities?

2984
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,180
No,

2985
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,250
they have different personalities.

2986
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:37,940
He was there like one of them was really
smart and she knows when you actually

2987
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:38,870
my dog killed that one,

2988
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,240
but we had one that was
really smart and she would uh,

2989
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,111
pick up the,

2990
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:42,171
uh,

2991
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:43,340
the dog got in the chicken coop.

2992
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:43,491
Man.

2993
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:44,031
It's so funny.

2994
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:44,950
Like in the Fox,

2995
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:45,793
in the chicken coop.

2996
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:46,640
Smart with time.

2997
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,280
Unfortunately the smart one
wanted to have the lowest perch.

2998
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,360
I guess she wasn't that sports.

2999
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,513
Yeah,

3000
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,750
it was a smart one.

3001
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:54,500
Yeah.

3002
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,260
She knew to follow me around and uh,

3003
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:01,370
like she knew that if anybody picked up
rocks that like my wife would like lift

3004
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:03,470
up rocks and she would go
into that and get the bugs.

3005
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,130
She knew she,

3006
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,430
she followed you around waiting for
you to pick up rocks for smart little

3007
01:19:07,431 --> 01:19:09,470
chicken too stupid.

3008
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,770
You kind of understand a little
bit in my obsession with my bunny.

3009
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:13,893
Oh No,

3010
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,110
I totally understand.

3011
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:18,950
People thought it was not as I had a
bunny and I was obsessed with that man.

3012
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:19,220
That was,

3013
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,690
I fell in love with it.

3014
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,261
Dude.

3015
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:25,910
I was fucking 41 41 in level of
rabbit in love with the bunny dude.

3016
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:26,930
I was in love with it.

3017
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:28,900
I was,

3018
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,820
oh Kamozi elbow Sun Kamozi tagged him.

3019
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,980
Dude was straight left hand when,

3020
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:34,201
when,

3021
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:34,341
uh,

3022
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:37,320
I was doing the show and
that one of the guys who,

3023
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:39,860
that second id had a,

3024
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,840
an African gray parrot,

3025
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:44,720
I think there was a cockatoo
and he had it for 17 years.

3026
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,420
Oh my God.

3027
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,300
And his wife got an argument.

3028
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,160
The para was on the ground.

3029
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:51,590
He stepped on the parrot and killed it.

3030
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,720
After 17 years,

3031
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:54,410
man.

3032
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:58,730
And he came and I had macaws so I knew
what he's got and he came to work and he

3033
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:00,560
was all bunched up and my friend was like,

3034
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,670
it's a fucking burn.

3035
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:02,240
I got dude,

3036
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,080
it's not just a bird,

3037
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:03,690
Bro.

3038
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:04,880
They're really smart.

3039
01:20:04,881 --> 01:20:09,150
And it was his best friend stepped
this wall arguing with his wife.

3040
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:09,771
He's like,

3041
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:10,320
you bitch.

3042
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,100
And another thing I say,

3043
01:20:12,101 --> 01:20:16,350
it's a God know what the fuck did
you make me do you make 17 years.

3044
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:16,680
He met,

3045
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,300
he had the bird way before he met her.

3046
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,670
He blamed her Kamozi scramble,

3047
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:21,061
scramble,

3048
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:21,511
hips out,

3049
01:20:21,511 --> 01:20:21,931
hips out,

3050
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:22,321
hips out.

3051
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,460
Get that fucking little lingo.

3052
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,660
I'll be carefully from the box,

3053
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:31,950
from the bar because this might
be an improvisational knee bar.

3054
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:35,150
Get out of there now that everybody

3055
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,010
is a purple belt.

3056
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:39,240
50 50 there you go.

3057
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:39,451
Yeah,

3058
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:40,284
it really is.

3059
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:40,651
It is,

3060
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:40,950
right?

3061
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,370
Yeah.

3062
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,630
This is like his defense.

3063
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:45,510
The defense on the one that,

3064
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:48,240
I mean it is in terms of
nothing's going to happen.

3065
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:48,931
No.

3066
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:50,540
Kamozi Kamozi got some.

3067
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,540
He's trying to set him out.

3068
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,261
He got something.

3069
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:52,981
If he wants it,

3070
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:54,560
he'd fucking definitely it.

3071
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,100
If he knows what he's doing.

3072
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,551
He's got,

3073
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:56,960
he does.

3074
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,780
Yes a lot.

3075
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,190
I don't know if you're gay tone and yeah,

3076
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:00,024
he's going to be fine.

3077
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:01,853
That's interesting.

3078
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,430
How hard are those elbows
to the thigh from that?

3079
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:06,810
How much does that suck?

3080
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:07,700
No one ever.

3081
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:11,220
I've known I've never had it done cause
you would think that a guy who's got

3082
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:14,980
really good elbows could seriously
fuck your leg up like this here.

3083
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,253
You see what I'm saying?

3084
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:20,130
Like Miranda is like got some serious
elbows and I'm watching him and I'm like I

3085
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:22,050
bet this guy can fuck your legs up.

3086
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:27,450
The this is interesting cause cause come
along and have a question like this.

3087
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:28,940
Exactly.

3088
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,773
He could,

3089
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,570
he could release that body locking

3090
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,880
the body launch rare is a week of
moseys punching him in the face from the

3091
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,123
fucking

3092
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,500
oh you go for leg locks.

3093
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:44,311
Guy's going to punch.

3094
01:21:44,311 --> 01:21:44,700
You.

3095
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:49,050
Rarely do people say get a leg lock
position but instead of finishing them

3096
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,480
because Kamozi isn't
an offensive position,

3097
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,440
he could go after that.

3098
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,020
He'll fucking thing that's going on.

3099
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:55,331
He's,

3100
01:21:55,331 --> 01:21:55,591
he's,

3101
01:21:55,591 --> 01:21:56,940
he's punching the guy back.

3102
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,220
What's going on is Miranda backwards.

3103
01:21:59,221 --> 01:21:59,311
He,

3104
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:00,061
this was going on.

3105
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:01,140
Miranda's trapped.

3106
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,990
Kamozi can move his body forward and back.

3107
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,160
Where's Miranda can't.

3108
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:05,321
Oh,

3109
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:05,801
now come on.

3110
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:07,880
And he's trying to lock it in and he's Oh,

3111
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,210
times out puzzles.

3112
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:10,170
He hit him with some hard,

3113
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:10,930
right.

3114
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,150
The rest are going to score that.

3115
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:12,451
Well,

3116
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:13,284
you should

3117
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,271
give that rounded.

3118
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:15,931
Kamozi well,

3119
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:16,711
not just that,

3120
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:17,544
that position,

3121
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,350
even though Miranda's above him,

3122
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:22,770
you have to understand who's close to
getting something done and who's being

3123
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,550
more effective.

3124
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,240
Kamozi had a,

3125
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,021
he had a heel,

3126
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:27,810
he hit a potential him and then he
also punched him in the face of the big

3127
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:28,051
things,

3128
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:29,010
the punches in the face.

3129
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,960
Even though Miranda's on top.

3130
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,000
Kamozi is tagging him
with that right hand.

3131
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,210
Kamozi also made that position happen.

3132
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:37,660
He wasn't put on Bob exactly,

3133
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,280
exactly.

3134
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,130
Which is a big day.

3135
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,623
There's a,

3136
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,280
a new level of leg lock game.

3137
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:46,640
The John Danaher put together that,

3138
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,460
you know,

3139
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,260
um,

3140
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:48,871
a very,

3141
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:50,850
very important part of Jujitsu right now.

3142
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,770
And 10 planets all over it,

3143
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:53,000
man.

3144
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,161
We,

3145
01:22:53,161 --> 01:22:57,030
we've taken the leg lock game to the
next fucking level within ourselves.

3146
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,220
You don't see a lot of it in the UFC.

3147
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:00,190
Now let's come on.

3148
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,530
Ryan Hall.

3149
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:04,150
Yeah.

3150
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:04,600
Ultimate.

3151
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,440
Ultimately Francisco

3152
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,830
say that's a shit.

3153
01:23:07,831 --> 01:23:11,950
One thing that you're going to see that's
different is leg lock battles against

3154
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:12,784
the cage.

3155
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,210
There's a whole different thing.

3156
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,970
There's going to damn rash
guards and leg lock battles.

3157
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,250
Super good point.

3158
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:19,031
No,

3159
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:19,211
Eddie,

3160
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:21,220
that's a super good point
because they can't go anywhere.

3161
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:23,200
I'm telling you about the future and
you're sitting here talking about the

3162
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:24,034
president.

3163
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,053
Hey

3164
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:28,960
Miranda Ravo Miranda's

3165
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,770
got some nasty smooth kickbox.

3166
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:31,560
Oh by the way,

3167
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:32,241
look at that leg.

3168
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:33,380
Look at that inside me.

3169
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:33,711
Well,

3170
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:34,810
the inside leg kick he's,

3171
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:35,280
he's doing,

3172
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,130
he's attacking the knee itself.

3173
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,970
May last three strikes have gone
like right on the two skinny.

3174
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,350
He looks like he's got skinny knees there.

3175
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,730
Kamasi is made out of iron.

3176
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:44,960
Fucking kid's a stud.

3177
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,010
He's iron man.

3178
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:47,080
Nobody's needs are your needs.

3179
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:47,990
And I made for sports.

3180
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:48,740
How about that?

3181
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:49,760
Go ahead and kick the knee.

3182
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,761
That's all bone.

3183
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:51,230
So well.

3184
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:54,820
Moran has been slamming his Shin into the
outside and the inside of that nature.

3185
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:55,760
Ouch.

3186
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,720
The mushy parts.

3187
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:56,991
Yeah,

3188
01:23:56,991 --> 01:23:57,920
he's definitely a,

3189
01:23:57,921 --> 01:23:58,754
it looks a little

3190
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:02,540
inside Ne.

3191
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,151
Yeah,

3192
01:24:03,151 --> 01:24:04,640
but why is that one okay?

3193
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:07,520
If people that are upset
about attacking the knee,

3194
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:09,260
that one is almost as devastating,

3195
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:11,180
especially the outside low kick.

3196
01:24:11,181 --> 01:24:12,440
Like Ernesto who style.

3197
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,430
By the way,

3198
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,453
I've flipped flopped.

3199
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,160
I'm for stopping.

3200
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:26,120
I thought about what you're saying this
whole time where you were saying this

3201
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:27,774
whole time.

3202
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,490
You know what?

3203
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,330
Oh

3204
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:34,951
Shit,

3205
01:24:34,951 --> 01:24:35,970
into my gym again.

3206
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,980
Kamozi on Todd's fucking leg kicks.

3207
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,780
Are they going to walk
with the grandchildren?

3208
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,740
People don't think about,

3209
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,593
they never think of Google.

3210
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,460
Eddie Miranda's got a maze
to get to his fucking buy.

3211
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:45,870
A fucking ivory handled can.

3212
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,130
Looking at Miranda's left leg.

3213
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:48,420
It's amazing to get to his dick.

3214
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,200
You go in and you've
got to follow the law.

3215
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,640
Follow the bread crumbs.

3216
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,760
It's the grandfather clock maids.

3217
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,011
There's amazing.

3218
01:24:58,011 --> 01:24:58,940
I was left this.

3219
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,130
I'm saying that a Brazilian accent.

3220
01:25:01,131 --> 01:25:05,910
It's great when a short girl from
my knee amass all the way to my,

3221
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,500
all the way around just going north.

3222
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:10,380
You find it way.

3223
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,370
There's no cheese,

3224
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,203
cheeses,

3225
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:22,120
openly gay play by play
commentator commentate this fight,

3226
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,340
a Brazilian Brazilian,

3227
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:27,510
this guy's heart

3228
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,373
strong.

3229
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,730
The mass

3230
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,953
oil

3231
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:39,590
oil.

3232
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,840
It's no,

3233
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,673
I have questions

3234
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,500
I'll be answering you just um,

3235
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:46,321
it's just sweat.

3236
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:46,681
It's not,

3237
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:50,010
it's not an oil sweat for
debt for the body on body.

3238
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,120
They're just working out
really hard in your body.

3239
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,970
Your body heats up and um,

3240
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,690
hit hit all the head here.

3241
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:59,200
Yeah.

3242
01:25:59,200 --> 01:25:59,491
Why,

3243
01:25:59,491 --> 01:26:01,320
why are they are so strong?

3244
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:03,080
Because they're,

3245
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,310
they're fighting

3246
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,761
other men.

3247
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,720
They have to be strong.

3248
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,350
Otherwise you get your
ass kicked and you know,

3249
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,060
you want to protect your
joints and stuff sometimes,

3250
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,570
you know,

3251
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:12,450
it's ridiculous.

3252
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,090
Come up.

3253
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:13,923
I don't know.

3254
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:14,991
Well,

3255
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:15,261
you know,

3256
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:15,710
the closer,

3257
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,461
I'm pretty tight.

3258
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:20,420
They've got quality Reebok gear
on here and cops and stuff.

3259
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,380
Everything's fine.

3260
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,610
You don't have to worry about that.

3261
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,473
Okay.

3262
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:24,770
You already smelling good.

3263
01:26:24,771 --> 01:26:25,440
You are.

3264
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,120
Judy will shower all day and I
just got back from bear hunt,

3265
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:32,090
smell like bear and I smell
and I like the forest.

3266
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:37,160
Vito Miranda cut over the left eye.

3267
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,091
Joey what?

3268
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:40,720
Chris most Wellman Kamozi
working animals ground.

3269
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:41,540
Well you know,

3270
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,230
you,

3271
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,980
you know as well as anybody that the gaps
in grappling are the hardest to close

3272
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:46,700
for some reason mind,

3273
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:46,911
you know,

3274
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:47,744
not the hardest,

3275
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,041
the hardest.

3276
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:49,670
Every,

3277
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:51,290
every gap is a hard gap to close.

3278
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:51,800
Right?

3279
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,760
You say striking but not necessarily in
the case of like a guy like Damien Maia

3280
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,770
to a guy who was a good
high school wrestler,

3281
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,140
you're never closing that
gap and your lifetime.

3282
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:03,500
Like you're going to have to become
obsessed with Jujitsu and live on the mats

3283
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:06,080
for the next 10 years to
even get in his neighborhood.

3284
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:06,771
That's a good point.

3285
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:07,604
Cause there's got like,

3286
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,910
like Alistair Overeem
who's just look at this,

3287
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,360
Ben Rothwell for ratio for doom
added the tool three in Cleveland,

3288
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,940
googly Mowgli in that crazy that uh,

3289
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,160
I liked that fight and you got Steve
Bay over him as the main event.

3290
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:23,540
I like that fight too.

3291
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,660
So why is there not an
automatic rematch for,

3292
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:28,310
for Steve Bay?

3293
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,110
Everybody doesn't get
an automatic reminder.

3294
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:30,480
You do.

3295
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,313
It has to be,

3296
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:31,970
but I mean,

3297
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:35,320
I don't know why he doesn't do that
cause it was a Kia that was in his,

3298
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:37,190
a lot of people waiting
in line like over him.

3299
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:38,180
I want to see the Overeem.

3300
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,980
I want to see the Overeem steep a fight.

3301
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:44,981
As much as I want to see any fight in
the UFC other than the cane and VRE doom

3302
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:45,620
rematch,

3303
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,060
I want to see Cain for doom,

3304
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:47,894
sea level

3305
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,710
Kane.

3306
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,600
I want to see Cain in great shape.

3307
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:55,760
I think I still maintained that.

3308
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:56,780
I've seen like again,

3309
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:59,990
it's just coming to movements
and what you see inside fights.

3310
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,041
I think Kane,

3311
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:03,410
like in the second fight
with junior dos Santos,

3312
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:08,540
I think that is right up there in my
eyes with faders fight with cro cop where

3313
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:13,230
you just seeing a a mauling by a better
animal against an animal in his prime or

3314
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,480
the best game we've ever seen in that.

3315
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,000
I really would.

3316
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,910
I really would have wanted more than
anything else in the history of the

3317
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:24,170
heavyweight division is that cane
versus that fade or fade or versus cro?

3318
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:26,040
Cop vs Cain junior too.

3319
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:26,780
That's sick.

3320
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,470
That would be the ultimate who's the
greatest heavyweight of all time because

3321
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:32,630
right now then it just
becomes speculation.

3322
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:33,351
You know,

3323
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:37,610
after Cain gets like a back injury
and two knee surgeries and shoulder

3324
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:38,091
surgeries,

3325
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:38,924
you got to go.

3326
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:40,850
How much of him does he have left?

3327
01:28:40,851 --> 01:28:41,031
I mean,

3328
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:41,930
how much are we seeing?

3329
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:44,690
Are we seeing the same came
that fought junior dos Santos?

3330
01:28:45,010 --> 01:28:47,070
Are we seeing the same cane that uh,

3331
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,660
you know,

3332
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:51,140
ran through guys on the way up to the
title of the ran through Rothwell.

3333
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:53,720
I don't know if we are with
specially with his style.

3334
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:53,970
Yeah.

3335
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,440
Style.

3336
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,230
Just break everything including himself.

3337
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,000
Bull dog training,

3338
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,200
mental toughness,

3339
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,250
ferocious born

3340
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,160
to fight and the body just
can't keep up with the mind.

3341
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,113
Yeah.

3342
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,680
So to me those are the two does,

3343
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:08,310
that's number one.

3344
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,701
Number two.

3345
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:13,701
But then Cain and bull and fade
or both submitted by Verdugo.

3346
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:14,993
That's right.

3347
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:19,350
Both of them for dumb submitted the three
greatest heavyweight talk to you for

3348
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:20,011
dooms the grace.

3349
01:29:20,011 --> 01:29:20,420
Have we had look,

3350
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:20,751
could are,

3351
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:21,371
you really can't.

3352
01:29:21,371 --> 01:29:23,040
It could be Steve Bay.

3353
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:27,520
Just shut the fucking show off so
you can't argue that you still can.

3354
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,950
You can't base it off one fight.

3355
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:29,590
Right?

3356
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:30,120
The product,

3357
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:35,120
you can argue it and also Verdomme
realistically is in his late thirties and

3358
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:36,660
clean.

3359
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,500
What's going on over here?

3360
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:38,334
Why did they stop?

3361
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,410
Cut His cut.

3362
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,471
That's a bad one.

3363
01:29:41,471 --> 01:29:42,304
Above the eye.

3364
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:42,690
Is that,

3365
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:43,860
but I'm saying it's thick.

3366
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,743
He's going to be fine.

3367
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:46,351
Oh yeah.

3368
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:47,184
It looks nasty.

3369
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:47,641
Yeah.

3370
01:29:47,641 --> 01:29:48,760
Just don't worry about it,

3371
01:29:48,761 --> 01:29:49,200
doctor.

3372
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,410
Don't take us as doc.

3373
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:51,180
Smile.

3374
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,013
Smile.

3375
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,093
That doctors,

3376
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,590
that motherfucker is from Vegas,

3377
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:56,270
he's not letting that.

3378
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:57,730
He says he can dive it

3379
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:00,320
is,

3380
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,170
I was falling off.

3381
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:03,560
Now he's not saying that.

3382
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:07,050
I'm just going to stop that kind of shit.

3383
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,730
Gotta be disgusting.

3384
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:09,690
Like the crowds got to go.

3385
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,460
Shit like your,

3386
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,630
your ears kind of fall off cozy.

3387
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:16,650
Kamasi's kickboxing's very good man.

3388
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,550
Very good.

3389
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,900
I'm really impressed.

3390
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,930
It's like his kickboxing
has gotten smoother.

3391
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:25,370
It's timing has gotten better and a must
be because he was really concentrating

3392
01:30:25,371 --> 01:30:28,170
it and knowing it was going to
fight Miranda and I think that,

3393
01:30:28,171 --> 01:30:32,190
and then he also went to these coasts
training with Ray Longo and why going back

3394
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:34,660
to Denver re log in is Chad man wait long.

3395
01:30:34,661 --> 01:30:35,910
It was an excellent coach.

3396
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:39,940
Oh look at this Kamozi with the tig tone.

3397
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,440
Commodes he's such a good dude too,

3398
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:43,740
man.

3399
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:44,460
Great Guy.

3400
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:45,271
Both guys are.

3401
01:30:45,271 --> 01:30:46,950
Miranda is a really nice guy too.

3402
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,330
He's been fighting forever,

3403
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:48,631
man.

3404
01:30:48,631 --> 01:30:49,530
On the Denver scene.

3405
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:52,080
He was kind of like the first guy
was just doing the damn thing.

3406
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:52,320
Yeah,

3407
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:52,891
and again,

3408
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:54,870
not particularly physically gifted,

3409
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:58,440
just fucking smart optimus
Kamozi I thought he was
younger than that while he's

3410
01:30:58,441 --> 01:30:58,861
been around.

3411
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:02,880
I think he's 34 34 four 35 but
he has a shitload of experience.

3412
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,501
Powerful sock.

3413
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:04,334
I tried hair.

3414
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,980
It's got sharp hair.

3415
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,470
The Denver Water and
veto Miranda on his back.

3416
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,240
This is not good for the third round.

3417
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,460
No made on the Great Jersey.

3418
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,540
Kamozi Kamozi clenched down,

3419
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:20,580
cover his face,

3420
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:23,340
stop debrief adding cover his face.

3421
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:28,341
Go for hidden alarm comes from here
and compress saddle leather brass.

3422
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,490
Congratulations.

3423
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:31,320
That's a lot of look at his skin.

3424
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:34,260
He gets exfoliated with
a lot of geeky training.

3425
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,000
Are you doing any facial stuff?

3426
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:36,990
I got to get a facial.

3427
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:37,851
Got a g training.

3428
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:40,020
It's going to give myself facials.

3429
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,130
I give myself,

3430
01:31:41,131 --> 01:31:42,480
Eddie has the best skin here.

3431
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,320
Look at his skin.

3432
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:43,980
Beautiful Skin.

3433
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:44,640
Come on.

3434
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,271
What are you talking about?

3435
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:47,220
How old you are and you look
at our fullest mouth is.

3436
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,143
You've had a lot of world.

3437
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:51,550
He had a lot of work done.

3438
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,000
Thank you.

3439
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,481
Thank you.

3440
01:31:54,481 --> 01:31:55,440
If you're serious,

3441
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,810
I know

3442
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
I am.

3443
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:05,200
Maybe you're just being gay with
me cause you want to be funny.

3444
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:06,800
Well both but you do look good.

3445
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:08,980
Well thank you.

3446
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:09,281
Randy.

3447
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:10,900
Got Back to his feet and need of the body.

3448
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,040
He's exhausted.

3449
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:13,480
Turned on as well.

3450
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:17,200
That helps your hands into the size and
then you could probably do anything.

3451
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:18,034
Fine.

3452
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,233
Oh

3453
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,810
you better not hold me down.

3454
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,120
Jesus Miranda taking down.

3455
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:26,900
Still throwing head Kish.

3456
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:27,221
Shoot.

3457
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,500
Kamozi Miranda's going for it man.

3458
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:31,810
Oh Shit.

3459
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,183
Wrestle him.

3460
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,870
This is a frantic fight.

3461
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,050
And that's another thing.

3462
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:39,730
Here's another thing to
take into consideration.

3463
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,690
Time limits,

3464
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,760
time limits for rounds.

3465
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,930
They impose a different style of fighting
because sometimes sense of urgency.

3466
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,650
Yeah,

3467
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,470
better,

3468
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,390
better entertainment.

3469
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:53,290
But are we sacrificing
reality for entertainment?

3470
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:54,400
I don't know if I'd make better fights.

3471
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:54,841
I think you,

3472
01:32:54,841 --> 01:32:57,640
you got to see under barriers.

3473
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:57,791
No,

3474
01:32:57,791 --> 01:32:58,061
under,

3475
01:32:58,061 --> 01:32:58,490
under,

3476
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:58,720
uh,

3477
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,980
confines and boundaries.

3478
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:03,430
You can still have the same kind of
excitement or maybe more excitement.

3479
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:04,190
Listen to me,

3480
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:08,050
but if the goal is fields
one 30 minute round,

3481
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,191
hey,

3482
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:11,170
come on dude,

3483
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,813
this is too much.

3484
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:13,590
No,

3485
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,423
I'm a,

3486
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,240
I'm a visionary.

3487
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,653
A football field.

3488
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,010
You throw like trash
cans in there and hook.

3489
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,291
No,

3490
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:21,501
no,

3491
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:21,720
no,

3492
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,060
no.

3493
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,070
Homes now looking for reality.

3494
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:26,770
I'm looking for the least
amount of variables possible.

3495
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:28,290
And you can pick the weaponry.

3496
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:32,160
It's like an alley.

3497
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:34,360
The stage is an alley and
that's the fight is done.

3498
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,021
No one,

3499
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:35,854
in reality,

3500
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:39,340
he knows in reality trains for
a street fight for six weeks.

3501
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,170
We're not talking about reality,

3502
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,690
not talking about the purest
form of the competition.

3503
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:47,380
Did Frank Mir on our podcast
said that he would never,

3504
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:51,550
he just recently started warming up
because he considered a fight in the

3505
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:52,240
octagon.

3506
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:56,230
He was looking at it as practice
for a real street fight.

3507
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:58,060
Frank Mir is a maniac.

3508
01:33:58,061 --> 01:34:00,490
Walks down like an armed fucking weapon.

3509
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,120
Yes.

3510
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:01,953
Straight up.

3511
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:02,800
He's a maniac.

3512
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,850
Very ready for the,

3513
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:04,810
for the Zombie apocalypse.

3514
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,930
He's one concussion away
from doing some crazy shit.

3515
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:08,751
I think all of us,

3516
01:34:08,751 --> 01:34:10,050
the be money for the gun store.

3517
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:10,691
Frank would be like,

3518
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:11,381
I've been ready.

3519
01:34:11,381 --> 01:34:12,790
I've been waiting for
this moment my whole life.

3520
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:15,400
Great guys.

3521
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:20,250
The best way to capital Kevin and that's
that and I do like as soon as I love

3522
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:21,123
him.

3523
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,270
He's a great guy.

3524
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,050
I love framework.

3525
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:24,610
Can't have 60 guns on you though.

3526
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,060
Yes,

3527
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:25,970
you can flip right.

3528
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,000
Even one is,

3529
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,600
oh look at this Kamozi with the
uppercut and Miranda tries a wheel kick.

3530
01:34:31,601 --> 01:34:32,620
This is a crazy fight.

3531
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:33,280
We're missing it.

3532
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,830
Frank Mir was the most
dangerous man on the planet.

3533
01:34:34,831 --> 01:34:36,130
I'd be going nuts right now.

3534
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,030
Yeah.

3535
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:40,390
One thing I really worry about that all
the years of yelling in the UFC have

3536
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:43,570
strengthened my vocal chords and my
vocal cords will get out of shape if I

3537
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:47,900
stopped coming to me now cause you're
going to stand or will they blow like

3538
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:48,160
that?

3539
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:48,850
I Dunno,

3540
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,540
but the yelling is I'll fucking
100% natural when when fights,

3541
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,850
I don't even realize I'm doing
it until it's out of my mouth.

3542
01:34:54,851 --> 01:34:56,960
So like you've never lost
your passion for the,

3543
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:58,220
I dunno

3544
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,053
how it is done.

3545
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:00,043
Just keep screaming,

3546
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,420
creaming.

3547
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:01,340
Yet even just,

3548
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,690
I don't know how many
times I've said this,

3549
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:06,170
but just yesterday I did a
podcast with nick the tooth.

3550
01:35:06,171 --> 01:35:08,300
I did his podcast and I love that dude.

3551
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:09,283
Good guy.

3552
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,700
Anytime you come up,

3553
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:11,450
what's happening?

3554
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:13,100
I got more wire to my mom come on.

3555
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:15,450
Used to I,

3556
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,810
I lay it on thick like for 10 minutes.

3557
01:35:17,811 --> 01:35:22,520
Like how much better of a commentator
you are than anybody out there.

3558
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:23,960
I mean,

3559
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,190
no one even fucking comes close.

3560
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:26,210
Brian stands good.

3561
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:27,080
Kenny Florian is good.

3562
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:30,050
I like John but there
ain't no Rogan out there.

3563
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,070
That's very nice.

3564
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:32,730
You can't throw it down like you.

3565
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:35,600
You can't know cause he has
personality and you start talking.

3566
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:36,530
When you guys started talking,

3567
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,670
talking about UFC,

3568
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:43,180
I feel like I'm a fucking beyond
a lower than the amateur marching.

3569
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:46,910
I just let you guys talk a holy Shit.

3570
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:49,370
You guys retain a lot more than I do.

3571
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:52,530
You have seen in my head I don't.

3572
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:57,550
I don't have any kickboxing and like a
motherfucker when all you watching this

3573
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:00,674
shit,

3574
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,860
how are you watching game of Thrones

3575
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,570
doing podcast three times a week.

3576
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:13,250
You got a family and kids you
spend a lot of quality time with.

3577
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:14,890
He's part of the Illuminati.

3578
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,321
Fuck.

3579
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:18,900
Are you watching kickboxing
and boxing the robot because

3580
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,280
here's how I look at it.

3581
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:24,240
Do you sleep?

3582
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,170
He has some supplement.

3583
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,460
We don't know about five.

3584
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:31,640
The option of sleeping eight hours a
night and not watching fights or sleeping

3585
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:33,260
six hours a night and watching fights.

3586
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,760
I take the six hours.

3587
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,410
I watched two hours of sleep.

3588
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:40,280
Is that what you do
before you go to sleep?

3589
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:41,000
All the time.

3590
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,990
Holy Shit.

3591
01:36:41,991 --> 01:36:43,290
I never do that all the time.

3592
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,690
I have everything.

3593
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,350
Everything's conspiracy
theory documentaries.

3594
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,153
That's fucking,

3595
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,260
that's what you're paranoid and I'm happy

3596
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:56,570
you're out there killing

3597
01:36:59,830 --> 01:37:00,663
gigantic

3598
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:07,190
ethical meat acquisition,

3599
01:37:07,191 --> 01:37:08,024
sir.

3600
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:09,970
I'm not cookies.

3601
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:13,970
Two hours of fights every night.

3602
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:15,500
No wonder he's killing bears.

3603
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,133
Now.

3604
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,010
I always want to watch
a smaller organizations.

3605
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,030
Fuck a wrestler,

3606
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,460
a fucking bear wrestler

3607
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,500
when they

3608
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:34,610
barely 27 book Kim.

3609
01:37:34,611 --> 01:37:35,680
I want the real bare.

3610
01:37:35,681 --> 01:37:36,650
It's not even close.

3611
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,580
Kamozi powerful.

3612
01:37:40,581 --> 01:37:41,510
Kamozi great.

3613
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:42,310
Fucking win.

3614
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:43,143
Very nice.

3615
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:45,230
Um,

3616
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:46,063
you know what man,

3617
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:47,763
I'm attracted to.

3618
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,180
Should I just go with
what I'm attracted to?

3619
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:51,020
Holy Shit.

3620
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,351
I love,

3621
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:54,050
I love watching Moitai they'd been
watching a lot of Moitai lately.

3622
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:55,070
He gone waves though.

3623
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,710
I go in waves and then
I had to do that boxing.

3624
01:37:58,711 --> 01:38:01,440
So for like two weeks I
was balls deep and boxing,

3625
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,790
which is so much fun,

3626
01:38:02,791 --> 01:38:02,941
man.

3627
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:05,730
But then I'll take a
break from fighting that.

3628
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:06,990
I'm balls deep in cars.

3629
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:07,411
Well Dude,

3630
01:38:07,411 --> 01:38:08,244
I know I'm go,

3631
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:08,640
go,

3632
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:08,860
go.

3633
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:13,500
Days watching hours and
hours of archery every day.

3634
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,140
I wish hour an hour shooting.

3635
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:18,540
Hey Sir.

3636
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,280
That's weird.

3637
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,150
That's fucking weird.

3638
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,240
It is weird.

3639
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,610
Until you start shooting
things with bows and arrows.

3640
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:27,200
And you realize like you gotta be really
good at archery to kill fucking elk and

3641
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:27,711
you're gonna your will.

3642
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:28,860
You miss with a bear.

3643
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:30,090
It's game over Sun.

3644
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:32,371
Joe Rogan.

3645
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:32,850
Brilliant.

3646
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:37,850
I know you're going to be my fucking
master to get me to Joe Rogan's fucking,

3647
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,190
I'm not doing it for that reason,

3648
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,330
but I know how to do it.

3649
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:46,920
Like I can tell you where animals would
likely be more than most people will be

3650
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:47,754
my leader.

3651
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:52,880
And you listened to hunting podcast
on the winds of Myla for six hours.

3652
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,790
Not,

3653
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:54,001
no,

3654
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:55,710
not just listen to honey podcasts.

3655
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:58,050
You look at my podcast
like all my podcasts,

3656
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:59,460
it's all like antlers.

3657
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,250
All of it is on

3658
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:07,993
your shit.

3659
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,860
Started criticizing the lead.

3660
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,090
The most powerful apocalyptic grew ever.

3661
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:15,720
I'm going to lead them,

3662
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,250
right.

3663
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,710
I'm going to read or write to the
Yellowstone apocalyptic where the fucking

3664
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:21,060
super volcano is going to blow up.

3665
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,130
Like we want to be like
right there when it blows.

3666
01:39:24,030 --> 01:39:24,863
Guys.

3667
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,450
So sorry to interrupt.

3668
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,920
Did you get coated Josie far?

3669
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:29,950
I'm just going to keep,

3670
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:30,451
because you got to,

3671
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:30,781
you know,

3672
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:31,450
if you're going to leave,

3673
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:33,910
you still need some
tightening lots together,

3674
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:34,763
you know what I mean?

3675
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,290
Update you and all that shit.

3676
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:39,220
We need someone to hold pads to any,

3677
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:40,063
any

3678
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:45,643
privates.

3679
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:46,360
Cool.

3680
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,130
Listen,

3681
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,320
here's the good thing is 400 pounds.

3682
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:50,810
If you kill now we all,

3683
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:54,330
we all going to show you got to
commercial freezers back there.

3684
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:55,900
I need to,

3685
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:59,010
I need more flip top dog frozen anymore.

3686
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:00,600
Is it frozen though?

3687
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:00,840
Yeah,

3688
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,330
it's frozen.

3689
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:02,080
Solid.

3690
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:02,430
Yeah.

3691
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:02,821
Oh no,

3692
01:40:02,821 --> 01:40:03,654
the only one eat it.

3693
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:04,440
I might have some.

3694
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:04,980
Um,

3695
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:06,330
do we have any of the elk?

3696
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,360
The summer sausage that's not frozen.

3697
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,480
Gentleman were drinking.

3698
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:12,100
I'll be

3699
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,443
there.

3700
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,420
Just tweeted that.

3701
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,161
What may,

3702
01:40:16,161 --> 01:40:19,500
whether Connor live on
paper view November.

3703
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:21,210
Oh my God.

3704
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:21,751
Check this out.

3705
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:22,581
So serious.

3706
01:40:22,581 --> 01:40:22,920
Yes.

3707
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,491
Check this out.

3708
01:40:23,491 --> 01:40:26,160
Just so I was with the boxing
community this past weekend.

3709
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,121
This is for real.

3710
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:27,780
This is happening.

3711
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:28,620
Investors,

3712
01:40:28,621 --> 01:40:30,600
investors in Mayweather's campus.

3713
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:31,500
When did you find out about it?

3714
01:40:31,501 --> 01:40:32,011
Last night?

3715
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:33,510
Investors and Mayweather's camp.

3716
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,340
They're like really big in this promotion.

3717
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:39,630
Say it's going to happen and probably
November and they don't know shit about

3718
01:40:39,631 --> 01:40:40,230
MMA.

3719
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:40,621
Did I go,

3720
01:40:40,621 --> 01:40:41,520
do you know Conor McGregor?

3721
01:40:41,521 --> 01:40:43,560
I'm like I should slap the
fuck out of both of you.

3722
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,670
Oh my God.

3723
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,470
I think Dannon white.

3724
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,390
Matt Serra and nick the
tooth just wrote a ball.

3725
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:49,291
Yeah,

3726
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:50,150
they did write a bowl.

3727
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:51,720
Dana is a,

3728
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,980
they're going to do stand
up on a Sunday night

3729
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,761
at the laugh factor.

3730
01:40:54,761 --> 01:40:55,331
You're on the show,

3731
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:55,600
right?

3732
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,070
I guess how I couldn't be on it.

3733
01:40:57,071 --> 01:40:57,220
Um,

3734
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:57,980
cause I'm doing shit.

3735
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:58,130
I'm,

3736
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:00,460
I'm ramping up for my
special in a few weeks.

3737
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:00,821
You big.

3738
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:01,290
So uh,

3739
01:41:01,290 --> 01:41:02,290
they want me to come in,

3740
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:03,370
I to do Braya no,

3741
01:41:03,371 --> 01:41:04,021
I'm doing Bray.

3742
01:41:04,021 --> 01:41:04,640
I'm judging him.

3743
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,550
Problem two sold out shows.

3744
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:08,350
I'm coming in on Saturday to help them.

3745
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:11,140
I guess it's a good idea.

3746
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:13,930
You're going to help anybody more than
anybody else is going to throw anybody

3747
01:41:13,931 --> 01:41:15,100
any fucking fake advice.

3748
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:15,960
Why not?

3749
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:16,270
No,

3750
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,103
I'll help both.

3751
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,980
I think I'm mature.

3752
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:19,990
You Jack Him off for me too.

3753
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,340
I would,

3754
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:24,520
I would not want to be in Intel
contest of the Matt Serra.

3755
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:28,930
I think Matt Serra is probably going
to be really good at standup at Dana

3756
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:33,340
White's probably super used to public
speaking and I think nick to tooth does a

3757
01:41:33,341 --> 01:41:35,230
lot of drugs so there
should be a lot of fun.

3758
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,540
Plus nick is like an open minded,

3759
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:38,470
very smart dude.

3760
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:39,460
Definitely smart guy.

3761
01:41:41,270 --> 01:41:42,180
Good photographer.

3762
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,990
He's one of the best guys ever.

3763
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:44,913
He's a sweetheart.

3764
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,103
He's so cool.

3765
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:48,853
He's a sweetheart.

3766
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,140
He's real smart,

3767
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,010
open minded.

3768
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,870
He's a really interesting cat electric.

3769
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:54,580
I'm psyched to help you.

3770
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:55,840
Second high purple belt.

3771
01:41:57,490 --> 01:41:58,480
He's in tremendous shape.

3772
01:41:58,481 --> 01:41:59,980
He's in his forties is my age.

3773
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:01,420
Tremendous shape.

3774
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:03,310
Really careful with his diet.

3775
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,080
He's at tight with half a Mendez.

3776
01:42:05,081 --> 01:42:07,900
They're like Bros and shit late
too that he trains with him.

3777
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:11,140
What is just a nice brothers
are so fucking technical.

3778
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:12,041
God Damn it.

3779
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:15,970
I went on to a Jujitsu ramp page like a
couple months ago and I watched a lot of

3780
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:18,323
phases.

3781
01:42:18,410 --> 01:42:20,200
Watch a lot of a rolling.

3782
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,830
I've watched him roll with um,

3783
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:26,140
it was him or guy who rolled with Jake
shields where they put a video of it

3784
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:26,610
online.

3785
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:28,060
It was half,

3786
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,060
half and half.

3787
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:28,893
It was just,

3788
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:29,490
just,

3789
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:32,560
just impenetrable in
penetrable off his back.

3790
01:42:32,561 --> 01:42:35,500
And then once he swept
Jake and he got his back,

3791
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:35,741
I'm like,

3792
01:42:35,741 --> 01:42:36,760
Jesus Christ,

3793
01:42:36,761 --> 01:42:40,090
you've seen just this
laser satirize shorts,

3794
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,590
scalpels,

3795
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,300
fucking sharpness of technique.

3796
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,700
Fascinating to watch this,

3797
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,200
this like small guy.

3798
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:48,041
Not Small,

3799
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:49,690
but I mean in comparison to Jake,

3800
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:54,420
I mean Jakes probably one 90 and a
pretty strong stout eighties yeah,

3801
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:54,671
yeah.

3802
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:58,450
High one eighties and maybe
Hafez like one 60 right?

3803
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,460
What would you walk around?

3804
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:01,660
Fuck,

3805
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,493
by the way,

3806
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:06,140
he does Abu Dhabi one 45 same James.

3807
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:08,950
So not a big guy.

3808
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:09,813
He's not a big guy.

3809
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,170
Strong black.

3810
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:12,004
A big guy.

3811
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:15,160
Like he have some roles with him
and Andre Galvao world class.

3812
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:17,080
I was like 200 pounds,

3813
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,950
this world class and
us round that off site.

3814
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,870
You can't pass out.

3815
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:25,190
They bought bye bye mom.

3816
01:43:25,191 --> 01:43:25,510
Bye.

3817
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:27,150
They boom by on that Brazilian beef jerky.

3818
01:43:27,151 --> 01:43:27,610
Yeah.

3819
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:27,731
Well,

3820
01:43:27,731 --> 01:43:28,451
you know what man?

3821
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:28,960
This is like,

3822
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,230
there's this strength that you
develop from repetitive technique.

3823
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:33,101
There's like this.

3824
01:43:33,101 --> 01:43:34,750
Like if you look at someone's body,

3825
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:35,470
there's a dude like,

3826
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:36,400
here's a perfect example,

3827
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:37,221
Michael McDonald.

3828
01:43:37,221 --> 01:43:38,054
Do you know that dude?

3829
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:38,230
Uh,

3830
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:38,901
fights in UFC?

3831
01:43:38,901 --> 01:43:39,731
He's 21,

3832
01:43:39,731 --> 01:43:40,750
maybe 22 now.

3833
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,210
Wicked knockout artists,

3834
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:43,571
man.

3835
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:44,170
Wicked.

3836
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:45,280
But if you looked at his body,

3837
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:46,114
you would never know.

3838
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:47,360
But there's a,

3839
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,040
there's a strength in his
ability to execute particular.

3840
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,020
Yeah,

3841
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:52,610
Bang.

3842
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:55,580
He's just got that groove carved in his,

3843
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:58,520
his synapses and when he unleashes shots,

3844
01:43:58,521 --> 01:43:58,881
man,

3845
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:01,820
they just ferocious
bombs row and you know,

3846
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:03,440
like here's a perfect example honey.

3847
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:03,641
Ya,

3848
01:44:03,641 --> 01:44:04,431
Ya honey.

3849
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,630
I is not a big guy,

3850
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,410
but that mother fucker gets your
neck and he's a fucking school.

3851
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:11,133
Same stores.

3852
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,953
These,

3853
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:16,240
they got that squeeze.

3854
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:20,060
Think of Saint George got his dad at
like 600 him fucking hiking up mountains

3855
01:44:20,061 --> 01:44:20,790
with tires.

3856
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:21,770
Easy Jack.

3857
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:24,200
But there's babies strength.

3858
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:25,063
Like there's like,

3859
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:26,860
no,

3860
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:26,970
no,

3861
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:27,140
no,

3862
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:30,810
not compared to like Randy coming toward
Randy couture's gotten timeout going

3863
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:31,400
man.

3864
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:31,900
Fuck you.

3865
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:32,733
Straps

3866
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:35,660
that hold your risk.

3867
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:39,770
I'm going to let you know those young
guys just call him or how'd that,

3868
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:43,550
how'd that all fucking all night
break Sukarno was also 285 pounds.

3869
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:44,601
But I mean,

3870
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:46,150
it's like there's like some,

3871
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:50,390
some ridiculous like grapple strength
that certain do tat for sure.

3872
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:54,950
Shield has a squeeze to be
developing in every choke.

3873
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:57,560
It's not just chicken
to squeeze in one choke.

3874
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:00,740
Marcello Marcel is a perfect example.

3875
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,150
The chrome Gracie from Great Britain,

3876
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,600
the shop has that kind of strength,

3877
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:08,240
but Brendan is also a gorilla,

3878
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:12,530
but there's the thing about crone is
it crone looks physically imposing.

3879
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,110
Like when clone crone doesn't
have a shirt off you go.

3880
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,190
When he has his shirt off,

3881
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:17,060
rather you look at him,

3882
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:17,301
you go,

3883
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:17,421
well,

3884
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:19,790
that kid is obviously doing something.

3885
01:45:19,791 --> 01:45:21,290
He's obviously doing some gymnastics,

3886
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,040
but you think it's like,

3887
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,893
fuck it.

3888
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:25,940
Oh my God.

3889
01:45:25,941 --> 01:45:26,600
Ridiculous.

3890
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:27,640
I saw crone.

3891
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:31,540
There's a video of him doing the shit
on Venice beach where he sourced Sanama

3892
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:36,050
where he's swinging and flying to the
air and catching the next bar and then

3893
01:45:36,051 --> 01:45:38,710
swinging and flying to
the and find that Jamie.

3894
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,220
He's also a dime piece.

3895
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:40,431
Yeah.

3896
01:45:40,431 --> 01:45:41,510
He's also a really good looking guy.

3897
01:45:41,511 --> 01:45:42,800
He's also very smart kid.

3898
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:43,783
Yeah.

3899
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,650
Runs Chrome Academy there in Culver City.

3900
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:47,540
He's very principled.

3901
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:49,093
Why over here?

3902
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:51,650
Take some pretty big heavyweights
and do whatever he wants to.

3903
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:52,011
Okay,

3904
01:45:52,011 --> 01:45:53,810
let's let off the gay stuff buddy.

3905
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:54,560
I'm just saying,

3906
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,310
here's crone.

3907
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:55,791
Here's crow.

3908
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:56,511
Check this shit out.

3909
01:45:56,511 --> 01:45:57,291
Watch this video.

3910
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:58,130
This is in Venice,

3911
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,780
but he's,

3912
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,940
he does this shit on these bars.

3913
01:46:01,941 --> 01:46:02,774
Like look at this.

3914
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:04,210
He's don't worry your soft side.

3915
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:05,511
Why not man?

3916
01:46:05,511 --> 01:46:05,871
You can worry.

3917
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:06,200
Sucks,

3918
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,000
whatever the fuck you
way you want from grace.

3919
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:09,110
Oh Joe Dude.

3920
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:10,470
He is the lineage.

3921
01:46:10,690 --> 01:46:12,980
The greatest fighter in
the history of Jujitsu.

3922
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:14,600
He's the son so he can put your socks.

3923
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,500
He works in gray.

3924
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,800
He could wear those Marvin
Hagler socks from the fucking

3925
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:20,503
the shit.

3926
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:27,230
He's picking this man

3927
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:29,643
who let them out.

3928
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,001
Crohn's.

3929
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:33,030
A bad motherfucker.

3930
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:33,741
You can't wear your stuff.

3931
01:46:33,741 --> 01:46:35,240
He's a bad motherfucker.

3932
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:36,530
Fuck yes.

3933
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,810
His jujitsu.

3934
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:39,110
The best guys ever.

3935
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:40,520
And here's the thing man,

3936
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,890
like his dad is the greatest
of all time for sure.

3937
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:44,180
His Dad is like a legit,

3938
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,200
like,

3939
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,700
like a mystic almost.

3940
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:47,990
His Dad would roll in.

3941
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:48,800
I'll never forget this,

3942
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,130
the room full of the baddest dudes

3943
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,310
on UFC fighters.

3944
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:53,160
The WHO's who of Jujitsu,

3945
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:54,270
he walks in there.

3946
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,740
It was like Blue Fossa

3947
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:57,530
bowed down and shit.

3948
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:58,671
Let me get on a neat,

3949
01:46:58,671 --> 01:46:59,100
the one,

3950
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:04,100
the one thing he has the most high level
Jujitsu players don't have good light

3951
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:08,710
when they're going to MMA
besides a good looks is uh,

3952
01:47:09,070 --> 01:47:09,360
uh,

3953
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:09,840
when you're,

3954
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,780
when you're talking
about just pure Jujitsu,

3955
01:47:11,790 --> 01:47:13,190
whether it's gear Nogi,

3956
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:16,200
the full guard is totally optional.

3957
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:18,510
You don't ever need to
develop a full guard of,

3958
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:19,291
it's just grappling.

3959
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:20,790
If you ever have someone to
full guard and I want to play,

3960
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,040
you open it up and then you start playing,

3961
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:23,400
you know,

3962
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,660
butterfly guard or whatever.

3963
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:25,530
Oh,

3964
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:27,990
full guard is totally optional.

3965
01:47:27,991 --> 01:47:31,320
There's many great jujitsu
players that just said,

3966
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:32,051
fuck plan,

3967
01:47:32,051 --> 01:47:32,881
full guard.

3968
01:47:32,881 --> 01:47:33,870
I'm going to do some other shit.

3969
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:35,760
We're going play open guard della Hiva.

3970
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:38,250
We start opening up and
start swinging around.

3971
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:42,510
Never really engage in this full guard
dimension that's completely optional.

3972
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,710
Geeky or no Gig,

3973
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,341
no gay.

3974
01:47:44,341 --> 01:47:45,450
If you don't want to play full guard,

3975
01:47:45,451 --> 01:47:46,860
if you don't want to develop a full guard,

3976
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:50,770
you don't have to just open up your
fucking legs and then just start planning

3977
01:47:52,850 --> 01:47:53,340
MMA.

3978
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:53,820
I'm sorry.

3979
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:54,780
Let me just finish this real quick.

3980
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:58,620
But in MMA it's the most important guard.

3981
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,753
Full Guard.

3982
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,620
It's the most important.

3983
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:06,000
You have to fucking play full guard when
a guy is trying to smash your fucking

3984
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,140
face and controls.

3985
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:08,490
So now,

3986
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,740
so now you're forced to play a card.

3987
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,000
You didn't have to play in
grappling ever and now an MMA,

3988
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:20,060
but crone is one of those rare
Jujitsu guys that in his grappling,

3989
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,790
his full guard is his main weapon.

3990
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:24,960
So he gets dudes in full guard.

3991
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:25,920
That's his shit.

3992
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:29,490
If he watches geeky
grappling or Nogi grappling,

3993
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:30,930
he wants to get you in full guard.

3994
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,300
His Guillotine is among the best.

3995
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:38,430
That's why he's doing good in MMA because
in MMA he's forced to play a guard

3996
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,860
that he wants to plain rice.

3997
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:40,741
Pardon me,

3998
01:48:40,741 --> 01:48:42,000
in front of a ton of people.

3999
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:42,930
Super embarrassing,

4000
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:43,890
super ambitious.

4001
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:45,900
That's got a real rough considering.

4002
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:46,241
He's like,

4003
01:48:46,241 --> 01:48:51,241
they were clapping 70 may be enrolled
for 25 minutes straight and then we were

4004
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:52,531
like going back forth.

4005
01:48:52,531 --> 01:48:55,770
No one tat know what tap can rate from
animals and then it just came out of

4006
01:48:55,771 --> 01:48:56,400
nowhere.

4007
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,620
It everyone standing up.

4008
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:00,420
I was all embarrassed and
it's beautiful that he got,

4009
01:49:00,421 --> 01:49:00,870
yeah.

4010
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:01,560
Hell yeah.

4011
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,460
You got to appreciate it.

4012
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:03,540
You know you're a gorilla.

4013
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:05,013
Yeah.

4014
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:06,043
Hey,

4015
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:08,840
I'm [inaudible] y'all for sure.

4016
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:10,830
He was even [inaudible] 70
he was smaller than that one.

4017
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:11,600
He submitted me.

4018
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,380
It's,

4019
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,213
it doesn't matter.

4020
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:15,870
One of the most satisfied
baskets in the world ever.

4021
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:20,370
One of the most satisfying aspects of
Jujitsu is that it's truly one of the only

4022
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:22,950
martial arts where a smaller,

4023
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:25,410
more tactical person
can overcome a bigger,

4024
01:49:25,411 --> 01:49:29,190
more powerful person Shankar when
roles in that motherfucker gorilla.

4025
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:32,880
That's a different girl at
[inaudible] so far beyond,

4026
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:35,790
but I guarantee you if he got in there
with Fabrizio over doom and they were

4027
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:37,650
just grappling for Breeshia would tap him.

4028
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:39,440
You know it and I know it correct.

4029
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:42,960
100% for [inaudible] here is going to
tap them and who is bigger for breezy or

4030
01:49:42,961 --> 01:49:43,351
Shane?

4031
01:49:43,351 --> 01:49:44,041
Shane's bigger,

4032
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:45,180
but it doesn't Matte Taller.

4033
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:45,481
There's a,

4034
01:49:45,481 --> 01:49:46,530
but there's a level,

4035
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:50,710
I guess it gets to a certain level
where the technique can overcome massive

4036
01:49:50,711 --> 01:49:51,410
physical as well.

4037
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,243
Pecking order.

4038
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:52,661
Dude.

4039
01:49:52,661 --> 01:49:54,610
It's fucking look our friend Cade,

4040
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:55,720
you know like uh,

4041
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:58,300
Cade is maybe one,

4042
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:03,580
how much does kid way one 35 one maybe
one 35 that motherfucker has put me in

4043
01:50:03,581 --> 01:50:04,390
danger.

4044
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,240
Tanga golf lunch.

4045
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:09,580
At times I'll waste smallest one 35
locked me up and triangles where I'm like,

4046
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,241
Oh shit,

4047
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:14,920
I'm going to have to tap to a dude
who 70 pounds go ahead and rampage.

4048
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:16,571
Okay,

4049
01:50:16,571 --> 01:50:17,321
I could do that.

4050
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:18,011
But he's your friend.

4051
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:18,844
You know it's supposed to do.

4052
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,330
But I mean what I'm saying is that
his technique that some of them,

4053
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,870
like my friend and my friend
Danny is lighter than mean Denny.

4054
01:50:25,871 --> 01:50:27,040
Denny taps me all the time.

4055
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:27,620
If,

4056
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,350
if Denny and I roll right now,

4057
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:30,400
I'm not having rolled in a while,

4058
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,330
but if we were rolling,

4059
01:50:31,331 --> 01:50:32,164
he would always tag me.

4060
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,030
He's better than me.

4061
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:34,570
Cause even though he's smaller than me,

4062
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:35,051
someone's,

4063
01:50:35,051 --> 01:50:36,430
he's just a heavy tech people get,

4064
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,450
they're just better.

4065
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,350
They're just better.

4066
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:43,280
Like Marcello's when I was watching lines
up with your weight has anyone else's

4067
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:45,923
style,

4068
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:49,120
oh try this guys.

4069
01:50:49,121 --> 01:50:50,060
We can't talk over each.

4070
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:50,320
Sorry.

4071
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:55,310
So try this raw mill as any guys were
talking about the nightmare hosted most of

4072
01:50:55,311 --> 01:50:55,581
China.

4073
01:50:55,581 --> 01:50:56,430
The two tests might change.

4074
01:50:56,431 --> 01:50:56,701
She's,

4075
01:50:56,701 --> 01:50:57,534
we're on the same diet.

4076
01:50:57,670 --> 01:50:57,851
Yeah,

4077
01:50:57,851 --> 01:50:58,650
cause I'm not into it.

4078
01:50:58,650 --> 01:50:59,170
All right,

4079
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:00,003
sounds good.

4080
01:51:00,330 --> 01:51:02,220
I think I'm going to say oh
did you didn't hear Kiddo.

4081
01:51:02,221 --> 01:51:03,210
Just looking away from you.

4082
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:05,790
I'm thinking about the poor little couch
and sitting there and getting it's tits

4083
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:06,624
sucked

4084
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:08,640
bad.

4085
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:09,130
What?

4086
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:09,361
No,

4087
01:51:09,361 --> 01:51:10,240
he enjoys that shit.

4088
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:11,390
Otherwise the bill down and joy.

4089
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,710
It's like they have to keep them in a
state where you're prepared to fight

4090
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:15,873
tonics affidavit.

4091
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,823
I love watching.

4092
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,070
It was a very good fight.

4093
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:18,551
Rick Story.

4094
01:51:18,551 --> 01:51:19,540
Who's got damn gorilla?

4095
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:21,820
Well he's been out for a girl or rip.

4096
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:22,181
Yeah.

4097
01:51:22,181 --> 01:51:22,931
Where's Rick Story?

4098
01:51:22,931 --> 01:51:23,764
Ben?

4099
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:25,330
It's a long story.

4100
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:30,940
[inaudible]

4101
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:36,723
out of the park.

4102
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:38,040
It was the week

4103
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:45,130
that ball landed in the bed of the

4104
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,220
slam dunk.

4105
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:55,090
That bread ball broke the window
of a convertible Archie bunker.

4106
01:51:58,130 --> 01:51:59,060
It's a long story.

4107
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:03,740
Safa Dean tried to avoid that takedown
can only get this fucking cheese on my

4108
01:52:03,741 --> 01:52:04,011
face.

4109
01:52:04,011 --> 01:52:04,730
You know what I mean?

4110
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:05,563
Is it that good?

4111
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,301
It's so good.

4112
01:52:08,301 --> 01:52:09,111
You go fuck you.

4113
01:52:09,111 --> 01:52:09,944
Cheese.

4114
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,190
Those cows in there suck.

4115
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:14,570
Those suck everybody's tits.

4116
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:15,170
Why didn't you,

4117
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:15,920
sorry guys.

4118
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:16,940
Cheese gets me crazy.

4119
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:19,743
Raw Cheese.

4120
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,781
Raw Cheese,

4121
01:52:20,781 --> 01:52:21,260
I don't pass.

4122
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:22,093
Right.

4123
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:24,500
Did you know they put
by Agora in Rochester?

4124
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:25,363
Yes,

4125
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,170
I got it at the gas station.

4126
01:52:27,171 --> 01:52:31,970
They put that Rhino seven and the final
column lag when everything the rhino

4127
01:52:31,971 --> 01:52:32,300
color,

4128
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:33,081
not just like sugar,

4129
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:34,100
just putting back

4130
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:45,853
shit.

4131
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:50,480
You got to cut down on
your Biafra free food.

4132
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,810
We'd come back around people fight,

4133
01:52:57,370 --> 01:53:02,370
that'd be Viagara conspiracies huddle
by Agri Association bought off Yale

4134
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:08,321
professors to prove that it was a good
for longevity and enter properties.

4135
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:12,620
Good for endurance.

4136
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:13,701
And they came up with,

4137
01:53:13,701 --> 01:53:15,770
if it was like a blood
pressure medication,

4138
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:16,633
something,

4139
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:17,630
what was that?

4140
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:19,580
Because it's illegal to take leave.

4141
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,430
It was blood pressure and open up your,

4142
01:53:21,431 --> 01:53:21,950
your uh,

4143
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:26,950
capillaries or getting hard on
it's illegal taking the Olympics.

4144
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:28,120
Oh yeah.

4145
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:31,430
He has liquid money to
get you more about that.

4146
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,470
You take fucking Douche shot shots.

4147
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:34,341
Also,

4148
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:34,610
um,

4149
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:35,200
uh,

4150
01:53:35,200 --> 01:53:38,560
Propecia was for prostate cancer and
they were growing hair and they're like,

4151
01:53:38,561 --> 01:53:39,271
what the fuck's going on?

4152
01:53:39,271 --> 01:53:39,591
And what it was.

4153
01:53:39,591 --> 01:53:40,261
It was a master.

4154
01:53:40,261 --> 01:53:41,750
I still hold on,

4155
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:42,410
I am,

4156
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:43,243
don't take it.

4157
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:49,100
It was a cardiovascular thing for it's
ability for it to lower blood pressure

4158
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:50,650
that everyone got the right shit.

4159
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:51,050
Yeah,

4160
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:51,261
dude,

4161
01:53:51,261 --> 01:53:52,330
that stuff's not good for you.

4162
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:54,591
First of all,

4163
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:58,310
because they took it out and then when
I got off and Ari took it and it made

4164
01:53:58,311 --> 01:53:59,040
them depressed.

4165
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,560
Are He got severely depressed?

4166
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,560
His cock you might be.

4167
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:05,360
Maybe you'd be more happy
if you weren't on it.

4168
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:06,201
That stuff,

4169
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:06,861
I'm not kidding.

4170
01:54:06,861 --> 01:54:11,630
That stuff is very directly to depression
because it fucks with your body's

4171
01:54:11,631 --> 01:54:12,860
ability to produce hormones.

4172
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:13,160
It,

4173
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,350
it suppresses dihydrotestosterone,

4174
01:54:15,351 --> 01:54:19,160
which is a derivative of testosterone
that causes you to go to balls and that is

4175
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:22,850
a part of your overall system and when
you suppress that one aspect of your

4176
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:23,450
system,

4177
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:24,710
it could fuck up your whole end.

4178
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,660
Chris was Joe.

4179
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:29,310
He's already like the
same thing with steroids.

4180
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:33,890
I don't have to be sad with a lot
of hair than happy with no hair.

4181
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,730
Okay.

4182
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:36,770
You and I are very different obviously,

4183
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,221
but Joe,

4184
01:54:37,221 --> 01:54:39,110
don't you think a always the exception?

4185
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:40,550
No super depressed.

4186
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:40,881
No,

4187
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:42,770
because it's a common common side.

4188
01:54:42,771 --> 01:54:43,520
Disposed to that.

4189
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:43,731
No,

4190
01:54:43,731 --> 01:54:44,930
it's a common side effect.

4191
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,780
I'm telling you already gone off
that shit and it changed him.

4192
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:49,240
It changed him.

4193
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,480
It a nice set of here that
might be yanked total dose.

4194
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:51,741
No,

4195
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:53,360
it kept his hair barely.

4196
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:54,090
Just like me.

4197
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:56,720
Kept my hair barely and
when I got off of it,

4198
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:58,400
my body felt way better.

4199
01:54:58,401 --> 01:54:59,510
I had more endurance.

4200
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:02,390
I was thinking I had chronic
fatigue syndrome or something.

4201
01:55:02,690 --> 01:55:03,021
I was like,

4202
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:04,430
why am I fucking tired all the time?

4203
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:06,320
It's hard for me to muster
up energy to work out.

4204
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:07,700
It was doing it all on willpower.

4205
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,420
I got off probation.

4206
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:10,283
My body was like,

4207
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:13,640
it felt 30% better.

4208
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:14,061
I was like,

4209
01:55:14,061 --> 01:55:14,811
this is ridiculous.

4210
01:55:14,811 --> 01:55:18,180
It's like I've been like
on a drug for Brian.

4211
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,191
I got off it too.

4212
01:55:19,191 --> 01:55:20,070
I was on for a while.

4213
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,940
I ran out,

4214
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,120
so it's been three months,

4215
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:25,050
but I've dog back on it.

4216
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:26,180
It doesn't make me feel bad at all.

4217
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:27,800
I'm out of the sun about feeling bad.

4218
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:31,290
It's like you still get those
bones overall like yeah,

4219
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,560
how long are you going to get a 10 years.

4220
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,850
Eventually it's got to,

4221
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,400
it's got to cause it keeps you,

4222
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:39,410
it keeps your approach smaller.

4223
01:55:39,411 --> 01:55:40,350
So yeah,

4224
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:41,690
for dudes you don't come,

4225
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:42,980
you know that's all about dudes.

4226
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:43,620
You don't come.

4227
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:43,930
What's the,

4228
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,000
do

4229
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,030
you know the jerking off,

4230
01:55:45,031 --> 01:55:47,310
just jerking off and having
regular sex is the best.

4231
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:48,720
Reduce her prostate cancer.

4232
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:49,080
That's fine.

4233
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:54,080
It's old dude's who's come backs up
inside them like old sewage and just stews

4234
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:55,194
up inside.

4235
01:55:57,560 --> 01:55:58,290
No worries.

4236
01:55:58,290 --> 01:55:59,123
I

4237
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:04,530
think if you took like a bunch of Harry
Shits left me your toilet and what that

4238
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:05,530
would do to the pipes.

4239
01:56:08,410 --> 01:56:13,410
I hadn't been eating bunnies by the Harris
Kaia hairs that are breaking off from

4240
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:14,574
your asshole.

4241
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,260
I wax my asshole.

4242
01:56:19,490 --> 01:56:20,370
How do you stop

4243
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:25,110
saved my ass hole changes
the way my fart sound.

4244
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:26,850
All they clap.

4245
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:28,710
They sound like it's somebody
else's fault and I'm like,

4246
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:29,880
who the fuck back?

4247
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:30,820
Then I take a clipper.

4248
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:33,330
Do you actually believe there?

4249
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,990
There's guys that are getting to a certain
age and they just stopped jacking off

4250
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:38,953
depression.

4251
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:43,280
A lot of guys lose their testosterone
and you can't gather guys dead.

4252
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:44,123
Hundred percent

4253
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:46,560
I can't.

4254
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,110
I can't.

4255
01:56:47,110 --> 01:56:47,630
I can't.

4256
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:49,860
Well it's some days I need to,

4257
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,541
here's the thing,

4258
01:56:51,541 --> 01:56:55,170
everybody fucking Jack Cause I saw
something weird way more than they should.

4259
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,480
Well this is something we know

4260
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:01,290
this slow drawn out.

4261
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,920
Oh,

4262
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:03,883
not to keep up with.

4263
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:04,670
I was like,

4264
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:05,503
we need to stop.

4265
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:06,450
Stop,

4266
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,950
stop to start a movement,

4267
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:11,630
hand Hashtag and jerking off or or,

4268
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:13,100
or slow in maintenance,

4269
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:13,381
man.

4270
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:16,700
It keeps your body healthy to get hurt.

4271
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,180
Slowed down his neck.

4272
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:19,031
Maybe not end.

4273
01:57:19,031 --> 01:57:19,531
It does.

4274
01:57:19,531 --> 01:57:20,280
Slow it down.

4275
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:20,671
No,

4276
01:57:20,671 --> 01:57:21,870
I think they can't slow it down.

4277
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:23,580
Everyone's all aggressive.

4278
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:24,870
Slowed down just a little bit.

4279
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,980
Powerful Terex afternoon that Brendan,

4280
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:28,320
just half the names of a rough man.

4281
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:29,041
He needs to,

4282
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:30,030
it needs maintenance.

4283
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,111
I'm not that crazy.

4284
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:31,381
Listen,

4285
01:57:31,381 --> 01:57:31,791
when you have,

4286
01:57:31,791 --> 01:57:32,221
first of all,

4287
01:57:32,221 --> 01:57:32,431
Eddie,

4288
01:57:32,431 --> 01:57:35,390
you and I can't talk about him
because he's got gladiator jeans.

4289
01:57:35,391 --> 01:57:36,224
Look at his body.

4290
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,380
Bodies like that are meant to come.

4291
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:43,320
He's the most to me all over the land.

4292
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:45,443
Oh,

4293
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:48,270
I got a half a Chubby,

4294
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:50,490
which I'll tell you like six,

4295
01:57:50,491 --> 01:57:50,821
five,

4296
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:51,061
six,

4297
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:51,360
four,

4298
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:51,691
six,

4299
01:57:51,691 --> 01:57:52,370
four,

4300
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:53,203
four,

4301
01:57:53,820 --> 01:57:54,091
six,

4302
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:55,650
four natural to 40.

4303
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,940
Just shut the fuck up.

4304
01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:59,400
Everybody got to come a lot.

4305
01:57:59,401 --> 01:58:00,234
But it's true.

4306
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,020
You don't want to run to the street.

4307
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:03,530
Gulf cocking your neighbors.

4308
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:04,321
Give me a child.

4309
01:58:04,321 --> 01:58:05,011
Give me a child.

4310
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:05,361
Let him see.

4311
01:58:05,361 --> 01:58:05,640
Sure.

4312
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,890
There last night to tell girls,

4313
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:07,471
take my wife.

4314
01:58:07,471 --> 01:58:08,101
I want to raise my,

4315
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:09,060
I want to raise your child.

4316
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:09,871
Listen to Rogan.

4317
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:10,501
I got to come.

4318
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:13,890
Don't be fucking calm to look at stuff.

4319
01:58:14,070 --> 01:58:15,810
A Dean with story on his back.

4320
01:58:15,811 --> 01:58:16,644
That's crazy.

4321
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:18,430
Safa Dean took story down.

4322
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:20,890
Sabba didn't trains with
guys like Henderson.

4323
01:58:20,891 --> 01:58:21,230
Yeah,

4324
01:58:21,230 --> 01:58:23,460
well that's who we went
to when he first started.

4325
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:23,850
Uh,

4326
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:25,230
getting into the MMA game.

4327
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,580
Fuck it.

4328
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:29,580
You can go to her and Olympic wrestler
figuring out how to stop this bullshit.

4329
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:30,580
Good clinicians.

4330
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:31,730
That black house a lot too.

4331
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:32,170
Oh yeah.

4332
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:32,730
Warren.

4333
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:32,861
Well,

4334
01:58:32,861 --> 01:58:37,861
you know that fight with Nate Marquardt
was a fucking excellent example of a guy

4335
01:58:38,281 --> 01:58:41,250
who's got just like
super fucking high level.

4336
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:41,980
He

4337
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,210
tactical striking.

4338
01:58:45,490 --> 01:58:49,060
Nate was trying to eat it for a while
and then when you eat a few of those you

4339
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:49,430
like,

4340
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:49,960
you were like,

4341
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:50,411
oh my God,

4342
01:58:50,411 --> 01:58:51,610
I'm stuck in a pattern.

4343
01:58:51,611 --> 01:58:53,590
And then you got to take
yourself out of the pattern.

4344
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:53,910
Right?

4345
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:55,150
We got to break yourself out.

4346
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:55,620
Well,

4347
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:59,230
you can't go against a high level
Bob kickbox like this and go,

4348
01:58:59,231 --> 01:59:00,280
I'm just going chuck them all night.

4349
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:01,031
Let me ask you this.

4350
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:04,420
If you ever had a fight where you
went into it and you were too relaxed,

4351
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:05,470
you were too confident.

4352
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:06,640
You asking me,

4353
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:07,473
Roy Nelson,

4354
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:08,351
Roy Nelson,

4355
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:09,160
fight the teacher,

4356
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,170
big knock fight way to relax.

4357
01:59:11,830 --> 01:59:13,270
That's a bad place to be.

4358
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:15,460
It's like everybody wants
to be super confident,

4359
01:59:15,461 --> 01:59:16,840
but you don't want to be too confident,

4360
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,520
obviously.

4361
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:19,353
Um,

4362
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,553
it's just,

4363
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:21,250
it's,

4364
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:21,661
I mean it's,

4365
01:59:21,661 --> 01:59:24,700
it varies with person to person
from instance to instance.

4366
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:29,890
But I would think that you're almost
better off being fucking terrified and

4367
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:31,990
dealing with all the horrible feeling.

4368
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:37,690
Because I remember the taekwondo days
whenever I felt like too good about things

4369
01:59:37,691 --> 01:59:38,381
I didn't find,

4370
01:59:38,381 --> 01:59:39,190
never went good.

4371
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:43,810
I fought like clumsy and I was too aware
of what I was doing instead of being

4372
01:59:43,811 --> 01:59:44,830
instinctive and,

4373
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,800
and like real fast twitch
and sharp terrified.

4374
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:48,160
Yeah,

4375
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:48,993
I hear Ya.

4376
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:49,300
But,

4377
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:52,360
but nobody wants to deal
with that feeling that all,

4378
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:56,320
all the day of the way ends
the day of the fucking,

4379
01:59:56,321 --> 01:59:57,400
but it's also what makes,

4380
01:59:57,550 --> 02:00:02,380
makes you great and it's also what makes
the experience of being victorious so

4381
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:03,160
powerful.

4382
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:08,160
When you see a guy like chocolate Dell
run around the cage and throw his arms

4383
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:11,440
when he would roar,

4384
02:00:11,441 --> 02:00:13,660
like when he knocked out
Tito or when he knocked out,

4385
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:15,820
Bob on board did the same shit exactly.

4386
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,110
Like you've got to realize that
feeling doesn't just come from victory.

4387
02:00:20,260 --> 02:00:25,260
That feeling comes from all that turmoil
and that did the fucking who knows

4388
02:00:25,301 --> 02:00:26,380
what's going to happen.

4389
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:31,720
It comes from when it comes to chuck and
he knew how much bigger that picture,

4390
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:32,554
Goddamn,

4391
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,240
look at chocolate has the
best picture in UFC history.

4392
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,150
Those trunks he's got,

4393
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:39,940
you know how much pussy
this is going to get me?

4394
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:43,890
That's the truth.

4395
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:44,321
Hey Joe.

4396
02:00:44,321 --> 02:00:46,150
But he was an animal,

4397
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:47,560
but just as good as the winds are.

4398
02:00:47,561 --> 02:00:48,430
When you're that scared,

4399
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:49,330
when you do lose,

4400
02:00:49,331 --> 02:00:49,601
when you're like,

4401
02:00:49,601 --> 02:00:49,721
yeah,

4402
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:50,500
what's what's can happen,

4403
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:51,520
you lose the worst way.

4404
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,600
Those same fears,

4405
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:52,811
you're like,

4406
02:00:52,811 --> 02:00:54,040
fuck going through that man.

4407
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:54,641
Fuck that.

4408
02:00:54,641 --> 02:00:56,050
Because you don't get the same pay off.

4409
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:56,860
There's some extent.

4410
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:58,030
There's certainly that as well.

4411
02:00:58,031 --> 02:01:00,710
There's certainly that as well and there's
lows are low and the highs are high.

4412
02:01:00,711 --> 02:01:05,711
It's also guys where you start realizing
the lows are coming repeatedly and it

4413
02:01:05,951 --> 02:01:08,770
doesn't seem like there's an escape for
them and you've got to realize what are

4414
02:01:08,771 --> 02:01:10,240
the consequences of these lows.

4415
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:13,750
They're permanent like a really
smart guy like Mac Dansik,

4416
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,850
like when Mac Danzig decided to retire,

4417
02:01:15,851 --> 02:01:16,330
he was like,

4418
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:17,740
that's a smart dude.

4419
02:01:17,741 --> 02:01:18,580
He should've done it before.

4420
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:19,720
That may be,

4421
02:01:19,721 --> 02:01:22,030
but it's hard to see
when you're inside of it.

4422
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:23,050
Very few people,

4423
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:27,640
me included can see themselves as well
as other people can see you because we

4424
02:01:27,641 --> 02:01:32,350
all have a certain amount of protective
layers of ego and of narcissism,

4425
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:33,184
professional fighter.

4426
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:34,150
If anybody,

4427
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:36,810
anybody that's trying to do good
at anything and anything you,

4428
02:01:36,811 --> 02:01:40,100
you have to have a certain amount of self
esteem and ego in order to pursue that

4429
02:01:40,101 --> 02:01:43,430
goal because otherwise for sure for sure,

4430
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,300
but most,

4431
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:45,320
most also,

4432
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:49,280
most likely their motivation for getting
in the first place is they had really

4433
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:53,210
low self esteem at one point in time in
life and fighting showed them the way

4434
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:53,480
out.

4435
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:54,400
Correct fight.

4436
02:01:54,410 --> 02:01:58,220
There's so many fighters come from
abusive backgrounds stepfathers that were

4437
02:01:58,221 --> 02:01:59,750
assholes and all that shit.

4438
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:00,710
Oh Shit.

4439
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:03,200
[inaudible] with the fucking
question mark kick over there said,

4440
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:03,710
oh,

4441
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:05,840
that was story storyland to that kid.

4442
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:05,991
No,

4443
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:06,500
he didn't.

4444
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:07,840
He didn't know Safdie did.

4445
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:08,660
And then he turned him.

4446
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:10,220
Oh Jesus Christ.

4447
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:12,350
Which one was showing crazy?

4448
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:13,490
Am I right?

4449
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:14,090
Who's going crazy?

4450
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,923
I don't know.

4451
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:16,280
Fucking cheese.

4452
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:16,610
There's,

4453
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:17,443
again,

4454
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:18,313
it's both.

4455
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:21,060
I'm going with the wine
and the wheat cheese.

4456
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:22,730
Since 2008,

4457
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:23,923
uh,

4458
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:27,320
Uconn has turned down.

4459
02:02:27,321 --> 02:02:28,490
We got through four bottles.

4460
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:30,440
We get loose tonight.

4461
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,460
Do we have to reimburse you for this now?

4462
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:34,131
And you know,

4463
02:02:34,131 --> 02:02:37,700
wireless Callan Eg throwing 200 bucks,

4464
02:02:37,701 --> 02:02:38,370
we'll call calling even know.

4465
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:40,640
Biggest probably crossed a to man.

4466
02:02:42,450 --> 02:02:42,860
Listen,

4467
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:43,520
man count.

4468
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,770
And you still haven't shot
your bow once I did it,

4469
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:46,810
I keep asking him,

4470
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:49,680
I got to come over and you
definitely don't keep my ticket.

4471
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:53,480
I do occasionally throw it out there.

4472
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:57,110
You don't get specific at all and you
don't get proactive even slightly.

4473
02:02:57,111 --> 02:02:57,944
I need to start,

4474
02:02:58,640 --> 02:02:59,473
keep texting.

4475
02:03:01,220 --> 02:03:02,930
You have a serious talk right now.

4476
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:04,100
Let's be honest.

4477
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:06,440
Be Honest about how much you've I,

4478
02:03:06,441 --> 02:03:09,140
this is one of the things
I decided because you kept
telling me that you wanted

4479
02:03:09,141 --> 02:03:10,970
to do archery and you wanted
to get into bow hunting.

4480
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:11,511
So I said,

4481
02:03:11,511 --> 02:03:11,811
okay.

4482
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:15,650
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to give
Brian a bow and now I'm going to let,

4483
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:18,620
we'll see how proactive he gets with this.

4484
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:19,791
And uh,

4485
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:20,840
it really hasn't panned out.

4486
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:23,330
Give you a nice job.

4487
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:25,563
Let's not a hunter.

4488
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:25,821
Yes,

4489
02:03:25,821 --> 02:03:27,440
I am a hunter.

4490
02:03:27,441 --> 02:03:28,274
You're wrong.

4491
02:03:29,120 --> 02:03:30,710
I've seen Brian kill animals.

4492
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:31,100
Yes,

4493
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:32,900
I seen Brian Kill and butchered deal.

4494
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:34,130
Now Brian,

4495
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:35,360
Brian is a good shot.

4496
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:36,860
He's a fucking calm dude.

4497
02:03:36,861 --> 02:03:38,020
Under pressure as good at it.

4498
02:03:38,030 --> 02:03:38,870
Doesn't mean he likes it.

4499
02:03:38,871 --> 02:03:40,130
Brian's crazy as fuck.

4500
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,450
And I love him to death,

4501
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:44,660
but that dude stays calm on the trigger.

4502
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:45,381
Let me tell you something.

4503
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:47,510
If I needed somebody to shoot for me,

4504
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:49,220
all your friends,

4505
02:03:49,220 --> 02:03:52,100
one of my number one picks
out of a guy who keeping,

4506
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:54,200
you only get one cause
he's so fucking crazy.

4507
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,180
He can keep it together under pressure.

4508
02:03:58,450 --> 02:04:01,310
That's Brian Cowen can fucking there.

4509
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:04,550
They could be a armies
running and Brian's direction.

4510
02:04:04,551 --> 02:04:05,450
I guarantee Brian,

4511
02:04:05,451 --> 02:04:09,320
we'll shoot as good as he as he
would if there was no one was.

4512
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:11,630
There's no doubt about that because I've
been going through that my whole life

4513
02:04:11,631 --> 02:04:12,150
in my head.

4514
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:12,983
He's crazy.

4515
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:13,963
He's crazy.

4516
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:14,901
In a weird way.

4517
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:16,620
He's a smiling guy that
knows how to shoot.

4518
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:17,120
Yeah,

4519
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:17,630
that's true.

4520
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:18,340
In a weird way.

4521
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:19,400
Now let's look at me.

4522
02:04:19,410 --> 02:04:20,800
I'm hungry right now,

4523
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:22,550
coming over us and Wisconsin.

4524
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:23,120
I'm coming.

4525
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:23,740
That's Bible.

4526
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:24,930
That's the dude we met in,

4527
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:31,100
does a great job during is one of the
best human beings has ever walked the face

4528
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:31,710
of the planet,

4529
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:32,391
a great meal.

4530
02:04:32,391 --> 02:04:33,141
He said his wife,

4531
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:34,640
he's a gem of a person.

4532
02:04:34,641 --> 02:04:35,480
You know his wife drew,

4533
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:35,721
she,

4534
02:04:35,721 --> 02:04:36,554
she's a painter.

4535
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:37,261
She was like,

4536
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:38,310
how beautiful is this painting?

4537
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:40,380
It's a painting of him on
the cell phone like this.

4538
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:40,651
She goes,

4539
02:04:40,651 --> 02:04:41,670
cause this is how we have dinner.

4540
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:45,220
He's like this looking at his phone.

4541
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:47,070
Powerful first light.

4542
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:48,060
How much longer we have here.

4543
02:04:48,061 --> 02:04:49,260
We were laughing so hard.

4544
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:50,400
How beautiful is my firstlight?

4545
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:51,080
Cammo.

4546
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:51,570
Aww,

4547
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:52,230
that's beautiful.

4548
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:52,411
Yeah.

4549
02:04:52,411 --> 02:04:53,970
We were talking about shit on a stick.

4550
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,630
There's a,

4551
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:56,190
there's a mold that looks like shit.

4552
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,820
We barely pay attention
to any of these fights.

4553
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:00,121
Meanwhile,

4554
02:05:00,121 --> 02:05:03,060
Rick Story and Terex half and he had
been going to war and we're like those

4555
02:05:03,061 --> 02:05:04,830
assholes and the fucking first row,

4556
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:05,664
they're drunk.

4557
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:07,320
They're fairly pitch tie

4558
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:10,733
to it.

4559
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:11,830
I swear to God,

4560
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:16,470
you're going to show another dimension.

4561
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:20,610
There needs to be a vegan hunting show
where they get a Vegan that goes out in

4562
02:05:20,611 --> 02:05:21,061
the wild.

4563
02:05:21,061 --> 02:05:22,110
I'm coming in this week.

4564
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,880
I want to see me crying on to me.

4565
02:05:23,881 --> 02:05:24,870
I'm coming in this week,

4566
02:05:25,770 --> 02:05:28,590
the hunt for wild edible plants.

4567
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:30,000
What about terrible idea

4568
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,810
for wild edible plants?

4569
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:34,051
Well,

4570
02:05:34,051 --> 02:05:35,130
I think there's going to be sure.

4571
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:38,460
I'm not going to be a real problem
soon with plant intelligence,

4572
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:41,310
whether they're understanding things
about the way plants communicate with each

4573
02:05:41,311 --> 02:05:42,144
other,

4574
02:05:42,650 --> 02:05:45,480
they're not much different
than look octopus,

4575
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:49,230
it's really super arguable that we
probably shouldn't need octopus because

4576
02:05:49,231 --> 02:05:51,190
octopus are smart as shit.

4577
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:53,340
They can read your
facial expressions right?

4578
02:05:53,370 --> 02:05:54,121
That well not only that,

4579
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:56,220
they communicate through
the texture of their skin.

4580
02:05:56,430 --> 02:05:57,263
They can kill,

4581
02:05:57,490 --> 02:06:00,990
they have ink that they blast in front
of things so they can get the fuck away.

4582
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,640
See Ya.

4583
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:02,540
They're really complex.

4584
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:05,900
Many times I'm a freak out guys.

4585
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:06,930
We can't talk over each.

4586
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:07,310
All don't,

4587
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:09,390
I'm sorry someone has to just back off.

4588
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,143
You got this Eddie.

4589
02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:14,040
I was just wondering if
octopus was like spinach.

4590
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:15,443
What do you mean?

4591
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,291
Cause you're saying you,

4592
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:19,230
there's a real good argument
between the plant life and hell.

4593
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:19,951
Smarter plan is,

4594
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:20,341
I'm good.

4595
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:21,174
I'll get really weird.

4596
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:21,871
No,

4597
02:06:21,871 --> 02:06:22,201
I'm good.

4598
02:06:22,201 --> 02:06:22,530
Doug,

4599
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:23,870
don't talking about spinach and AUC.

4600
02:06:23,871 --> 02:06:25,530
Do you want to be a podcast
or just certain things.

4601
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:30,450
If you want to be willing to get so
high you say stupid shit be with us.

4602
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,800
He will watch this bro.

4603
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:32,410
So what were you saying?

4604
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:32,800
Gosh,

4605
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:33,930
to buses and spinach.

4606
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:34,681
Oh,

4607
02:06:34,681 --> 02:06:34,891
well,

4608
02:06:34,891 --> 02:06:37,200
you were saying there's a real
argument about plant life.

4609
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:38,100
How smart they are.

4610
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,211
Cause Vegan sale.

4611
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:39,361
Well,

4612
02:06:39,361 --> 02:06:39,931
we plants,

4613
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:40,320
right?

4614
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:40,740
Well the,

4615
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:41,190
yeah.

4616
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:41,491
Well the,

4617
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:45,090
the argument is that we're starting to
understand that plants communicate with

4618
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:46,890
each other and very strange way.

4619
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:48,930
Don't eat octopus.

4620
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,580
They have more genes than you.

4621
02:06:50,581 --> 02:06:50,721
Dude,

4622
02:06:50,721 --> 02:06:51,161
I love it.

4623
02:06:51,161 --> 02:06:52,080
Nice on the Guardian.

4624
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,750
Whoa.

4625
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:53,470
Taste delicious.

4626
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:53,700
No,

4627
02:06:53,700 --> 02:06:53,810
no.

4628
02:06:53,810 --> 02:06:54,510
Not to eat.

4629
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,560
Apparently much friends,

4630
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:56,041
plants,

4631
02:06:56,041 --> 02:06:56,851
we have those chickens.

4632
02:06:56,851 --> 02:06:57,550
His friends.

4633
02:06:57,550 --> 02:07:01,650
I'd like octopuses friends
plants react and don't show it,

4634
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:05,070
but the same way they do calculations.

4635
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:06,510
Here's what's weird about plants.

4636
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:09,390
They do calculations and they communicate
with each other than it's weird way.

4637
02:07:09,391 --> 02:07:09,511
Like,

4638
02:07:09,511 --> 02:07:10,650
here's a perfect example.

4639
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,730
And acacia tree,

4640
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:14,370
if an Acacia tree is upwind or uh,

4641
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:14,760
yeah,

4642
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:15,091
it's up.

4643
02:07:15,091 --> 02:07:16,260
When the animals eat it,

4644
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:17,310
like a giraffe eats it,

4645
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:20,070
the wind goes down and the wind goes down,

4646
02:07:20,071 --> 02:07:20,881
hits the other case,

4647
02:07:20,881 --> 02:07:21,271
you trees.

4648
02:07:21,271 --> 02:07:22,950
And they changed the way they taste.

4649
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:24,420
What they become bitter.

4650
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:28,470
We fact there's a problem with animals
that are downwind of a constant breeds

4651
02:07:28,471 --> 02:07:31,830
where they literally could starve to
death because they won't eat their

4652
02:07:31,831 --> 02:07:36,010
preferred food because it tastes
bad or reason to those plants up.

4653
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:36,880
How about that?

4654
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:37,420
Yeah.

4655
02:07:37,420 --> 02:07:38,253
How about that?

4656
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:42,630
It's a weird communication going on also
with the ground itself because we look

4657
02:07:42,631 --> 02:07:43,980
at the ground as being just dirt,

4658
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:45,390
but it's not.

4659
02:07:45,390 --> 02:07:47,030
It's full of arts and ecosystems.

4660
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:50,010
It's filled with all sorts of different
things and most importantly it's,

4661
02:07:50,011 --> 02:07:51,030
here's a big factor,

4662
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:54,240
decomposing plant and animal material,

4663
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:56,970
which gets absorbed into the ground.

4664
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:59,160
Like when you eat plant food,

4665
02:07:59,250 --> 02:08:02,980
when you plant like vegetables
and then you have to add soy,

4666
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:04,680
you have to add minerals to the soil,

4667
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:07,020
you have to add fertilizer to the soil.

4668
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:07,380
Right.

4669
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:09,030
For most lance,

4670
02:08:09,031 --> 02:08:10,920
because we've depleted
the minerals in the soil,

4671
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:12,090
but when you go to the woods,

4672
02:08:12,091 --> 02:08:13,260
no one's adding shit.

4673
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:14,100
Okay.

4674
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:18,300
What's happening is things are decomposing
the recycling animals are decomposing

4675
02:08:18,301 --> 02:08:21,720
bodies or all sorts of things that
are left behind are composing.

4676
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:22,321
Yeah.

4677
02:08:22,321 --> 02:08:22,711
I mean it's,

4678
02:08:22,711 --> 02:08:24,270
it's legitimately what it is.

4679
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:27,390
And plants need that as
much as they need water.

4680
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:29,700
There's like this constant thing going on.

4681
02:08:29,850 --> 02:08:32,940
So without animal life
and animal life dying,

4682
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:37,920
these plants are not going to exist like
this day and their existing eating this

4683
02:08:37,921 --> 02:08:42,921
weird fucking ground and then water and
then they're breathing in oxygen and

4684
02:08:43,231 --> 02:08:46,230
spitting or breathing in carbon
dioxide and spitting out oxygen.

4685
02:08:46,470 --> 02:08:48,060
How about some Venus fly trap?

4686
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:48,810
Oh yeah.

4687
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:49,530
The things,

4688
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:49,981
hey man,

4689
02:08:49,981 --> 02:08:50,814
that's a plant.

4690
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:51,540
How about,

4691
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:53,340
how about the one in the Amazon eats rats.

4692
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:57,260
God does a plant that
plant that each rock off.

4693
02:08:57,690 --> 02:08:58,523
Jamie,

4694
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,083
Jamie,

4695
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:00,820
Jamie,

4696
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:01,470
Jamie.

4697
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:02,820
We played this a dozen times.

4698
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:07,370
There's a fucking plant in the Amazon
that honey Dick's rat on a out to fall

4699
02:09:07,371 --> 02:09:09,780
inside of it and it closes up on it.

4700
02:09:09,781 --> 02:09:10,980
It's this fat crazy.

4701
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:11,640
Look at this.

4702
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:12,473
Come on.

4703
02:09:13,590 --> 02:09:14,530
Just sweat this.

4704
02:09:14,531 --> 02:09:15,750
Sweat this whole watch.

4705
02:09:15,751 --> 02:09:16,350
What happens.

4706
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:16,681
Oh,

4707
02:09:16,681 --> 02:09:17,514
that's a wrap.

4708
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:18,390
Sweden there.

4709
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:19,681
Exactly.

4710
02:09:19,681 --> 02:09:22,230
It's sweet and it's slippery.

4711
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:26,730
And this mouses Foxville now
that mouse is not getting out.

4712
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,593
Never.

4713
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:28,381
They get eaten.

4714
02:09:28,381 --> 02:09:29,490
Well that's a Venus fly trap.

4715
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:33,200
Oh c'mon.

4716
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:35,170
C'Mon flies.

4717
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:38,250
They so get that rat go down
that hole and never come back.

4718
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:39,240
Yeah.

4719
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:41,310
Ted's on the rep went to red heaven,

4720
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:46,710
which show that mad when we know
it's like the little shop of horrors.

4721
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:48,360
How do we know?

4722
02:09:48,510 --> 02:09:49,440
I don't know about that.

4723
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:50,500
What are you talking about?

4724
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:51,334
This fucking

4725
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:56,570
bullshit.

4726
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:57,420
That is bullshit.

4727
02:09:57,421 --> 02:09:58,890
What does propaganda fuck?

4728
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:03,180
What is this Jamie?

4729
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:04,580
Y'All fucking laugh.

4730
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:04,921
Jamie.

4731
02:10:04,921 --> 02:10:05,754
What is this?

4732
02:10:06,330 --> 02:10:07,163
What is it eating?

4733
02:10:09,570 --> 02:10:10,800
You can't see shit.

4734
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:11,521
That's hard to see.

4735
02:10:11,521 --> 02:10:12,510
It's a weird photo.

4736
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:12,871
Oh,

4737
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:13,291
I see.

4738
02:10:13,291 --> 02:10:15,030
The rat is stuck in there and he's like,

4739
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,140
Oh snap.

4740
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:16,920
It's over.

4741
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,930
That's a little rat.

4742
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:22,363
Fuck.

4743
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:25,650
Why the fuck is the
plant eating rats though?

4744
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,823
Because

4745
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:28,590
look,

4746
02:10:28,590 --> 02:10:29,700
he gets nutrients from it.

4747
02:10:29,701 --> 02:10:30,451
The same way it gets.

4748
02:10:30,451 --> 02:10:34,220
Nutrients are decomposing plainly grab
animal matter gets into the ground.

4749
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:35,203
Fucking plan.

4750
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,991
What I was going to say,

4751
02:10:35,991 --> 02:10:39,950
it's all of the fertilizer
that we use today,

4752
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:43,250
either as it as it has to have nitrogen
in it cause that's like one of the key

4753
02:10:43,251 --> 02:10:44,084
components,

4754
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:45,530
but a lot of like what it is like,

4755
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,210
especially when people make compost,

4756
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,530
that's like the best.

4757
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:53,480
When people throw their food waste in
and then they throw worms and leaves and

4758
02:10:53,481 --> 02:10:54,950
everything sort of decomposes.

4759
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,580
Yeah,

4760
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,001
that's stuff.

4761
02:10:56,001 --> 02:10:58,520
Decomposes it and you can use that in
your garden and that's like one of the

4762
02:10:58,521 --> 02:11:01,370
best ways of sort of replenishing
nutrients in the soil.

4763
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:04,190
You do that shit when you're
hanging out with a chick stories.

4764
02:11:04,191 --> 02:11:04,730
There's one.

4765
02:11:04,730 --> 02:11:05,121
Yes.

4766
02:11:05,121 --> 02:11:05,990
I compost.

4767
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:06,824
I grow.

4768
02:11:07,190 --> 02:11:08,990
I grow vegetables in the
hangout with chickens,

4769
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,240
but it makes me happy.

4770
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,453
Makes me happy.

4771
02:11:12,530 --> 02:11:13,430
When I eat a salad,

4772
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:15,950
when I eat like a some
tomatoes that I grew,

4773
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,933
it makes me happy,

4774
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:18,380
so it makes me feel good.

4775
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:19,933
It feels good.

4776
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:20,580
It was.

4777
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:21,440
It's a weird way.

4778
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:21,891
It's cool,

4779
02:11:21,891 --> 02:11:22,540
man.

4780
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:23,630
The patient makes me feel good.

4781
02:11:23,631 --> 02:11:24,464
It's a fun.

4782
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:30,110
It's one of those things
that I think a is like,

4783
02:11:30,440 --> 02:11:31,700
have you ever caught fish before?

4784
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,340
No.

4785
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,173
Yeah.

4786
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:34,670
When you catch a fish,

4787
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:35,803
oh shit.

4788
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:36,793
Oh Shit.

4789
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:37,760
You get excited.

4790
02:11:37,761 --> 02:11:38,481
Apparently.

4791
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:40,830
There's also a similar
reaction to people that are,

4792
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:44,150
if you're a a a bug collector,

4793
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:45,960
like a moth collector,

4794
02:11:45,961 --> 02:11:46,611
or not my friend,

4795
02:11:46,611 --> 02:11:47,444
but a flashlight.

4796
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,210
I don't have any friends that do that.

4797
02:11:50,211 --> 02:11:54,830
There's something because human
beings for a long period of time where

4798
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:57,470
apparently insectivores
Rick story won that fight.

4799
02:11:58,490 --> 02:11:59,230
A bear.

4800
02:11:59,230 --> 02:12:00,080
That's outrageous.

4801
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:01,723
We do that.

4802
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:05,720
What does that Jamie
and horseback Ddo snake.

4803
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:06,111
Oh,

4804
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:06,944
chicken.

4805
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:08,983
Chicken.

4806
02:12:09,090 --> 02:12:09,771
Oh my God.

4807
02:12:09,771 --> 02:12:10,580
Let it roll.

4808
02:12:10,580 --> 02:12:11,320
Let it roll.

4809
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:11,871
Oh my God.

4810
02:12:11,871 --> 02:12:12,704
It eats a chick.

4811
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:16,010
He consumes it that it's crazy.

4812
02:12:16,011 --> 02:12:16,461
A horse.

4813
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:17,294
Just check.

4814
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:19,490
Fuck with those teeth.

4815
02:12:19,491 --> 02:12:20,150
Wow.

4816
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:21,500
Squished him like a Cabernet.

4817
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:22,373
Oh No.

4818
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:25,220
We were brainwashed to
believe that we're herbivores.

4819
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:25,641
Well,

4820
02:12:25,641 --> 02:12:27,110
they are for the most part,

4821
02:12:27,111 --> 02:12:28,790
but when they get a chance to eat checks,

4822
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:31,250
what does hate chickadee
move the fuck out of the way.

4823
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:31,800
Wow.

4824
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:32,150
That's,

4825
02:12:32,150 --> 02:12:34,340
that's like the smart
chicken jump baby chicken.

4826
02:12:34,341 --> 02:12:35,750
I can't run away to a smart one.

4827
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:37,250
It's a little ground graphs.

4828
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:38,451
That's crazy,

4829
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:39,284
isn't it?

4830
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:40,170
Where'd you find that?

4831
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:42,380
I forget where I saw it,

4832
02:12:42,381 --> 02:12:43,520
but I just makes me sick.

4833
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:44,300
Oh my God.

4834
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:46,580
Have you ever seen deer
chase birds and eat them?

4835
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:47,630
What the fuck?

4836
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:48,140
No,

4837
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:48,660
that,

4838
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:48,990
yeah.

4839
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:50,720
Deer eat birds regularly.

4840
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:51,501
Not only that,

4841
02:12:51,501 --> 02:12:53,870
there is a fence that was put up and uh,

4842
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:55,010
it was one of these weird,

4843
02:12:55,011 --> 02:13:00,011
a nettings and a bird's got stuck in the
netting and deer were eating the birds

4844
02:13:00,741 --> 02:13:01,610
out of the netting.

4845
02:13:01,611 --> 02:13:03,910
Some evil as dare the Burgess.

4846
02:13:03,960 --> 02:13:07,610
He couldn't differentiate
between the whole and the string.

4847
02:13:07,611 --> 02:13:09,680
And they ran right into
it and got stuck on it.

4848
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:10,250
And the birds,

4849
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,740
the deer just aid them and they just
needed the protein or something.

4850
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,270
They don't give a fuck about birds.

4851
02:13:14,271 --> 02:13:15,230
That's what's really going on.

4852
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:16,220
They're not Bambi.

4853
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:19,250
It just looks like we have a
real problem in this country.

4854
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:22,340
In Disney's fucked our brains
for the time we were babies.

4855
02:13:22,341 --> 02:13:22,751
I love it.

4856
02:13:22,751 --> 02:13:23,660
They're juicy.

4857
02:13:23,661 --> 02:13:24,620
Knows friendly.

4858
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:25,120
That's,

4859
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:25,953
I can't hunt them.

4860
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,863
Yeah.

4861
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:27,990
You gotta get over that post here.

4862
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:28,610
Nah Man,

4863
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:29,540
I'm trying to kill bears.

4864
02:13:29,541 --> 02:13:30,320
Doug.

4865
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,160
I'll call what you do to they beers.

4866
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,750
B e a or,

4867
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:35,183
and we'd on this.

4868
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:38,521
What did you mean?

4869
02:13:38,521 --> 02:13:38,971
I don't even know.

4870
02:13:38,971 --> 02:13:39,810
What do you say bears are?

4871
02:13:39,811 --> 02:13:40,290
Beers.

4872
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:41,380
You know the grizzly crime.

4873
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,060
Oh,

4874
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:46,870
I thought you meant just for the narrow.

4875
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:47,580
Do I need a gun?

4876
02:13:47,580 --> 02:13:48,180
Okay,

4877
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:48,570
hold on.

4878
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:49,081
No problem.

4879
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:50,490
You'll set it up 100%.

4880
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:51,870
Tell me why you set it up with a offer,

4881
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:52,723
bro.

4882
02:13:55,330 --> 02:13:55,800
We're in.

4883
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,041
Okay.

4884
02:13:56,041 --> 02:13:56,874
This is what we do.

4885
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:57,793
A Hunter's done.

4886
02:13:57,810 --> 02:13:58,440
Here's what we do.

4887
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:58,951
Peer pressure.

4888
02:13:58,951 --> 02:14:00,180
Do an August.

4889
02:14:00,181 --> 02:14:01,710
Bear hunt with rifle.

4890
02:14:01,870 --> 02:14:03,000
Fuck the three of us.

4891
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:03,510
You guys,

4892
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,710
you put these can use a rifle.

4893
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:05,544
I'm gonna use a bow.

4894
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:06,220
Listen,

4895
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,220
you have a rifle I could buy,

4896
02:14:07,230 --> 02:14:08,450
although this week I'm coming over to,

4897
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:10,110
I got to keep both,

4898
02:14:10,111 --> 02:14:10,944
borrow my rifles.

4899
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:13,710
I'm coming over that goddamn
armory and a machine gun.

4900
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:14,760
I got a lot of shit.

4901
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:15,593
I'll use that.

4902
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,860
A lot of problems in my head

4903
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:19,233
and I'm ready.

4904
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:20,243
I'm ready.

4905
02:14:21,410 --> 02:14:22,243
I'm ready.

4906
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:23,400
I'm so ready.

4907
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:24,211
You and Tim.

4908
02:14:24,211 --> 02:14:24,511
Kenny,

4909
02:14:24,511 --> 02:14:25,440
just Remy and Tim.

4910
02:14:25,441 --> 02:14:25,920
Ken nothin's,

4911
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:26,753
everyday friends.

4912
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:27,310
Uh,

4913
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:28,050
but um,

4914
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:28,411
this,

4915
02:14:28,411 --> 02:14:29,130
um,

4916
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:31,530
this camp that we would go to in Alberta,

4917
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:33,330
my friend John and Jen Rivet,

4918
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:37,680
they're fucking awesome human beings and
it places amazing and they have GI and

4919
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:39,360
what kind of beers and here's the thing.

4920
02:14:39,950 --> 02:14:40,220
No,

4921
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:41,310
but black bears and they,

4922
02:14:41,311 --> 02:14:42,510
there's grizzlies up there too.

4923
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:43,680
I saw a Grizzly,

4924
02:14:43,890 --> 02:14:44,611
I saw a Grizzly,

4925
02:14:44,611 --> 02:14:45,780
not where we were hunting,

4926
02:14:45,781 --> 02:14:46,500
but near it,

4927
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:46,801
on the,

4928
02:14:46,801 --> 02:14:48,030
on the weight I saw links.

4929
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:48,810
I saw many,

4930
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:49,591
many Moose.

4931
02:14:49,591 --> 02:14:50,970
Mule deer all kill you,

4932
02:14:50,971 --> 02:14:51,450
right?

4933
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:51,810
Yeah.

4934
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:52,643
So I'm in,

4935
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:57,480
well you got to do them during certain
times when we're in the bear time.

4936
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:58,890
And here's the thing about bears,

4937
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,520
it's like it actually does help the
population because they eat babies,

4938
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:03,630
they eat cubs.

4939
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:06,030
If you kill the big boars,

4940
02:15:06,031 --> 02:15:07,390
it actually is good for the popular.

4941
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:09,530
So I need to hear it
sounds counter intuitive.

4942
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:10,450
That's all we need.

4943
02:15:10,450 --> 02:15:12,030
As long as I have a
reason that I'll do it,

4944
02:15:12,031 --> 02:15:14,480
I'm doing conservation as well.

4945
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:14,680
It,

4946
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:14,901
it's,

4947
02:15:14,901 --> 02:15:15,140
it's,

4948
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:15,570
it's,

4949
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:17,190
it's a side effect of hunting.

4950
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:21,000
But here's one thing that my friend Ben
O'brian pointed this out this weekend.

4951
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:22,470
He's a good buddy of mine.

4952
02:15:22,471 --> 02:15:23,950
I used to write for a Peterson's,

4953
02:15:23,951 --> 02:15:24,270
uh,

4954
02:15:24,270 --> 02:15:25,110
hunting magazine.

4955
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:27,570
He's a super intelligent guy
and he came hunting with us.

4956
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:31,280
And one of the things that he
said is it like honey as a con.

4957
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:33,150
Conservation is a side effect of hunting.

4958
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,860
And until we're honest about that,

4959
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:38,670
people are going to always have this
argument against us or against people that

4960
02:15:38,671 --> 02:15:41,730
hunt because like people like to
say that hunting is conservation.

4961
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:42,690
It is,

4962
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,130
but it's a side effect of honey.

4963
02:15:44,131 --> 02:15:44,381
Like you,

4964
02:15:44,381 --> 02:15:46,080
you really want to hunt
because you want meat.

4965
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:46,370
Yeah.

4966
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:46,910
Not trying.

4967
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:47,610
Yeah,

4968
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:50,130
but then there's people that don't and
they don't really even really want me.

4969
02:15:50,131 --> 02:15:52,050
I knew a dude who used
to hunt all the time.

4970
02:15:52,051 --> 02:15:55,340
He hated wild game and he
hunted concerts to kill beef.

4971
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:56,243
He's just,

4972
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,150
he likes to kill.

4973
02:15:57,150 --> 02:15:57,840
He enjoyed,

4974
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:58,673
he didn't,

4975
02:15:58,740 --> 02:16:00,300
he was a real problem dude.

4976
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:00,990
He had a,

4977
02:16:00,990 --> 02:16:01,470
he's got,

4978
02:16:01,470 --> 02:16:02,310
he's got other,

4979
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:03,960
but there's something
about hunting horses.

4980
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:05,611
There's something about hunting.

4981
02:16:05,611 --> 02:16:09,300
When you wake up in the middle of nowhere
and you're walking through like in

4982
02:16:09,301 --> 02:16:10,134
Alaska,

4983
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:14,700
there is something very primordial and
very interesting about like not knowing

4984
02:16:14,701 --> 02:16:16,320
what you're going to see
around the next corner.

4985
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:16,651
Well,

4986
02:16:16,651 --> 02:16:17,191
when you and I,

4987
02:16:17,191 --> 02:16:17,820
we did that.

4988
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,710
That island in Alaska is one of my,

4989
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:24,650
two of my favorite times as a human being
is when we were in Montana and when we

4990
02:16:24,651 --> 02:16:26,880
were in Alaska and we laughed.

4991
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,470
So fucking hot and miserable.

4992
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:29,740
Yes.

4993
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:30,573
Kill anything.

4994
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:31,061
Well,

4995
02:16:31,061 --> 02:16:31,894
we did.

4996
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:32,831
We both did,

4997
02:16:32,831 --> 02:16:34,510
but in Alaska and neither one of us did.

4998
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:34,811
Joe,

4999
02:16:34,811 --> 02:16:36,100
how long would the bear humpy?

5000
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:36,700
Well,

5001
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:37,870
the bear on I just did,

5002
02:16:37,960 --> 02:16:39,400
but was three days of hunting.

5003
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:41,380
I can do one day of travel on each end,

5004
02:16:41,381 --> 02:16:44,740
so it was a five day hunt and I was
unsuccessful with my friend Cameron Hanes.

5005
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:44,980
Shout,

5006
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:46,330
a seven foot eight bear.

5007
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:47,600
Take telling you guys about it.

5008
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:49,540
We ate that bear by the way,

5009
02:16:49,570 --> 02:16:50,610
and it's fucking delicious.

5010
02:16:50,611 --> 02:16:52,450
What about the rug and you
going to make a rug from home?

5011
02:16:52,451 --> 02:16:54,630
We're going to use every
aspect for the rug.

5012
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:54,821
No,

5013
02:16:54,821 --> 02:16:54,971
no.

5014
02:16:54,971 --> 02:16:56,650
We'll use every aspect of the bear,

5015
02:16:57,130 --> 02:16:59,050
but the thing about bears
is they do two things.

5016
02:16:59,051 --> 02:16:59,411
One,

5017
02:16:59,411 --> 02:17:01,240
they eat cubs like all of them,

5018
02:17:01,241 --> 02:17:02,480
100% of them mechanical.

5019
02:17:02,550 --> 02:17:04,140
That's all I needed to hit all come out.

5020
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:05,530
Not only they come out of hibernation,

5021
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:06,460
they come into hibernation.

5022
02:17:06,461 --> 02:17:09,760
Looking to get a cub stone
cold cause cubs are easy.

5023
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:12,970
So they go into dance because the females
tend to sleep laters in the later than

5024
02:17:12,971 --> 02:17:13,804
the males.

5025
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,810
And it's something that's set up
because nature knows they don't have any

5026
02:17:16,811 --> 02:17:17,310
predator.

5027
02:17:17,310 --> 02:17:22,090
This is nature's or like a complex
but really efficient system and nature

5028
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:24,160
realize that there's
these things are bears.

5029
02:17:24,310 --> 02:17:26,680
Nothing can fuck with
them other than them.

5030
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:31,000
So what it did is it made the men
cannibals where it's very different from

5031
02:17:31,001 --> 02:17:31,630
wolves.

5032
02:17:31,630 --> 02:17:32,500
See Wolves.

5033
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:33,280
You could,

5034
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,120
a wolf could have a battle and
get killed by a mountain lions.

5035
02:17:36,121 --> 02:17:38,560
There's videos online of wolves
getting killed by a mountain lion.

5036
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:42,370
A really recent one that Jamie and I
played the other day of a mountain lion

5037
02:17:42,371 --> 02:17:44,830
killing a [inaudible] where the
guy that was light on it mount.

5038
02:17:44,831 --> 02:17:45,101
Yes,

5039
02:17:45,101 --> 02:17:45,581
exactly.

5040
02:17:45,581 --> 02:17:46,090
You've seen it.

5041
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:46,810
It's crazy.

5042
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:49,030
Mountain lions are just way
more gangster than wolves.

5043
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:50,470
Wolves can suck mountain lines.

5044
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:55,500
Dick was a mountain lion is like Kevin
Randleman is prime and a wolf is like a

5045
02:17:57,251 --> 02:17:59,320
14 year old girl in a fucking mic.

5046
02:17:59,321 --> 02:18:00,820
Dojo karate class.

5047
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:07,570
That's my favorite analogy of all time.

5048
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,760
But there's a mountain lion eating a wolf.

5049
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:12,040
He's just killing a wolf
would his fucking face.

5050
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:12,461
Well,

5051
02:18:12,461 --> 02:18:15,850
cats are just as the cats
are as gangster gangsters.

5052
02:18:15,851 --> 02:18:17,020
Any animal that's ever lived,

5053
02:18:17,050 --> 02:18:18,820
they kill crocodiles in the Amazon.

5054
02:18:18,850 --> 02:18:19,683
The tiger killed.

5055
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:21,110
But surely you've seen.

5056
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,200
But if you surely seen these,

5057
02:18:23,201 --> 02:18:24,940
a jaguars killed crocodiles.

5058
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:26,050
No,

5059
02:18:26,050 --> 02:18:27,550
I've only seen any top tiger.

5060
02:18:27,551 --> 02:18:28,590
Do it please.

5061
02:18:28,910 --> 02:18:30,200
Jack Joe Jaguar,

5062
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,390
Haman in the,

5063
02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:35,650
he's kind of love for this face.

5064
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:37,880
Cats are so gangster.

5065
02:18:37,881 --> 02:18:40,000
No fucking around moving.

5066
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:41,050
He's not freaking out.

5067
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:42,130
He's barely breathing.

5068
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:43,900
He's just slowly killing that wall,

5069
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:44,411
by the way.

5070
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:44,591
Some,

5071
02:18:44,591 --> 02:18:45,424
by the way,

5072
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:47,620
the Puma Puma.

5073
02:18:47,621 --> 02:18:48,454
And that's what you're looking at.

5074
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:51,880
The Boma is considered the
most athletic of all cats.

5075
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:52,181
Yes,

5076
02:18:52,181 --> 02:18:52,870
you're correct.

5077
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:53,770
So a house cat,

5078
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,251
by the way,

5079
02:18:54,251 --> 02:18:57,580
they say if a house cat was as big
as a house cat and be running shit,

5080
02:18:57,581 --> 02:18:57,820
yes.

5081
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:59,590
It'd be neat to not a cat guy.

5082
02:18:59,591 --> 02:18:59,861
Man.

5083
02:18:59,861 --> 02:19:00,700
I'm allergic to cats.

5084
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:01,001
I know.

5085
02:19:01,001 --> 02:19:01,834
It's weird.

5086
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,390
The one thing I don't like about level,

5087
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:04,263
never,

5088
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:05,610
never had a cat cat.

5089
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:08,010
I love them and I trust him to cats.

5090
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:09,663
You know what?

5091
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,000
You know what man is,

5092
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:13,150
I got to appreciate about cats.

5093
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:13,993
No.

5094
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:14,501
Hold on.

5095
02:19:14,501 --> 02:19:14,921
Watch this.

5096
02:19:14,921 --> 02:19:15,740
Watch this.

5097
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:16,810
Watch this Jaguar.

5098
02:19:16,811 --> 02:19:19,240
Sneak up on a crocodile jog.

5099
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:20,620
Jacked that mother fucker.

5100
02:19:20,621 --> 02:19:21,970
He eats crocodiles.

5101
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:22,730
Suck it.

5102
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:23,860
Fuck yeah.

5103
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:25,690
I'll look at the cre.

5104
02:19:25,691 --> 02:19:26,690
Don't fuck with Jak.

5105
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:27,590
Two guys don't know shit.

5106
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:28,700
Jags are no joke.

5107
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,220
Oh my God,

5108
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:31,400
they're about 250 pounds
by those so scared.

5109
02:19:31,401 --> 02:19:34,360
But this whole swayed me towards
liking cath cause you can't be like,

5110
02:19:34,361 --> 02:19:35,171
oh my house cat.

5111
02:19:35,171 --> 02:19:35,900
So like this,

5112
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:36,733
watch our water.

5113
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:37,900
Their water crackles,

5114
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,470
swims out their water.

5115
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:39,900
Babe.

5116
02:19:39,900 --> 02:19:43,780
When he's out to this little
fucking island and the Jaguars,

5117
02:19:44,910 --> 02:19:49,910
you big lizard wizard creeping
through the water and super slow.

5118
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:51,253
Watch this shit.

5119
02:19:53,330 --> 02:19:54,260
Fuck over here.

5120
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:56,360
He carries them off.

5121
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:56,870
Yay.

5122
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:57,703
Carries carries.

5123
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:00,300
Like you would carry a
roll of toilet paper.

5124
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:03,620
I look at it through the water.

5125
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:04,483
God,

5126
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:09,230
we can't show this house.

5127
02:20:09,231 --> 02:20:14,190
You can't show what duty grabs and
contracts and back in the day he knows

5128
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:17,260
the homeys.

5129
02:20:17,290 --> 02:20:19,190
He controls that body so well.

5130
02:20:19,191 --> 02:20:21,300
They just swims across the God damn ready.

5131
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:23,330
If you got a 10 year
old boy in a headlock,

5132
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:25,090
do you think you'd be worried
about swimming with them?

5133
02:20:27,050 --> 02:20:28,130
It could be a problem.

5134
02:20:28,870 --> 02:20:29,900
That can be a problem,

5135
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:33,640
dude.

5136
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:35,960
Those fucking Jaguars are so gangster,

5137
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:36,950
super gangs.

5138
02:20:36,951 --> 02:20:37,850
They're so gangster.

5139
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:39,380
I ask or do that.

5140
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:40,730
So with bears,

5141
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:42,530
because they don't have natural predators,

5142
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:44,330
they've nature is developed this,

5143
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,890
this really dark,

5144
02:20:45,891 --> 02:20:48,040
dark system where the males eat,

5145
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:48,883
the bait has,

5146
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:53,890
so the struggle is constantly the males
try and eat other babies in order to

5147
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:55,020
bring the woman back,

5148
02:20:55,050 --> 02:20:58,760
the female parents back into estrous so
he can meet with her and pass on his own

5149
02:20:58,761 --> 02:20:59,510
genetics.

5150
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:04,190
And just the fact that it's hard to
come by protein because they run fairly

5151
02:21:04,191 --> 02:21:04,611
quick,

5152
02:21:04,611 --> 02:21:06,290
but they don't run as quick as deer.

5153
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:11,090
So the only deer they get to eat
realistically or the babies or the injured

5154
02:21:11,091 --> 02:21:11,924
ones,

5155
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:13,070
mostly Fonz.

5156
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:18,160
So they say that bear in Alberta eat
50% of all moose calves and deer.

5157
02:21:19,731 --> 02:21:21,860
Fox got to kill him when we were,

5158
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:23,300
when we were in a Alaska,

5159
02:21:23,301 --> 02:21:27,980
we saw a female bear with her
cub and I came out with what yon?

5160
02:21:27,981 --> 02:21:28,814
What was his name?

5161
02:21:29,210 --> 02:21:30,043
You tell us.

5162
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:34,730
Said that probably what was going on with
she was keeping him in the highlands.

5163
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,350
Is Her,

5164
02:21:35,350 --> 02:21:36,870
her baby away from the males?

5165
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:38,240
Yeah,

5166
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:42,110
because she was keeping them up high way
too late in the season just to try to

5167
02:21:42,111 --> 02:21:45,760
protect his life because the males eat
them and then you say mother nature's a

5168
02:21:45,761 --> 02:21:46,260
motherfucker.

5169
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:47,120
That's what you're saying,

5170
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:48,650
mother nature a fucker.

5171
02:21:49,490 --> 02:21:49,940
Well,

5172
02:21:49,940 --> 02:21:51,950
what I'm saying is that
people who love animals,

5173
02:21:51,951 --> 02:21:53,390
the sentiment is beautiful,

5174
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:54,440
but when you,

5175
02:21:55,220 --> 02:22:00,220
when you really try to let
all your predisposed or
your preconceived notions or

5176
02:22:02,391 --> 02:22:03,320
morphic this,

5177
02:22:03,410 --> 02:22:05,960
then there's a little of
that putting given the us.

5178
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:07,940
It's not just anthropomorphic,

5179
02:22:07,941 --> 02:22:11,360
it's also even little love of actual
animals that are in your environment that

5180
02:22:11,361 --> 02:22:16,361
are not trying to eat you like squirrels
and birds and dogs and cats and pets

5181
02:22:17,091 --> 02:22:18,110
that you and I both have,

5182
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:18,944
we both love,

5183
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:22,790
but there's a big goddamn difference
between all of those things.

5184
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:24,110
And then the wild itself,

5185
02:22:24,111 --> 02:22:25,530
which is this weird system.

5186
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:26,100
Yeah,

5187
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,390
and it's weird system.

5188
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:31,140
Wildlife Biologists have studied this
weird system over decades and they've

5189
02:22:31,141 --> 02:22:36,141
concluded that there's some benefit to
removing certain dominant males from the

5190
02:22:37,051 --> 02:22:37,620
equation.

5191
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:38,670
And that's what you hunt.

5192
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:39,120
Right.

5193
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,260
And that's intended about Rhino,

5194
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:40,610
you know?

5195
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:40,720
Yeah.

5196
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:41,310
What's it,

5197
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:45,030
well that's one of the reasons why that
Cory Knowlton guy got off the hook,

5198
02:22:45,031 --> 02:22:45,950
whereas the,

5199
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:46,431
the,

5200
02:22:46,431 --> 02:22:48,660
the lion killer killer didn't.

5201
02:22:48,661 --> 02:22:48,900
Yes.

5202
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:49,290
Yes.

5203
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:50,670
They were going to kill that rhino anyway.

5204
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:53,010
Cause that rhino was
killing other male rhinos.

5205
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:53,220
Yeah.

5206
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,240
So Corey,

5207
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:59,120
in spending $250,000 plus two
to bid on killing that rhino,

5208
02:22:59,121 --> 02:23:03,270
rhino fed like a hundred fucking families.

5209
02:23:03,271 --> 02:23:03,750
Yes.

5210
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:05,670
Not only did he feed a hundred families,

5211
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:09,870
he gave $250,000 to conservation to
protect the rhinos and killed a rhino.

5212
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:10,800
They were going to have to kill it.

5213
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:11,070
Yes.

5214
02:23:11,070 --> 02:23:12,270
Which helps out the rhinos.

5215
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:13,061
It helps out the wrong,

5216
02:23:13,061 --> 02:23:16,500
but it's so complicated because you
would think that if you love rhinos,

5217
02:23:16,501 --> 02:23:19,290
the last thing we'd want to some
dude paying money to kill a rhino,

5218
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:19,801
you'd be like,

5219
02:23:19,801 --> 02:23:20,634
that's ridiculous.

5220
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:22,080
That's just the education.

5221
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:25,470
But when you say hunting takes out
the big males that kill all these,

5222
02:23:25,471 --> 02:23:26,250
that's what you hunt.

5223
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:26,940
How do,

5224
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:28,090
how can you tell the difference?

5225
02:23:28,091 --> 02:23:28,710
Just size.

5226
02:23:28,710 --> 02:23:30,090
That's what it 100%.

5227
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:31,800
You tell by size.

5228
02:23:31,801 --> 02:23:32,640
I tell by smell.

5229
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:33,450
Well,

5230
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:34,770
Brian is what's called game.

5231
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:37,320
I came by and came knows you fucks.

5232
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:37,831
Meanwhile,

5233
02:23:37,831 --> 02:23:38,790
hem browse about to fight.

5234
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:39,421
Jeremy Stevens,

5235
02:23:39,421 --> 02:23:40,620
the Goddamn Co main event.

5236
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:42,190
My Hana Barrao is,

5237
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:43,500
I'll see.

5238
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:46,590
I like saying the obvious things like
this guy's Hannah Brown was a good

5239
02:23:46,591 --> 02:23:46,980
fighter.

5240
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:48,180
That's what I say when I work.

5241
02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:48,751
This is,

5242
02:23:48,751 --> 02:23:49,770
I gotta be honest with you.

5243
02:23:49,771 --> 02:23:52,860
This is the number one argument from
me never doing commentary again.

5244
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:54,870
You get Pi this fast.

5245
02:23:54,900 --> 02:23:57,400
It's like a best for hammers where balls,

5246
02:23:58,030 --> 02:23:59,160
I'm going to say something really.

5247
02:23:59,161 --> 02:24:00,450
I'm going to say something really cheesy.

5248
02:24:00,630 --> 02:24:03,780
I had an overwhelming feeling of
kinship for all my friends here.

5249
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:04,741
I know it's Cheesy,

5250
02:24:04,741 --> 02:24:06,510
but I love all you guys.

5251
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:07,221
Dude.

5252
02:24:07,221 --> 02:24:07,990
There's a million.

5253
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:08,581
I'm not drunk.

5254
02:24:08,581 --> 02:24:10,640
I'm just saying that it's
the one in a million people,

5255
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:13,920
more than a million human beings is
going to listen to this and feel the same

5256
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:14,620
way.

5257
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:15,330
There you go.

5258
02:24:15,330 --> 02:24:18,990
Jeremy Stevens at and browse
a motherfucker of a fight
because Jeremy Stephens

5259
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,310
is ready to throw bombs.

5260
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:25,110
Super Confident and Hanan Barao first
time in one 45 not knowing exactly how

5261
02:24:25,111 --> 02:24:26,030
he's going to do it,

5262
02:24:26,050 --> 02:24:30,060
gets one of the best knockout strikers
in this division under browse more sales.

5263
02:24:30,061 --> 02:24:30,894
He's more skilled.

5264
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:31,813
Hey,

5265
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:32,673
don't say that.

5266
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:35,280
No Hennen browse a guy who
will trade and take shots.

5267
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:38,290
Can you Kenny take a shot from
Germany stealing the question?

5268
02:24:38,350 --> 02:24:39,183
He can

5269
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,690
max out at one 55 guys.

5270
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:46,020
Chip dos Anjos exactly
with a ruthless uppercuts.

5271
02:24:46,021 --> 02:24:48,410
Jeremy Stevens is no joke.

5272
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:52,380
Probably the hardest hit about 45 he's
one of easy and it's kind of a cracker

5273
02:24:52,381 --> 02:24:52,710
costs,

5274
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:55,140
I guess you've forgotten about the harsh
mocks or let me tell you something,

5275
02:24:55,141 --> 02:24:56,850
Connor verses this guy,

5276
02:24:57,030 --> 02:25:01,950
Jeremy Stevens versus Connor would be
fucking chaos and don't be surprised if

5277
02:25:01,951 --> 02:25:03,150
Jeremy Stevens wins.

5278
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:04,170
There's your fight.

5279
02:25:04,171 --> 02:25:04,321
If,

5280
02:25:04,321 --> 02:25:04,491
oh,

5281
02:25:04,491 --> 02:25:05,110
it's this.

5282
02:25:05,110 --> 02:25:06,240
My God,

5283
02:25:06,241 --> 02:25:08,470
I think I was going to be Jeremy Stephens.

5284
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:09,780
Shut the fuck.

5285
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:11,900
No idea what's going to happen.

5286
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:13,060
Neither do I can fight.

5287
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:14,100
I'm ready Brian.

5288
02:25:14,101 --> 02:25:15,200
No one knows what's going to happen.

5289
02:25:15,201 --> 02:25:15,990
I know exactly.

5290
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,220
There's,

5291
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:16,831
oh,

5292
02:25:16,831 --> 02:25:17,510
we just tagged them.

5293
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:20,640
The straight right guys keeping
his head down and correct.

5294
02:25:20,641 --> 02:25:23,130
Hit behind the ear or not a good place.

5295
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:24,003
Stevens.

5296
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:27,490
That's all.

5297
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:28,590
It's not an auction,

5298
02:25:28,590 --> 02:25:29,520
but somebody started singing.

5299
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:30,743
I'm up.

5300
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:31,571
Correct.

5301
02:25:31,571 --> 02:25:32,590
Hid behind the here.

5302
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:34,030
There's very few things going wrong.

5303
02:25:34,090 --> 02:25:35,740
I'm allowed to be obnoxious about it.

5304
02:25:35,741 --> 02:25:36,371
Other than calling.

5305
02:25:36,371 --> 02:25:37,204
You're my man.

5306
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:38,590
Oh,

5307
02:25:38,590 --> 02:25:39,010
I told,

5308
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:40,440
taught by Borow every time you get them.

5309
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:45,530
I told you Jeremy Stevens had like a
brick mine like a bit both by that left.

5310
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:46,983
He got tagged.

5311
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:48,070
Cow Looks Good.

5312
02:25:48,210 --> 02:25:48,740
Browse,

5313
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:49,300
browse,

5314
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:49,780
looks great.

5315
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:51,580
Have we forgotten how good morale as well.

5316
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,630
He was without a doubt,

5317
02:25:52,631 --> 02:25:57,420
one of the best in the world at one 35
and I think it's better for him at one 42

5318
02:25:57,430 --> 02:25:58,600
much of a piece for him to cut.

5319
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:00,020
They said they said it always killed him.

5320
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:04,070
So you know he might be a monster at 45
how about him verse all at four Oh five

5321
02:26:04,400 --> 02:26:05,740
all we know where he would never do.

5322
02:26:05,741 --> 02:26:07,270
They train them to be surprised.

5323
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:10,300
I don't want them to,

5324
02:26:10,570 --> 02:26:11,291
I don't want them to,

5325
02:26:11,291 --> 02:26:12,370
I don't want friends to fight.

5326
02:26:12,371 --> 02:26:13,204
I really don't.

5327
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:14,463
I don't like it.

5328
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:16,000
I'd be down for Tj,

5329
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:16,990
like it's kind of fun.

5330
02:26:17,050 --> 02:26:17,561
Oh,

5331
02:26:17,561 --> 02:26:18,590
Barao with the take down.

5332
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:21,820
I feel like it's kind of fun
that there's sacred things.

5333
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,250
I feel like it's kind of fun that
some people just won't check.

5334
02:26:24,251 --> 02:26:26,560
She and those guys think it's fun though.

5335
02:26:26,710 --> 02:26:28,680
I don't care what they think I know,

5336
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:30,580
but they make the match of stuff.

5337
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:31,900
I don't care.

5338
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:33,400
But my personal opinion,

5339
02:26:33,401 --> 02:26:33,731
I mean,

5340
02:26:33,731 --> 02:26:34,091
listen,

5341
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:34,531
I call it,

5342
02:26:34,531 --> 02:26:34,920
you know what?

5343
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:38,320
I love every matchup I call
every match up with with love.

5344
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:39,250
I love them all,

5345
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:40,480
but I don't personally,

5346
02:26:40,481 --> 02:26:41,530
I know a lot of these guys,

5347
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:42,500
I don't want to seen them fight there,

5348
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:43,690
but if Hennen Browne,

5349
02:26:43,691 --> 02:26:44,650
all those fighting,

5350
02:26:44,651 --> 02:26:45,261
you got to call it,

5351
02:26:45,261 --> 02:26:46,450
you ain't shit in less.

5352
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:47,281
This is what I want to say.

5353
02:26:47,281 --> 02:26:50,590
Unless they want to fight their
friends and they think it's okay.

5354
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:51,010
Like,

5355
02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:51,240
oh,

5356
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:52,270
[inaudible] Pena.

5357
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:54,700
Julianna Pena is very
close with Misha Tate.

5358
02:26:54,701 --> 02:26:58,480
And apparently Julianna Pena said I
would fight her for the title and if she

5359
02:26:58,481 --> 02:27:00,100
wins her next fight and
I expect her to win,

5360
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:01,240
I'll fight it for the title.

5361
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:01,601
Oh,

5362
02:27:01,601 --> 02:27:02,200
so you're cool.

5363
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:03,000
And they're cool with it?

5364
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:03,350
Yeah,

5365
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:04,390
because they're both cool with it.

5366
02:27:04,391 --> 02:27:06,890
Apparently they realize it's business
that's life changing and they'll,

5367
02:27:07,180 --> 02:27:09,760
and they'll go back to being friends
and being cool with each other.

5368
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,760
I,

5369
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:13,360
where's Tim Kennedy
and why is he not fire?

5370
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:13,781
Jim?

5371
02:27:13,781 --> 02:27:15,340
Tim Kennedy is still serving.

5372
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:15,940
Oh,

5373
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:18,250
Tim Kennedy is still
involved in multiple things.

5374
02:27:18,251 --> 02:27:19,510
You can't talk about it,

5375
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:20,850
but he's also trying to get a fight.

5376
02:27:20,851 --> 02:27:21,170
Yeah.

5377
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:23,380
And they haven't given him mad
and he would take a fight again.

5378
02:27:23,410 --> 02:27:24,310
And you know there's,

5379
02:27:24,370 --> 02:27:25,690
there's a legit problem,

5380
02:27:25,691 --> 02:27:26,740
I don't want to start any noise,

5381
02:27:26,741 --> 02:27:30,100
but Tim Kennedy is a very vocal critic
of all sorts of different things.

5382
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,233
You listen,

5383
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:35,110
Tim Kennedy is a legit war hero and you,

5384
02:27:35,240 --> 02:27:35,490
you,

5385
02:27:35,490 --> 02:27:39,360
you can't get legit war
heroes to play games now.

5386
02:27:39,550 --> 02:27:40,820
But also when they speak,

5387
02:27:41,170 --> 02:27:41,820
you speak,

5388
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:42,491
it matters.

5389
02:27:42,491 --> 02:27:42,941
You know what I'm saying?

5390
02:27:42,941 --> 02:27:43,270
He's,

5391
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:44,350
he's a critical thinker.

5392
02:27:44,351 --> 02:27:44,951
He's not a hater.

5393
02:27:44,951 --> 02:27:45,940
He's a critical thinker.

5394
02:27:46,350 --> 02:27:47,183
Nice level.

5395
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:47,830
He is.

5396
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:48,663
And at the,

5397
02:27:48,670 --> 02:27:49,630
at the highest level,

5398
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:50,110
every,

5399
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,801
every sport,

5400
02:27:50,801 --> 02:27:51,790
every endeavor,

5401
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,950
every application in your own,

5402
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:56,050
your own creativity and your own ideals.

5403
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:59,500
But whatever you're trying to pursue in
this life should be done to the highest

5404
02:27:59,501 --> 02:27:59,711
level.

5405
02:27:59,711 --> 02:28:02,080
So all criticism should be
taken into consideration,

5406
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:03,910
whether it's valid or invalid.

5407
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:06,100
And a guy like Tim Kennedy,

5408
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:07,570
I think is an important voice.

5409
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:09,940
He's an important voice cause
he's a legit human being.

5410
02:28:09,941 --> 02:28:10,121
I mean,

5411
02:28:10,121 --> 02:28:10,361
he's a,

5412
02:28:10,361 --> 02:28:11,950
is legit as a man gets

5413
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:16,660
humid American in the
fucking UFC for what he does.

5414
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:17,890
He's one of them for sure.

5415
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:19,690
Everyone falls short and they should.

5416
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,291
They should.

5417
02:28:20,291 --> 02:28:21,124
He's legit.

5418
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:22,100
I mean,

5419
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,200
I've legit like massive respect,

5420
02:28:24,201 --> 02:28:27,620
fair minded guy and he's a
smart dude and you know it.

5421
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:28,640
You need people like that,

5422
02:28:28,641 --> 02:28:28,940
man.

5423
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:29,810
Don't think you don't.

5424
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:31,400
Cause there's people like
that and the other side,

5425
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:32,930
it's people like that in the world.

5426
02:28:32,931 --> 02:28:34,250
And the ideally,

5427
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:34,551
yes,

5428
02:28:34,551 --> 02:28:36,170
we would all love peace and love,

5429
02:28:36,410 --> 02:28:40,910
but occasionally you have to deal with
assholes and often you have to realize

5430
02:28:40,911 --> 02:28:45,530
that there's religious zealots and crazy
people [inaudible] women about isis and

5431
02:28:45,531 --> 02:28:46,490
see how nice people are,

5432
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:49,250
but just how badly they'd love to
have a guy like fucking tenders.

5433
02:28:49,251 --> 02:28:50,270
All throughout history,

5434
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:50,571
man.

5435
02:28:50,571 --> 02:28:51,540
Would you say about Isis?

5436
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:52,371
Well,

5437
02:28:52,371 --> 02:28:54,560
the Yazidi's what they did
to that community and Iraq,

5438
02:28:54,561 --> 02:28:56,780
the Yazidi women were always
considered the most beautiful women.

5439
02:28:56,781 --> 02:28:57,710
They had fair hair,

5440
02:28:57,711 --> 02:28:58,550
blue eyes.

5441
02:28:58,900 --> 02:28:59,733
He arrives.

5442
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:01,760
I'm not hearing great hair and big tits.

5443
02:29:01,761 --> 02:29:04,620
I don't even know what
the fuck you're saying.

5444
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:05,540
It's not serious

5445
02:29:07,770 --> 02:29:08,400
beauty.

5446
02:29:08,400 --> 02:29:12,200
What a moment mentee white skin where
you could see your whole hand print when

5447
02:29:12,201 --> 02:29:12,831
you spank them.

5448
02:29:12,831 --> 02:29:13,551
Hey man,

5449
02:29:13,551 --> 02:29:14,384
did you say,

5450
02:29:15,350 --> 02:29:16,190
hey bro,

5451
02:29:16,250 --> 02:29:16,611
sir,

5452
02:29:16,611 --> 02:29:19,430
I did not say Iranian chicks,

5453
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:20,740
but if you didn't say that all,

5454
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:22,400
I'm really cute.

5455
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:23,730
I don't understand what you're saying.

5456
02:29:23,900 --> 02:29:26,390
That part of the wall has done some of
the most beautiful women on the planet

5457
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:30,170
and lighting on wire a
paper with red nail Polish.

5458
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:31,641
Did you just say that?

5459
02:29:31,641 --> 02:29:31,730
Oh,

5460
02:29:31,730 --> 02:29:32,511
I didn't say that.

5461
02:29:32,511 --> 02:29:33,344
Sorry.

5462
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:34,660
And asked to,

5463
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:36,260
to waist ratio.

5464
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,800
Yes.

5465
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:41,510
That's always a very believes a man
like a sports as to waist ratio.

5466
02:29:41,511 --> 02:29:41,951
What is that?

5467
02:29:41,951 --> 02:29:42,741
That that'll kill you.

5468
02:29:42,741 --> 02:29:43,650
That'll stop it man.

5469
02:29:43,651 --> 02:29:44,484
And His fucking,

5470
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:45,790
that'll ruin your whole life.

5471
02:29:45,791 --> 02:29:48,230
A buddy of mine was telling
me about his girlfriend does,

5472
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:50,780
girl relativity was dating and they,

5473
02:29:50,781 --> 02:29:51,200
you know,

5474
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,150
they got to know each other,

5475
02:29:52,170 --> 02:29:55,270
went out a few times and one day
they went back to her place and uh,

5476
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:55,940
she,

5477
02:29:55,940 --> 02:29:56,241
she,

5478
02:29:56,241 --> 02:29:58,190
her waist was too big
and it freaked him out.

5479
02:29:58,570 --> 02:29:59,403
It's a prompt.

5480
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:00,373
It's fuck,

5481
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,120
fuck with them.

5482
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,051
He's like,

5483
02:30:03,051 --> 02:30:03,831
she's really cool,

5484
02:30:03,831 --> 02:30:05,030
but her waist was too thick.

5485
02:30:05,031 --> 02:30:05,421
I was like,

5486
02:30:05,421 --> 02:30:06,600
what's it been a ladies man?

5487
02:30:06,601 --> 02:30:06,950
I know.

5488
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:07,041
Well,

5489
02:30:07,041 --> 02:30:07,670
she wasn't even,

5490
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:08,370
I guess so.

5491
02:30:08,370 --> 02:30:09,130
It must have been,

5492
02:30:09,130 --> 02:30:11,180
but she wasn't even overweight.

5493
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:13,250
It's just like he didn't
like to her dementia.

5494
02:30:13,251 --> 02:30:14,330
I've had that situation.

5495
02:30:14,331 --> 02:30:15,410
I had a girl take her clothes off.

5496
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:17,241
Hold on,

5497
02:30:17,241 --> 02:30:17,601
hold on.

5498
02:30:17,601 --> 02:30:18,170
What happened?

5499
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:19,550
I said I had a girl take her clothes off.

5500
02:30:19,590 --> 02:30:20,391
She had a hairy ass.

5501
02:30:20,391 --> 02:30:21,260
I've talked about it before.

5502
02:30:21,261 --> 02:30:23,140
She was blowing her asshole.

5503
02:30:23,380 --> 02:30:24,140
No,

5504
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:24,531
I'm sorry.

5505
02:30:24,531 --> 02:30:27,140
She had a ducktail her cheeks she had,

5506
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:27,830
she had,

5507
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:29,630
she had black hairs on her rump.

5508
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:30,480
Like our Lawsky.

5509
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:30,740
Yup.

5510
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:31,550
And guess what I did?

5511
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:32,560
I faked a stomach ache.

5512
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,220
I would have fucked her
like she was a female where?

5513
02:30:35,221 --> 02:30:37,850
Well after I came I picked her stuff like,

5514
02:30:37,851 --> 02:30:38,684
Hey,

5515
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:40,520
I got me

5516
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:42,891
fucked her.

5517
02:30:42,891 --> 02:30:44,570
Like I was trying to make her evolve.

5518
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:50,330
I was trying to help her bring her up.

5519
02:30:50,331 --> 02:30:51,470
Pass the Paleolithic.

5520
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:53,080
When you're younger you
don't give a fuck around.

5521
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:57,050
Dumped some caveman loads

5522
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:01,370
just here all over ass cheeks.

5523
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:01,670
Yup,

5524
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,600
that's right for my friend.

5525
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:06,030
And she had a white girl.

5526
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:07,101
I didn't mind that,

5527
02:31:07,101 --> 02:31:08,390
but she had a huge Dick.

5528
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,410
Literally breath tastes
like a lot of common,

5529
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:13,250
a lot of comm.

5530
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:13,461
Nay.

5531
02:31:13,461 --> 02:31:16,040
She was a white girl B
and she had a big beard,

5532
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:17,030
but she's a great girl.

5533
02:31:17,930 --> 02:31:18,441
Other than that,

5534
02:31:18,441 --> 02:31:19,620
she was a pretty pretty girl.

5535
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:21,860
He didn't get past the
Dick and then the beer now.

5536
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:23,520
I thought she was
fucking a wonderful girl.

5537
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:25,073
Bad mouth her,

5538
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:26,011
but I couldn't.

5539
02:31:26,011 --> 02:31:27,120
We only did it for like six months.

5540
02:31:27,121 --> 02:31:28,550
Tops had smelly feet too.

5541
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:29,713
Yeah.

5542
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:34,080
It's a matter of feet
and she wore diapers.

5543
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:36,820
Jab.

5544
02:31:36,820 --> 02:31:37,840
You look at his ship.

5545
02:31:39,050 --> 02:31:40,800
An animated cartoon of Joey.

5546
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:42,080
Oh,

5547
02:31:42,081 --> 02:31:43,140
he just got caught.

5548
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:48,200
That's what Henry just got caught in a
Chen got do this and and brow got right

5549
02:31:49,610 --> 02:31:50,240
channels.

5550
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:52,050
Can we cut son?

5551
02:31:52,051 --> 02:31:52,710
There's nother one.

5552
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:54,030
Stephen's really needs to work on.

5553
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,190
Oh,

5554
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:56,280
browse and trouble.

5555
02:31:56,281 --> 02:31:57,114
He's in trouble.

5556
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:58,080
He was wobbly before.

5557
02:31:58,081 --> 02:31:59,760
Stan is still in front of them too,

5558
02:31:59,761 --> 02:31:59,971
man.

5559
02:31:59,971 --> 02:32:00,900
He's got to move.

5560
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:02,550
Jeremy is going to time him.

5561
02:32:02,551 --> 02:32:04,600
He's head just got tagged.

5562
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:05,410
We'll browse.

5563
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:06,121
Looking to fire back.

5564
02:32:06,121 --> 02:32:06,900
Maybe it's not as hers.

5565
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,720
We think he's,

5566
02:32:07,720 --> 02:32:08,090
he's actually,

5567
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:08,530
he's playing.

5568
02:32:08,530 --> 02:32:09,690
He's playing like he's on Queer Street.

5569
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:11,820
He'd come over the top
three definitely got hurt,

5570
02:32:11,821 --> 02:32:15,780
but you got to think this dude is a
Nova Uniao fighter and one of the things

5571
02:32:15,781 --> 02:32:17,560
about those training camps and Nolan Yao,

5572
02:32:17,561 --> 02:32:19,490
those guys go to war or stop.

5573
02:32:19,491 --> 02:32:21,450
They stopped all the pressure.

5574
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:23,191
Boy,

5575
02:32:23,191 --> 02:32:24,660
that's hard to believe now.

5576
02:32:24,661 --> 02:32:24,841
Yeah,

5577
02:32:24,841 --> 02:32:25,531
that's their style,

5578
02:32:25,531 --> 02:32:25,830
right?

5579
02:32:25,830 --> 02:32:26,730
It's what your culture

5580
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:29,250
is established.

5581
02:32:29,251 --> 02:32:33,060
He's a strong fund at 55 well he fought
a 55 and really struggles to get down to

5582
02:32:33,061 --> 02:32:38,040
45 was Barao was fighting
at 35 and struggled there
and it's more comfortable at

5583
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:41,040
45 so Steven's a thicker bone character.

5584
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:41,780
Yes.

5585
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:42,240
I think.

5586
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,920
I believe he's an inch taller too.

5587
02:32:44,410 --> 02:32:46,410
It looks at how we,

5588
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:47,260
it's fine.

5589
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:50,640
The height and weight are these guys.

5590
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:51,091
Yeah.

5591
02:32:51,091 --> 02:32:51,924
Jamie.

5592
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:53,100
Jamie,

5593
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:53,933
please.

5594
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:55,230
Shaming please.

5595
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,093
Jamie,

5596
02:32:56,430 --> 02:32:57,181
what does it say?

5597
02:32:57,181 --> 02:33:01,170
Height 71 seven that was quite a
five six and five nine this is a big

5598
02:33:01,171 --> 02:33:01,560
difference.

5599
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:02,190
What is this?

5600
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:03,840
59 inches?

5601
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:07,000
First is not five six 60 69 inches.

5602
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:08,610
Fucking in his gut.

5603
02:33:08,700 --> 02:33:08,851
Ooh,

5604
02:33:08,851 --> 02:33:09,570
that's rough.

5605
02:33:09,570 --> 02:33:10,141
That's five.

5606
02:33:10,141 --> 02:33:11,820
Seven that's five six isn't it?

5607
02:33:12,150 --> 02:33:16,500
(609) 595-6960 six is five six.

5608
02:33:16,501 --> 02:33:18,740
That's why I said is five feelings.

5609
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:21,810
Like he's admitted
Hixon Gracie AB workout,

5610
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,530
any of sucking it up pretty fast.

5611
02:33:23,550 --> 02:33:25,290
He got 69 is five nine,

5612
02:33:25,291 --> 02:33:25,591
right?

5613
02:33:25,591 --> 02:33:29,100
Because 12 inch and five six
and five nine and then 66 so,

5614
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:29,934
okay.

5615
02:33:30,210 --> 02:33:30,511
Five,

5616
02:33:30,511 --> 02:33:31,410
nine and five six.

5617
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:34,980
But when you look at them and in Borow
doesn't look that much shorter than him.

5618
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:35,611
It just,

5619
02:33:35,611 --> 02:33:38,800
he looks like more slender
and not as like thick,

5620
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:40,093
like definitely

5621
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:43,710
hard when you're bending
at the knees and moving.

5622
02:33:43,711 --> 02:33:44,450
Correct.

5623
02:33:44,450 --> 02:33:46,290
Thick is Grau has a wider stance.

5624
02:33:46,410 --> 02:33:46,840
Ooh,

5625
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:47,673
backache.

5626
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:52,080
My vision is getting so shitty that it's
hard for me to tell what that blown up

5627
02:33:52,410 --> 02:33:53,243
we're getting all of us,

5628
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:56,210
whether it says 69
inches or five foot nine.

5629
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:56,670
I mean,

5630
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:57,630
I have beautiful eyes.

5631
02:33:58,050 --> 02:34:01,020
It's like just at that point
where the six is blurry,

5632
02:34:01,230 --> 02:34:02,310
even as big as it is.

5633
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:03,540
Hampson so depressing.

5634
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:04,530
So you'll wear glasses?

5635
02:34:04,740 --> 02:34:06,810
I bread them only when I read things.

5636
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:08,280
What about the laser show clothes?

5637
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:09,173
And that's no good.

5638
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:10,470
It's,

5639
02:34:10,470 --> 02:34:13,350
but it's only good for certain types of,

5640
02:34:13,351 --> 02:34:14,184
um,

5641
02:34:14,250 --> 02:34:16,260
Connie's well issues with your,

5642
02:34:16,261 --> 02:34:16,591
your,

5643
02:34:16,591 --> 02:34:16,990
um,

5644
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,823
your retina.

5645
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:18,070
So

5646
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:21,000
you're traveling long distances now.

5647
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:21,641
Much more.

5648
02:34:21,641 --> 02:34:22,630
It's close distances,

5649
02:34:22,631 --> 02:34:23,680
but even long distance,

5650
02:34:23,681 --> 02:34:24,290
not so hot.

5651
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:26,560
I have no problem with long closer if,

5652
02:34:26,561 --> 02:34:27,040
no,

5653
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,710
I still probably have pretty good vision.

5654
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:31,270
Like I see you crystal clear.

5655
02:34:31,271 --> 02:34:32,104
I see you a Christian.

5656
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:33,611
I can read it,

5657
02:34:33,611 --> 02:34:34,080
but it's,

5658
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,360
it's,

5659
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:34,721
there's a,

5660
02:34:34,721 --> 02:34:38,590
there's a certain amount
of aura to the numbers.

5661
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:38,890
He said,

5662
02:34:38,890 --> 02:34:39,660
not clear.

5663
02:34:39,660 --> 02:34:41,710
It's like say sick gave
it to me on lights.

5664
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:44,650
I'll put these glasses
on and Bam and money.

5665
02:34:44,651 --> 02:34:45,100
It's crystal.

5666
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:46,660
So just wear those like Malcolm X.

5667
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:47,493
Okay.

5668
02:34:47,730 --> 02:34:48,510
Like man,

5669
02:34:48,510 --> 02:34:49,130
just shit.

5670
02:34:49,130 --> 02:34:49,450
No,

5671
02:34:49,450 --> 02:34:49,961
that's your shit.

5672
02:34:49,961 --> 02:34:54,730
Now they get in the way that my contacts
off for good and fuck the contacts.

5673
02:34:54,731 --> 02:34:57,040
I would just want to cook
glasses this year for sure.

5674
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:57,490
Feel lucky.

5675
02:34:57,490 --> 02:34:59,140
I don't have the money
to do lasik eventually.

5676
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:02,650
But your problem with lasix is like
Kathy Griffin and a real issue with it.

5677
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:04,560
Apparently she's the Brown.

5678
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:06,440
He's a crisp.

5679
02:35:06,450 --> 02:35:07,360
Ben Wa have lasik.

5680
02:35:07,390 --> 02:35:07,790
Right.

5681
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:08,750
And Brown wouldn't say town,

5682
02:35:08,751 --> 02:35:09,584
but Jeremy Steals.

5683
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:10,490
Oh boy.

5684
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:11,950
I'll look and take that back.

5685
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:13,121
Don't kid yourself.

5686
02:35:13,121 --> 02:35:14,550
Jeremy Stevens passed his seat.

5687
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:18,250
Where are you at this bigger Stevens is
also a training partner for Dominick.

5688
02:35:18,251 --> 02:35:20,170
Cruz is training at alliance.

5689
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:20,471
I mean,

5690
02:35:20,471 --> 02:35:22,420
he's down there with l Eric Dolphy Futuro.

5691
02:35:22,421 --> 02:35:24,730
One of the most underrated
coaches in the world.

5692
02:35:25,330 --> 02:35:26,163
Mountain Matt.

5693
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:27,113
Yeah.

5694
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:29,080
Melanzane went to black house,

5695
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:29,943
didn't he?

5696
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:30,150
Uh,

5697
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:30,941
he goes to both.

5698
02:35:30,941 --> 02:35:31,470
I remember.

5699
02:35:31,470 --> 02:35:31,570
Oh,

5700
02:35:31,570 --> 02:35:31,901
he goes back.

5701
02:35:31,901 --> 02:35:32,830
He was there forever.

5702
02:35:32,831 --> 02:35:34,590
Maybe he is that black house too,

5703
02:35:34,591 --> 02:35:35,231
was there forever.

5704
02:35:35,231 --> 02:35:37,400
But I think they brought him
in the black house in normal.

5705
02:35:37,410 --> 02:35:37,910
Jay was,

5706
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:39,860
is out of a alliance camp there.

5707
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:40,713
They're monsters.

5708
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:42,880
Gustafson was down there with him.

5709
02:35:42,881 --> 02:35:43,840
They brought Pearson.

5710
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:45,160
Did they give to us when a fight?

5711
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:49,390
I feel like they feel like Gustafson just
said something about not knowing what

5712
02:35:49,391 --> 02:35:50,130
he's doing.

5713
02:35:50,130 --> 02:35:51,310
I thought he said he lost the,

5714
02:35:51,311 --> 02:35:51,570
uh,

5715
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:52,460
does the drive right.

5716
02:35:52,470 --> 02:35:53,011
So he went,

5717
02:35:53,011 --> 02:35:57,040
he flew from Sweden to San Diego to see
if the fire was still there and he still

5718
02:35:57,041 --> 02:35:57,611
was questioned.

5719
02:35:57,611 --> 02:35:58,444
I,

5720
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,083
oh man.

5721
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:01,270
I think he comes from money.

5722
02:36:01,300 --> 02:36:03,010
That's the of the thing is he's got a lot.

5723
02:36:03,011 --> 02:36:03,780
How dare you just be?

5724
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:04,690
I don't think so.

5725
02:36:04,990 --> 02:36:05,171
No,

5726
02:36:05,171 --> 02:36:05,801
I think he does.

5727
02:36:05,801 --> 02:36:07,030
I think it's not even real money.

5728
02:36:07,031 --> 02:36:07,350
It's like,

5729
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:07,530
no,

5730
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:08,350
these families are,

5731
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:09,280
she has a lot of money.

5732
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:09,460
Yeah,

5733
02:36:09,460 --> 02:36:10,280
but it's not even an immense.

5734
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:12,370
He was always a kind of a
problem child growing up,

5735
02:36:12,670 --> 02:36:14,170
but now he's a superstar.

5736
02:36:14,690 --> 02:36:15,600
Hardge and sweet.

5737
02:36:15,610 --> 02:36:18,550
It's hard to go back to that training
when you're already kind of arrived.

5738
02:36:18,551 --> 02:36:19,990
People from Stockholm and to listening.

5739
02:36:19,991 --> 02:36:21,310
I was only joking about your money.

5740
02:36:21,370 --> 02:36:23,720
He's the stuff Brian
didn't hear it do like,

5741
02:36:23,880 --> 02:36:24,910
what do you think's American

5742
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,000
tax revenue is?

5743
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,460
The only money is that
it is a high tax rate.

5744
02:36:30,461 --> 02:36:31,540
It's like something like crazy.

5745
02:36:31,541 --> 02:36:32,860
Like 60% no,

5746
02:36:32,890 --> 02:36:33,910
that's not what I'm saying Brian.

5747
02:36:33,911 --> 02:36:35,170
I'm saying Americans better.

5748
02:36:35,230 --> 02:36:36,063
Yeah,

5749
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:38,350
she's Merrick's son.

5750
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:39,920
I don't care about their fucking tax rate.

5751
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:42,720
Only pay 1% taxes.

5752
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:43,541
You could suck my Dick.

5753
02:36:43,541 --> 02:36:45,490
You have to live in Scotland
or wherever the hell you lift.

5754
02:36:46,990 --> 02:36:47,823
Put such in.

5755
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:54,420
Stockholm is a beautiful sleeping
and swimming in the water there.

5756
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:55,283
I've been there.

5757
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:56,620
You might as well be living on the moon.

5758
02:36:57,850 --> 02:36:58,810
Excuse me.

5759
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:00,730
I did two shows back home.

5760
02:37:00,731 --> 02:37:01,564
I'm sorry.

5761
02:37:01,610 --> 02:37:02,351
I'm sorry.

5762
02:37:02,351 --> 02:37:03,070
I'm outraged.

5763
02:37:03,070 --> 02:37:04,390
I did two shows in Stockholm.

5764
02:37:04,540 --> 02:37:06,250
I was supposed to come in
here and come from money.

5765
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:08,103
I didn't hear that.

5766
02:37:08,200 --> 02:37:09,400
He's a fucking monster.

5767
02:37:09,890 --> 02:37:10,800
He'd go to war with John.

5768
02:37:10,830 --> 02:37:11,730
John Rich,

5769
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:13,410
trust me and trust comes from.

5770
02:37:13,630 --> 02:37:14,620
Why don't you Google it?

5771
02:37:14,621 --> 02:37:15,381
Don't say me.

5772
02:37:15,381 --> 02:37:15,771
Trust me.

5773
02:37:15,771 --> 02:37:17,940
If you're not sure I'm better
than Google and what are,

5774
02:37:17,941 --> 02:37:20,030
you should have an inside scoop
on that to be honest with you.

5775
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:20,451
No.

5776
02:37:20,451 --> 02:37:24,860
Do you really do that guy
probably hates on him.

5777
02:37:26,390 --> 02:37:27,680
The guy he comes from,

5778
02:37:27,681 --> 02:37:29,180
I'm not saying he comes from billions,

5779
02:37:29,181 --> 02:37:31,400
but he comes from a well
to do family as well.

5780
02:37:31,401 --> 02:37:32,234
It's not a bad thing.

5781
02:37:32,410 --> 02:37:33,980
I'm not saying anything bad about them.

5782
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:34,261
That's it.

5783
02:37:34,261 --> 02:37:34,851
It's a good thing.

5784
02:37:34,851 --> 02:37:36,020
It comes from a good family.

5785
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:40,540
A successful farm is very
successful and apparently he was a,

5786
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,410
I guess he had some problems growing up.

5787
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:43,100
Okay,

5788
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:43,411
hold on.

5789
02:37:43,411 --> 02:37:44,330
You know you have a phone,

5790
02:37:44,331 --> 02:37:44,780
right?

5791
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:45,200
Yeah.

5792
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:46,190
Why don't you look that up?

5793
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:46,550
Well,

5794
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:46,850
what do I,

5795
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:47,570
how do I look it up?

5796
02:37:47,570 --> 02:37:50,270
It's Google Alexander
Gustafson's childhood.

5797
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:51,130
I have 1%.

5798
02:37:51,130 --> 02:37:51,560
Well,

5799
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:52,190
oh my God.

5800
02:37:52,190 --> 02:37:53,240
Plug it into bed too late.

5801
02:37:53,480 --> 02:37:54,530
Just plug it in man.

5802
02:37:54,710 --> 02:37:58,250
I just don't feel like young
Jamie would find that young Jamie.

5803
02:37:58,251 --> 02:37:59,060
We'll find it.

5804
02:37:59,060 --> 02:37:59,893
Here's the deal.

5805
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:02,720
I think he's a spectacular person,

5806
02:38:02,721 --> 02:38:06,230
so I don't want to disparage his
background and if he did come up from a

5807
02:38:06,231 --> 02:38:08,050
hardscrabble existence even more in,

5808
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:11,720
the last thing I want to hear is
the kid over there making shit,

5809
02:38:11,721 --> 02:38:13,470
talking shit and making things though.

5810
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:14,091
He's a billionaire.

5811
02:38:14,091 --> 02:38:17,460
He says this God father's uncle gates.

5812
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:19,070
They'll get uncle gates.

5813
02:38:19,610 --> 02:38:20,421
Jeremy Stevens,

5814
02:38:20,421 --> 02:38:21,440
dropping bows,

5815
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:23,810
dropping knees on John Brown.

5816
02:38:24,020 --> 02:38:27,500
Light heavyweight needs with stream
in the running since tough guy.

5817
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:29,300
That's a real tough guy.

5818
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,700
One of the best thing I'll close.

5819
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:33,440
He was to winning a world
title and a true blonde.

5820
02:38:33,441 --> 02:38:34,550
I call him the true blonde.

5821
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:38,840
Truly beat beat Manama with no one had,

5822
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:39,860
you know,

5823
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:42,900
I mean he took a fight with
manual and man one is Jimmy Manna.

5824
02:38:42,901 --> 02:38:44,150
What was knocking out anybody?

5825
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:45,390
Everybody uh,

5826
02:38:45,430 --> 02:38:46,010
penance.

5827
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:46,641
Bleeding man.

5828
02:38:46,641 --> 02:38:47,680
What happened man?

5829
02:38:47,690 --> 02:38:50,030
Stevens is just basically got in a fight.

5830
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:53,490
What happened

5831
02:38:56,210 --> 02:39:00,200
had an is having trouble
hurting Stevens with this damn.

5832
02:39:00,201 --> 02:39:01,730
He's got a big head and Jeremy,

5833
02:39:02,470 --> 02:39:03,303
oh,

5834
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:04,011
he can just,

5835
02:39:04,011 --> 02:39:05,420
he can kind of walk through it.

5836
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:07,130
Keep pressure on him like this.

5837
02:39:08,090 --> 02:39:08,610
Ouch.

5838
02:39:08,610 --> 02:39:09,443
Ouch.

5839
02:39:09,630 --> 02:39:09,830
Yeah.

5840
02:39:09,830 --> 02:39:10,663
He said,

5841
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:12,081
Oh boy,

5842
02:39:12,081 --> 02:39:14,240
he loves us a damn upper cut does.

5843
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:14,631
Well,

5844
02:39:14,631 --> 02:39:17,590
I mean it's one of his most
spectacular highlight real case,

5845
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,490
so you never drove it to the UFC.

5846
02:39:19,491 --> 02:39:22,340
Starts adding CGI blood like live.

5847
02:39:22,341 --> 02:39:24,590
They can do it like snap chat filters.

5848
02:39:24,591 --> 02:39:28,220
Now imagine if you could take 'em down.

5849
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:31,860
Rash guards filters down to a man.

5850
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:36,230
If you could watch the UFC through
snapchat and you could make a Brad Pitt

5851
02:39:36,231 --> 02:39:39,560
filter erratic and Angelina Jolie,

5852
02:39:39,630 --> 02:39:41,090
we're duking it out to the death.

5853
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:41,330
Oh,

5854
02:39:41,330 --> 02:39:42,950
you put Angelina his head,

5855
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,160
you can use their bodies.

5856
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:48,980
You can make like cyborgs body.

5857
02:39:49,310 --> 02:39:50,840
Like you could have cyborg fight.

5858
02:39:50,841 --> 02:39:51,651
Cain Velasquez,

5859
02:39:51,651 --> 02:39:53,060
next time for doing fights cane.

5860
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:54,650
She's turning to Cyborg.

5861
02:39:55,220 --> 02:39:57,990
He was like really into watching
the girl beat the fuck out here.

5862
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:02,240
Hey you bastards and African this fight.

5863
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:03,111
Let me ask a question.

5864
02:40:03,111 --> 02:40:05,720
Girl from frozen ANA for frozen.

5865
02:40:05,721 --> 02:40:07,520
That can be who's fighting and winning.

5866
02:40:08,550 --> 02:40:08,870
Oh,

5867
02:40:08,870 --> 02:40:10,340
those snapchat filters are crazy,

5868
02:40:10,341 --> 02:40:10,780
man.

5869
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:11,250
Crying.

5870
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:12,230
You could take your face,

5871
02:40:12,231 --> 02:40:12,680
put it on,

5872
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:13,080
on,

5873
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:13,913
on uh,

5874
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:15,200
chavs body.

5875
02:40:15,230 --> 02:40:16,440
I know he could say anything.

5876
02:40:16,700 --> 02:40:18,450
I was as Brian Cowen,

5877
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,430
I'm going to even with
a good knee to the body.

5878
02:40:20,431 --> 02:40:21,390
I don't fuck with snapchat.

5879
02:40:21,391 --> 02:40:22,050
Do you Joe?

5880
02:40:22,050 --> 02:40:22,261
No,

5881
02:40:22,261 --> 02:40:23,370
I did not either do I?

5882
02:40:23,550 --> 02:40:27,120
You guys should do an episode where
you play each other the whole time.

5883
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:27,841
You're in character.

5884
02:40:27,841 --> 02:40:29,070
You're like Kelly cow.

5885
02:40:29,210 --> 02:40:29,620
The whole,

5886
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:30,453
it's a bad idea.

5887
02:40:30,470 --> 02:40:31,303
Nobody kicked me.

5888
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:32,101
Yeah,

5889
02:40:32,101 --> 02:40:32,934
you're right.

5890
02:40:32,980 --> 02:40:34,650
That's a good episode for three DB.

5891
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:36,420
Patty Jenkins says hi to you.

5892
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:37,140
She's done.

5893
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:37,440
She's,

5894
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:38,970
she's been directing wonder woman.

5895
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:40,250
I don't give a fuck about wonder woman.

5896
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:41,370
Patty,

5897
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:41,850
can we,

5898
02:40:41,850 --> 02:40:45,300
can we salute to the fighter and the kid
making it to number one on the Itunes

5899
02:40:45,301 --> 02:40:46,590
TV show last night?

5900
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:49,800
Oh No.

5901
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:50,940
I've no idea too.

5902
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:53,670
You guys are number one
on iTunes comedy TV.

5903
02:40:53,671 --> 02:40:54,770
That's kind of incredible.

5904
02:40:54,810 --> 02:40:55,501
It's kind of crazy,

5905
02:40:55,501 --> 02:40:56,071
but you know what?

5906
02:40:56,071 --> 02:40:56,521
We're proud of.

5907
02:40:56,521 --> 02:40:58,320
What we've kind of crazy.

5908
02:40:58,321 --> 02:40:59,250
That's incredible.

5909
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,480
You're not number three.

5910
02:41:00,710 --> 02:41:01,100
You're not.

5911
02:41:01,100 --> 02:41:01,950
Number six,

5912
02:41:02,290 --> 02:41:02,930
he gives him,

5913
02:41:02,930 --> 02:41:03,840
you're not number two.

5914
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:06,060
I got to start taking
my success and I don't.

5915
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:09,450
I always think of myself as a
failure and definitely a failure.

5916
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:10,321
I am definitely a failure,

5917
02:41:10,321 --> 02:41:12,790
but at least that it's just about,

5918
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:15,330
it's about what you're counting.

5919
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:18,390
It depend make you fail that basketball,

5920
02:41:19,270 --> 02:41:20,910
he never got to be in the NBA.

5921
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:21,753
Then we're going to be in the room.

5922
02:41:22,030 --> 02:41:22,863
He looked at it,

5923
02:41:22,950 --> 02:41:24,990
you suck at software development.

5924
02:41:25,690 --> 02:41:27,240
You're never going to win this car.

5925
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:28,613
Oh fuck.

5926
02:41:29,730 --> 02:41:31,180
There's so many things
I'm never going to do.

5927
02:41:31,470 --> 02:41:31,831
Tiger.

5928
02:41:31,831 --> 02:41:32,970
Kim doesn't even know who you are.

5929
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:39,420
I called tiger him tire camp.

5930
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:40,770
They knew who I was.

5931
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:41,860
He didn't know who the fuck you are.

5932
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:43,230
Two of my kids are sick.

5933
02:41:43,460 --> 02:41:45,380
My kicks are set up too.

5934
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:46,470
That's the fight right there.

5935
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:47,370
Look at these two guys.

5936
02:41:48,060 --> 02:41:48,870
Two killers.

5937
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:49,703
Good luck pin.

5938
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:51,330
They can fight of the night tonight.

5939
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:51,991
Dan.

5940
02:41:51,991 --> 02:41:52,824
These are good.

5941
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:53,570
Well done.

5942
02:41:53,570 --> 02:41:54,610
Team one floor,

5943
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:57,450
barely paid any attention.

5944
02:41:57,870 --> 02:42:02,520
Nobody that tuned in here wanting
to hear us talking about fights.

5945
02:42:02,521 --> 02:42:03,390
I'm so sorry.

5946
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:04,740
I feel bad.

5947
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:05,191
Not me.

5948
02:42:05,191 --> 02:42:05,911
If you expected.

5949
02:42:05,911 --> 02:42:07,200
We were just going to talk about fights.

5950
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:08,910
Ram your face into your wall.

5951
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:09,360
There's,

5952
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:09,931
I mean there's no,

5953
02:42:09,931 --> 02:42:11,040
we would never do that.

5954
02:42:12,290 --> 02:42:13,110
She Cowen.

5955
02:42:13,110 --> 02:42:16,650
Isn't it important to admit like things
that you're a failure at support and

5956
02:42:16,651 --> 02:42:19,680
then you and I have had this conversation
many times I'm a failure at almost

5957
02:42:19,681 --> 02:42:20,580
everything I've ever done.

5958
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:21,240
Yes.

5959
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:24,330
Ultimately you find ways
to be successful at it,

5960
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:25,980
but I've failed at everything.

5961
02:42:26,010 --> 02:42:26,131
Well,

5962
02:42:26,131 --> 02:42:26,641
wisdom.

5963
02:42:26,641 --> 02:42:28,110
What does wisdom I think wisdom.

5964
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:31,420
What'd you fail in a way
to get everybody to wisdom.

5965
02:42:32,570 --> 02:42:33,220
Wisdom.

5966
02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:36,820
Wisdom is not failed on the land.

5967
02:42:36,860 --> 02:42:37,170
Listen,

5968
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:37,700
listen,

5969
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:38,031
listen,

5970
02:42:38,031 --> 02:42:38,730
listen.

5971
02:42:38,730 --> 02:42:39,361
You always fail.

5972
02:42:39,361 --> 02:42:41,130
That's why I always say to younger people,

5973
02:42:41,131 --> 02:42:42,570
listen to me because
I've made more mistakes.

5974
02:42:42,880 --> 02:42:46,050
Then you have wisdom and wisdom.

5975
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:46,441
Listen,

5976
02:42:46,441 --> 02:42:46,990
everything.

5977
02:42:46,990 --> 02:42:48,140
No wisdom is

5978
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:54,030
wisdom is coming to terms
with your limitations and
learning what to do with it.

5979
02:42:54,340 --> 02:42:56,070
That's where wisdom is.

5980
02:42:56,071 --> 02:42:58,950
Learning that you have limitations
coming to terms with that,

5981
02:42:58,951 --> 02:43:02,250
accepting it and then
learning what to do with that.

5982
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:04,230
You're learning how to
make that work for you.

5983
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:05,041
That's what it is.

5984
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:06,570
That's how you learn it.

5985
02:43:06,571 --> 02:43:06,721
Well,

5986
02:43:06,721 --> 02:43:07,500
you know you learn.

5987
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:08,270
You keep failing,

5988
02:43:08,270 --> 02:43:10,980
you keep adjusting your approach
and you can move on to something.

5989
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:11,853
No,

5990
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:13,443
sometimes.

5991
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:14,590
Sometimes you got to move on.

5992
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:16,840
Go Kido.

5993
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:18,460
Sometimes son,

5994
02:43:18,461 --> 02:43:19,294
do all these guys.

5995
02:43:19,870 --> 02:43:20,703
You saw that

5996
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:23,501
by the way,

5997
02:43:23,501 --> 02:43:23,831
by the way.

5998
02:43:23,831 --> 02:43:24,120
He's,

5999
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:24,320
he's,

6000
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:25,300
he's trimmed up man.

6001
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:27,840
How about we have no idea who
won this and we barely pay.

6002
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:33,700
I'm going to go home tonight and I'm
gonna Watch this shit before I go to sleep

6003
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:34,180
now.

6004
02:43:34,180 --> 02:43:37,540
Really Getting Jeremy Stephens
fucking with mother fucker.

6005
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:40,540
That mother fuck powerful dad
bought by DC on the side there.

6006
02:43:40,630 --> 02:43:44,470
The powerful Jeremy Stevens who is a
heavy burden on being on the Joe Rogan

6007
02:43:44,471 --> 02:43:45,304
experience.

6008
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:46,263
It's tough on him.

6009
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:47,290
No,

6010
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:48,460
Jeremy Stevens has been on.

6011
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:48,611
Oh,

6012
02:43:48,611 --> 02:43:49,570
Rosemont again.

6013
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:53,800
Anytime he wants Jeremy
Open invitation my dog.

6014
02:43:54,340 --> 02:43:55,270
What a big win.

6015
02:43:55,470 --> 02:43:56,001
Huge,

6016
02:43:56,001 --> 02:43:57,490
huge fucking huge win.

6017
02:43:57,550 --> 02:43:58,270
Shutdown.

6018
02:43:58,270 --> 02:44:00,790
One of the guys who was considered
to be one of the best pound for pound

6019
02:44:00,791 --> 02:44:03,680
fighters in the world just a
year and a half ago for Tj,

6020
02:44:03,681 --> 02:44:04,660
it seems like forever ago.

6021
02:44:05,260 --> 02:44:05,621
It is.

6022
02:44:05,621 --> 02:44:06,820
Cj ate his lunch.

6023
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:07,570
It is.

6024
02:44:07,570 --> 02:44:09,840
It is forever ago in the world of MMA.

6025
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:11,710
That's like one of the weird
things about this sport.

6026
02:44:12,130 --> 02:44:13,300
This sport is strange,

6027
02:44:13,301 --> 02:44:13,740
man.

6028
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:14,980
You're only as good as your last fight.

6029
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:15,521
Well,

6030
02:44:15,521 --> 02:44:17,770
you're only as good as
your last training session.

6031
02:44:18,130 --> 02:44:21,250
You could have a bad training session
and they'll go into fight like,

6032
02:44:21,251 --> 02:44:21,641
man,

6033
02:44:21,641 --> 02:44:22,480
I don't even know.

6034
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:26,950
You know like there's certain guys that
you can take on his training partners.

6035
02:44:26,951 --> 02:44:30,010
They could fuck up your confidence for
a fight because you can know there's a

6036
02:44:30,011 --> 02:44:31,360
rumble Johnson like that out there.

6037
02:44:31,361 --> 02:44:32,320
If you're some due to trains,

6038
02:44:32,321 --> 02:44:34,350
light heavyweight it black house and you,

6039
02:44:34,351 --> 02:44:36,280
your training would rumble
all day like what happened?

6040
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:37,133
What am I doing?

6041
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:38,291
Why am I doing this?

6042
02:44:38,291 --> 02:44:38,450
What?

6043
02:44:38,450 --> 02:44:39,490
I like concussions.

6044
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:40,481
What am I doing?

6045
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:41,314
I'm going to learn.

6046
02:44:41,320 --> 02:44:45,670
I'm going to get better with this fucking
dude who's like the freak of freaks

6047
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:46,973
don't.

6048
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:49,570
Although like Anderson,

6049
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,160
that's what makes him so extraordinary.

6050
02:44:51,161 --> 02:44:55,540
His his dominance for so long and then
he got knocked out once and then broke

6051
02:44:55,541 --> 02:44:57,620
his leg and well selfless.

6052
02:44:57,730 --> 02:44:59,020
Sometimes it ends sometimes,

6053
02:44:59,021 --> 02:44:59,410
sometimes,

6054
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:04,410
sometimes just those also 40
there's a hundred factors involved.

6055
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:06,010
There is life.

6056
02:45:06,030 --> 02:45:06,460
There is,

6057
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:08,970
there's psychology is psychology.

6058
02:45:08,980 --> 02:45:12,970
Psycho is also understanding who you
are as a human being and how that gets

6059
02:45:12,971 --> 02:45:17,971
distorted by massive amounts of fame
and praise and adulation and love from,

6060
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:22,330
from your country man and from people
around the world because you're the

6061
02:45:22,331 --> 02:45:25,360
champion of the world
and recognize my opinion.

6062
02:45:25,390 --> 02:45:27,460
If you want to ask me who's
the greatest of all time,

6063
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:29,290
I will always say Anderson Silva.

6064
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:30,550
I think Anderson Silva,

6065
02:45:30,610 --> 02:45:32,050
the greatest MMA fighter,

6066
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,130
he's the best.

6067
02:45:35,380 --> 02:45:38,050
The best dinner finished everybody.

6068
02:45:38,051 --> 02:45:43,051
He did things during the apex of the
prime of MMA that nobody had been able to

6069
02:45:43,091 --> 02:45:43,924
do before.

6070
02:45:43,960 --> 02:45:44,480
You know what?

6071
02:45:44,480 --> 02:45:47,650
He just was a monster man when
he was with the knock out,

6072
02:45:47,830 --> 02:45:49,390
the veto knockout the feature,

6073
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:50,780
not the person who was

6074
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:54,850
named Mark Court too.

6075
02:45:55,210 --> 02:45:56,043
I mean everybody,

6076
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:57,130
oh my God,

6077
02:45:57,131 --> 02:45:57,580
dude.

6078
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:58,061
Everybody.

6079
02:45:58,061 --> 02:45:58,751
He was a month.

6080
02:45:58,751 --> 02:45:59,584
James Irvin,

6081
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:01,030
how about the Forrest Griffin fight?

6082
02:46:01,090 --> 02:46:02,280
Jesus fucking Christ.

6083
02:46:02,360 --> 02:46:02,540
Anyway,

6084
02:46:02,540 --> 02:46:05,590
a full matrix [inaudible] matrix matrix.

6085
02:46:05,591 --> 02:46:06,580
Jesus Christ.

6086
02:46:07,300 --> 02:46:08,000
This coming,

6087
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:08,530
you know,

6088
02:46:08,530 --> 02:46:09,630
even the,

6089
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:12,740
even the first one for
night but not for me.

6090
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:15,830
So that was an interesting fight for
me because that was a fight where I was

6091
02:46:15,831 --> 02:46:17,840
telling everybody that worked for the UFC.

6092
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:18,531
I was like,

6093
02:46:18,531 --> 02:46:20,270
do you understand what you have acquired?

6094
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:21,201
I'm like,

6095
02:46:21,201 --> 02:46:21,981
you have acquired,

6096
02:46:21,981 --> 02:46:24,500
in my opinion the baddest
motherfucker in this division.

6097
02:46:24,700 --> 02:46:26,360
Like do you understand how good this guy?

6098
02:46:26,390 --> 02:46:29,210
But it wasn't that dominant
in Japan but it didn't matter.

6099
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,643
Didn't matter.

6100
02:46:31,250 --> 02:46:35,390
You're talking about Andy Simpson when
Anderson came over the UFC I was adamant.

6101
02:46:35,390 --> 02:46:39,710
I'm like you guys have a guy who when
I watch movement I watched like the way

6102
02:46:39,711 --> 02:46:40,371
guys move.

6103
02:46:40,371 --> 02:46:42,200
I'm like this guy can do some shit.

6104
02:46:43,260 --> 02:46:43,850
He did.

6105
02:46:43,850 --> 02:46:45,930
He was he just so much
faster than most guys.

6106
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:46,970
Only time man.

6107
02:46:47,230 --> 02:46:49,670
He's more ties just like super,

6108
02:46:49,671 --> 02:46:51,290
super high level there is up there.

6109
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:53,360
This is Anderson versus Forrest Griffin.

6110
02:46:53,570 --> 02:46:54,321
Look at that behind you.

6111
02:46:54,321 --> 02:46:57,170
This is Anderson in his
prime and by the way,

6112
02:46:57,530 --> 02:47:02,090
light heavyweight fight to a guy
who's 20 pounds less as a champion.

6113
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:05,600
And this is just an opportunity for
Anderson to fight and not have to cut

6114
02:47:05,601 --> 02:47:06,230
weight.

6115
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:10,220
And in Brazil was this
Brazil against four you?

6116
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:10,850
Same card.

6117
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:12,230
Cause I fought Nogueira that night.

6118
02:47:12,330 --> 02:47:13,100
Pretty sure.

6119
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:13,640
Am I right on,

6120
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:15,110
do I feel like this is Vegas?

6121
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:15,981
God,

6122
02:47:15,981 --> 02:47:16,880
you might be right Joe.

6123
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,710
I feel like this is Mandalay bay

6124
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:23,630
because I feel like this was Vegas.

6125
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:25,070
I don't think this is Brazil.

6126
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:25,641
Janie,

6127
02:47:25,641 --> 02:47:26,690
find out please.

6128
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:27,300
Young.

6129
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,450
Maybe shogun fought forest in Brazil.

6130
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:30,643
Yes he did.

6131
02:47:30,890 --> 02:47:31,491
Yes he did.

6132
02:47:31,491 --> 02:47:32,990
It's why I'm thinking is my bet.

6133
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:37,100
But when the Anderson Anderson accidently
I poked or something and also with any

6134
02:47:37,101 --> 02:47:37,880
does the Matrix,

6135
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:38,720
this is in Vegas.

6136
02:47:38,721 --> 02:47:39,440
You're right Jill.

6137
02:47:39,440 --> 02:47:43,100
We opens him up and just relax as
an Anderson was like really good.

6138
02:47:43,340 --> 02:47:48,230
They'd like figuring out your timing and
lulling you to sleep with a false sense

6139
02:47:48,231 --> 02:47:52,880
of security and then out of nowhere
he would just drop bombs on you.

6140
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:54,560
But then he took it to another level.

6141
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:55,453
Yeah.

6142
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:59,690
Well I think with Weidman,

6143
02:47:59,691 --> 02:48:02,780
Weidman took them down early
and threatened him with
a knee bar and I think he

6144
02:48:02,781 --> 02:48:05,120
was really worried about the
ground game in Philadelphia.

6145
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:06,123
Was it filling?

6146
02:48:06,230 --> 02:48:07,040
Thank you chairman.

6147
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:07,873
God

6148
02:48:09,790 --> 02:48:10,940
boom and,

6149
02:48:10,941 --> 02:48:12,590
and you know Forrest is in trouble.

6150
02:48:12,620 --> 02:48:12,801
Yeah,

6151
02:48:12,801 --> 02:48:13,070
sure,

6152
02:48:13,070 --> 02:48:13,310
sure.

6153
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:15,190
Forced shook his head
like God damn horses,

6154
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:19,190
every bit of six for at
least two 35 it's a big boy.

6155
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:19,760
Yeah,

6156
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:20,980
and he's a former arms.

6157
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:22,250
He's the light heavyweight champ.

6158
02:48:22,251 --> 02:48:22,671
That's right.

6159
02:48:22,671 --> 02:48:25,190
He beat the beat rampage.

6160
02:48:25,250 --> 02:48:26,083
Well,

6161
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:28,220
close fight and all that.

6162
02:48:28,221 --> 02:48:29,120
That means fine.

6163
02:48:29,160 --> 02:48:29,870
I mean,

6164
02:48:29,870 --> 02:48:30,800
I was at that fight though.

6165
02:48:30,801 --> 02:48:33,470
It was kind of cool when I was right.

6166
02:48:33,490 --> 02:48:33,570
Well,

6167
02:48:33,570 --> 02:48:34,310
I was with you.

6168
02:48:34,310 --> 02:48:34,880
Oh,

6169
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:35,713
okay.

6170
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:37,460
Oh look at,

6171
02:48:37,460 --> 02:48:38,170
oh goodness.

6172
02:48:38,170 --> 02:48:38,900
Another going out.

6173
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:39,770
I'm going to sound

6174
02:48:42,570 --> 02:48:44,390
bad and it's just random person.

6175
02:48:44,690 --> 02:48:45,610
The way he moves his,

6176
02:48:45,890 --> 02:48:46,730
he moves his head.

6177
02:48:46,731 --> 02:48:47,031
That was like,

6178
02:48:47,031 --> 02:48:47,570
well dude.

6179
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:47,781
Yeah,

6180
02:48:47,781 --> 02:48:50,480
it's almost like Anderson got
it when we got upset about,

6181
02:48:50,930 --> 02:48:51,763
oh shit.

6182
02:48:51,910 --> 02:48:53,300
We get us matrix.

6183
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:53,451
Oh,

6184
02:48:53,451 --> 02:48:54,500
he's beating them up now.

6185
02:48:54,501 --> 02:48:55,251
That was the matrix,

6186
02:48:55,251 --> 02:48:55,431
right?

6187
02:48:55,431 --> 02:48:56,211
They're slow motion.

6188
02:48:56,211 --> 02:48:57,740
You never seen some ramp that up.

6189
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,790
He's like,

6190
02:48:58,790 --> 02:48:59,750
Judge Shit.

6191
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:03,140
He got mad at forest when or
what the fuck happened man.

6192
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:03,890
Like,

6193
02:49:03,890 --> 02:49:04,431
oh man.

6194
02:49:04,431 --> 02:49:05,061
White anger.

6195
02:49:05,061 --> 02:49:05,960
Excuse me.

6196
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:07,573
The only difference in

6197
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:08,873
resilience,

6198
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:10,830
one man needs more softer vitamin D.

6199
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:11,783
I'm mad.

6200
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:14,930
I'm mad at white people
and I'm white and me to

6201
02:49:18,140 --> 02:49:21,420
make and those looking at blocking a shot,

6202
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:22,280
he's still,

6203
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:24,380
I'll bring that shit
into my fucking forest,

6204
02:49:24,381 --> 02:49:26,130
like pulled back on a round kick.

6205
02:49:26,670 --> 02:49:27,220
Look at him,

6206
02:49:27,220 --> 02:49:27,490
Joe.

6207
02:49:27,490 --> 02:49:31,740
He realize how slow forces
right hand and that's it.

6208
02:49:31,800 --> 02:49:33,960
And it pushed for spread out like that.

6209
02:49:34,330 --> 02:49:35,880
And that's a wrap please.

6210
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:37,200
Enough is enough.

6211
02:49:37,250 --> 02:49:40,140
You know who talks shit on white
people in the past is Joey.

6212
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:41,071
Oh Joey does?

6213
02:49:41,071 --> 02:49:41,904
Yeah,

6214
02:49:43,860 --> 02:49:44,490
he's the,

6215
02:49:44,490 --> 02:49:45,061
he's the best.

6216
02:49:45,061 --> 02:49:46,380
I'm talking shit about everything.

6217
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:47,670
Fucking white people.

6218
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:49,450
What did you think you want to do?

6219
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:51,630
Just fucking guy's been
living in the jungle.

6220
02:49:52,050 --> 02:49:53,610
He's been docking Jaguars,

6221
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:55,440
Jaguars eight and crocodiles.

6222
02:49:55,690 --> 02:49:57,630
This mother fucker's hitting
him with a right hook.

6223
02:49:58,320 --> 02:50:00,330
He owe king him fucking white people.

6224
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:00,631
He's,

6225
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:02,290
he'll hook and flamingos and the

6226
02:50:04,230 --> 02:50:04,801
Alameda.

6227
02:50:04,801 --> 02:50:05,634
Alameda is

6228
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:09,510
Centrum multivitamin once a day

6229
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:14,790
and he's getting steroid shot.

6230
02:50:14,791 --> 02:50:17,910
And who is the hole in his
dick with a Turkey baster?

6231
02:50:22,410 --> 02:50:23,800
Give him three stars or death.

6232
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:28,080
Three stars that this is a
photo from Joey's a Twitter.

6233
02:50:28,140 --> 02:50:30,120
I retweeted it like yesterday.

6234
02:50:30,360 --> 02:50:31,193
It's,

6235
02:50:31,260 --> 02:50:32,093
he says,

6236
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:33,360
come on Pittsburgh.

6237
02:50:33,361 --> 02:50:37,020
Who wants to meet the
devil and hotel room.

6238
02:50:37,290 --> 02:50:40,440
He's got mushrooms and the stars of death,

6239
02:50:40,441 --> 02:50:42,600
which I think these stars,

6240
02:50:42,601 --> 02:50:47,160
the pot gummy stars are
like 500 milligrams of THC.

6241
02:50:47,310 --> 02:50:48,570
Look at that fucking photograph.

6242
02:50:49,890 --> 02:50:54,890
Thousand milligrams of THC and at least
three grams of mushrooms you ready to

6243
02:50:55,581 --> 02:50:56,414
see?

6244
02:50:58,810 --> 02:51:00,870
That's a Thursday night.

6245
02:51:00,871 --> 02:51:01,860
Shrooms and stars

6246
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:06,860
and stars and that's how
he's living a real an Alva.

6247
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:09,480
Does he take him fixed
mushrooms before he performs?

6248
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,470
Of course he does.

6249
02:51:10,471 --> 02:51:11,380
You shut the fuck.

6250
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:12,781
Oh my God.

6251
02:51:12,781 --> 02:51:16,290
You hurt my feelings was a little bit.

6252
02:51:16,310 --> 02:51:18,030
Got a fix for the main event.

6253
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:21,540
That is an amazing picture or wine please.

6254
02:51:21,810 --> 02:51:22,800
Is that anonymous Twitter?

6255
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:23,370
Yes.

6256
02:51:23,370 --> 02:51:28,320
We may be told I haven't
turned a very good.

6257
02:51:28,330 --> 02:51:29,240
That turned shit in.

6258
02:51:29,241 --> 02:51:30,450
My glass turned.

6259
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:31,353
Turned me.

6260
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:34,000
You're so gross with your wine.

6261
02:51:34,980 --> 02:51:35,281
Hold on.

6262
02:51:35,281 --> 02:51:36,114
Hold on.

6263
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:37,020
That's good.

6264
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:37,853
It's just different.

6265
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:40,650
You hadn't get involved.

6266
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:42,330
Look at that fucking photo.

6267
02:51:42,331 --> 02:51:43,030
Pittsburgh.

6268
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:44,580
Are you ready to see the devil?

6269
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:49,050
The improv at seven and 9:00 PM Oh shit.

6270
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:50,941
I'm sorry Bob.

6271
02:51:50,941 --> 02:51:51,391
I'm sorry.

6272
02:51:51,391 --> 02:51:51,940
Come on,

6273
02:51:51,940 --> 02:51:52,440
dust.

6274
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:53,280
You don't have to suck my Dick.

6275
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:56,053
Dick.

6276
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:58,950
Joey Diaz will be here on Tuesday.

6277
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:01,440
Joey D's will be here Tuesday.

6278
02:52:02,250 --> 02:52:02,630
Hey.

6279
02:52:02,630 --> 02:52:02,851
Hey,

6280
02:52:02,851 --> 02:52:03,684
you fucks.

6281
02:52:04,230 --> 02:52:05,100
I'll be in St Louis.

6282
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:05,681
Ninth,

6283
02:52:05,681 --> 02:52:07,490
10th and 11th and Sterling Comedy Clubs.

6284
02:52:07,491 --> 02:52:08,324
You Fox.

6285
02:52:08,510 --> 02:52:09,320
No,

6286
02:52:09,320 --> 02:52:10,141
I didn't say that.

6287
02:52:10,141 --> 02:52:10,974
That was Jamie.

6288
02:52:10,990 --> 02:52:11,823
Jamie,

6289
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:13,240
this is Jamie.

6290
02:52:13,241 --> 02:52:15,280
Brian's going to be a helium
coming from Saint Luke's.

6291
02:52:15,281 --> 02:52:16,090
Shit time.

6292
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:17,950
I heard St Louis is a rough joint dude.

6293
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:18,863
Really?

6294
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:19,290
Yeah.

6295
02:52:19,290 --> 02:52:20,050
Helium.

6296
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:20,351
No.

6297
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:21,184
Saint Louis.

6298
02:52:21,250 --> 02:52:22,083
Oh,

6299
02:52:22,180 --> 02:52:22,691
I've been there.

6300
02:52:22,691 --> 02:52:23,380
It's nice.

6301
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,160
It's rough.

6302
02:52:24,160 --> 02:52:24,730
Come on man.

6303
02:52:24,730 --> 02:52:25,930
What's his name is from Barry's.

6304
02:52:25,931 --> 02:52:26,740
Who's that wrapper?

6305
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:27,820
Everyone's getting crazy.

6306
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:30,190
Nelly fucking Nellie's my boy.

6307
02:52:30,600 --> 02:52:31,160
Hey Brian.

6308
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:32,040
But that girl behind us,

6309
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:35,380
we've seen the girl understands
the camera's on her right behind.

6310
02:52:35,490 --> 02:52:36,570
Just look at her.

6311
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:37,960
She's looking at Cody going,

6312
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:38,380
oh,

6313
02:52:38,380 --> 02:52:39,160
fuck my mouth.

6314
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:39,993
Yes.

6315
02:52:40,060 --> 02:52:41,110
I'm sure she's not a pro.

6316
02:52:41,950 --> 02:52:42,581
What are you trying to say,

6317
02:52:42,581 --> 02:52:43,380
Bros?

6318
02:52:43,380 --> 02:52:46,510
I didn't say anything just because
the girls are a good looking girl.

6319
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:47,170
That's all I meant.

6320
02:52:47,170 --> 02:52:48,003
That's all I met.

6321
02:52:48,370 --> 02:52:49,330
Professional hot girl.

6322
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:52,180
But meanwhile if there was a guy,

6323
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:52,840
okay,

6324
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:55,870
that was standing back there and
it was looking at a stud woman,

6325
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:57,850
that's like the female equivalent to Coty.

6326
02:52:58,150 --> 02:52:59,590
That'd be like a natural thing to say.

6327
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:01,060
Too many catches Cody.

6328
02:53:01,061 --> 02:53:01,751
Too many tattoos.

6329
02:53:01,751 --> 02:53:02,230
Of course.

6330
02:53:02,230 --> 02:53:04,190
Now of course I no,

6331
02:53:05,180 --> 02:53:07,270
that's how you attract a
certain type of female.

6332
02:53:07,330 --> 02:53:07,990
Is that true?

6333
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:08,200
Yeah.

6334
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:09,570
One was Cody could.

6335
02:53:09,571 --> 02:53:10,750
It wasn't that dangerous shit.

6336
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:11,380
The neck.

6337
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:12,760
Some girls like dangerous shit.

6338
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:13,420
They like it.

6339
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:13,961
You know what?

6340
02:53:13,961 --> 02:53:14,771
He's so good looking.

6341
02:53:14,771 --> 02:53:16,020
He could do that shit handsome.

6342
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:16,151
Oh,

6343
02:53:16,151 --> 02:53:16,331
he's,

6344
02:53:16,331 --> 02:53:17,164
it doesn't matter.

6345
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:18,880
You can put a tattoo right on his face.

6346
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,490
He's first job bins.

6347
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:23,310
The captain now captain,

6348
02:53:23,380 --> 02:53:24,250
he's very cute.

6349
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:25,113
He's very cute.

6350
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:26,440
No short to beat.

6351
02:53:26,530 --> 02:53:28,680
Luke Rockhold changed the captain wrong.

6352
02:53:28,690 --> 02:53:29,523
He's tall.

6353
02:53:31,180 --> 02:53:32,020
Doesn't matter.

6354
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:32,873
Luke's taller.

6355
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:34,050
Luke could be with Versace.

6356
02:53:34,100 --> 02:53:35,650
Gotta put height and he seeks it out.

6357
02:53:35,651 --> 02:53:36,240
Yeah.

6358
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:37,720
You don't have to face structure.

6359
02:53:37,790 --> 02:53:39,250
He's too legit TV.

6360
02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:41,190
He,

6361
02:53:41,190 --> 02:53:42,870
you know what I'm saying?

6362
02:53:42,871 --> 02:53:44,320
He's too legit to be signed.

6363
02:53:45,740 --> 02:53:47,800
Once you get signed by a modeling agent,

6364
02:53:47,801 --> 02:53:48,611
then you're a model.

6365
02:53:48,611 --> 02:53:50,020
If you're just as good looking,

6366
02:53:50,021 --> 02:53:50,711
you're not signed.

6367
02:53:50,711 --> 02:53:51,550
You're more legit.

6368
02:53:51,590 --> 02:53:52,423
I

6369
02:53:53,760 --> 02:53:55,180
think Joe bands more legit.

6370
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:56,433
No,

6371
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:58,930
we don't talk about anything.

6372
02:53:58,931 --> 02:53:59,764
Huh?

6373
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:02,230
He says we're all fucking,

6374
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:08,110
what are the so hot did he got the tattoos
on his neck to keep the girls like at

6375
02:54:08,111 --> 02:54:08,500
bay?

6376
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:09,333
So he's gay?

6377
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:09,821
No,

6378
02:54:09,821 --> 02:54:10,541
it's just like shit.

6379
02:54:10,541 --> 02:54:11,201
There's too many.

6380
02:54:11,201 --> 02:54:13,210
There's nobody's ever said that.

6381
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:14,553
You never know

6382
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:19,020
what's going on.

6383
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:20,710
Why do we have to go there?

6384
02:54:20,711 --> 02:54:21,544
That's not right.

6385
02:54:21,650 --> 02:54:23,020
I lanch what's going on?

6386
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:25,740
He's just trying to get
a specific qualities.

6387
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:27,393
You know what I'm saying?

6388
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:32,480
He's tired of women that are like
looking for some sort of longterm,

6389
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:33,560
serious commitment.

6390
02:54:33,561 --> 02:54:34,630
So your tattoo on your neck,

6391
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:36,220
morals and religious beliefs

6392
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:40,150
and only drags in the freaks.

6393
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:41,210
He's got some tents on them.

6394
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:42,273
I saw Joe ban,

6395
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:43,240
giant poster,

6396
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:43,960
New York,

6397
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:44,621
New York City.

6398
02:54:44,621 --> 02:54:45,580
Him Shirt off.

6399
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:47,313
Handsome man.

6400
02:54:47,630 --> 02:54:48,050
Oh Man.

6401
02:54:48,050 --> 02:54:50,170
Oh well we're talking billboard son,

6402
02:54:50,171 --> 02:54:51,010
Versace.

6403
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:53,110
Really?

6404
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:53,611
Holy Shit.

6405
02:54:53,611 --> 02:54:54,101
I'm Brian.

6406
02:54:54,101 --> 02:54:54,960
Why are you scared of weed?

6407
02:54:55,080 --> 02:54:55,270
No,

6408
02:54:55,270 --> 02:54:56,320
I'm not guys a,

6409
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:58,270
I'll do it if you're friendly with me,

6410
02:54:58,330 --> 02:54:58,571
but,

6411
02:54:58,571 --> 02:55:00,730
well Brendan just reached
for it and you put it out.

6412
02:55:01,330 --> 02:55:02,120
Oh good.

6413
02:55:02,120 --> 02:55:03,470
I'll do Jiu Jitsu to now on.

6414
02:55:04,600 --> 02:55:08,780
I'll tell you guys I keep going
back job and you're fucking crazy.

6415
02:55:08,781 --> 02:55:12,880
You think anyone's on that level
drag the conversation is going to be,

6416
02:55:12,980 --> 02:55:13,200
look,

6417
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:15,380
it's going to be nobody has Rinaldo crazy.

6418
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:20,130
Nobody has Rinaldo Chopin looks like
Rinaldo not quite this conversation,

6419
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:20,500
you know,

6420
02:55:20,500 --> 02:55:21,333
way to

6421
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:26,230
shit that's,

6422
02:55:26,630 --> 02:55:27,463
and I'm there.

6423
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:27,921
I'm there.

6424
02:55:27,921 --> 02:55:28,730
I'm with you.

6425
02:55:28,730 --> 02:55:30,310
I'm a wack Chabad Chabad.

6426
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:31,303
Beautiful Man.

6427
02:55:31,730 --> 02:55:33,770
We gotta be a little better
about talking over each other.

6428
02:55:33,771 --> 02:55:38,771
I know I keep saying this but he's
guilty as everybody but only voice in the

6429
02:55:39,591 --> 02:55:40,424
wilderness.

6430
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:43,580
He keeps bringing us back cause I'm the
one who has to read the tweets here,

6431
02:55:43,581 --> 02:55:44,360
right?

6432
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:44,841
No,

6433
02:55:44,841 --> 02:55:48,050
but it's something about your parents and
this is the most beautiful thing ever.

6434
02:55:48,051 --> 02:55:50,060
I think we're all working
together to create a piece of art.

6435
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:53,090
You just gotta be real careful about
stomping on each of those words.

6436
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:57,590
A piece of bark up the Turkey base to
steroids and some of these stick when

6437
02:55:57,591 --> 02:55:58,880
you're talking about gay shit,

6438
02:55:59,330 --> 02:56:00,320
saving gauge,

6439
02:56:00,330 --> 02:56:00,681
all bands.

6440
02:56:00,681 --> 02:56:01,461
A good looking dude.

6441
02:56:01,461 --> 02:56:04,580
I think he's first team Thomas Bro.

6442
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:06,290
How many times I've got
to tell you he's married.

6443
02:56:06,320 --> 02:56:08,240
Tom saw made is not a
bad looking fella either.

6444
02:56:10,890 --> 02:56:11,900
If you're a man,

6445
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:12,561
if he ended up,

6446
02:56:12,561 --> 02:56:13,550
he looks like a Dell

6447
02:56:18,350 --> 02:56:19,161
all due respect.

6448
02:56:19,161 --> 02:56:20,030
A lot of black guys,

6449
02:56:20,990 --> 02:56:22,090
exactly what they're looking for.

6450
02:56:24,080 --> 02:56:24,591
Hey man,

6451
02:56:24,591 --> 02:56:24,861
listen,

6452
02:56:24,861 --> 02:56:25,680
he's a twink.

6453
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:29,680
He's called the kid is a fucking
savage Tom Summit as a God damn.

6454
02:56:29,730 --> 02:56:31,180
SAS tough fight for garbage.

6455
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:31,461
Oh,

6456
02:56:31,461 --> 02:56:32,001
Brian,

6457
02:56:32,001 --> 02:56:33,410
with this nonsense of winning,

6458
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:34,760
as you saying about the last fight,

6459
02:56:34,761 --> 02:56:35,594
you were wrong.

6460
02:56:35,830 --> 02:56:37,040
Now I was painting you guys,

6461
02:56:37,041 --> 02:56:37,874
but here's the thing,

6462
02:56:38,780 --> 02:56:39,650
he's going to win this fight.

6463
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:41,240
He certainly can win,

6464
02:56:41,390 --> 02:56:41,961
but you know what,

6465
02:56:41,961 --> 02:56:43,160
Cody can win to both.

6466
02:56:43,161 --> 02:56:44,300
These guys are undefeated.

6467
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:45,620
I meet as the favorite I made.

6468
02:56:45,621 --> 02:56:47,140
It's got 22 of course he is,

6469
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:48,860
but let me tell you something.

6470
02:56:48,861 --> 02:56:50,390
Brad pickets stunned.

6471
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:52,790
I'll meda and he's
stunned him and hurt him.

6472
02:56:53,590 --> 02:56:54,440
Pick pickets.

6473
02:56:54,450 --> 02:56:55,283
A great truths.

6474
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:56,233
It's true,

6475
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:57,410
but I'm telling you,

6476
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,460
Cody Garbrandt,

6477
02:56:58,670 --> 02:57:01,280
I believe at this stage
of his career in life,

6478
02:57:01,281 --> 02:57:02,600
he's only 24 years old.

6479
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:05,750
He's faster and more
dangerous with his hand.

6480
02:57:05,780 --> 02:57:08,990
He also hits harder than anyone
at one 30 is boggling background.

6481
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:09,291
Yes,

6482
02:57:09,291 --> 02:57:11,090
he's a very strong boxing background.

6483
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:16,120
So if Cody can impose his boxing skills
in a similar manner to what Brad picket

6484
02:57:17,031 --> 02:57:17,241
did,

6485
02:57:17,241 --> 02:57:20,210
we might see some interesting
results by inserting mean Kale.

6486
02:57:20,330 --> 02:57:20,631
But,

6487
02:57:20,631 --> 02:57:21,620
but I'm telling you,

6488
02:57:21,621 --> 02:57:23,030
this guy's hard to take out.

6489
02:57:23,031 --> 02:57:24,620
He's a God damn savage.

6490
02:57:24,890 --> 02:57:26,180
This fucking kid,

6491
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:28,450
Thomas Almeda is something super special.

6492
02:57:28,470 --> 02:57:29,580
Takes hits though Bro.

6493
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:30,400
Chill.

6494
02:57:30,400 --> 02:57:35,400
But it comes back like
he came back against Brad
Pickett hits fucking hard man.

6495
02:57:37,900 --> 02:57:42,530
Chicken dropped him and Almeda came back
and knocked him out with a flying knee

6496
02:57:42,531 --> 02:57:43,910
Kayo in the next round.

6497
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:49,240
We're about to watch some crazy epic
shit that could easily be a world

6498
02:57:49,911 --> 02:57:52,790
championship fight easily.

6499
02:57:52,910 --> 02:57:56,850
Maybe garb brand is a year
away from world caliber.

6500
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:57,470
Yes,

6501
02:57:57,470 --> 02:57:58,161
he wins this.

6502
02:57:58,161 --> 02:57:59,150
He's off to the races.

6503
02:57:59,180 --> 02:58:02,460
You got number eight undefeated
and you look like that.

6504
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:04,670
Cody is like in my opinion,

6505
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:05,311
a year,

6506
02:58:05,311 --> 02:58:08,130
a year and a half away
from fine for title agree,

6507
02:58:08,190 --> 02:58:10,170
which means it could happen tomorrow.

6508
02:58:10,200 --> 02:58:14,850
Hey nicknamed the last guy who was on
rank to lead a main event that wasn't like

6509
02:58:14,851 --> 02:58:15,660
a legend.

6510
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:15,841
Well,

6511
02:58:15,841 --> 02:58:20,340
what is courtesy ranking at all ranked
while he's on the top 15 he's certainly

6512
02:58:20,341 --> 02:58:22,650
dangerous and he certainly
comes from a really good team.

6513
02:58:22,651 --> 02:58:23,251
He's a team.

6514
02:58:23,251 --> 02:58:23,731
Alpha male.

6515
02:58:23,731 --> 02:58:24,151
God,

6516
02:58:24,151 --> 02:58:27,450
they've got a long history of success
and knockout arts and knockout artists.

6517
02:58:27,451 --> 02:58:29,520
He has awesome hands tall.

6518
02:58:29,521 --> 02:58:30,300
Is He?

6519
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:30,991
I think he's five.

6520
02:58:30,991 --> 02:58:31,650
Eight.

6521
02:58:31,650 --> 02:58:32,401
That's pretty tall.

6522
02:58:32,401 --> 02:58:33,234
That's not short.

6523
02:58:33,580 --> 02:58:34,170
Yeah.

6524
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:35,370
Well you see five five,

6525
02:58:35,371 --> 02:58:35,551
eight,

6526
02:58:35,551 --> 02:58:36,720
five is tall enough.

6527
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:37,783
Tall enough.

6528
02:58:38,060 --> 02:58:39,320
One 35 is tall.

6529
02:58:39,930 --> 02:58:40,410
He's fine.

6530
02:58:40,410 --> 02:58:41,440
I made is five seven.

6531
02:58:41,441 --> 02:58:44,400
When he want to know I
made as a gangster dude,

6532
02:58:44,401 --> 02:58:45,600
he's so solid.

6533
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:46,370
I liked garb.

6534
02:58:46,370 --> 02:58:46,560
Ramp,

6535
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:46,840
man.

6536
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:47,790
We're watching right now.

6537
02:58:47,791 --> 02:58:52,360
We're about to watch some fucking
technical martial arts chaos that's we're

6538
02:58:52,370 --> 02:58:53,203
about to watch.

6539
02:58:53,220 --> 02:58:55,020
You can watch sock him in the face.

6540
02:58:55,050 --> 02:58:58,890
You might watch that or you might watch
Almeda hit him with a fucking switch

6541
02:58:58,891 --> 02:59:00,180
knee as he's coming in.

6542
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:01,980
You might watch some leg kicks.

6543
02:59:01,981 --> 02:59:03,540
It take Cody garb,

6544
02:59:03,541 --> 02:59:04,620
ran out of the game.

6545
02:59:04,650 --> 02:59:05,450
I mean,

6546
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:07,230
it's all dependent upon approach.

6547
02:59:07,530 --> 02:59:08,340
This is like,

6548
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:11,430
this is guessing and theoretical ideas.

6549
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:16,290
It's like it's a theoretical that if
Cody keeps it on the feet and sprawls and

6550
02:59:16,291 --> 02:59:16,711
brawls,

6551
02:59:16,711 --> 02:59:17,544
he wins,

6552
02:59:17,790 --> 02:59:20,340
but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's true.

6553
02:59:20,460 --> 02:59:24,090
Fuck Kevin Randleman knocked out
Mirko Cro cop with a left hook.

6554
02:59:24,300 --> 02:59:24,601
Yeah.

6555
02:59:24,601 --> 02:59:27,840
I mean this is a crazy game
where we're about to watch.

6556
02:59:28,020 --> 02:59:28,231
I mean,

6557
02:59:28,231 --> 02:59:29,200
this is crazy.

6558
02:59:29,201 --> 02:59:31,980
A game as people play sport to bet on it.

6559
02:59:31,990 --> 02:59:34,830
Throw my bones at you with all my mind.

6560
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:36,000
That's it.

6561
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:41,000
The same kind of power that produces a
90 plus mile an hour fast ball and I'm

6562
02:59:41,131 --> 02:59:43,350
going to stuff it into your fucking lips.

6563
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:44,333
The gaming show,

6564
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:46,053
that's the game.

6565
02:59:47,310 --> 02:59:52,310
Make you quit or shut you up in
the house in the fucking house.

6566
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:53,950
Cody opens up the plan.

6567
02:59:54,060 --> 02:59:55,260
Crazy roundhouse kicks.

6568
02:59:55,261 --> 02:59:57,390
We touched the criminal
complaint around house damage.

6569
02:59:57,420 --> 02:59:58,620
Here's the problem with that.

6570
02:59:58,621 --> 03:00:01,200
You should probably shouldn't be able
to touch the ground on purpose and then

6571
03:00:01,201 --> 03:00:02,490
punching out with that same hand.

6572
03:00:02,491 --> 03:00:03,930
We've got the referee wiping it off.

6573
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:04,711
Oh my God,

6574
03:00:04,711 --> 03:00:04,921
Joe,

6575
03:00:04,921 --> 03:00:05,460
come on.

6576
03:00:05,460 --> 03:00:05,661
No,

6577
03:00:05,661 --> 03:00:07,140
if you go to the ground and boxing,

6578
03:00:07,470 --> 03:00:08,460
they wipe your hands off.

6579
03:00:08,461 --> 03:00:11,220
You ever noticed that the wipe your hands
off that fucking tattoo on the back?

6580
03:00:11,221 --> 03:00:14,870
Is that a rose and cause there's a
bunch of people walking like the referee

6581
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:19,710
walks through the arena and then uses
those same shoes is walking around and

6582
03:00:19,711 --> 03:00:20,544
smack him.

6583
03:00:21,090 --> 03:00:22,170
Wash his feet.

6584
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:24,600
I say I'm thinking of my
people are in the ring though.

6585
03:00:24,610 --> 03:00:25,630
And baby wipes.

6586
03:00:25,631 --> 03:00:26,100
Yeah.

6587
03:00:26,100 --> 03:00:26,910
Oh Hey,

6588
03:00:26,910 --> 03:00:27,200
what?

6589
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:28,050
I liked that part.

6590
03:00:28,051 --> 03:00:28,621
Oh my God.

6591
03:00:28,621 --> 03:00:29,580
We lost power.

6592
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:30,570
A Fox sports one.

6593
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:31,230
Oh Wow.

6594
03:00:31,230 --> 03:00:31,740
Came back.

6595
03:00:31,740 --> 03:00:32,573
Calm down.

6596
03:00:32,910 --> 03:00:33,390
Calm down.

6597
03:00:33,390 --> 03:00:34,230
No ideas won't shut.

6598
03:00:34,290 --> 03:00:36,710
The shutters does scary.

6599
03:00:36,780 --> 03:00:38,300
Cody Garbrandt with a left hook arm.

6600
03:00:38,340 --> 03:00:39,173
Right.

6601
03:00:39,210 --> 03:00:43,860
See the thing is [inaudible] oh
we fight when it's dangerous.

6602
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:47,220
Starts off with the hands because you
don't feel comfortable enough to start

6603
03:00:47,221 --> 03:00:47,851
throwing kicks.

6604
03:00:47,851 --> 03:00:52,530
And last year some crazy Moy Thai style
kick an expert where it's a part of your

6605
03:00:52,531 --> 03:00:54,360
natural thing killer.

6606
03:00:54,650 --> 03:00:57,360
But like guys who are like
straight up MMA fighters,

6607
03:00:57,480 --> 03:00:59,080
they tend to favor hands with,

6608
03:00:59,081 --> 03:00:59,914
they're nervous.

6609
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:01,540
So when your favorite hands,

6610
03:01:01,780 --> 03:01:06,780
carb brands got a pretty fucking nice
advantage over a large percentage of the

6611
03:01:06,941 --> 03:01:08,320
people he's faced so far,

6612
03:01:08,440 --> 03:01:09,400
especially with his box.

6613
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:09,780
Exactly.

6614
03:01:09,780 --> 03:01:10,210
Yeah.

6615
03:01:10,210 --> 03:01:10,451
Joe,

6616
03:01:10,451 --> 03:01:13,040
wouldn't you say most guys favorite
grappling in the beginning?

6617
03:01:13,041 --> 03:01:13,990
There's a little bit of that,

6618
03:01:14,020 --> 03:01:18,220
but there's also hands before
kicks cause it distance.

6619
03:01:18,250 --> 03:01:19,990
He's got speed and Almeda.

6620
03:01:20,070 --> 03:01:23,020
Almeda license throw knees
and likes to throw kicks,

6621
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:25,120
but he might get counter.

6622
03:01:25,210 --> 03:01:29,280
He might get conservative in his approach
because of the fact that Garber hands

6623
03:01:29,290 --> 03:01:32,440
hands are so good that he doesn't want
to open himself up to like he brought.

6624
03:01:32,441 --> 03:01:36,310
He probably considered straight right
counters to the right leg kicks they garb

6625
03:01:36,311 --> 03:01:37,120
ramp might look.

6626
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:39,280
Look how heavy garb rant
is on the front leg.

6627
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:42,400
I want to assume that he's ready for
a straight right hand counter to that.

6628
03:01:42,550 --> 03:01:46,180
How quicker his right
leg kicks to quick move.

6629
03:01:46,181 --> 03:01:47,650
His hands are lightning fast.

6630
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:50,570
His right leg kick isn't
really fast to mass.

6631
03:01:50,970 --> 03:01:51,803
Oh

6632
03:01:53,470 --> 03:01:53,880
hello.

6633
03:01:53,880 --> 03:01:54,720
He's a big trouble.

6634
03:01:56,460 --> 03:01:57,300
Cody garb.

6635
03:01:57,301 --> 03:01:59,760
Brands all over him relax to only,

6636
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:05,400
and Jesus looks at this
killer he's taught to.

6637
03:02:05,410 --> 03:02:06,780
How good is that neck tattoo.

6638
03:02:06,781 --> 03:02:07,770
If look if he went out,

6639
03:02:07,771 --> 03:02:08,740
what's up now Brian?

6640
03:02:08,741 --> 03:02:09,241
That's an APP.

6641
03:02:09,241 --> 03:02:10,074
If he wins,

6642
03:02:10,250 --> 03:02:11,083
he's

6643
03:02:12,180 --> 03:02:12,640
awesome.

6644
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:13,600
He gets us.

6645
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:16,830
Damn Amanda can take a punch guys.

6646
03:02:16,850 --> 03:02:18,940
Get a star right below his eyes.

6647
03:02:19,100 --> 03:02:22,410
If he wins 100% if I may
can take up all bogus shit.

6648
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:24,780
You see him just take that
beating and state standing there.

6649
03:02:24,810 --> 03:02:25,643
This is crazy.

6650
03:02:27,460 --> 03:02:31,860
My son Cody is and off on a man who does
getting a little reckless stake control

6651
03:02:31,930 --> 03:02:32,750
matter.

6652
03:02:32,750 --> 03:02:33,410
It looks.

6653
03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:34,243
Oh,

6654
03:02:34,530 --> 03:02:35,363
Gotcha.

6655
03:02:39,170 --> 03:02:40,100
Oh my God.

6656
03:02:40,101 --> 03:02:40,640
Cody.

6657
03:02:40,640 --> 03:02:43,100
When Cody is legit as fuck you up.

6658
03:02:43,101 --> 03:02:44,000
I'm top 10 now.

6659
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:44,241
Hey,

6660
03:02:44,241 --> 03:02:45,880
you told shit

6661
03:02:47,610 --> 03:02:48,620
an you fuckers.

6662
03:02:48,621 --> 03:02:49,670
Carm just beat him.

6663
03:02:49,671 --> 03:02:51,320
He took him out in the first round.

6664
03:02:51,390 --> 03:02:53,750
You cheeto finger fucks rank him.

6665
03:02:54,320 --> 03:02:54,621
Brian,

6666
03:02:54,621 --> 03:02:56,960
didn't you say that
you were a wanting for,

6667
03:02:56,961 --> 03:02:57,560
didn't you?

6668
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:57,741
Well,

6669
03:02:57,741 --> 03:03:00,040
who were Tom's?

6670
03:03:00,100 --> 03:03:00,350
No,

6671
03:03:00,350 --> 03:03:03,830
I've been a Garber in France and
it's fucking 90 96 wait a minute.

6672
03:03:03,831 --> 03:03:06,230
Did you say meda for sure is going to win?

6673
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:08,670
No data and since 2011 he's been my boy.

6674
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:11,840
I was watching this kid wrestling
high school wrestling match.

6675
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:15,710
Cody's in told you I told you
for hardest sit at 35 son.

6676
03:03:15,711 --> 03:03:15,950
Yup.

6677
03:03:15,950 --> 03:03:16,940
Oh my God.

6678
03:03:16,941 --> 03:03:18,170
Look at this beautiful.

6679
03:03:18,930 --> 03:03:23,930
Oh beautiful Thai boxing technique though.

6680
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:26,660
Even with the ground and pound
going right to the hammer.

6681
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:28,550
Oh my God.

6682
03:03:29,400 --> 03:03:30,770
Oh my God.

6683
03:03:30,790 --> 03:03:32,130
It's beautiful.

6684
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:35,780
What a beautiful fucking huge wind man.

6685
03:03:35,781 --> 03:03:36,350
It's beautiful.

6686
03:03:36,350 --> 03:03:37,070
Good for him.

6687
03:03:37,070 --> 03:03:40,100
To me that's like a mountain
covered in snow with a sunrise.

6688
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:42,050
Great.

6689
03:03:42,050 --> 03:03:42,411
It has.

6690
03:03:42,411 --> 03:03:45,170
It definitely has visual
triggers like porn.

6691
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:47,120
It's right up there
with as to waist ratio.

6692
03:03:47,150 --> 03:03:47,720
Yup.

6693
03:03:47,720 --> 03:03:48,553
Well,

6694
03:03:48,750 --> 03:03:49,730
when I got there.

6695
03:03:49,840 --> 03:03:50,041
Yeah.

6696
03:03:50,041 --> 03:03:50,650
Brilliant.

6697
03:03:50,650 --> 03:03:51,483
That's beautiful.

6698
03:03:52,070 --> 03:03:53,030
I respect that.

6699
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:58,010
I have to strongly disagree
so he can barely keep

6700
03:03:58,010 --> 03:03:58,630
open his eyes.

6701
03:03:58,630 --> 03:04:02,150
So it's just this offs shut this off.

6702
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:03,680
I don't want to watch anymore.

6703
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:05,530
I found enough violence.

6704
03:04:08,490 --> 03:04:10,020
Garbin doing the damn thing.

6705
03:04:11,870 --> 03:04:12,830
35 son.

6706
03:04:12,890 --> 03:04:13,521
God Damn,

6707
03:04:13,521 --> 03:04:14,354
you look good tonight.

6708
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:16,600
This was like a coming
out party for garbage.

6709
03:04:17,270 --> 03:04:20,240
They give him undefeated
2108 rank guy in the world.

6710
03:04:20,241 --> 03:04:21,790
Any starches?

6711
03:04:21,980 --> 03:04:24,590
Not 21 to know he's lost
two fights in a row.

6712
03:04:25,430 --> 03:04:26,240
No.

6713
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:29,090
Well we mean you're not
talking about tonight.

6714
03:04:29,280 --> 03:04:30,170
I'm talking about tonight.

6715
03:04:30,380 --> 03:04:32,720
Well Hanan Barao was
lost a couple of times.

6716
03:04:32,810 --> 03:04:33,501
I'm not talking about whom?

6717
03:04:33,501 --> 03:04:36,890
Brown Cody Garbrandt
and I'll meet a fight.

6718
03:04:37,090 --> 03:04:37,460
Oh,

6719
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:37,740
Beatles.

6720
03:04:37,740 --> 03:04:38,280
Undefeated.

6721
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:39,510
He hasn't lost confused.

6722
03:04:39,880 --> 03:04:40,713
I got baffled.

6723
03:04:40,900 --> 03:04:41,300
Yeah,

6724
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:42,380
we'll cut what Cody do.

6725
03:04:42,381 --> 03:04:43,214
You had to rank them.

6726
03:04:43,550 --> 03:04:43,821
Yeah.

6727
03:04:43,821 --> 03:04:48,821
Well Cody did tonight was like impose
his skills in a way that I don't think

6728
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:50,990
you've ever seen him do before.

6729
03:04:51,330 --> 03:04:54,910
That was like the best version
of all of his combination.

6730
03:04:54,940 --> 03:04:55,820
That part the most,

6731
03:04:56,270 --> 03:04:56,930
yeah,

6732
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:57,710
for sure coming out.

6733
03:04:57,710 --> 03:04:58,210
Right.

6734
03:04:58,210 --> 03:05:03,210
He's a star now is a good looking dude
and calm and all that fire and that fire

6735
03:05:04,371 --> 03:05:07,460
range and then fucking
squadron of death range.

6736
03:05:07,461 --> 03:05:08,294
When you got to,

6737
03:05:08,300 --> 03:05:09,111
he was so,

6738
03:05:09,111 --> 03:05:10,430
his eyes are so focused.

6739
03:05:10,431 --> 03:05:14,350
He was so relaxed and I don't
know shit about striking but uh,

6740
03:05:15,050 --> 03:05:16,450
I mean he looks like Bruce Wallace.

6741
03:05:16,490 --> 03:05:16,911
You know what?

6742
03:05:16,911 --> 03:05:18,030
This was a great car here.

6743
03:05:18,070 --> 03:05:22,160
Looks like this is your break card
basis because the match ups were fun.

6744
03:05:22,370 --> 03:05:22,910
But look,

6745
03:05:22,910 --> 03:05:23,481
look what we had,

6746
03:05:23,481 --> 03:05:24,020
we had,

6747
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:26,570
we had Jeremy Stevens
beat Hanan Barao was like,

6748
03:05:26,571 --> 03:05:27,290
wow,

6749
03:05:27,290 --> 03:05:29,600
that was a big fucking
wind for chairman Stevens.

6750
03:05:29,601 --> 03:05:30,260
Holy Shit.

6751
03:05:30,260 --> 03:05:34,010
And then because we had Cody Garbrandt
take it to the totally next level,

6752
03:05:34,130 --> 03:05:34,880
so it was like,

6753
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:35,750
it was a perfect,

6754
03:05:35,751 --> 03:05:37,590
like coal main and then main right.

6755
03:05:37,650 --> 03:05:38,260
Like said,

6756
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:39,093
looking forward,

6757
03:05:39,560 --> 03:05:40,351
come on man,

6758
03:05:40,351 --> 03:05:41,184
how are you going to do that?

6759
03:05:41,330 --> 03:05:46,330
I mean it's also amazing that Hennen Barao
who just two fights ago was the world

6760
03:05:46,851 --> 03:05:51,680
champion and and three sites and sites
for pound best for best in the world.

6761
03:05:51,720 --> 03:05:51,890
It was,

6762
03:05:51,890 --> 03:05:53,180
they're like waiting and I'm in and out.

6763
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:54,890
I was thinking he was number three.

6764
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:55,281
I was like,

6765
03:05:55,281 --> 03:05:56,390
it was Jon Jones.

6766
03:05:56,500 --> 03:05:57,440
I felt like,

6767
03:05:57,470 --> 03:05:58,303
well four.

6768
03:05:58,430 --> 03:05:58,821
I was like,

6769
03:05:58,821 --> 03:05:59,660
because it was before,

6770
03:05:59,661 --> 03:06:01,580
although it got stopped by Mcgregor,

6771
03:06:01,730 --> 03:06:02,511
Jon Jones.

6772
03:06:02,511 --> 03:06:03,344
Demetrius was,

6773
03:06:03,530 --> 03:06:05,780
he was like a little bit below it was in,

6774
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:06,110
it was,

6775
03:06:06,110 --> 03:06:06,770
it was all,

6776
03:06:06,770 --> 03:06:09,830
it's all subjective but it was in the
mix and it was definitely in the mix.

6777
03:06:09,950 --> 03:06:10,651
Top five for sure.

6778
03:06:10,651 --> 03:06:11,101
For sure.

6779
03:06:11,101 --> 03:06:13,880
For sure and for all those
peanuts are on the fence.

6780
03:06:14,090 --> 03:06:17,330
All those people that are on
the fence about a neck tattoo.

6781
03:06:17,331 --> 03:06:17,691
Boom,

6782
03:06:17,691 --> 03:06:19,710
they got side kicked over pat time.

6783
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:23,780
I know for sure it gets to get a neck.

6784
03:06:23,870 --> 03:06:24,561
Here's the thing,

6785
03:06:24,561 --> 03:06:25,520
I think this is important.

6786
03:06:25,521 --> 03:06:27,410
Talk about for all and then they fans.

6787
03:06:27,710 --> 03:06:28,080
There's a,

6788
03:06:28,080 --> 03:06:28,491
there's a,

6789
03:06:28,491 --> 03:06:32,840
there's an issue that keeps coming up
with MMA and social media that I think

6790
03:06:32,841 --> 03:06:34,130
people need to relax about.

6791
03:06:34,700 --> 03:06:38,180
Like all of us as friends
disagree about shit,

6792
03:06:38,480 --> 03:06:39,920
but we're not douchey about it.

6793
03:06:40,130 --> 03:06:43,400
Like if you think that Hennen Barao was
going to be able to figure out how to

6794
03:06:43,401 --> 03:06:45,410
weight a way to beat Jeremy Stevens,

6795
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:49,460
but I think that Jeremy Stevens power
and experience at 145 pounds going to

6796
03:06:49,461 --> 03:06:50,294
prevail.

6797
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:51,440
We don't have to be enemies.

6798
03:06:52,370 --> 03:06:53,900
This weird thing going on.

6799
03:06:53,901 --> 03:06:56,790
Like if you say something that you,

6800
03:06:56,791 --> 03:06:57,840
and I disagree with it,

6801
03:06:57,990 --> 03:06:58,960
like if,

6802
03:06:58,970 --> 03:06:59,240
if,

6803
03:06:59,240 --> 03:06:59,820
if that,

6804
03:06:59,820 --> 03:07:01,470
like if that hits online,

6805
03:07:01,650 --> 03:07:03,420
like if two people disagree online,

6806
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:07,530
people assume that there's like some
sort of a horrible argument going on and

6807
03:07:07,531 --> 03:07:08,640
they assume that,

6808
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:09,270
you know,

6809
03:07:09,270 --> 03:07:13,570
there's like some negativity to me,

6810
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:14,071
hey,

6811
03:07:14,071 --> 03:07:15,610
you hate each other pill.

6812
03:07:15,730 --> 03:07:16,563
No good.

6813
03:07:16,970 --> 03:07:18,490
But that's a tendency for tempo.

6814
03:07:18,700 --> 03:07:19,800
How many times have you,

6815
03:07:19,801 --> 03:07:24,060
and I mean you're as close to it as a
human being as I could be with you guys.

6816
03:07:24,061 --> 03:07:24,894
All of you guys,

6817
03:07:24,930 --> 03:07:26,070
you later in my life,

6818
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:27,450
but I was still up.

6819
03:07:27,451 --> 03:07:28,350
You're up down dog.

6820
03:07:28,351 --> 03:07:29,184
You know Bro.

6821
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:30,330
You know what I'm saying?

6822
03:07:30,870 --> 03:07:32,550
Dog Coming Times.

6823
03:07:32,551 --> 03:07:33,700
We disagreed about shit.

6824
03:07:33,930 --> 03:07:34,763
We've had some,

6825
03:07:35,220 --> 03:07:37,350
we've had some intense disagreements.

6826
03:07:37,351 --> 03:07:37,890
Yes,

6827
03:07:37,890 --> 03:07:39,300
we've had some intense disagreements,

6828
03:07:39,301 --> 03:07:43,050
but through those disagreements you
learn to consider other people's

6829
03:07:43,051 --> 03:07:43,850
perspectives,

6830
03:07:43,850 --> 03:07:44,790
but online Joe,

6831
03:07:44,791 --> 03:07:45,920
they call it they,

6832
03:07:45,970 --> 03:07:46,441
they'll say it's,

6833
03:07:46,441 --> 03:07:46,621
hey,

6834
03:07:46,621 --> 03:07:47,870
it's called critical thinking.

6835
03:07:48,510 --> 03:07:52,590
She doesn't listen to my love
for both of you and you too.

6836
03:07:52,591 --> 03:07:53,790
All My love for all of you.

6837
03:07:53,850 --> 03:07:57,510
It doesn't change dependent upon whether
or not I agree with you or disagree

6838
03:07:57,511 --> 03:07:57,860
with you.

6839
03:07:57,860 --> 03:07:58,693
Yes,

6840
03:07:59,830 --> 03:08:00,371
exactly.

6841
03:08:00,371 --> 03:08:03,330
Arrest example of that
is the chem trail issue.

6842
03:08:06,540 --> 03:08:07,373
Yes.

6843
03:08:07,770 --> 03:08:12,770
It's pretty good damn chem trail and
I'm all about Kevin and feel like I,

6844
03:08:15,010 --> 03:08:16,410
this is what I really feel like.

6845
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:21,090
I feel like it is entirely possible
that at one point in time they have

6846
03:08:21,091 --> 03:08:23,040
experimented with spraying things in the,

6847
03:08:23,250 --> 03:08:23,830
you were fucked.

6848
03:08:23,830 --> 03:08:26,430
It's entirely not possible.

6849
03:08:26,431 --> 03:08:30,860
They do it all the time and then it's
just they just scattered will try to

6850
03:08:30,861 --> 03:08:32,260
control it all the time,

6851
03:08:35,160 --> 03:08:40,160
but then there's the issue of all the
tensions all go through condensation and

6852
03:08:40,621 --> 03:08:41,400
the atmosphere.

6853
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:46,400
No one said they would actually change
the temperature daughter getting sucked

6854
03:08:46,890 --> 03:08:48,650
into turbines.

6855
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:51,893
Exactly.

6856
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:52,883
Like,

6857
03:08:57,770 --> 03:08:58,603
Hey,

6858
03:09:03,250 --> 03:09:05,900
I love you and you're trying
to tell me that the NGS,

6859
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:06,900
that's what we're trying to tell you.

6860
03:09:07,530 --> 03:09:08,363
Yes,

6861
03:09:08,490 --> 03:09:09,323
yes,

6862
03:09:09,850 --> 03:09:10,290
yes.

6863
03:09:10,290 --> 03:09:11,123
Heady

6864
03:09:12,980 --> 03:09:16,140
fucking told me that nine 11 was real.

6865
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:17,333
What do you mean real?

6866
03:09:17,610 --> 03:09:21,300
It actually happened while I was
here September 11th and then,

6867
03:09:21,301 --> 03:09:21,480
uh,

6868
03:09:21,480 --> 03:09:23,160
I woke up on September 12th and I'm like,

6869
03:09:23,161 --> 03:09:23,994
I'm pretty sure

6870
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:27,780
both towers were a hologram.

6871
03:09:27,781 --> 03:09:28,920
That shit never existed.

6872
03:09:29,460 --> 03:09:30,450
Look in the scriptures,

6873
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:31,591
the scriptures,

6874
03:09:31,591 --> 03:09:33,130
they never talked about the twin town

6875
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:36,190
wine in your mom.

6876
03:09:38,200 --> 03:09:39,670
Chaos.

6877
03:09:40,180 --> 03:09:41,790
And you know you're doing
the riders on the storm.

6878
03:09:41,791 --> 03:09:43,800
You know the craziest thing
about the riders on the storm,

6879
03:09:43,890 --> 03:09:45,360
the craziest thing about the doors.

6880
03:09:45,510 --> 03:09:49,050
Do you know the Jim Morrison's dad
orchestrated the Gulf of Tonkin?

6881
03:09:49,910 --> 03:09:50,250
No.

6882
03:09:50,250 --> 03:09:51,210
Fucking no.

6883
03:09:51,270 --> 03:09:51,780
Wow.

6884
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:52,410
This is the,

6885
03:09:52,410 --> 03:09:53,080
that makes sense.

6886
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:53,460
This is,

6887
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:53,890
this is,

6888
03:09:53,890 --> 03:09:54,100
this

6889
03:09:54,100 --> 03:09:55,450
is the craziest thing.

6890
03:09:55,750 --> 03:09:57,240
And that's not in the best conspiracy.

6891
03:09:57,241 --> 03:09:58,074
Jamie

6892
03:10:00,160 --> 03:10:00,993
gold.

6893
03:10:03,250 --> 03:10:05,830
He was a navy high level,

6894
03:10:06,880 --> 03:10:07,713
high level.

6895
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:11,650
Jim Morrison's dad orchestrated
the Gulf of Tonkin,

6896
03:10:11,651 --> 03:10:12,484
but his dad,

6897
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:13,360
because his dad,

6898
03:10:13,590 --> 03:10:14,423
his dad,

6899
03:10:14,990 --> 03:10:15,521
it's real.

6900
03:10:15,521 --> 03:10:17,180
It's not a conspiracy right?

6901
03:10:17,230 --> 03:10:17,531
This week,

6902
03:10:17,531 --> 03:10:22,360
a pdf pages being friends with
both Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo.

6903
03:10:22,361 --> 03:10:24,160
Occasionally they have solid points.

03:10:44,140 --> 03:10:44,830
There's a,

6922
03:10:44,830 --> 03:10:45,490
there's a,

6923
03:10:45,490 --> 03:10:46,990
you got to know that there's a,

6924
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:51,460
there's a woman named Kay Greg who
was married to a high ranking army,

6925
03:10:51,560 --> 03:10:52,030
uh,

6926
03:10:52,030 --> 03:10:52,631

03:10:55,570 --> 03:10:57,300
They were married and he,

6931
03:10:57,320 --> 03:10:59,050
and she knows all about his life.

6932
03:10:59,051 --> 03:11:01,450
He was raised as an assassin.

6933
03:11:01,690 --> 03:11:02,051
He was,

6934
03:11:02,051 --> 03:11:03,190
he was a navy seal.

6935
03:11:03,191 --> 03:11:05,470
He was a CIA operative.

6936
03:11:05,650 --> 03:11:07,690
He was UN special forces.

6937
03:11:07,870 --> 03:11:09,700
And then you became a high ranking.

6938
03:11:09,701 --> 03:11:10,560
This is not a conspiracy.

6939
03:11:10,590 --> 03:11:12,960
You're talking about the movie
trip on his name is George Griggs.

6940
03:11:13,090 --> 03:11:13,540
There's,

6942
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:15,260
Okay.

6943
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:16,720
Did you just give us the plots of triple?

6944
03:11:17,290 --> 03:11:18,123
Exactly,

6945
03:11:18,380 --> 03:11:19,213
exactly.

6946
03:11:27,400 --> 03:11:28,770
There's a woman and K Griggs.

6947
03:11:28,771 --> 03:11:29,140

6948
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:29,973

6949
03:11:29,980 --> 03:11:30,261

6950
03:11:30,261 --> 03:11:30,610
she's,

6951
03:11:30,610 --> 03:11:31,810
she was all in it too.

6952
03:11:31,820 --> 03:11:32,653
She's,

6953
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:37,800
there's an eight hour interview of hers
chopped up a million times with one

6954
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:38,833
chip.

6955
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:40,180
You can believe it or not.

6956
03:11:40,181 --> 03:11:41,620
Maybe she's a little crazy bitch.

6957
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:41,970
Well,

6958
03:11:41,970 --> 03:11:43,290
let me take you through this chicken.

6959
03:11:43,320 --> 03:11:44,153
Be Crazy,

6960
03:11:44,170 --> 03:11:45,003
fully shit.

6961
03:11:45,100 --> 03:11:45,640
She was like,

6962
03:11:45,640 --> 03:11:46,780
she basically tells,

6963
03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:48,100
she's basically saying,

6964
03:11:48,470 --> 03:11:49,000
uh,

6965
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:53,710
how the world is run based on her
husband who was high ranking and army

6966
03:11:53,711 --> 03:11:54,520
intelligence.

6967
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:57,940
Real good friends with George
senior like right there.

6968
03:11:58,360 --> 03:11:59,050
She was,

6969
03:11:59,050 --> 03:12:01,780
she basically is a whistleblower.

6970
03:12:01,960 --> 03:12:02,530
She's on,

6971
03:12:02,530 --> 03:12:03,880
there's one interview,

6972
03:12:04,060 --> 03:12:04,681
eight hour,

6973
03:12:04,681 --> 03:12:06,940
she goes off and she breaks
it off and she makes you,

6974
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:08,320
if you believe what she says,

6975
03:12:08,440 --> 03:12:10,840
she basically says the CIA.

6976
03:12:10,930 --> 03:12:12,460
That's just a scape goat.

6977
03:12:12,880 --> 03:12:14,080
There aren't doing shit.

6978
03:12:14,110 --> 03:12:17,440
The people that are really running
the world or army intelligence,

6979
03:12:17,470 --> 03:12:19,690
naval intelligence and
air force intelligence,

6980
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:21,480
she said they're the one K Griggs.

6981
03:12:21,680 --> 03:12:22,330
That's there's,

6982
03:12:22,330 --> 03:12:22,920
she says,

6983
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:23,800
she says that,

6984
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:24,340
that,

6985
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:25,720
that fucking money in the world,

6986
03:12:25,900 --> 03:12:26,733
they're all,

6987
03:12:27,160 --> 03:12:28,060
and what it's all about,

6988
03:12:28,210 --> 03:12:31,350
it's all about a gun running and,

6989
03:12:31,351 --> 03:12:31,900
and uh,

6990
03:12:31,900 --> 03:12:33,160
and just selling arms.

6991
03:12:33,161 --> 03:12:34,140
It's all about all,

6992
03:12:34,340 --> 03:12:35,200
it's like Mafia.

6993
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:36,670
It's all high ranking,

6994
03:12:36,671 --> 03:12:37,630
army intelligence,

6995
03:12:37,750 --> 03:12:39,070
Mafia gun running,

6996
03:12:39,071 --> 03:12:39,904
drug running.

6997
03:12:40,030 --> 03:12:41,020
They've always done it.

6998
03:12:41,021 --> 03:12:42,070
Her husband's part of it.

6999
03:12:42,370 --> 03:12:44,140
It's these assassins.

7000
03:12:44,440 --> 03:12:45,220
They uh,

7001
03:12:45,220 --> 03:12:46,260
can neuro Jews.

7002
03:12:46,290 --> 03:12:46,381
No,

7003
03:12:46,381 --> 03:12:46,871
but if you,

7004
03:12:46,871 --> 03:12:47,441
if you believe that,

7005
03:12:47,441 --> 03:12:47,621
okay,

7006
03:12:47,621 --> 03:12:48,454
if you believe that,

7007
03:12:48,790 --> 03:12:49,481
let me take it through the,

7008
03:12:49,481 --> 03:12:50,590
so she's saying,

7009
03:12:50,990 --> 03:12:53,570
I thought you took army intelligence
runs through all the shit.

7010
03:12:53,571 --> 03:12:53,870
Right?

7011
03:12:53,870 --> 03:12:54,380
So then you,

7012
03:12:54,380 --> 03:12:56,120
then you find out that,

7013
03:12:56,510 --> 03:12:56,960
um,

7014
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:58,680
you know that actor Rockstar Dude,

7015
03:12:58,730 --> 03:12:59,563
Jared Leto.

7016
03:12:59,600 --> 03:12:59,880
Yeah.

7017
03:12:59,880 --> 03:13:00,960
You spread your sweetheart.

7018
03:13:01,280 --> 03:13:03,140
He bought for $4 million.

7019
03:13:03,260 --> 03:13:06,440
He bought in the Laurel
Canyon in the Hollywood hills.

7020
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:11,560
He bought a former top secret air
force intelligence base there.

7021
03:13:12,711 --> 03:13:14,810
Was that in Hollywood?

7022
03:13:16,630 --> 03:13:17,463
This is Jeremy.

7023
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:18,381
No,

7024
03:13:18,381 --> 03:13:19,040
no.

7025
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:19,311
Okay.

7026
03:13:19,311 --> 03:13:20,144
I'm trying to let him,

7027
03:13:20,210 --> 03:13:20,481
let him,

7028
03:13:20,481 --> 03:13:20,841
come on,

7029
03:13:20,841 --> 03:13:21,020
man.

7030
03:13:21,020 --> 03:13:24,250
This is how it connects to Jim
Morrison trying to connect them.

7031
03:13:25,520 --> 03:13:26,930
I don't know if this is real,

7032
03:13:27,080 --> 03:13:28,310
but this is what I've looked into.

7033
03:13:28,311 --> 03:13:28,871
You Look,

7034
03:13:28,871 --> 03:13:30,230
look investigating the shadow.

7035
03:13:30,231 --> 03:13:33,610
We conspiracy that Jared Leto the lead.

7036
03:13:33,611 --> 03:13:35,410
Jared Leto to bother nuclear fucking

7037
03:13:38,480 --> 03:13:39,620
curb Los Angeles.

7038
03:13:39,621 --> 03:13:40,130
Yeah.

7039
03:13:40,130 --> 03:13:40,491
Okay,

7040
03:13:40,491 --> 03:13:43,850
so you don't think that
Jared Oban top secret air?

7041
03:13:43,880 --> 03:13:44,770
You don't believe that's true.

7042
03:13:45,620 --> 03:13:46,380
Hold on.

7043
03:13:46,380 --> 03:13:47,000
Hold on.

7044
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:47,710
That's real.

7045
03:13:47,710 --> 03:13:48,150
Okay.

7046
03:13:48,150 --> 03:13:48,940
Hold on.

7047
03:13:48,940 --> 03:13:49,773
What's the big deal?

7048
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:51,880
I know you haven't.

7049
03:13:52,910 --> 03:13:54,770
I know you have this
instinct to mock things.

7050
03:13:54,880 --> 03:13:55,980
I'm like a monkey.

7051
03:13:58,360 --> 03:13:59,193
Fuck him.

7052
03:14:00,420 --> 03:14:01,730
Let him no man.

7053
03:14:01,731 --> 03:14:03,290
I'm with Jerry in your mind.

7054
03:14:05,030 --> 03:14:08,810
There's no need to watch you watch TV.

7055
03:14:08,811 --> 03:14:09,501
That's not true.

7056
03:14:09,501 --> 03:14:14,501
When you accept not to qualify them,

7057
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:18,490
please continue.

7058
03:14:18,710 --> 03:14:19,820
This is game of Thrones,

7059
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:23,000
which may have an ounce of truth.

7060
03:14:23,780 --> 03:14:24,441
It makes it better,

7061
03:14:24,441 --> 03:14:25,370
but game of Thrones.

7062
03:14:25,371 --> 03:14:25,641
Okay,

7063
03:14:25,641 --> 03:14:26,061
your watch,

7064
03:14:26,061 --> 03:14:26,631
game of Thrones.

7065
03:14:26,631 --> 03:14:28,490
This is so Jared Leto.

7066
03:14:28,640 --> 03:14:29,330
If you look at it,

7067
03:14:29,330 --> 03:14:34,330
he bought a top secret for since the
forties it was top secret and what they

7068
03:14:35,151 --> 03:14:35,661
find them,

7069
03:14:35,661 --> 03:14:37,220
and this is all this is
not conspiracy theory,

7070
03:14:37,221 --> 03:14:42,221
that this top secret air
force intelligence base was
mainly a full fucking force

7071
03:14:44,030 --> 03:14:46,670
film studio where they
make propaganda films,

7072
03:14:46,730 --> 03:14:47,091
right?

7073
03:14:47,091 --> 03:14:48,020
Healing Hollywood,

all of them making propaganda
films that no one can,

7078
03:14:54,900 --> 03:14:57,440
there's no records of what
films were made there.

7079
03:14:57,560 --> 03:15:00,200
You can't tell which films
are made in the studio,

7080
03:15:00,201 --> 03:15:00,920
which warrant,

7081
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:01,660
because like,

7082
03:15:01,660 --> 03:15:01,970
whoa.

7083
03:15:01,970 --> 03:15:02,830
And then you start looking,

7084
03:15:02,850 --> 03:15:03,683
you're like,

7085
03:15:03,920 --> 03:15:04,311

7086
03:15:04,311 --> 03:15:04,820
okay.

7087
03:15:04,820 --> 03:15:05,180
Okay,

7088
03:15:05,180 --> 03:15:07,640
Jared Leto bought this air force.

7089
03:15:07,641 --> 03:15:08,150
Okay.

7090
03:15:08,150 --> 03:15:08,983
And then you,

7091
03:15:09,230 --> 03:15:10,370
there's this book called,

7092
03:15:10,371 --> 03:15:11,150

7093
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:11,450

03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:17,670
unless it's,

7097
03:15:17,670 --> 03:15:18,700
this is the craziest Shit,

7098
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:19,310
if you look,

7099
03:15:19,310 --> 03:15:20,720
it is not a conspiracy theory.

7100
03:15:21,110 --> 03:15:23,090
All the bands from the mid sixties,

7101
03:15:23,150 --> 03:15:23,810
the doors,

7102
03:15:23,810 --> 03:15:24,643

7103
03:15:24,650 --> 03:15:25,310

Crosby,

7107
03:15:27,921 --> 03:15:28,754
stills and Nash,

7108
03:15:28,790 --> 03:15:31,180
they all came from Loral
King and mother sucker.

7109
03:15:35,670 --> 03:15:36,503
Hey,

7110
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:37,953
after this,

7111
03:15:38,020 --> 03:15:39,000
he's been on 16.

7112
03:15:39,010 --> 03:15:40,690
I know this is okay.

7113
03:15:40,730 --> 03:15:41,563
Okay.

7114
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:43,760
So sorry to tell you some shit.

7115
03:15:44,710 --> 03:15:45,543
Okay,

7116
03:15:45,930 --> 03:15:46,220
so,

7117
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:48,470
so this is what this book is about.

7118
03:15:48,620 --> 03:15:50,120
This book is about it.

7119
03:15:50,170 --> 03:15:51,840
Isn't it fucking weird?

7120
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:56,960
Isn't it fucking suspicious and crazy
that there's this top secret air force

7121
03:15:58,441 --> 03:16:03,441
intelligence base right there in Laurel
Canyon and in the mid sixties all the

7122
03:16:03,961 --> 03:16:06,570
bands that started the hippie movement,

7123
03:16:06,690 --> 03:16:08,400
the Anti War movement,

7124
03:16:08,490 --> 03:16:09,530
they all came from law.

7125
03:16:09,570 --> 03:16:12,090
They all came from Laurel Canyon cosmic.

7126
03:16:12,450 --> 03:16:13,230
And guess what?

7127
03:16:13,230 --> 03:16:16,020
All their parents are in intelligence.

7128
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:17,190
So these were all,

7129
03:16:17,610 --> 03:16:18,241
all of them,

7130
03:16:18,241 --> 03:16:19,080
the doors,

7131
03:16:19,110 --> 03:16:21,750
all of them came through Laurel Canyon.

7132
03:16:21,900 --> 03:16:22,733
They're all,

7133
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:23,940
most of them in the bath.

7134
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,280
None of them got drafted to Vietnam.

7135
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:27,570
None of them got drafted.

7136
03:16:27,840 --> 03:16:31,680
Jim Morrison's father orchestrated
the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

7137
03:16:31,800 --> 03:16:33,330
It gets pretty fucking weird.

7138
03:16:33,570 --> 03:16:35,490
Like this is crazy fucking weird.

7139
03:16:35,760 --> 03:16:40,760
And Jared fucking letter was raised by
his grandfather was on his Brian Suggest

7140
03:16:41,630 --> 03:16:42,463
Brian.

7141
03:16:42,670 --> 03:16:43,090
Brian.

7142
03:16:43,090 --> 03:16:43,923
Brian.

7143
03:16:43,970 --> 03:16:44,220
No,

7144
03:16:44,220 --> 03:16:44,350
no,

7145
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:44,640
no.

7146
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:46,200
Let him sit through this.

7147
03:16:46,230 --> 03:16:46,591
I got it.

7148
03:16:46,591 --> 03:16:47,670
The Guy who wrote the book,

7149
03:16:47,671 --> 03:16:49,080
his name is

7150
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:52,273
Sean.

7151
03:16:52,550 --> 03:16:53,140
I don't care.

7152
03:16:53,140 --> 03:16:53,973
It isn't that.

7153
03:16:54,100 --> 03:16:55,320
The book is called David.

7154
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:57,720
Dave McGough.

7155
03:16:58,680 --> 03:16:59,513
I've heard of him.

7156
03:16:59,590 --> 03:16:59,960
Yeah.

7157
03:16:59,960 --> 03:17:02,250
So according to him,

7158
03:17:02,370 --> 03:17:03,570
and when you look into this,

7159
03:17:04,170 --> 03:17:08,820
out of nowhere in the sixties
these bands didn't struggle.

7160
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:10,350
They got signed quick.

7161
03:17:10,530 --> 03:17:11,310
All of them.

7162
03:17:11,310 --> 03:17:14,220
All these clubs in Hollywood
pop up the Troubadour,

7163
03:17:14,460 --> 03:17:15,120
the whiskey.

7164
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:16,950
This guy investigated this shit.

7165
03:17:17,700 --> 03:17:18,330
Yeah,

7166
03:17:18,330 --> 03:17:20,460
there's a conspiracy theory out there.

7167
03:17:20,461 --> 03:17:21,570
It could be total bullshit.

7168
03:17:21,630 --> 03:17:22,810
It could be totally blows,

7169
03:17:23,220 --> 03:17:26,970
but there's a conspiracy theory out there
that you Loral king and there was some

7170
03:17:26,971 --> 03:17:27,804
intelligence.

7171
03:17:27,990 --> 03:17:28,620
There was a,

7172
03:17:28,620 --> 03:17:29,670
there was a base.

7173
03:17:29,671 --> 03:17:29,971
Brian,

7174
03:17:29,971 --> 03:17:30,451
let him finish.

7175
03:17:30,451 --> 03:17:32,100
Please let him,

7176
03:17:33,090 --> 03:17:33,923
don't tell me.

7177
03:17:34,080 --> 03:17:37,650
Don't tell me that the military
fucking wrote that awesome music,

7178
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:39,060
that fucking Crosby stills,

7179
03:17:39,061 --> 03:17:40,660
Nash and young kids in.

7180
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:43,470
Dare you everybody.

7181
03:17:43,471 --> 03:17:44,610
Let me talk for a long time.

7182
03:17:44,670 --> 03:17:45,350
You got to let Bryan.

7183
03:17:45,350 --> 03:17:45,680
Okay.

7184
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:50,310
How dare you give the u s military or
the Air Force or anybody in the u s

7185
03:17:50,311 --> 03:17:54,300
government credit for the fucking
awesome rock and roll that came out and

7186
03:17:54,301 --> 03:17:58,180
culminated in 1968 Bam.

7187
03:17:58,430 --> 03:18:00,120
Peaking at Haight Ashbury.

7188
03:18:00,150 --> 03:18:02,350
How fucking dare you the Mamas in the box.

7189
03:18:03,160 --> 03:18:06,100
You are a fucking plant
and you worked for the u s

7190
03:18:06,430 --> 03:18:07,263
fucking

7191
03:18:12,640 --> 03:18:13,280
beat me up.

7192
03:18:13,280 --> 03:18:14,113
God,

7193
03:18:14,450 --> 03:18:15,720
let your fuck my ass hole.

7194
03:18:15,810 --> 03:18:16,231
All Right,

7195
03:18:16,231 --> 03:18:16,801
ladies and gentlemen,

7196
03:18:16,801 --> 03:18:17,920
this has been the Joe Rogan.

7197
03:18:18,860 --> 03:18:18,931
Oh,

7198
03:18:18,931 --> 03:18:19,764
sorry.

7199
03:18:21,650 --> 03:18:25,080
I thought I was fucking a lies

7200
03:18:25,090 --> 03:18:25,301
this,

7201
03:18:25,301 --> 03:18:28,930
as much as I realized this as much as
anybody who has his big brown and we're

7202
03:18:28,931 --> 03:18:29,764
all parents.

7203
03:18:29,950 --> 03:18:30,400
Okay.

7204
03:18:30,400 --> 03:18:35,400
What we realize is it takes a lot of
fucking time and effort to raise children

7205
03:18:35,980 --> 03:18:38,860
and communicate with
children and raise children.

7206
03:18:38,890 --> 03:18:40,150
It's a lot of time.

7207
03:18:40,330 --> 03:18:41,770
And if you're working for the government,

7208
03:18:41,771 --> 03:18:44,970
you don't have that kind of time.

7209
03:18:44,971 --> 03:18:45,790
Correct.

7210
03:18:45,790 --> 03:18:48,010
Certainly don't have
the kind of to hit and

7211
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:51,550
tie some fucking kid and brainwashed
them into make it in the most excellent

7212
03:18:51,551 --> 03:18:52,810
music the world's ever known.

7213
03:18:54,370 --> 03:18:55,060
Hold on.

7214
03:18:55,060 --> 03:19:00,060
That is the opposite of what
I [inaudible] let you talk.

7215
03:19:01,750 --> 03:19:02,201
Keep going.

7216
03:19:02,201 --> 03:19:03,490
Just the opposite.

7217
03:19:03,530 --> 03:19:07,720
What the opposite is is a child
that grows up in an oppressive,

7218
03:19:07,750 --> 03:19:12,370
strict conservative family that's
connected to the military and realize that

7219
03:19:12,371 --> 03:19:13,450
this is bullshit.

7220
03:19:13,540 --> 03:19:15,730
And they start doing drugs and acid.

7221
03:19:15,731 --> 03:19:16,780
They start drinking,

7222
03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:20,260
they started hanging out with fucking
Weirdos and they produce amazing music.

7223
03:19:20,261 --> 03:19:20,611
Yes.

7224
03:19:20,611 --> 03:19:23,680
And that's what we see and
you can connect it to them,

7225
03:19:23,890 --> 03:19:26,020
but I think it's an erroneous connections.

7226
03:19:26,140 --> 03:19:29,890
I think it's a connection and it appeals
to your desire to think that the world

7227
03:19:29,891 --> 03:19:34,080
is controlled by a cabal
of intelligent super.

7228
03:19:34,470 --> 03:19:34,960
Come on.

7229
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:39,960
He and I liked the cabal of intelligent
super geniuses that have somehow figured

7230
03:19:40,121 --> 03:19:43,450
out in a way to manage
their own love lives.

7231
03:19:43,451 --> 03:19:46,570
They're all in financial
accounts are on real estate,

7232
03:19:46,571 --> 03:19:47,740
fucking holdings.

7233
03:19:47,741 --> 03:19:50,050
Their own stock market portfolios,

7234
03:19:50,260 --> 03:19:53,020
their own relationships
with their coworkers,

7235
03:19:53,021 --> 03:19:54,310
their hobbies,

7236
03:19:54,500 --> 03:19:58,030
the hookers that they occasionally
stick their penis into.

7237
03:19:58,300 --> 03:20:02,020
They have time for all
that plus chem trails.

7238
03:20:02,530 --> 03:20:04,690
I say no,

7239
03:20:04,900 --> 03:20:07,470
there's not just time in the,

7240
03:20:08,140 --> 03:20:13,140
and the government did not
make [inaudible] is not
responsible for their doors.

7241
03:20:16,230 --> 03:20:17,190
I talked about this.

7242
03:20:17,380 --> 03:20:18,730
I talked about this before.

7243
03:20:19,030 --> 03:20:20,500
I want to,

7244
03:20:20,920 --> 03:20:23,290
I want to be in the Goddamn
it a little bit naughty.

7245
03:20:23,291 --> 03:20:24,460
If their goddamn listening.

7246
03:20:24,550 --> 03:20:25,383
Of course you do.

7247
03:20:27,470 --> 03:20:32,470
You're just gave the military the military
credit for all the great music that

7248
03:20:32,681 --> 03:20:37,681
came out of the 60s you fucking military
helps you or I fucking just shift your

7249
03:20:38,210 --> 03:20:38,810
shot.

7250
03:20:38,810 --> 03:20:41,050
Want to start my own false flowers.

7251
03:20:41,051 --> 03:20:43,300
Jones is going to call you
a shield Monday morning.

7252
03:20:43,450 --> 03:20:47,650
We got a disturbing turn of events at
Eddie Bravo of how I've had on this

7253
03:20:47,651 --> 03:20:48,484
podcast.

7254
03:20:48,610 --> 03:20:51,060
I did not know he was
in the Illuminati Shit.

7255
03:20:51,370 --> 03:20:52,060
Fuck yeah,

7256
03:20:52,060 --> 03:20:54,370
he is on the Joe Rogan experience.

7257
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:55,130
Yes,

7258
03:20:55,130 --> 03:20:55,800
I didn't do it.

7259
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:57,430
Get trails proven to be false.

7260
03:20:57,431 --> 03:20:58,070
Fuck yeah.

7261
03:20:58,070 --> 03:20:58,903
Fuck yeah.

7262
03:20:59,140 --> 03:20:59,830
Fuck yeah.

7263
03:20:59,830 --> 03:21:00,820
I want to fucking,

7264
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:01,713
oh my God.

7265
03:21:01,810 --> 03:21:02,643
You're in.

7266
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:03,071
Oh,

7267
03:21:03,071 --> 03:21:03,461
please.

7268
03:21:03,461 --> 03:21:03,820
Let me,

7269
03:21:03,820 --> 03:21:04,653
let me this way.

7270
03:21:04,730 --> 03:21:05,563
My own fault.

7271
03:21:06,100 --> 03:21:07,030
I talked about this before.

7272
03:21:07,090 --> 03:21:07,923
I would,

7273
03:21:07,940 --> 03:21:10,330
if I would get that
fucking oil from Alaska,

7274
03:21:10,450 --> 03:21:12,160
I would go in there and make it,

7275
03:21:12,340 --> 03:21:13,360
make us elect Trump,

7276
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:14,950
make it look like the eye.

7277
03:21:15,010 --> 03:21:16,540
Isis is uh,

7278
03:21:16,860 --> 03:21:17,590
uh,

7279
03:21:17,590 --> 03:21:19,300
Eskimos are trained in Isis.

7280
03:21:19,480 --> 03:21:20,250
I would,

7281
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:20,560
you know,

7282
03:21:20,560 --> 03:21:24,690
you're a national treasure and I love
the blue whale is a national trend.

7283
03:21:24,691 --> 03:21:24,851
I mean,

7284
03:21:24,851 --> 03:21:25,450
these things are true.

7285
03:21:25,450 --> 03:21:27,370
It has to be frustrating at
iie to believe something.

7286
03:21:27,371 --> 03:21:27,781
He goes,

7287
03:21:27,781 --> 03:21:32,470
you constantly have to back years
ago and this is very exhausted

7288
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:38,320
with what we were talking
about before the podcast.

7289
03:21:38,321 --> 03:21:39,190
Just think about that.

7290
03:21:39,580 --> 03:21:41,020
It's the same shit.

7291
03:21:41,050 --> 03:21:42,160
It's like that.

7292
03:21:42,460 --> 03:21:44,200
It's like God damn.

7293
03:21:44,320 --> 03:21:45,153
Sometimes it's,

7294
03:21:45,170 --> 03:21:46,490
please Illuminati.

7295
03:21:46,490 --> 03:21:46,941
Take me.

7296
03:21:46,941 --> 03:21:48,500
I want to fuck these mother fuckers.

7297
03:21:48,770 --> 03:21:52,610
I want to fuck with these
motherfuckers that science and,

7298
03:21:52,850 --> 03:21:53,301
Oh,

7299
03:21:53,301 --> 03:21:54,870
I want to get science.

7300
03:21:56,590 --> 03:21:57,860
Why are you measuring shit?

7301
03:21:57,920 --> 03:21:59,580
You

7302
03:22:02,020 --> 03:22:03,460
know that the crazy thing is,

7303
03:22:03,990 --> 03:22:04,370
oh,

7304
03:22:04,370 --> 03:22:05,600
your distance and your speed.

7305
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:06,853
Ooh.

7306
03:22:08,190 --> 03:22:09,023
Ooh.

7307
03:22:09,960 --> 03:22:10,970
What about psychics,

7308
03:22:10,971 --> 03:22:11,804
Bro?

7309
03:22:13,320 --> 03:22:15,050
Your measurable experiments.

7310
03:22:18,170 --> 03:22:19,490
How come y'all see the same shit,

7311
03:22:19,491 --> 03:22:20,150
Bro?

7312
03:22:20,150 --> 03:22:21,820
Every time I went to a psychic bro,

7313
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:24,680
this tastes like shit.

7314
03:22:24,740 --> 03:22:25,573
I love that chaser.

7315
03:22:25,670 --> 03:22:26,130
It's weird.

7316
03:22:26,130 --> 03:22:26,720
It's both.

7317
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:28,070
I think both things are true.

7318
03:22:28,130 --> 03:22:28,371
I mean,

7319
03:22:28,371 --> 03:22:32,900
Gulf of Tonkin was obviously a
coordinated false flag event.

7320
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:33,601
Uh,

7321
03:22:33,601 --> 03:22:38,601
the operation Northwoods was obviously
an idea that they had tried to pass where

7322
03:22:38,781 --> 03:22:40,520
it got through the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

7323
03:22:40,521 --> 03:22:43,940
It was signed and vetoed by Kennedy
where they're going to have a false flag.

7324
03:22:43,941 --> 03:22:45,020
And American civilians,

7325
03:22:45,230 --> 03:22:48,350
there's obviously have been
throughout human history,

7326
03:22:48,560 --> 03:22:50,960
liars and manipulators
that were in charge.

7327
03:22:51,050 --> 03:22:51,883
So we should do,

7328
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:54,080
we should certainly have
some healthy skepticism,

7329
03:22:54,380 --> 03:22:56,690
but we also have to
take any consideration.

7330
03:22:56,690 --> 03:22:58,790
How much fucking time does
a person having a day?

7331
03:22:59,150 --> 03:23:00,560
Who are all these masterminds?

7332
03:23:00,561 --> 03:23:02,300
I got much of this is just convenient.

7333
03:23:02,470 --> 03:23:03,050
Yes.

7334
03:23:03,050 --> 03:23:04,310
You're talking about the exception.

7335
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:05,120
Yeah.

7336
03:23:05,120 --> 03:23:05,841
Well how much of,

7337
03:23:05,841 --> 03:23:06,920
how much of what's going on?

7338
03:23:06,921 --> 03:23:08,300
Like the 60 shit,

7339
03:23:08,450 --> 03:23:09,770
how much is just convenient,

7340
03:23:09,771 --> 03:23:10,550
rebellion,

7341
03:23:10,550 --> 03:23:11,570
obvious rebellion.

7342
03:23:11,880 --> 03:23:16,220
If you grow up with someone who's some
sort of a fucking military asshole track

7343
03:23:16,221 --> 03:23:17,240
and he's super strict,

7344
03:23:17,450 --> 03:23:17,691
I mean,

7345
03:23:17,691 --> 03:23:20,360
I mean how many rock stars
have come from that background?

7346
03:23:20,390 --> 03:23:22,100
It's like a giant number.

7347
03:23:22,190 --> 03:23:23,060
It's their outlet.

7348
03:23:23,210 --> 03:23:25,890
Being creative and trying to be a fight.

7349
03:23:26,970 --> 03:23:28,190
Talked to Cody Garbrandt.

7350
03:23:28,370 --> 03:23:31,370
He did not have a fucking
cool seventh grade,

7351
03:23:31,670 --> 03:23:36,670
you know for sure some shit
who's a Stepdad and mom
had turned out brand tattoo

7352
03:23:41,331 --> 03:23:43,610
on your neck that says like self-made.

7353
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:44,593
Yeah.

7354
03:23:45,020 --> 03:23:47,060
That's like you're trying
to fight off something.

7355
03:23:47,090 --> 03:23:47,421
That's right.

7356
03:23:47,421 --> 03:23:47,840
Yeah.

7357
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:49,900
You're not homecoming
king and the neck tests,

7358
03:23:50,690 --> 03:23:53,770
but we also have to be taking
into consideration that,

7359
03:23:53,771 --> 03:23:55,610
like we were talking
about with bears earlier,

7360
03:23:55,730 --> 03:23:57,620
the bears don't have natural predators,

7361
03:23:57,800 --> 03:23:58,980
so nature is rigged.

7362
03:23:58,980 --> 03:23:59,813
Them Weird.

7363
03:23:59,850 --> 03:24:03,500
They've nature's wired them in some
weird way with they eat babies,

7364
03:24:03,770 --> 03:24:06,470
whereas wolves don't do that
cause he have to survive.

7365
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:07,640
Elk Don't do that.

7366
03:24:07,641 --> 03:24:08,660
Pigs don't do that.

7367
03:24:08,661 --> 03:24:11,450
They have to take care of their babies
because it's not as easy for them to

7368
03:24:11,451 --> 03:24:12,170
survive.

7369
03:24:12,170 --> 03:24:14,540
But the bears got to the
top of the food chain.

7370
03:24:14,541 --> 03:24:15,110
They realized,

7371
03:24:15,110 --> 03:24:16,100
oh no,

7372
03:24:16,490 --> 03:24:17,211
we're fucked.

7373
03:24:17,211 --> 03:24:17,870
Like we,

7374
03:24:17,870 --> 03:24:18,920
no one can eat us.

7375
03:24:19,070 --> 03:24:23,240
So we can just keep fucking and making
millions of us and we overcome all the

7376
03:24:23,241 --> 03:24:24,710
food and we'll all starve to death.

7377
03:24:25,010 --> 03:24:25,311
Okay,

7378
03:24:25,311 --> 03:24:29,180
we can start eating our
babies and nature's rigged
them in some sort of a weird

7379
03:24:29,181 --> 03:24:29,630
way.

7380
03:24:29,630 --> 03:24:30,650
You got to eat a baby.

7381
03:24:30,710 --> 03:24:32,890
Which one out of three babies too?

7382
03:24:33,340 --> 03:24:34,071
When you come to my house,

7383
03:24:34,071 --> 03:24:36,560
do not give me a hard time
when you see my fucking mail.

7384
03:24:36,680 --> 03:24:38,780
Seven foot eight maybe eight.

7385
03:24:38,781 --> 03:24:40,040
Six cause I'm dead.

7386
03:24:40,041 --> 03:24:41,960
I and I got a nose for fucking bear.

7387
03:24:42,320 --> 03:24:43,980
Do not give me a hard time
when you wiggle your toes

7388
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:46,830
to my fucking rug cause I
am saving bears by killing.

7389
03:24:46,831 --> 03:24:47,860
There's no sound.

7390
03:24:47,900 --> 03:24:48,733
So

7391
03:24:50,550 --> 03:24:51,480
we got a paper rock,

7392
03:24:51,481 --> 03:24:52,314
scissor who

7393
03:24:53,460 --> 03:24:54,030
we don't know.

7394
03:24:54,030 --> 03:24:54,750
We don't have to.

7395
03:24:54,750 --> 03:24:54,871
No,

7396
03:24:54,871 --> 03:24:55,621
you don't understand.

7397
03:24:55,621 --> 03:24:55,791
Look,

7398
03:24:55,791 --> 03:24:56,320
the rivets,

7399
03:24:56,320 --> 03:24:57,600
my friends who live up there,

7400
03:24:57,810 --> 03:24:58,710
they've got a whole set.

7401
03:24:58,711 --> 03:25:02,850
They have 30 or 40 different
spots where they put people,

7402
03:25:03,890 --> 03:25:04,261
they have a,

7403
03:25:04,261 --> 03:25:07,510
they have a like a serious
organization but also dude,

7404
03:25:07,620 --> 03:25:08,580
and they have to,

7405
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:11,010
they get two tags per hunter a year.

7406
03:25:11,190 --> 03:25:13,980
You're supposed to kill
to mature boars a years.

7407
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:14,933
Hey Dude.

7408
03:25:15,020 --> 03:25:16,950
Triangulations honor you.

7409
03:25:16,951 --> 03:25:21,360
Stand the fuck down till I get my
trophy and then and then you let me,

7410
03:25:21,620 --> 03:25:22,860
you let me secure shit.

7411
03:25:22,890 --> 03:25:24,210
You let me secure your hips.

7412
03:25:24,740 --> 03:25:25,111
He let me,

7413
03:25:25,111 --> 03:25:25,950
you say look Brophy.

7414
03:25:25,980 --> 03:25:30,120
That's a taboo word and that's supposed
to say that trophy trophy taper off son

7415
03:25:30,121 --> 03:25:32,160
of a real hunter.

7416
03:25:32,510 --> 03:25:33,600
I Will Brian that meat.

7417
03:25:33,630 --> 03:25:34,950
I'll eat it all year.

7418
03:25:35,070 --> 03:25:35,641
Let me ask you,

7419
03:25:35,641 --> 03:25:38,490
this is a legit standup comedian
and respect you and love you.

7420
03:25:38,550 --> 03:25:38,851
Thank you.

7421
03:25:38,851 --> 03:25:39,661
When someone says,

7422
03:25:39,661 --> 03:25:41,610
what's the difference between
a comic and a comedian?

7423
03:25:41,611 --> 03:25:44,700
Do you explain it or do you
say fuck you and walk away?

7424
03:25:44,701 --> 03:25:46,100
I say fuck you and walk away for you.

7425
03:25:46,290 --> 03:25:47,123
That's real.

7426
03:25:47,220 --> 03:25:48,053
Yeah,

7427
03:25:48,450 --> 03:25:49,560
that's what we're talking about here.

7428
03:25:49,890 --> 03:25:50,670
It's true.

7429
03:25:50,670 --> 03:25:51,420
Listen to me.

7430
03:25:51,420 --> 03:25:52,253
Please stand down.

7431
03:25:52,500 --> 03:25:53,310
Stand down.

7432
03:25:53,310 --> 03:25:54,900
You follow my fucking lead.

7433
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:56,640
You stay a couple inches behind me.

7434
03:25:56,700 --> 03:25:57,300
Hey,

7435
03:25:57,300 --> 03:25:58,230
don't talk when I'm talking,

7436
03:25:58,560 --> 03:25:59,393
I'm an experienced,

7437
03:25:59,420 --> 03:26:00,253
I'm not a hunter.

7438
03:26:00,270 --> 03:26:01,350
And then when it's time,

7439
03:26:01,380 --> 03:26:03,880
when it's time for you to fucking
shoot and you're breathing hard,

7440
03:26:03,900 --> 03:26:06,690
you're a regular guy and I
help you with your breathing.

7441
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:08,020
You understand me?

7442
03:26:08,020 --> 03:26:09,570
Me With my man because your
breathing is like this.

7443
03:26:11,970 --> 03:26:12,331
And I go,

7444
03:26:12,331 --> 03:26:12,550
hey,

7445
03:26:12,550 --> 03:26:12,930
hey,

7446
03:26:12,930 --> 03:26:13,141
hey,

7447
03:26:13,141 --> 03:26:13,351
hey,

7448
03:26:13,351 --> 03:26:13,800
hey.

7449
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:15,180
And I smack your face a couple times ago.

7450
03:26:15,510 --> 03:26:16,260
Look at me.

7451
03:26:16,260 --> 03:26:17,790
I kiss your mouth as a man,

7452
03:26:17,850 --> 03:26:20,640
as a friend because your
mouth to wake you the fuck up.

7453
03:26:20,850 --> 03:26:21,630
There it is.

7454
03:26:21,630 --> 03:26:22,440
Look at me.

7455
03:26:22,440 --> 03:26:23,261
You're behind them.

7456
03:26:23,261 --> 03:26:25,770
Joe's behind your breathing
into your neck and you,

7457
03:26:25,810 --> 03:26:28,940
you key into that rhythm and I'm
breathing in near mouth and we breathe all

7458
03:26:28,950 --> 03:26:30,030
together as men.

7459
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:31,043
Let me,

7460
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:32,940
can I just step in from our buddy?

7461
03:26:32,941 --> 03:26:33,271
Go ahead.

7462
03:26:33,271 --> 03:26:36,660
Why do you want to belittle
him in this weird way?

7463
03:26:36,900 --> 03:26:40,140
We see you're not a hunter
where you know he's killed.

7464
03:26:40,141 --> 03:26:40,710
It leaves.

7465
03:26:40,710 --> 03:26:41,670
We just killed three deer.

7466
03:26:41,730 --> 03:26:42,031
Three days.

7467
03:26:42,031 --> 03:26:42,150
Yeah.

7468
03:26:42,150 --> 03:26:43,980
Three one in Montana to in Wisconsin.

7469
03:26:43,981 --> 03:26:44,430
Dear Bro,

7470
03:26:44,430 --> 03:26:45,760
he's killed three deer and eaten though.

7471
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:46,880
That's a hunter and John.

7472
03:26:47,250 --> 03:26:47,760
Yeah,

7473
03:26:47,760 --> 03:26:48,480
dude,

7474
03:26:48,480 --> 03:26:49,890
he's made great shots.

7475
03:26:50,200 --> 03:26:50,660
He's maker.

7476
03:26:50,660 --> 03:26:51,181
I'm telling you,

7477
03:26:51,181 --> 03:26:56,181
Brian Cowen made a hundred and hire 50
160 shot yard shot in your first deer.

7478
03:26:56,341 --> 03:26:57,030
I think so.

7479
03:26:57,030 --> 03:26:57,600
Something like that.

7480
03:26:57,600 --> 03:27:00,990
Me and he made 'em to 100 yard shot,

7481
03:27:01,510 --> 03:27:02,343
second and third.

7482
03:27:02,670 --> 03:27:02,920
No,

7483
03:27:02,920 --> 03:27:03,060
no,

7484
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:03,211
no,

7485
03:27:03,211 --> 03:27:03,331
no,

7486
03:27:03,331 --> 03:27:03,451
no.

7487
03:27:03,451 --> 03:27:04,284
You don't understand.

7488
03:27:04,290 --> 03:27:08,230
When you shooting at a living creature
and it's all about getting it right and,

7489
03:27:08,240 --> 03:27:10,020
and trigger disciplined,

7490
03:27:10,070 --> 03:27:10,920
it's a big deal.

7491
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:12,030
It's not easy.

7492
03:27:12,031 --> 03:27:12,864
And Brian,

7493
03:27:13,830 --> 03:27:16,170
every time he's attempted it
and he's eating those animals,

7494
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:17,083
he said,

7495
03:27:17,190 --> 03:27:17,311
hey,

7496
03:27:17,311 --> 03:27:18,144
look at me.

7497
03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:23,130
City boy city boy.

7498
03:27:24,600 --> 03:27:25,201
He doesn't like,

7499
03:27:25,201 --> 03:27:25,420
no,

7500
03:27:25,420 --> 03:27:26,253
I love hunting

7501
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:29,870
city boy.

7502
03:27:32,550 --> 03:27:33,383
Boy.

7503
03:27:39,900 --> 03:27:40,810
I love hunting.

7504
03:27:40,811 --> 03:27:41,790
Do Platinum sit

7505
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:44,800
with your arms up in the air.

7506
03:27:44,801 --> 03:27:46,300
Like Robbie Lawler after he,

7507
03:27:46,660 --> 03:27:47,770
after he won by knockout

7508
03:27:52,990 --> 03:27:53,710
animal.

7509
03:27:53,710 --> 03:27:55,870
But I like hanging out with tears.

7510
03:27:56,470 --> 03:27:57,303
I had to drop.

7511
03:27:58,680 --> 03:28:00,430
I don't like killing the actual animal,

7512
03:28:00,431 --> 03:28:01,800
but I like hanging with Joe and I,

7513
03:28:01,950 --> 03:28:02,783
no,

7514
03:28:03,070 --> 03:28:03,821
that's a fact.

7515
03:28:03,821 --> 03:28:04,720
This and there's this,

7516
03:28:04,721 --> 03:28:05,380
it's real.

7517
03:28:05,380 --> 03:28:05,841
But I have,

7518
03:28:05,841 --> 03:28:08,890
I do admit that I don't like
killing the animal is the part,

7519
03:28:08,891 --> 03:28:09,250
but I,

7520
03:28:09,250 --> 03:28:10,930
but I wanted the time to do what I do it.

7521
03:28:11,610 --> 03:28:13,750
But I love the experience we have.

7522
03:28:13,751 --> 03:28:15,040
We laugh harder.

7523
03:28:15,490 --> 03:28:17,510
I make that fucker laugh harder than him.

7524
03:28:17,590 --> 03:28:18,700
Anybody ever met that?

7525
03:28:18,701 --> 03:28:19,890
He gets that high ticket.

7526
03:28:20,080 --> 03:28:20,913
Please

7527
03:28:25,580 --> 03:28:26,141
let me take it.

7528
03:28:26,141 --> 03:28:27,310
Let me tell you what happened in Montana.

7529
03:28:27,311 --> 03:28:28,060
We did kill him.

7530
03:28:28,060 --> 03:28:28,780
We were in the,

7531
03:28:28,780 --> 03:28:29,350
in the,

7532
03:28:29,350 --> 03:28:30,040
in the bush.

7533
03:28:30,040 --> 03:28:31,030
That's how we talk about it.

7534
03:28:32,030 --> 03:28:34,800
We were on the same routes.

7535
03:28:35,090 --> 03:28:35,800
That's for sure.

7536
03:28:35,800 --> 03:28:36,401
It's bonding,

7537
03:28:36,401 --> 03:28:37,234
Bro.

7538
03:28:37,860 --> 03:28:40,150
When Lewis and Clark
traveled across the West,

7539
03:28:40,360 --> 03:28:41,111
that's where we went.

7540
03:28:41,111 --> 03:28:42,210
We were on the Missouri River.

7541
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:44,980
We were in the Missouri breaks in Montana.

7542
03:28:44,981 --> 03:28:46,120
It was fucking fantastic.

7543
03:28:46,121 --> 03:28:46,954
Miserable.

7544
03:28:47,110 --> 03:28:47,801
Five days,

7545
03:28:47,801 --> 03:28:48,670
a Dick Jokes.

7546
03:28:49,410 --> 03:28:49,610
Oh,

7547
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:52,120
I never said it was
all cock and gay stuff.

7548
03:28:52,270 --> 03:28:54,220
And Brian doing this bit to today,

7549
03:28:54,400 --> 03:28:57,730
to this day is one of the
hardest things I've ever like,

7550
03:28:57,820 --> 03:28:59,770
like hyperventilating,

7551
03:28:59,980 --> 03:29:01,300
tears running down my face.

7552
03:29:01,301 --> 03:29:06,130
It's maybe six degrees outside the room
called the ravine comer jerking off into

7553
03:29:06,131 --> 03:29:06,820
a roofing.

7554
03:29:06,820 --> 03:29:09,250
I killed his deer and we
were gutting this deer.

7555
03:29:09,251 --> 03:29:10,001
And Brian's eating.

7556
03:29:10,001 --> 03:29:11,210
It's eyeballs like it was like,

7557
03:29:11,230 --> 03:29:11,531
really?

7558
03:29:11,531 --> 03:29:11,771
Yeah.

7559
03:29:11,771 --> 03:29:13,970
He eats a tello behind the eyeballs.

7560
03:29:14,410 --> 03:29:14,710
I'm,

7561
03:29:14,710 --> 03:29:15,790
I'm fucking crazy.

7562
03:29:15,791 --> 03:29:16,360
I hate to write.

7563
03:29:16,360 --> 03:29:17,470
I cut a piece off and ate it.

7564
03:29:17,471 --> 03:29:19,210
Raw flesh around bro.

7565
03:29:20,820 --> 03:29:21,480
Hunter,

7566
03:29:21,480 --> 03:29:22,031
what were you saying?

7567
03:29:22,031 --> 03:29:23,700
Go flash behind the eyeballs.

7568
03:29:23,710 --> 03:29:25,330
Tastes like bread dough.

7569
03:29:25,690 --> 03:29:26,280
Dough.

7570
03:29:26,280 --> 03:29:27,630
Fernald gave it to me and I ate it.

7571
03:29:29,440 --> 03:29:30,510
Throw it off the face.

7572
03:29:30,760 --> 03:29:31,910
Go throw up in the fucking,

7573
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:34,300
you're a few can't even
handle this conversation.

7574
03:29:34,750 --> 03:29:35,610
Alan going,

7575
03:29:35,611 --> 03:29:36,444
Alan does this.

7576
03:29:36,720 --> 03:29:39,760
He's just doing this character
called the ravine comer.

7577
03:29:42,500 --> 03:29:44,770
We have this deer tied to this tree.

7578
03:29:44,771 --> 03:29:45,610
We pull this deer down.

7579
03:29:45,611 --> 03:29:46,690
We're fuck you freezing.

7580
03:29:46,870 --> 03:29:47,990
We're fucking freezing.

7581
03:29:48,180 --> 03:29:48,731
I remember like,

7582
03:29:48,731 --> 03:29:49,271
Oh my God,

7583
03:29:49,271 --> 03:29:49,530
where am I,

7584
03:29:49,530 --> 03:29:50,363
Montana?

7585
03:29:50,470 --> 03:29:51,970
The fucking ground is frozen.

7586
03:29:51,971 --> 03:29:53,140
It's eight degrees outside.

7587
03:29:53,290 --> 03:29:55,360
We're cutting this deer and
we decided to have a fire.

7588
03:29:55,630 --> 03:29:55,731
It's,

7589
03:29:55,731 --> 03:29:58,630
we had this little tiny little
campfire and Brian County goes,

7590
03:29:58,631 --> 03:30:02,430
why don't you the a bottom tier
like to come and he gets shit.

7591
03:30:02,860 --> 03:30:04,420
He gets near the bridge,

7592
03:30:04,940 --> 03:30:07,150
not a bridge like Lyft

7593
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:09,873
and he starts,

7594
03:30:10,630 --> 03:30:15,010
he starts jacking off in front of this
ravine and saying he's the ravine.

7595
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:17,140
Calmer because you asked
me what I was doing

7596
03:30:18,780 --> 03:30:19,960
were crying.

7597
03:30:20,110 --> 03:30:25,110
It's me and Rinella and mode
tears rolling down her eyes.

7598
03:30:29,110 --> 03:30:31,150
That deer skin,

7599
03:30:31,151 --> 03:30:31,601
that deer,

7600
03:30:31,601 --> 03:30:32,890
I'm taking coq to hand.

7601
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:35,860
I'm coming and just repeat screaming.

7602
03:30:35,861 --> 03:30:36,694
I'm coming,

7603
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:37,833
I'm coming.

7604
03:30:37,910 --> 03:30:38,743
It's out.

7605
03:30:39,020 --> 03:30:39,890
When you say you're coming,

7606
03:30:39,891 --> 03:30:40,551
like you're pulling,

7607
03:30:40,551 --> 03:30:41,384
it's hilarious.

7608
03:30:42,550 --> 03:30:46,640
Can you see something about people on
boats and the distance hearing your cries

7609
03:30:48,250 --> 03:30:52,670
so fucked up about it because we were
like a couple of months we're going to

7610
03:30:52,671 --> 03:30:53,690
pack out with the meat.

7611
03:30:53,691 --> 03:30:53,931
He's like,

7612
03:30:53,931 --> 03:30:55,140
we're miles away from the river.

7613
03:30:55,141 --> 03:30:55,451
He's like,

7614
03:30:55,451 --> 03:30:55,730
Hey,

7615
03:30:55,730 --> 03:30:57,980
my cries of pleasure.

7616
03:30:58,190 --> 03:31:00,480
And he just keeps jacking
off in the bushes,

7617
03:31:00,500 --> 03:31:02,030
thumb off as like Tom off.

7618
03:31:02,031 --> 03:31:02,900
I call it thumbing,

7619
03:31:03,180 --> 03:31:04,820
but it was five days of that.

7620
03:31:04,821 --> 03:31:08,300
I know it was five days of the
best audience when I got you alone,

7621
03:31:08,330 --> 03:31:13,220
you are the best audience cause you
fucking laugh hard and I just wait for my

7622
03:31:13,221 --> 03:31:14,450
openings and I take them.

7623
03:31:14,900 --> 03:31:15,770
I just take them.

7624
03:31:15,830 --> 03:31:17,660
What about when I led some days I fucking,

7625
03:31:17,661 --> 03:31:19,370
the other day I W I was blue.

7626
03:31:19,590 --> 03:31:22,880
Joe Kept laughing and I was fucking
funny out of ammunition and I didn't know

7627
03:31:22,881 --> 03:31:24,500
what to do and I just fucking,

7628
03:31:24,501 --> 03:31:25,670
I was spazzing out and I go,

7629
03:31:25,910 --> 03:31:26,510
ah,

7630
03:31:26,510 --> 03:31:27,820
I kicked the table over it.

7631
03:31:28,100 --> 03:31:29,820
I need some fucking attention.

7632
03:31:36,200 --> 03:31:38,840
I didn't know what else to do and I
was funny to see Doug Durham was there.

7633
03:31:38,841 --> 03:31:39,231
I was like,

7634
03:31:39,231 --> 03:31:40,190
I don't always get making them all laugh.

7635
03:31:40,191 --> 03:31:40,461
And I go,

7636
03:31:40,461 --> 03:31:40,791
I'll have,

7637
03:31:40,791 --> 03:31:42,350
fuck man,

7638
03:31:42,351 --> 03:31:43,111
I kicked bleed.

7639
03:31:43,111 --> 03:31:43,241
Hey,

7640
03:31:43,241 --> 03:31:44,930
well I need some fucking intention.

7641
03:31:44,931 --> 03:31:47,750
Barely had the energy to sleep
when we were in Wisconsin.

7642
03:31:47,910 --> 03:31:48,920
It was just always,

7643
03:31:48,921 --> 03:31:49,590
shit.

7644
03:31:49,590 --> 03:31:50,060
Fuck,

7645
03:31:50,060 --> 03:31:53,090
this shit is shit on the ground.

7646
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:55,460
You will laugh your ass
off when you go to bill.

7647
03:31:55,760 --> 03:31:56,800
Here's the problem with hunting.

7648
03:31:56,820 --> 03:31:57,111
Here's why.

7649
03:31:57,111 --> 03:31:57,944
Hunting sucks.

7650
03:31:58,160 --> 03:31:58,993
You're cold,

7651
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:00,110
you sleep on the floor,

7652
03:32:00,111 --> 03:32:00,891
it rains,

7653
03:32:00,891 --> 03:32:01,760
you don't see animals.

7654
03:32:01,761 --> 03:32:03,770
There's all kinds of things
that sucks about hunting.

7655
03:32:04,100 --> 03:32:04,933
But guess what?

7656
03:32:05,090 --> 03:32:06,710
That's what brings you together.

7657
03:32:06,711 --> 03:32:08,120
You're all together in a tent.

7658
03:32:08,600 --> 03:32:10,940
Gale force winds and you're
laughing your fucking balls off.

7659
03:32:10,941 --> 03:32:14,120
I listened to that podcast we did with
Rinella after you had talked about it.

7660
03:32:14,150 --> 03:32:14,983
It was great.

7661
03:32:15,320 --> 03:32:16,153
It was awesome.

7662
03:32:16,190 --> 03:32:18,380
And we did that podcast soaking wet,

7663
03:32:18,410 --> 03:32:20,660
miserable for five days in a row.

7664
03:32:20,690 --> 03:32:22,310
You were so cold and do in Alaska,

7665
03:32:22,340 --> 03:32:22,971
you don't remember this,

7666
03:32:22,971 --> 03:32:23,510
but you were,

7667
03:32:23,510 --> 03:32:26,510
I remember there was the morning and
you couldn't get dry cause all your shit

7668
03:32:26,511 --> 03:32:30,290
was to go ahead if you didn't bring
waterproof anything and so you're wet.

7669
03:32:30,380 --> 03:32:31,041
It's in the morning,

7670
03:32:31,041 --> 03:32:31,874
six in the morning.

7671
03:32:31,910 --> 03:32:33,380
You were shaking so bad.

7672
03:32:33,381 --> 03:32:34,214
I don't know if you remember,

7673
03:32:34,250 --> 03:32:37,820
you were shaking so badly and I was
too cold and miserable to say anything.

7674
03:32:38,030 --> 03:32:39,020
Your Lips,

7675
03:32:39,120 --> 03:32:40,760
you're a fucking lips.

7676
03:32:40,890 --> 03:32:42,860
We're going back and forth.

7677
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:46,940
They look like they look like a short
when it's grabbed the fucking like his

7678
03:32:46,941 --> 03:32:47,630
latest work,

7679
03:32:47,630 --> 03:32:48,321
his lips,

7680
03:32:48,321 --> 03:32:53,321
his big fat fucking fat dsls
we're going like this back in June

7681
03:32:56,270 --> 03:32:57,103
they were,

7682
03:32:58,010 --> 03:33:00,710
they were literally going from
left to right east to west,

7683
03:33:00,980 --> 03:33:01,801
east to west,

7684
03:33:01,801 --> 03:33:06,801
just the way the way a pitbull shakes
a fucking rabbit and I was like,

7685
03:33:07,311 --> 03:33:07,521
dude,

7686
03:33:07,521 --> 03:33:09,340
those lips are fucking big,

7687
03:33:09,890 --> 03:33:11,240
meaty and cold.

7688
03:33:11,780 --> 03:33:12,680
That's all I kept saying.

7689
03:33:12,681 --> 03:33:16,610
I remember the one night where it
didn't rain for like a few hours.

7690
03:33:16,650 --> 03:33:17,570
We started a fire.

7691
03:33:18,220 --> 03:33:19,730
She does with Cheetos.

7692
03:33:20,390 --> 03:33:20,901
And by the way,

7693
03:33:20,901 --> 03:33:22,220
a fire is the best thing.

7694
03:33:22,230 --> 03:33:22,670
Well,

7695
03:33:22,670 --> 03:33:23,800
when you're so miserable,

7696
03:33:24,630 --> 03:33:25,280
jerk off,

7697
03:33:25,280 --> 03:33:25,831
we don't just go,

7698
03:33:25,831 --> 03:33:26,880
Oh hell no.

7699
03:33:26,881 --> 03:33:27,714
You don't.

7700
03:33:29,690 --> 03:33:30,920
You take shits,

7701
03:33:30,980 --> 03:33:31,401
you take,

7702
03:33:31,401 --> 03:33:32,390
you get up in the middle of the night,

7703
03:33:32,780 --> 03:33:33,411
you got to Piss,

7704
03:33:33,411 --> 03:33:38,240
you go Neil and just go just an inch
out of my fucking 10 I'm terrified.

7705
03:33:38,240 --> 03:33:38,370
I'm,

7706
03:33:38,370 --> 03:33:39,780
are you there?

7707
03:33:40,740 --> 03:33:41,460
Yes,

7708
03:33:41,460 --> 03:33:43,230
Dan Dodi and Mike.

7709
03:33:43,231 --> 03:33:43,831
I remember Mike,

7710
03:33:43,831 --> 03:33:45,970
we figured out how to
make a fire with Cheetos.

7711
03:33:46,110 --> 03:33:49,560
Was it Dan Dodi's idea stand
noting when you light Cheetos.

7712
03:33:49,590 --> 03:33:50,071
Cheetos,

7713
03:33:50,071 --> 03:33:52,680
light on fire and all the
bullshit that's in Cheetos.

7714
03:33:52,740 --> 03:33:53,573
Best kindling

7715
03:33:55,010 --> 03:33:55,690
dude.

7716
03:33:55,690 --> 03:33:56,523
Slow,

7717
03:33:57,330 --> 03:33:58,163
slow burn.

7718
03:33:58,170 --> 03:33:59,460
Cheetos are incredible.

7719
03:33:59,790 --> 03:34:01,560
They stay a light forever.

7720
03:34:03,500 --> 03:34:08,500
It's a slow to fuck off once
or the crunchy ones one.

7721
03:34:09,450 --> 03:34:10,081
That's the one thing.

7722
03:34:10,081 --> 03:34:12,570
All the Zombie movies
and TV shows didn't get,

7723
03:34:12,790 --> 03:34:15,180
you know from this point on
they're going to use the Cheetos.

7724
03:34:15,550 --> 03:34:16,730
It's a slow burn.

7725
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:17,461
Beautiful.

7726
03:34:17,461 --> 03:34:21,930
Bernie took something like trees and we
chopped trees down and hacked off the

7727
03:34:21,931 --> 03:34:24,820
bottom of the trees cause
that was the driest spot.

7728
03:34:25,020 --> 03:34:25,321
We,

7729
03:34:25,321 --> 03:34:29,460
we hacked off the insides of the limbs
because the outside of the lambs are more

7730
03:34:29,461 --> 03:34:30,090
wet.

7731
03:34:30,090 --> 03:34:34,770
Do we were Desperado we took paper and
we started paper to develop a wet fire

7732
03:34:34,771 --> 03:34:37,350
and we'll wet five means like
it's touch and go the whole way.

7733
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:37,770
You're,

7734
03:34:37,770 --> 03:34:41,280
you're burning wet stuff and you're
trying to get the driest stuff that's

7735
03:34:41,281 --> 03:34:41,851
available.

7736
03:34:41,851 --> 03:34:43,830
And Cheetos saved our ass.

7737
03:34:43,860 --> 03:34:44,321
And tell me,

7738
03:34:44,321 --> 03:34:45,154
if you tell me,

7739
03:34:45,180 --> 03:34:46,013
hey

7740
03:34:47,230 --> 03:34:49,230
you to feel this,

7741
03:34:49,231 --> 03:34:50,041
tell me if you didn't feel this.

7742
03:34:50,041 --> 03:34:51,350
And I'm not being dramatic when I say it.

7743
03:34:51,351 --> 03:34:52,830
It's like that's not possible.

7744
03:34:52,860 --> 03:34:53,693
Well that's true.

7745
03:34:53,820 --> 03:34:54,653
That's very true.

7746
03:34:54,750 --> 03:34:57,360
But when you're in the middle
of that majestic wilderness,

7747
03:34:57,390 --> 03:34:58,830
literally that doesn't care about you.

7748
03:34:59,160 --> 03:35:00,480
You do get a sense.

7749
03:35:00,510 --> 03:35:01,320
There is a very,

7750
03:35:01,320 --> 03:35:02,850
there is a feeling of sadness,

7751
03:35:02,880 --> 03:35:07,110
of feeling of I'm being so insignificant
that it makes you a little bit

7752
03:35:07,111 --> 03:35:08,100
depressed sometimes.

7753
03:35:08,160 --> 03:35:08,610
Yeah.

7754
03:35:08,610 --> 03:35:09,450
Did you feel that?

7755
03:35:09,451 --> 03:35:10,200
Did you ever feel that?

7756
03:35:10,200 --> 03:35:14,280
When we were sitting up at the top of
this one of these ridges and you and I and

7757
03:35:14,281 --> 03:35:18,240
m Yonis were up there and we were taking
a break and we sat up there and we

7758
03:35:18,241 --> 03:35:20,160
glassed this canyon and it was,

7759
03:35:20,161 --> 03:35:23,960
the rain was coming in and going out
and we're looking around and I'm,

7760
03:35:24,010 --> 03:35:26,490
and my team was there too
and we were just like,

7761
03:35:26,491 --> 03:35:27,121
Jesus Christ,

7762
03:35:27,121 --> 03:35:29,340
like this land doesn't give
a fuck of your here are gone.

7763
03:35:29,370 --> 03:35:29,730
Yes.

7764
03:35:29,730 --> 03:35:31,450
It's going to be the same like a,

7765
03:35:32,220 --> 03:35:36,660
it's like a realization that no matter
what mark you think you're laying,

7766
03:35:36,830 --> 03:35:39,630
it doesn't matter if you're
fucking King Tut it does it.

7767
03:35:39,631 --> 03:35:40,170
It doesn't matter.

7768
03:35:40,170 --> 03:35:41,730
Matter you are ultimately,

7769
03:35:41,731 --> 03:35:42,570
it's all bullshit.

7770
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:42,841
Yes.

7771
03:35:42,841 --> 03:35:43,740
Like you get this,

7772
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:49,100
this entirely temporary existence and
it the world and the universe is bigger.

7773
03:35:50,190 --> 03:35:50,540
Yes.

7774
03:35:50,540 --> 03:35:53,460
You still a grain of sand and that's hard
to deal with because you want to pass

7775
03:35:53,461 --> 03:35:56,640
your genes and you want to be special
and you want to show greatness and you

7776
03:35:56,641 --> 03:35:58,710
want people to remember
your name after you're gone.

7777
03:35:58,950 --> 03:36:00,810
But ultimately that's not
really what's important.

7778
03:36:01,080 --> 03:36:03,270
And that when you're
confronted with that reality,

7779
03:36:03,271 --> 03:36:05,310
whether it's through
psychedelic drugs over there,

7780
03:36:05,311 --> 03:36:10,311
it's through sitting on a mountain in
Prince of Wales and best buddies sitting

7781
03:36:11,851 --> 03:36:12,301
there going,

7782
03:36:12,301 --> 03:36:12,511
man,

7783
03:36:12,511 --> 03:36:14,220
we can't even fucking find a deer.

7784
03:36:14,460 --> 03:36:17,790
We didn't find a deer for
days and days so lonely.

7785
03:36:17,791 --> 03:36:20,160
It's such a lonely part of the world.

7786
03:36:20,600 --> 03:36:23,760
You can see for miles and miles
it what you think about it.

7787
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:24,271
For me,

7788
03:36:24,271 --> 03:36:26,520
what I thought about it was
exactly what he's talking about,

7789
03:36:26,521 --> 03:36:28,680
like the notion that I'm so,

7790
03:36:28,810 --> 03:36:29,643
um,

7791
03:36:29,700 --> 03:36:33,030
I'm so insignificant and so
much of my effort all day,

7792
03:36:33,031 --> 03:36:34,350
so much mind in a way.

7793
03:36:34,351 --> 03:36:35,410
So much of my effort.

7794
03:36:35,660 --> 03:36:36,130
First of all,

7795
03:36:36,130 --> 03:36:40,030
you also realize how vulnerable you are
without food and water without like,

7796
03:36:40,060 --> 03:36:40,380
uh,

7797
03:36:40,380 --> 03:36:45,380
no how without the culture
and the accumulated knowhow
of how to survive in that

7798
03:36:46,130 --> 03:36:47,710
we should talk about what we bring.

7799
03:36:47,711 --> 03:36:51,280
We bring a freeze dried
foods and we bring some,

7800
03:36:51,281 --> 03:36:53,860
some like hard snack bars.

7801
03:36:53,920 --> 03:36:54,101
No,

7802
03:36:54,101 --> 03:36:54,191
no,

7803
03:36:54,191 --> 03:36:55,024
we're fine.

7804
03:36:55,380 --> 03:36:56,690
We're not doing any survivor man,

7805
03:36:57,880 --> 03:37:01,720
firemen shit five to six days.

7806
03:37:02,200 --> 03:37:02,951
It's true.

7807
03:37:02,951 --> 03:37:06,190
We have a limited supply and it lets
you know that like without this stuff,

7808
03:37:06,191 --> 03:37:08,710
cause we're not trying to live
off this mountain ops food,

7809
03:37:08,740 --> 03:37:09,040
no,

7810
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:10,120
whatever the fuck it's called,

7811
03:37:10,121 --> 03:37:11,080
whatever the meals or call.

7812
03:37:11,081 --> 03:37:11,920
I don't think it's mountain ops.

7813
03:37:12,150 --> 03:37:13,870
Not An ops is like a good protein,

7814
03:37:13,930 --> 03:37:15,810
a US company for hunters.

7815
03:37:16,100 --> 03:37:17,010
But um,

7816
03:37:17,080 --> 03:37:17,980
what will you realize?

7817
03:37:17,981 --> 03:37:20,410
It's like if I didn't have the
stuff that I brought with me,

7818
03:37:20,620 --> 03:37:22,360
I'm not going to survive
just living off the land.

7819
03:37:22,870 --> 03:37:24,100
It's hard as hell.

7820
03:37:24,280 --> 03:37:25,180
It's hard as hell.

7821
03:37:25,210 --> 03:37:26,980
So you're saying you weren't worried
about your Twitter followers?

7822
03:37:26,981 --> 03:37:27,450
Instagram,

7823
03:37:27,450 --> 03:37:29,920
you realize how much bullshit you need,

7824
03:37:29,921 --> 03:37:31,900
less sleep and just that it's not,

7825
03:37:31,901 --> 03:37:33,490
this cell phone doesn't work.

7826
03:37:33,500 --> 03:37:34,333
Isn't there a satellite?

7827
03:37:34,430 --> 03:37:34,771
No,

7828
03:37:34,771 --> 03:37:35,350
no.

7829
03:37:35,350 --> 03:37:36,790
Cell phones or direct to wreck.

7830
03:37:36,970 --> 03:37:37,570
It's like,

7831
03:37:37,570 --> 03:37:40,870
that's why you have this fake trees
and the four or five cell phones.

7832
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:42,630
No,

7833
03:37:42,630 --> 03:37:42,881
no,

7834
03:37:42,881 --> 03:37:43,061
no.

7835
03:37:43,061 --> 03:37:43,511
Not at all.

7836
03:37:43,511 --> 03:37:43,940
Not at all.

7837
03:37:43,940 --> 03:37:45,970
So set gps,

7838
03:37:46,210 --> 03:37:47,830
which is global positioning satellites,

7839
03:37:48,040 --> 03:37:49,420
GPS satellites.

7840
03:37:49,421 --> 03:37:49,810
I here,

7841
03:37:49,810 --> 03:37:54,810
I'll Glen ground and GPS
global positioning satellites.

7842
03:37:55,811 --> 03:37:56,770
That's what it literally is.

7843
03:37:56,790 --> 03:37:57,160
Yes,

7844
03:37:57,160 --> 03:38:02,160
absolutely correct is not like the GPS
in your iPhone is run by satellites.

7845
03:38:03,310 --> 03:38:04,170
This is how it works.

7846
03:38:05,250 --> 03:38:05,911
Let me explain.

7847
03:38:05,911 --> 03:38:06,850
Let me explain to you Eddie,

7848
03:38:06,851 --> 03:38:07,684
how it works.

7849
03:38:07,870 --> 03:38:08,703
Launch.

7850
03:38:09,080 --> 03:38:10,150
No,

7851
03:38:10,151 --> 03:38:10,451
no,

7852
03:38:10,451 --> 03:38:10,631
no,

7853
03:38:10,631 --> 03:38:11,050
no.

7854
03:38:11,050 --> 03:38:14,500
It's all land based
based on youtube science.

7855
03:38:16,100 --> 03:38:17,020
Let's avoid this.

7856
03:38:17,270 --> 03:38:19,330
We were just talking
about just being alone,

7857
03:38:19,360 --> 03:38:20,860
being up there without any,

7858
03:38:21,250 --> 03:38:25,090
any connection to what you are
used to realize how small you are.

7859
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:25,540
I,

7860
03:38:25,540 --> 03:38:29,440
it's good to get away from the cell
phone and the bullshit and I think,

7861
03:38:29,710 --> 03:38:31,060
I think cell phones are awesome.

7862
03:38:31,420 --> 03:38:32,770
I think computers are awesome.

7863
03:38:32,980 --> 03:38:34,060
I think Google is awesome.

7864
03:38:34,320 --> 03:38:34,860
I think it's,

7865
03:38:34,860 --> 03:38:36,160
I think reality shows are awesome.

7866
03:38:36,161 --> 03:38:37,780
I think basketball wives is awesome.

7867
03:38:37,810 --> 03:38:38,860
I think it's hilarious.

7868
03:38:39,190 --> 03:38:42,720
I think we should enjoy the most fucked
up aspects of the greatest time people

7869
03:38:42,730 --> 03:38:43,510
who've ever been alive.

7870
03:38:43,510 --> 03:38:44,410
I think it's amazing,

7871
03:38:44,800 --> 03:38:49,800
but I think it's also good to push all
this external dialogue aside and just how

7872
03:38:52,451 --> 03:38:55,960
do you feel about the world and how
much of how you feel about the world is

7873
03:38:55,961 --> 03:38:57,970
honest and how much have you feel,

7874
03:38:58,360 --> 03:39:01,960
how you feel about the world is objective
and how much of it is based on the

7875
03:39:01,961 --> 03:39:05,740
actual world itself and not the opinions
of all these other people around you

7876
03:39:06,040 --> 03:39:08,810
and get a good look at who you
are and what you think about that.

7877
03:39:09,020 --> 03:39:09,460
Do that.

7878
03:39:09,460 --> 03:39:13,270
Every night I try to shut myself up like
around when I get home from Jujitsu and

7879
03:39:13,271 --> 03:39:14,104
teaching.

7880
03:39:14,590 --> 03:39:16,630
If there's some important
email I got to get to,

7881
03:39:16,631 --> 03:39:17,141
I'll get to it.

7882
03:39:17,141 --> 03:39:19,300
If there's an important text
or call I got to get to,

7883
03:39:19,301 --> 03:39:24,301
but generally I'm going to watch them
bullshit ass TV for about an hour and a

7884
03:39:25,090 --> 03:39:25,340
half.

7885
03:39:25,340 --> 03:39:26,173
I don't want to hear,

7886
03:39:26,550 --> 03:39:27,383
but see when you're in,

7887
03:39:27,520 --> 03:39:28,353
when you're hunting,

7888
03:39:29,860 --> 03:39:32,170
when you're hunting on youtube
and watch like the hottest,

7889
03:39:32,830 --> 03:39:33,800
when hunting those,

7890
03:39:33,801 --> 03:39:35,630
those usual escapes don't exist.

7891
03:39:35,900 --> 03:39:37,190
And a lot of times for real,

7892
03:39:37,191 --> 03:39:41,180
what you have is just yourself and the
sound of your breathing men and dark.

7893
03:39:41,181 --> 03:39:42,014
Very hard.

7894
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:42,873
It's sound.

7895
03:39:42,930 --> 03:39:44,210
It's a bit like feeling.

7896
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:47,360
It's a bit like being in a free
fall if you're not used to it.

7897
03:39:47,690 --> 03:39:48,860
And in the beginning,

7898
03:39:48,861 --> 03:39:52,670
like the first two days you might panic
a little bit or you might kind of need

7899
03:39:52,671 --> 03:39:53,540
to hold on hold on thing.

7900
03:39:53,540 --> 03:39:54,590
But let me just back up.

7901
03:39:54,591 --> 03:39:55,424
She's sleeping.

7902
03:39:55,430 --> 03:39:56,410
Hope your sleep bed.

7903
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:56,751
Yes,

7904
03:39:56,751 --> 03:39:57,260
absolutely.

7905
03:39:57,260 --> 03:39:58,070
Eddie,

7906
03:39:58,070 --> 03:39:59,990
you're the first American
at top of Gracie.

7907
03:40:01,350 --> 03:40:02,070
He's no,

7908
03:40:02,070 --> 03:40:03,170
there's no pussy in you.

7909
03:40:03,171 --> 03:40:04,010
You don't have any pussy.

7910
03:40:04,340 --> 03:40:05,173
You are.

7911
03:40:05,710 --> 03:40:06,543
No,

7912
03:40:07,550 --> 03:40:07,851
no,

7913
03:40:07,851 --> 03:40:08,001
no,

7914
03:40:08,001 --> 03:40:08,211
no.

7915
03:40:08,211 --> 03:40:09,470
Well you are as an slider.

7916
03:40:09,570 --> 03:40:09,910
No.

7917
03:40:09,910 --> 03:40:11,930
You honest about the way you feel.

7918
03:40:12,230 --> 03:40:14,130
There's a lot of people
pretend to try to do that.

7919
03:40:14,270 --> 03:40:17,720
A lot of people pretend that they feel
different than the way they actually

7920
03:40:17,721 --> 03:40:18,290
feel.

7921
03:40:18,290 --> 03:40:19,130
But when you,

7922
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:19,470
when,

7923
03:40:19,470 --> 03:40:21,410
when push comes to shove and you perform,

7924
03:40:21,650 --> 03:40:23,840
it's one of the things like
when we went to Sao Paulo,

7925
03:40:23,960 --> 03:40:26,600
like I'd seen you compete in the trials.

7926
03:40:26,630 --> 03:40:28,400
You competed in San Diego and the trials.

7927
03:40:28,670 --> 03:40:30,410
And those are the only
times I saw you compete.

7928
03:40:30,590 --> 03:40:32,960
I started competing trials and
I saw you compete on video.

7929
03:40:32,961 --> 03:40:34,280
We've looked at some video before,

7930
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:35,330
but when I saw you compete,

7931
03:40:35,410 --> 03:40:37,160
when we flew down to San Paulo,

7932
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:38,113
Sao Paulo,

7933
03:40:38,210 --> 03:40:39,170
and uh,

7934
03:40:39,200 --> 03:40:42,200
I saw you tap Gustavo's Dante says,

7935
03:40:42,350 --> 03:40:43,940
who's a Brazilian Jujitsu world champion?

7936
03:40:43,940 --> 03:40:44,180
I was like,

7937
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:45,080
Oh shit.

7938
03:40:45,110 --> 03:40:48,440
Like Eddie Bravo knows how
to perform an depression.

7939
03:40:48,570 --> 03:40:50,480
If there's a moment in the fight for me,

7940
03:40:50,490 --> 03:40:51,350
tell you something good about this.

7941
03:40:51,351 --> 03:40:52,161
It's 2003.

7942
03:40:52,161 --> 03:40:52,480
Okay.

7943
03:40:52,480 --> 03:40:53,330
Tapped a world champ.

7944
03:40:53,360 --> 03:40:54,200
Let me tell you something happens.

7945
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:59,120
Eddie Bravo has got this
dude in a position where a
lot of traditional Brazilian

7946
03:40:59,121 --> 03:41:03,200
Jujitsu referees practitioners might
not have understood what was going on.

7947
03:41:03,380 --> 03:41:06,760
And he was moving towards
this guy's back and uh,

7948
03:41:06,890 --> 03:41:10,100
Eddie's holding onto him and the
referee is insinuating that there's some

7949
03:41:10,101 --> 03:41:12,530
stalling and then it's going
to have to be some moving.

7950
03:41:12,710 --> 03:41:13,660
And Eddie turns to him,

7951
03:41:13,661 --> 03:41:14,720
it looks to me was a star and he was,

7952
03:41:14,721 --> 03:41:15,530
I'm not stoned,

7953
03:41:15,530 --> 03:41:18,970
I'm about to take this dude's
back and Gustava Dante,

7954
03:41:18,980 --> 03:41:20,060
she says like what?

7955
03:41:20,350 --> 03:41:20,570
Like,

7956
03:41:20,570 --> 03:41:23,780
and then all of a sudden Eddie takes
his back and chokes him out and taps him

7957
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:28,120
and Wa and gets up on a white truck truck.

7958
03:41:28,240 --> 03:41:28,430
Well,

7959
03:41:28,430 --> 03:41:29,240
when you will truck,

7960
03:41:29,240 --> 03:41:30,200
but when you were in the truck,

7961
03:41:30,201 --> 03:41:33,700
that's when the referee stepped in
and said that you were stalling you.

7962
03:41:33,780 --> 03:41:34,640
I'm not dawn,

7963
03:41:34,760 --> 03:41:35,960
I'm about to take us back.

7964
03:41:36,050 --> 03:41:36,230
No,

7965
03:41:36,230 --> 03:41:36,440
no.

7966
03:41:36,440 --> 03:41:36,950
I was at,

7967
03:41:36,950 --> 03:41:37,731
when he came in,

7968
03:41:37,731 --> 03:41:39,800
what happened was I swept him.

7969
03:41:39,950 --> 03:41:40,940
We both pulled guard.

7970
03:41:40,941 --> 03:41:41,540
I forced,

7971
03:41:41,540 --> 03:41:42,800
I forced pull guard.

7972
03:41:42,801 --> 03:41:43,341
He pulled guard,

7973
03:41:43,341 --> 03:41:43,800
I poke guard.

7974
03:41:43,800 --> 03:41:43,971
What?

7975
03:41:43,971 --> 03:41:45,030
I tried to force each other.

7976
03:41:45,320 --> 03:41:47,090
I forced him on top of me,

7977
03:41:47,300 --> 03:41:49,670
swept him and he stayed in a position.

7978
03:41:49,671 --> 03:41:54,650
I had them in side control and he stayed
in a position basically fetal away from

7979
03:41:54,651 --> 03:41:55,400
me.

7980
03:41:55,400 --> 03:41:56,930
So as soon as he got up his knees,

7981
03:41:56,931 --> 03:41:58,700
I was going to the truck
or if he came into me,

7982
03:41:58,701 --> 03:41:59,331
I was going to the truck,

7983
03:41:59,331 --> 03:42:01,700
but he stayed there for minutes.

7984
03:42:01,790 --> 03:42:03,620
Adam inside Katoi to
stay there and I'm like,

7985
03:42:03,621 --> 03:42:04,760
are you going to go this way?

7986
03:42:04,760 --> 03:42:05,481
Whatever way you go,

7987
03:42:05,481 --> 03:42:06,560
I'm going to put you on the truck.

7988
03:42:06,680 --> 03:42:07,513
But he didn't do shit.

7989
03:42:07,520 --> 03:42:08,031
He stayed there.

7990
03:42:08,031 --> 03:42:08,751
He knew the system.

7991
03:42:08,751 --> 03:42:10,760
Mark Layman was in his corner
and saying don't do nothing.

7992
03:42:11,150 --> 03:42:12,110
So I was like just sitting.

7993
03:42:12,130 --> 03:42:12,411
I'm like,

7994
03:42:12,411 --> 03:42:13,244
okay.

7995
03:42:13,430 --> 03:42:15,230
I remember saying to the referee though,

7996
03:42:15,231 --> 03:42:16,310
I'm about to take his back.

7997
03:42:16,730 --> 03:42:18,570
The reason I take in a
long road here at it,

7998
03:42:18,571 --> 03:42:19,700
the reason I said that,

7999
03:42:20,060 --> 03:42:20,331
no,

8000
03:42:20,331 --> 03:42:21,430
the reason I said cut,

8001
03:42:21,530 --> 03:42:22,363
we kind of,

8002
03:42:22,490 --> 03:42:25,730
the reason why I kinda
wrapped it up and was that uh,

8003
03:42:25,820 --> 03:42:27,770
I knew mark layman stories before.

8004
03:42:27,771 --> 03:42:28,071
They said,

8005
03:42:28,071 --> 03:42:28,251
dude,

8006
03:42:28,251 --> 03:42:28,740
that the ref,

8007
03:42:28,740 --> 03:42:29,720
the referees in Brazil,

8008
03:42:29,721 --> 03:42:30,554
they're going to fuck you.

8009
03:42:31,110 --> 03:42:32,010
The Brazilians

8010
03:42:32,010 --> 03:42:32,521
rafts,

8011
03:42:32,521 --> 03:42:33,720
they don't like Americans.

8012
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:35,640
And I heard that and I'm like all scared.

8013
03:42:35,641 --> 03:42:37,980
So I'm thinking this guy is
actually going to stand me up.

8014
03:42:38,040 --> 03:42:40,590
So the only reason I said
anything is because I thought,

8015
03:42:40,650 --> 03:42:41,483
oh shit,

8016
03:42:41,580 --> 03:42:43,880
this motherfucker is going
to stand me up in Brazil.

8017
03:42:44,240 --> 03:42:45,850
He was talking to you and I said,

8018
03:42:46,610 --> 03:42:47,700
that's exactly what I said.

8019
03:42:48,090 --> 03:42:49,160
The Rub has taking the law.

8020
03:42:49,940 --> 03:42:51,120
But that's what I said

8021
03:42:52,660 --> 03:42:57,060
is you said I'm about to take
his bachelor's gangster as fuck.

8022
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:58,100
I'm about to take his back.

8023
03:42:58,101 --> 03:42:58,270
Yeah.

8024
03:42:58,270 --> 03:43:02,620
And then he took his back and
choked him out some kinks to show,

8025
03:43:03,050 --> 03:43:06,510
but the only reason I said that was
because I said don't stand me up.

8026
03:43:07,780 --> 03:43:08,700
You didn't want me to stand you up.

8027
03:43:09,080 --> 03:43:10,380
But you said the weight

8028
03:43:12,100 --> 03:43:14,700
because I was actually worried
that we're going to stand me up.

8029
03:43:14,790 --> 03:43:15,361
I think.

8030
03:43:15,361 --> 03:43:18,330
I think that like w w I was thinking
about what bothers me the most.

8031
03:43:18,720 --> 03:43:19,710
That's why I appreciate you.

8032
03:43:19,720 --> 03:43:20,940
You're talking about your friend.

8033
03:43:20,941 --> 03:43:24,330
Like what you did is pretty extraordinary
and you'd have to take moments in life

8034
03:43:24,331 --> 03:43:26,880
to fucking say that the Wayne McCullough
cause one of my favorite people on the

8035
03:43:26,881 --> 03:43:27,511
fucking plan.

8036
03:43:27,511 --> 03:43:27,801
I love it.

8037
03:43:27,801 --> 03:43:28,634
I love that guy.

8038
03:43:28,830 --> 03:43:31,740
And somebody was talking to Wayne
with a lack of respect to me,

8039
03:43:31,741 --> 03:43:32,680
like the in the boxing gym.

8040
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:36,180
They were acting like he was
just a guy who holds mitts and I,

8041
03:43:36,330 --> 03:43:37,380
and I said to the guy,

8042
03:43:37,381 --> 03:43:37,740
go,

8043
03:43:37,740 --> 03:43:39,330
I got to just stop you for a second.

8044
03:43:39,331 --> 03:43:40,680
This is fucking important to me.

8045
03:43:40,740 --> 03:43:41,191
Can I stop?

8046
03:43:41,191 --> 03:43:42,210
You just really happened.

8047
03:43:42,270 --> 03:43:42,900
Yes,

8048
03:43:42,900 --> 03:43:43,650
you can ask Wayne.

8049
03:43:43,650 --> 03:43:44,483
I said,

8050
03:43:44,940 --> 03:43:45,451
but listen to,

8051
03:43:45,451 --> 03:43:46,500
he'll get mad at me for saying this,

8052
03:43:46,501 --> 03:43:47,251
but I want to say this.

8053
03:43:47,251 --> 03:43:47,970
Listen to this.

8054
03:43:47,970 --> 03:43:49,860
You asked such a Dick,

8055
03:43:51,580 --> 03:43:52,413
Dick,

8056
03:43:54,310 --> 03:43:55,020
Dick,

8057
03:43:55,020 --> 03:43:55,340
buddy.

8058
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:56,010
But listen,

8059
03:43:56,010 --> 03:43:56,610
this is my point.

8060
03:43:56,610 --> 03:43:58,410
My point is exactly what
you were saying with Eddie.

8061
03:43:58,620 --> 03:43:59,070
I said,

8062
03:43:59,070 --> 03:44:00,870
a legit boxer didn't say this to you.

8063
03:44:01,500 --> 03:44:01,980
What's that?

8064
03:44:01,980 --> 03:44:02,910
A legit guidance.

8065
03:44:03,730 --> 03:44:04,221
Yes.

8066
03:44:04,221 --> 03:44:04,930
And I said this,

8067
03:44:04,930 --> 03:44:05,340
he said,

8068
03:44:05,340 --> 03:44:08,490
I said crossfit dude way super pale.

8069
03:44:08,910 --> 03:44:11,530
The way the person was
tasked gags to trying to be,

8070
03:44:12,690 --> 03:44:16,470
I'm trying to kind of talk around this
because somebody wasn't treating Wayne

8071
03:44:16,471 --> 03:44:17,700
with the kind of respect he deserves.

8072
03:44:17,850 --> 03:44:18,690
And I tried to explain,

8073
03:44:18,691 --> 03:44:18,901
I said,

8074
03:44:18,901 --> 03:44:19,260
listen man,

8075
03:44:19,260 --> 03:44:20,310
let me explain something cause this stuff.

8076
03:44:20,340 --> 03:44:22,080
He was a fucking world champion.

8077
03:44:22,170 --> 03:44:23,890
He was a world like WBC Carey.

8078
03:44:24,090 --> 03:44:24,871
Who are we talking about?

8079
03:44:24,871 --> 03:44:26,090
We're talking about the garbage man.

8080
03:44:26,360 --> 03:44:28,380
A famous person like I don't
want you to say his name.

8081
03:44:28,381 --> 03:44:29,880
The dude working at Carl's Jr.

8082
03:44:30,060 --> 03:44:30,240
Yeah.

8083
03:44:30,240 --> 03:44:32,550
What kind of guy is he dropped.

8084
03:44:33,670 --> 03:44:37,080
He was a guy who was trying
to box at the actual boxer.

8085
03:44:37,140 --> 03:44:37,510
Uh,

8086
03:44:37,510 --> 03:44:38,020
no.

8087
03:44:38,020 --> 03:44:38,210
Well,

8088
03:44:38,210 --> 03:44:39,043
he's just a guy.

8089
03:44:39,570 --> 03:44:39,841
Yeah,

8090
03:44:39,841 --> 03:44:41,300
just somebody who was
like calling him gray.

8091
03:44:41,330 --> 03:44:41,700
Yes.

8092
03:44:41,700 --> 03:44:43,000
Who's somebody who's locked.

8093
03:44:43,010 --> 03:44:43,220
Great.

8094
03:44:43,220 --> 03:44:43,620
Okay.

8095
03:44:43,620 --> 03:44:45,240
So Greg was treating Wayne,

8096
03:44:46,440 --> 03:44:47,273
Wayne,

8097
03:44:47,300 --> 03:44:47,600
Greg,

8098
03:44:47,600 --> 03:44:47,911
the screening.

8099
03:44:47,911 --> 03:44:48,360
Wayne like,

8100
03:44:48,360 --> 03:44:49,140
Oh hey,

8101
03:44:49,140 --> 03:44:50,790
hold these myths from a essentially,

8102
03:44:51,120 --> 03:44:51,890
you know what I mean?

8103
03:44:51,890 --> 03:44:52,440
And I kind of,

8104
03:44:52,440 --> 03:44:52,960
for me,

8105
03:44:52,960 --> 03:44:53,793
that's what he does.

8106
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:54,991
No,

8107
03:44:54,991 --> 03:44:55,824
he doesn't.

8108
03:44:56,370 --> 03:44:56,611
No,

8109
03:44:56,611 --> 03:44:57,010
he's got a,

8110
03:44:57,010 --> 03:44:59,310
he's got a legit guy who was
fighting right now for our big fight.

8111
03:45:01,020 --> 03:45:04,170
But the point I'm making is that the
point I'm making is that you in life,

8112
03:45:04,320 --> 03:45:06,690
when you see somebody who
accomplished a great deal,

8113
03:45:06,810 --> 03:45:08,130
you got to fucking give it up.

8114
03:45:08,340 --> 03:45:09,630
You have to have respect for that.

8115
03:45:09,750 --> 03:45:11,010
You have to have gratitude for it.

8116
03:45:11,011 --> 03:45:12,060
You have to market.

8117
03:45:12,061 --> 03:45:14,070
You have to treat it with some reverence.

8118
03:45:14,730 --> 03:45:15,810
Reverence is important.

8119
03:45:16,150 --> 03:45:18,630
We can't use him as an example.

8120
03:45:19,560 --> 03:45:20,341
Here's what is important.

8121
03:45:20,341 --> 03:45:21,780
There's no reason to disrespect him.

8122
03:45:22,060 --> 03:45:23,310
He's not like he's doing anything.

8123
03:45:23,370 --> 03:45:24,001
Even if you will,

8124
03:45:24,001 --> 03:45:24,571
to a legend.

8125
03:45:24,571 --> 03:45:25,260
You should.

8126
03:45:25,260 --> 03:45:25,680
Of course.

8127
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:25,951
No,

8128
03:45:25,951 --> 03:45:26,970
but it's more than that.

8129
03:45:26,971 --> 03:45:30,250
You know that he's highly accomplished
in the sport that you're attempting

8130
03:45:30,330 --> 03:45:30,700
to metal.

8131
03:45:30,700 --> 03:45:31,533
Say Olympics.

8132
03:45:31,630 --> 03:45:32,463
It's amazing.

8133
03:45:32,930 --> 03:45:34,480
Get your fucking champion boxer.

8134
03:45:34,780 --> 03:45:35,613
But,

8135
03:45:36,280 --> 03:45:37,390
but here's what I'm saying.

8136
03:45:37,400 --> 03:45:40,180
It's like why would you want to
say bad things about him ever?

8137
03:45:40,540 --> 03:45:41,373
But people,

8138
03:45:41,380 --> 03:45:42,520
what I'm saying is people,

8139
03:45:42,521 --> 03:45:42,821
they might,

8140
03:45:42,821 --> 03:45:43,390
who knows?

8141
03:45:43,390 --> 03:45:43,701
Yeah.

8142
03:45:43,701 --> 03:45:47,710
But people who don't express gratitude
like that and don't like they know older

8143
03:45:47,711 --> 03:45:48,371
boxer though.

8144
03:45:48,371 --> 03:45:50,440
So my hearing's young guy who has no idea.

8145
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:51,340
Here's what I did.

8146
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:52,173
Here's what it is.

8147
03:45:53,050 --> 03:45:53,920
That's what bothered me.

8148
03:45:54,280 --> 03:45:58,450
People know that when you have something
and it's amazing and then you lose it,

8149
03:45:58,451 --> 03:46:00,700
you realize you're not as
great as you once were.

8150
03:46:00,760 --> 03:46:04,800
So they recognize that Wayne
McCullough was a world champion boxer,

8151
03:46:04,801 --> 03:46:07,060
a silver medalist in the Olympics,

8152
03:46:07,240 --> 03:46:08,710
and it's athletic peak.

8153
03:46:08,711 --> 03:46:11,740
He was lazy love throughout the
land and he's not there anymore.

8154
03:46:11,950 --> 03:46:16,810
So they recognize this as an opportunity
to see someone who has diminished from

8155
03:46:16,811 --> 03:46:19,060
the previous ice and they try to attack.

8156
03:46:19,090 --> 03:46:19,760
Exactly.

8157
03:46:19,760 --> 03:46:23,920
Try to attack him to make him feel bad
because they know psychologically that

8158
03:46:23,921 --> 03:46:27,760
this has to have some sort of an effect
on the way his self esteem because they

8159
03:46:27,761 --> 03:46:30,400
never touched because they never
fucking came close to that kind of

8160
03:46:30,520 --> 03:46:32,470
accomplishment doing it.

8161
03:46:32,630 --> 03:46:34,110
It's time to bring him down.

8162
03:46:34,540 --> 03:46:35,840
It's an animal instinct,

8163
03:46:36,060 --> 03:46:36,640
an animalistic,

8164
03:46:36,640 --> 03:46:37,550
and that's a bummer.

8165
03:46:37,580 --> 03:46:38,980
But Shit,

8166
03:46:39,070 --> 03:46:41,150
haters are lose.

8167
03:46:41,151 --> 03:46:42,040
Exactly correct.

8168
03:46:42,120 --> 03:46:43,030
They have to be,

8169
03:46:43,031 --> 03:46:45,010
and that's what I was
experiencing recently.

8170
03:46:45,190 --> 03:46:47,700
A winner and also be haters.

8171
03:46:47,740 --> 03:46:48,520
They don't go.

8172
03:46:48,520 --> 03:46:49,350
Exactly.

8173
03:46:49,350 --> 03:46:49,720
Yeah,

8174
03:46:49,720 --> 03:46:50,560
and that's what I was trying to say.

8175
03:46:50,561 --> 03:46:51,040
I go,

8176
03:46:51,040 --> 03:46:55,690
if you can't celebrate and have some
reverence for what that do did or anybody

8177
03:46:55,691 --> 03:46:56,740
like that you,

8178
03:46:56,830 --> 03:46:58,000
that's your fucking problem.

8179
03:46:58,001 --> 03:46:58,291
And that,

8180
03:46:58,291 --> 03:46:58,630
that,

8181
03:46:58,630 --> 03:47:01,000
oh well they never been
beat up then probably.

8182
03:47:01,150 --> 03:47:01,983
You're right buddy.

8183
03:47:02,290 --> 03:47:06,240
So should good luck.

8184
03:47:06,830 --> 03:47:11,360
And I fucking gentlemen this cheese away.

8185
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:12,360
Everyone's Joe out.

8186
03:47:12,370 --> 03:47:12,780
It's,

8187
03:47:12,780 --> 03:47:13,613
yes.

8188
03:47:13,660 --> 03:47:16,690
I was watching some jokes outside the
training footage of somebody put it on

8189
03:47:16,691 --> 03:47:17,321
Twitter today.

8190
03:47:17,321 --> 03:47:17,651
I was like,

8191
03:47:17,651 --> 03:47:18,930
Jesus Christ dies.

8192
03:47:18,970 --> 03:47:19,361
Dad,

8193
03:47:19,361 --> 03:47:19,660
man.

8194
03:47:19,660 --> 03:47:20,620
Oh my God.

8195
03:47:20,621 --> 03:47:23,260
It's fucking hand speed was retarded.

8196
03:47:23,330 --> 03:47:24,610
He was so fast.

8197
03:47:24,700 --> 03:47:26,560
He lost a Hopkins right now.

8198
03:47:26,561 --> 03:47:30,550
He Peed Hopkins would be Roy Jones Jr
beat Hopkins where he appeared later.

8199
03:47:31,200 --> 03:47:31,840
Duff.

8200
03:47:31,840 --> 03:47:35,640
He did he beat out undefeated.

8201
03:47:35,650 --> 03:47:35,831
Yes,

8202
03:47:35,831 --> 03:47:36,664
he did.

8203
03:47:36,730 --> 03:47:37,690
He beat Hopkins.

8204
03:47:37,691 --> 03:47:39,040
He'd be Roy Jones Jr.

8205
03:47:39,160 --> 03:47:41,560
We just don't accept him
because he wasn't in medic gone.

8206
03:47:41,570 --> 03:47:42,403
No,

8207
03:47:42,550 --> 03:47:43,211
cause he was a,

8208
03:47:43,211 --> 03:47:44,470
he was an English gentleman.

8209
03:47:44,530 --> 03:47:46,290
He gets no credit plus and Joe cows.

8210
03:47:46,291 --> 03:47:46,581
Augie.

8211
03:47:46,581 --> 03:47:47,710
He's like an all time great.

8212
03:47:47,860 --> 03:47:50,140
I mean he might not call
rugged mother fucker.

8213
03:47:51,970 --> 03:47:53,410
He might've retired.

8214
03:47:54,010 --> 03:47:58,360
Does it have as a 46.0 this is
fucking running around saying

8215
03:48:00,160 --> 03:48:03,940
I'm asleep and I'm causing you
can't sleep on John's Bernard.

8216
03:48:04,020 --> 03:48:04,940
Bernard Hustler,

8217
03:48:05,550 --> 03:48:06,201
Kessler,

8218
03:48:06,201 --> 03:48:06,611
a beat.

8219
03:48:06,611 --> 03:48:08,170
A lot of like Jeff Lacey.

8220
03:48:08,560 --> 03:48:11,630
Jeff Lacey was one of his big wins
like early on his career Talker,

8221
03:48:11,631 --> 03:48:12,990
but Hopkins,

8222
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:13,441
the beeper,

8223
03:48:13,441 --> 03:48:13,921
nine hop.

8224
03:48:13,921 --> 03:48:14,950
Whose name talking to him,

8225
03:48:15,190 --> 03:48:16,440
he'd be Roy Jones Jr.

8226
03:48:16,470 --> 03:48:17,680
What was the year that fight?

8227
03:48:17,890 --> 03:48:21,280
Oh eight oh eight
enrolling in the same year.

8228
03:48:21,870 --> 03:48:23,050
I honestly,

8229
03:48:23,051 --> 03:48:26,020
Roy was not the Roy of his prime

8230
03:48:28,070 --> 03:48:29,740
oh eight he was still pretty bad ass,

8231
03:48:29,750 --> 03:48:30,230
wasn't me.

8232
03:48:30,230 --> 03:48:30,570
No,

8233
03:48:30,570 --> 03:48:31,403
no.

8234
03:48:31,440 --> 03:48:32,273
Well,

8235
03:48:33,680 --> 03:48:34,850
compared to everybody in this room,

8236
03:48:34,851 --> 03:48:35,960
he's bad ass right now.

8237
03:48:36,230 --> 03:48:38,030
If we all had to get it in the right jobs,

8238
03:48:38,031 --> 03:48:40,030
junior could ever five tequila shots.

8239
03:48:40,070 --> 03:48:42,060
Box the shit out of everyone in this room.

8240
03:48:42,480 --> 03:48:45,180
I think everyone in this room
to take that silly bitch down.

8241
03:48:47,020 --> 03:48:47,870
Fuck that dude.

8242
03:48:49,280 --> 03:48:49,970
Hey Man.

8243
03:48:49,970 --> 03:48:52,280
[inaudible] ass fucking reference.

8244
03:48:52,281 --> 03:48:53,210
This is what I'm talking about.

8245
03:48:53,211 --> 03:48:55,940
You hate her mother fucker went dark.

8246
03:48:56,570 --> 03:48:57,081
You went dark.

8247
03:48:57,081 --> 03:48:57,914
It's real life.

8248
03:48:58,400 --> 03:48:59,450
I'm a critical thinker.

8249
03:48:59,480 --> 03:49:04,070
I said I sat directly behind roads
engineer and this was my monologue in my

8250
03:49:04,071 --> 03:49:04,341
head.

8251
03:49:04,341 --> 03:49:05,174
I was quite like this.

8252
03:49:05,480 --> 03:49:08,630
I was going to quit his full
time that I was doing this.

8253
03:49:08,631 --> 03:49:09,470
I was saying stuff like this.

8254
03:49:09,650 --> 03:49:10,910
It's got a lot of fast twitch muscle.

8255
03:49:11,330 --> 03:49:12,370
Look at these fucking traps.

8256
03:49:12,710 --> 03:49:13,580
It's got a weird head,

8257
03:49:14,470 --> 03:49:15,440
but he can move that head.

8258
03:49:15,530 --> 03:49:16,790
He could kick my ass right now,

8259
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:19,850
one of what I would do if I had to fight
and they're just are all the questions

8260
03:49:19,851 --> 03:49:22,550
I asked 49 years old.

8261
03:49:22,551 --> 03:49:23,540
I'm asking these questions,

8262
03:49:24,430 --> 03:49:25,790
Dick pic and an elevator.

8263
03:49:25,791 --> 03:49:26,624
He's taken me down.

8264
03:49:26,860 --> 03:49:28,670
[inaudible] you down.

8265
03:49:30,360 --> 03:49:30,970
Knock me down.

8266
03:49:30,970 --> 03:49:31,803
That's what,

8267
03:49:32,030 --> 03:49:32,211
wait,

8268
03:49:32,211 --> 03:49:33,980
listen and elevators where
you gave your best shot.

8269
03:49:33,981 --> 03:49:35,090
I know it's not getting to win.

8270
03:49:35,150 --> 03:49:35,983
No Bitch.

8271
03:49:36,080 --> 03:49:37,190
The fuck out of my,

8272
03:49:37,620 --> 03:49:38,980
he's got a dirty budget.

8273
03:49:39,050 --> 03:49:40,640
Tight shoulders come up.

8274
03:49:41,630 --> 03:49:42,440
You shoot him.

8275
03:49:42,440 --> 03:49:42,891
What's he doing?

8276
03:49:42,891 --> 03:49:43,611
He's hitting elbows.

8277
03:49:43,611 --> 03:49:44,444
He's got no gloves,

8278
03:49:45,330 --> 03:49:45,830
elbows.

8279
03:49:45,830 --> 03:49:48,410
He hitting bone mother fucker.

8280
03:49:48,411 --> 03:49:50,230
That's what I say is I
fucking bring his niece.

8281
03:49:51,280 --> 03:49:56,280
I bring him in down and then
I bar with my bad arm bar,

8282
03:49:56,661 --> 03:49:57,380
my blue belt.

8283
03:49:57,380 --> 03:49:58,550
Armbar Brendan,

8284
03:49:58,610 --> 03:49:59,443
what do you think about that?

8285
03:49:59,720 --> 03:50:00,710
I don't see that

8286
03:50:03,250 --> 03:50:08,250
you guys have her a job
with heavyweight for real,

8287
03:50:08,451 --> 03:50:09,440
like a real roll.

8288
03:50:09,440 --> 03:50:10,161
Eight minute round.

8289
03:50:10,161 --> 03:50:12,710
Let's go for real dude with Brenda Shadow.

8290
03:50:12,920 --> 03:50:13,760
Is that a yes or no?

8291
03:50:13,940 --> 03:50:15,980
I know I had rolled a ton.

8292
03:50:15,981 --> 03:50:16,650
I always fucked with.

8293
03:50:16,650 --> 03:50:17,030
I have.

8294
03:50:17,030 --> 03:50:19,370
I have grabbed him in a perfect head,

8295
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:20,570
an arm lock,

8296
03:50:20,780 --> 03:50:21,680
thrown my hips out.

8297
03:50:21,681 --> 03:50:26,681
Judo style brought his head and he's a
Harmon with a cable with a Grable grip.

8298
03:50:27,620 --> 03:50:30,020
Kept my chin tight and
looked at them and gone.

8299
03:50:30,021 --> 03:50:31,370
He was trying to take a nap and I go,

8300
03:50:31,670 --> 03:50:33,560
you're going fucking nowhere,

8301
03:50:33,570 --> 03:50:34,403
motherfucker.

8302
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:35,870
And had them tight.

8303
03:50:36,050 --> 03:50:37,790
I mean Armand had tight judo,

8304
03:50:38,090 --> 03:50:38,470
hips,

8305
03:50:38,470 --> 03:50:39,303
slave,

8306
03:50:39,350 --> 03:50:40,340
hips splayed.

8307
03:50:40,550 --> 03:50:41,270
Fucking uh,

8308
03:50:41,270 --> 03:50:41,870
what's his name?

8309
03:50:41,870 --> 03:50:41,991
The,

8310
03:50:41,991 --> 03:50:42,440
here you go.

8311
03:50:42,440 --> 03:50:44,350
This is another one that's high fall.

8312
03:50:44,390 --> 03:50:45,223
This is correct.

8313
03:50:45,440 --> 03:50:46,273
This is correct.

8314
03:50:46,600 --> 03:50:47,030
Look at this.

8315
03:50:47,030 --> 03:50:48,210
Doctor's chicken is

8316
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:53,240
amazing with no hormone supplements.

8317
03:50:53,241 --> 03:50:54,290
You don't just break.

8318
03:50:54,390 --> 03:50:54,670
Nah.

8319
03:50:54,670 --> 03:50:55,390
Fuck you.

8320
03:50:55,390 --> 03:50:56,223
Fuck you.

8321
03:50:56,750 --> 03:50:58,960
Look at that high fucking you look at,

8322
03:50:58,961 --> 03:51:00,170
you'd be Super Fun.

8323
03:51:02,300 --> 03:51:05,650
If I was near that I'd be
like [inaudible] he does.

8324
03:51:06,970 --> 03:51:08,110
He loves tongue.

8325
03:51:08,800 --> 03:51:09,501
Has He ever gotten,

8326
03:51:09,501 --> 03:51:10,334
you

8327
03:51:11,810 --> 03:51:13,140
know,

8328
03:51:13,160 --> 03:51:15,900
49 year old comic did not be penny.

8329
03:51:16,210 --> 03:51:17,860
It's not a call and he beat,

8330
03:51:18,250 --> 03:51:22,220
he fucking catch you every night we
got to stop talking over each other.

8331
03:51:22,280 --> 03:51:22,551
I know,

8332
03:51:22,551 --> 03:51:25,650
but I mean I couldn't do and I had a gun.

8333
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:26,040
It would be

8334
03:51:26,040 --> 03:51:26,873
a problem.

8335
03:51:26,940 --> 03:51:27,930
He does whatever he wants.

8336
03:51:28,290 --> 03:51:29,400
That's why you got to let them come.

8337
03:51:29,460 --> 03:51:30,760
I've been talking about that on it.

8338
03:51:32,230 --> 03:51:37,230
It always comes down to the cone and
these lessons is a reason why big people

8339
03:51:37,380 --> 03:51:38,213
exist.

8340
03:51:38,450 --> 03:51:40,830
They were podcasting for four hours.

8341
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:41,660
Fuck.

8342
03:51:41,660 --> 03:51:42,750
Wasn't it measuring time?

8343
03:51:42,751 --> 03:51:43,890
Is this still going though?

8344
03:51:43,891 --> 03:51:45,450
Who gives a fuck but
we weren't allowed to.

8345
03:51:45,451 --> 03:51:46,230
It was that we can do whatever.

8346
03:51:46,230 --> 03:51:47,700
It's like we're in Alaska,

8347
03:51:48,740 --> 03:51:49,201
but Jamie,

8348
03:51:49,201 --> 03:51:49,480
Jamie,

8349
03:51:49,480 --> 03:51:50,910
I'm going to be cut off at three hours.

8350
03:51:50,930 --> 03:51:51,601
No more rules.

8351
03:51:51,601 --> 03:51:52,434
I'm tired.

8352
03:51:52,800 --> 03:51:53,640
I can't do it anymore.

8353
03:51:53,690 --> 03:51:54,510
No one's gone.

8354
03:51:54,510 --> 03:51:55,230
Cages.

8355
03:51:55,230 --> 03:51:57,690
We'll break this podcast up
into part one and part two.

8356
03:51:57,691 --> 03:51:59,010
I can't be employed in A's.

8357
03:51:59,020 --> 03:51:59,853
Can't do it anymore.

8358
03:52:00,450 --> 03:52:01,490
I have it left in me.

8359
03:52:01,800 --> 03:52:04,200
Is drained like a sponge exist.

8360
03:52:04,770 --> 03:52:05,050
Hey,

8361
03:52:05,050 --> 03:52:05,520
be free.

8362
03:52:05,520 --> 03:52:06,720
This podcast for us,

8363
03:52:06,870 --> 03:52:09,870
thanks to your urging
has been a life changer.

8364
03:52:11,150 --> 03:52:12,290
Going to let you

8365
03:52:14,070 --> 03:52:14,820
know,

8366
03:52:14,820 --> 03:52:15,653
excuse me,

8367
03:52:15,670 --> 03:52:17,390
talking about podcast each other.

8368
03:52:18,100 --> 03:52:21,810
You see such a random movie
trail that she goes a little bit.

8369
03:52:21,811 --> 03:52:22,980
Let's talk about tip.

8370
03:52:23,010 --> 03:52:26,030
Going to want to see it though.

8371
03:52:26,040 --> 03:52:26,650
Jamie,

8372
03:52:26,650 --> 03:52:28,380
what were we trying to encourage?

8373
03:52:28,381 --> 03:52:31,710
Eddie Bravo and to bringing back any
bravo radio and you want to talk about

8374
03:52:31,800 --> 03:52:32,970
tickling funny.

8375
03:52:32,971 --> 03:52:33,390
I don't have,

8376
03:52:33,390 --> 03:52:35,700
I don't have to get punched in
the face and work as a podcast.

8377
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:36,833
It's incredible.

8378
03:52:37,260 --> 03:52:39,030
I loved and doing my podcast.

8379
03:52:39,270 --> 03:52:41,070
But I feel like sometimes,

8380
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:43,350
you know when you do a
podcast and you've got to,

8381
03:52:43,351 --> 03:52:46,380
you get new audience and you've got to
tell the fucking same story over and

8382
03:52:46,381 --> 03:52:47,214
over.

8383
03:52:47,430 --> 03:52:48,800
I hate saying the same.

8384
03:52:48,830 --> 03:52:50,090
You know when people
start saying over here,

8385
03:52:50,100 --> 03:52:50,930
he goes,

8386
03:52:50,930 --> 03:52:52,590
why would you say the same story over?

8387
03:52:52,591 --> 03:52:54,840
And it comes up here on a podcast.

8388
03:52:54,841 --> 03:52:55,540
I've done that.

8389
03:52:55,540 --> 03:52:57,600
It's you gotta say you gotta kind of,

8390
03:52:57,630 --> 03:53:00,360
you got to get an abbreviate it and
say I've talked about this before,

8391
03:53:00,540 --> 03:53:01,410
but unfortunately,

8392
03:53:01,411 --> 03:53:04,260
unless that's like cut up in like a clip,

8393
03:53:04,590 --> 03:53:07,740
it's hard for people just started
listening to your podcast to find that.

8394
03:53:07,980 --> 03:53:11,940
So it becomes annoying cause you're
speaking of so many people like you were

8395
03:53:11,941 --> 03:53:12,691
getting like what?

8396
03:53:12,691 --> 03:53:14,370
Like 50 a hundred thousand downloads,

8397
03:53:14,371 --> 03:53:15,204
how many downloads?

8398
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:16,140
How many again,

8399
03:53:16,140 --> 03:53:16,680
nothing.

8400
03:53:16,680 --> 03:53:17,740
Whatever you're getting nothing.

8401
03:53:17,870 --> 03:53:18,240
Let's say,

8402
03:53:18,240 --> 03:53:18,660
let's say,

8403
03:53:18,660 --> 03:53:21,310
let's say you're getting 5,000
even if you're getting five times,

8404
03:53:21,330 --> 03:53:23,850
that's 5,000 fucking people in an arena.

8405
03:53:24,050 --> 03:53:27,090
I mean Ari and I had this conversation
when we first started talking about

8406
03:53:27,091 --> 03:53:28,620
Twitter because aren't get on Twitter.

8407
03:53:28,621 --> 03:53:28,861
He's like,

8408
03:53:28,861 --> 03:53:30,060
I only got 2000 followers.

8409
03:53:30,061 --> 03:53:30,894
I go,

8410
03:53:31,140 --> 03:53:33,870
what would you think if you
went to a show and you're like,

8411
03:53:33,871 --> 03:53:35,160
it's only 2000 people.

8412
03:53:36,270 --> 03:53:37,500
You would never think that.

8413
03:53:37,770 --> 03:53:38,670
You'd never think that.

8414
03:53:38,671 --> 03:53:38,971
You'd be like,

8415
03:53:38,971 --> 03:53:39,571
Holy Shit,

8416
03:53:39,571 --> 03:53:40,860
there's 2000 people.

8417
03:53:40,861 --> 03:53:42,240
He's like your art or the,

8418
03:53:42,250 --> 03:53:42,511
yeah,

8419
03:53:42,511 --> 03:53:43,110
I'm right.

8420
03:53:43,110 --> 03:53:43,410
Yeah.

8421
03:53:43,410 --> 03:53:47,910
There's 2000 people listening
and eventually you're going
to say something funny

8422
03:53:47,911 --> 03:53:49,010
and someone's going to find out,

8423
03:53:49,011 --> 03:53:52,860
I'm not going to spread it to five people
will spread it to 10 you'll have 1500

8424
03:53:52,861 --> 03:53:54,480
people and six months.

8425
03:53:54,570 --> 03:53:56,700
How many Twitter followers
do you have till road?

8426
03:53:57,720 --> 03:53:58,500
Um,

8427
03:53:58,500 --> 03:53:59,160
I don't know.

8428
03:53:59,160 --> 03:53:59,821
Over a million.

8429
03:53:59,821 --> 03:54:02,310
1.9 or something like that.

8430
03:54:02,370 --> 03:54:02,761
What is it,

8431
03:54:02,761 --> 03:54:03,330
Jamie?

8432
03:54:03,330 --> 03:54:04,163
Is it Jeremy?

8433
03:54:04,680 --> 03:54:08,340
1.9100000000000001 point 9
million Instagram followers.

8434
03:54:08,490 --> 03:54:10,240
1.1 million fans.

8435
03:54:10,360 --> 03:54:10,961
It was crazy.

8436
03:54:10,961 --> 03:54:12,090
You know it's,

8437
03:54:12,091 --> 03:54:12,451
listen,

8438
03:54:12,451 --> 03:54:13,480
you guys will have that too.

8439
03:54:14,020 --> 03:54:15,720
It's an accumulative effect.

8440
03:54:15,870 --> 03:54:18,420
There's girls out there to just do
nothing but stick their ass in front of a

8441
03:54:18,421 --> 03:54:19,050
camera.

8442
03:54:19,050 --> 03:54:20,780
They have like 10 times
as many as I blessed.

8443
03:54:20,950 --> 03:54:21,783
We're

8444
03:54:23,150 --> 03:54:24,040
Russian broad.

8445
03:54:24,280 --> 03:54:25,001
Oh my God.

8446
03:54:25,001 --> 03:54:26,410
I almost jerked off in
front of my friends.

8447
03:54:26,470 --> 03:54:27,070
Let me see her.

8448
03:54:27,070 --> 03:54:27,761
She's so hot.

8449
03:54:27,761 --> 03:54:28,361
She was that high.

8450
03:54:28,361 --> 03:54:29,380
It didn't make any sense.

8451
03:54:30,010 --> 03:54:33,160
I'm going to tell you how frustrated
I don't want to get more followers to

8452
03:54:33,170 --> 03:54:34,720
please tell me now.

8453
03:54:34,721 --> 03:54:37,990
I have to know 10 fucking piano later.

8454
03:54:37,991 --> 03:54:39,490
I don't remember it a farm on Bro.

8455
03:54:39,491 --> 03:54:39,970
Don't be a bitch.

8456
03:54:39,970 --> 03:54:41,110
Don't I don't remember Jamie.

8457
03:54:41,111 --> 03:54:44,240
You know I just randomly
found too dark hair.

8458
03:54:44,260 --> 03:54:45,250
Light hair dark.

8459
03:54:45,420 --> 03:54:45,880
Yeah.

8460
03:54:45,880 --> 03:54:47,350
You guys are getting more followers.

8461
03:54:47,780 --> 03:54:48,940
She would bring her up.

8462
03:54:49,830 --> 03:54:50,441
Let's move on.

8463
03:54:50,441 --> 03:54:51,100
Let's move on.

8464
03:54:51,100 --> 03:54:52,060
This is what's important.

8465
03:54:52,390 --> 03:54:53,223
Um,

8466
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:54,310
it's uh,

8467
03:54:54,310 --> 03:54:55,720
it's about consistency.

8468
03:54:56,050 --> 03:54:56,771
Like when you're,

8469
03:54:56,771 --> 03:54:57,281
when you're,

8470
03:54:57,281 --> 03:54:57,610
um,

8471
03:54:57,610 --> 03:54:58,600
using social media,

8472
03:54:58,601 --> 03:55:02,150
it's about honesty and consistency and
you guys are super honest and you shoot

8473
03:55:02,151 --> 03:55:02,984
her consistent.

8474
03:55:03,160 --> 03:55:05,440
So it's going to be people don't like you.

8475
03:55:05,830 --> 03:55:06,670
It's inevitable.

8476
03:55:06,730 --> 03:55:07,810
People don't like me.

8477
03:55:07,811 --> 03:55:08,770
They don't like Eddie.

8478
03:55:08,890 --> 03:55:09,370
Oh,

8479
03:55:09,370 --> 03:55:10,203
Jesus.

8480
03:55:10,670 --> 03:55:11,503
Lord.

8481
03:55:12,170 --> 03:55:13,240
She's a good girl.

8482
03:55:14,610 --> 03:55:15,900
Those are muscular quads.

8483
03:55:15,910 --> 03:55:16,390
Yeah,

8484
03:55:16,390 --> 03:55:17,910

8485
03:55:18,240 --> 03:55:18,710

03:55:22,300 --> 03:55:23,410
Oh my fuck.

8490
03:55:23,450 --> 03:55:25,590
Oh God.

8491
03:55:25,900 --> 03:55:27,280
Changes top 10.

8492
03:55:29,240 --> 03:55:30,190
Jamie

8493
03:55:31,830 --> 03:55:35,720

was about take it down and you guys

8494
03:55:36,100 --> 03:55:38,320
all I'm thinking about as
the milking properties,

8495
03:55:39,730 --> 03:55:40,450
the fact that pussy,

8496
03:55:40,450 --> 03:55:41,850
he's like

8497
03:55:43,400 --> 03:55:46,930
farmer's hand squeezing
out a wet pair of socks.

8498
03:55:46,931 --> 03:55:47,820
A farmers hand,

8499
03:55:47,821 --> 03:55:48,331
a pharmacy.

8500
03:55:48,331 --> 03:55:49,164
Man,

8501
03:55:49,480 --> 03:55:50,010

It's the,

8507
03:56:01,880 --> 03:56:04,360
it's the let's come cut podcast guys.

8508
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:07,190

8509
03:56:07,220 --> 03:56:07,920

8510
03:56:07,920 --> 03:56:08,753
no more.

8511
03:56:10,170 --> 03:56:12,280
Who brought the fucking
Puritan to the party?

8512
03:56:12,340 --> 03:56:12,600
You know,

8513
03:56:12,600 --> 03:56:14,980
it's a beautiful thing about
potty web belts on your hats.

8514
03:56:15,160 --> 03:56:16,300
The beautiful thing about politics,

8515
03:56:17,200 --> 03:56:18,690
we have all of us together.

8516
03:56:18,720 --> 03:56:21,240
It's like a legit network and not just us,

8517
03:56:21,241 --> 03:56:22,410
but everybody else out there.

8518
03:56:22,560 --> 03:56:22,771
You know,

8519
03:56:22,771 --> 03:56:25,920
there's always been networks
like CBS and ABC and NBC,

8520
03:56:26,130 --> 03:56:27,870
but those networks like businesses,

8521
03:56:28,200 --> 03:56:29,880
but like we're a network of friends.

8522
03:56:29,950 --> 03:56:31,410
Like that's a new thing.

8523
03:56:31,620 --> 03:56:32,520
That's a new thing.

8524
03:56:32,610 --> 03:56:35,040
Like everything that you do helps me.

8525
03:56:35,041 --> 03:56:36,750
Everything that I do helps you.

8526
03:56:37,050 --> 03:56:38,250
We all help each other.

8527
03:56:38,460 --> 03:56:40,290
You guys come on my podcast,

8528
03:56:40,291 --> 03:56:41,850
we blow it up on Twitter.

8529
03:56:41,851 --> 03:56:43,170
We put it up on Instagram.

8530
03:56:43,171 --> 03:56:44,880
We do a fight companion all together.

8531
03:56:45,090 --> 03:56:46,440
Everybody blows up.

8532
03:56:46,710 --> 03:56:47,790
This is a network,

8533
03:56:47,791 --> 03:56:51,300
like an organic network as opposed
to like a business network.

8534
03:56:51,301 --> 03:56:51,421
Well,

8535
03:56:51,421 --> 03:56:55,710
we sat down and said I needed to control
40% of this one glomerate and try and

8536
03:56:55,850 --> 03:56:56,683
there's no agenda.

8537
03:56:58,770 --> 03:56:59,581
It's just friends.

8538
03:56:59,581 --> 03:57:00,290
There's no agenda,

8539
03:57:00,290 --> 03:57:01,123
no paperwork,

8540
03:57:01,410 --> 03:57:02,250
no paperwork.

8541
03:57:02,280 --> 03:57:03,180
Everybody's cool.

8542
03:57:03,330 --> 03:57:04,410
Everybody helps everybody.

8543
03:57:04,710 --> 03:57:05,070
You know,

8544
03:57:05,070 --> 03:57:07,380
if there's ever like shows
it need to be tweeted.

8545
03:57:07,410 --> 03:57:09,240
Everybody's happy to tweet for everybody.

8546
03:57:09,241 --> 03:57:10,200
I see everybody doing it.

8547
03:57:10,201 --> 03:57:11,280
We all do it for each other.

8548
03:57:11,700 --> 03:57:13,410
Our comedian friends do it for each other.

8549
03:57:13,590 --> 03:57:14,640
I didn't notice that shirt.

8550
03:57:15,330 --> 03:57:17,570
The kido kid get yo slim off.

8551
03:57:18,240 --> 03:57:19,073
He's Quito.

8552
03:57:19,290 --> 03:57:21,590
You don't even know about that shirt
and you're in the business with him.

8553
03:57:21,980 --> 03:57:22,371
I don't.

8554
03:57:22,371 --> 03:57:23,870
I don't have them sign off.

8555
03:57:24,640 --> 03:57:26,560
It is the first time he
sees barely penetrate.

8556
03:57:27,340 --> 03:57:28,400
You just make sure it's,

8557
03:57:28,401 --> 03:57:28,880
and I'm like,

8558
03:57:28,880 --> 03:57:29,111
Hey,

8559
03:57:29,111 --> 03:57:29,390
good job.

8560
03:57:29,390 --> 03:57:30,320
They go on sale this week,

8561
03:57:30,321 --> 03:57:30,710
Brian.

8562
03:57:30,710 --> 03:57:33,980
I called them the Kido kid at the
beginning of our last podcast together.

8563
03:57:34,440 --> 03:57:34,900
Awesome.

8564
03:57:34,900 --> 03:57:35,211
Still,

8565
03:57:35,211 --> 03:57:37,160
I was in Arizona this week
and people are yelling,

8566
03:57:37,250 --> 03:57:38,300
I'm Tito Kid,

8567
03:57:39,530 --> 03:57:42,520
the kid too and this is fucked up
cause you can use the Kido kids.

8568
03:57:42,520 --> 03:57:43,030
They can't stand.

8569
03:57:43,030 --> 03:57:43,880
It's more legit.

8570
03:57:43,940 --> 03:57:44,290
What will,

8571
03:57:44,290 --> 03:57:45,860
if you put something before kid for me,

8572
03:57:45,861 --> 03:57:46,694
what would you call me?

8573
03:57:47,480 --> 03:57:48,313
The old kid,

8574
03:57:49,040 --> 03:57:50,780
I call him creepy creepy kid for sure.

8575
03:57:51,500 --> 03:57:52,250
The perfect kid.

8576
03:57:52,250 --> 03:57:53,630
Mildly Delusional Kid.

8577
03:57:53,800 --> 03:57:54,633
Briefly.

8578
03:57:54,920 --> 03:57:59,300
The wrinkle kid align kid the
lying about the fact that my dad,

8579
03:57:59,360 --> 03:58:02,930
how about the fact that I told the story
like a really good long story dramatic

8580
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:05,600
and my father in front of a
bunch of people goes like this,

8581
03:58:05,690 --> 03:58:06,800
like friends and he goes,

8582
03:58:07,400 --> 03:58:10,070
now how much of that story do
you think is actually true?

8583
03:58:10,280 --> 03:58:11,113
That's right,

8584
03:58:11,310 --> 03:58:11,641
mother.

8585
03:58:11,641 --> 03:58:11,970
Fuck.

8586
03:58:11,970 --> 03:58:15,500
Well the problem is you understand
drama so well that you'll occasionally

8587
03:58:15,501 --> 03:58:19,200
sprinkle it in as long as you keep the
ethics of the original idea of storing

8588
03:58:19,280 --> 03:58:19,940
about sir.

8589
03:58:19,940 --> 03:58:21,100
Don't know what you're talking to.

8590
03:58:21,820 --> 03:58:25,700
You are more concerned with
the entertainment value
of what you're saying and

8591
03:58:25,701 --> 03:58:27,380
you are the voracity of the true.

8592
03:58:27,390 --> 03:58:29,980
I'm already involved statements.

8593
03:58:30,860 --> 03:58:31,940
Benjamin Button.

8594
03:58:32,010 --> 03:58:33,650
A case is showing,

8595
03:58:33,860 --> 03:58:38,060
why are we showing that Guy Jamie decided
to spice it up with a random shows

8596
03:58:38,061 --> 03:58:40,280
like a naked man in the
mirror with glasses on.

8597
03:58:40,340 --> 03:58:41,060
Yeah,

8598
03:58:41,060 --> 03:58:41,893
Benjamin Button.

8599
03:58:42,740 --> 03:58:44,150
I think overall like you,

8600
03:58:44,180 --> 03:58:47,930
you would never change the actual results
of the story you're talking about.

8601
03:58:47,960 --> 03:58:48,230
Right?

8602
03:58:48,230 --> 03:58:51,470
But you would flavor that story with
additional spices that weren't in the

8603
03:58:51,471 --> 03:58:52,304
original recipe.

8604
03:58:52,470 --> 03:58:53,303
Like a lawyer.

8605
03:58:53,330 --> 03:58:55,670
You'll throw some shit in
there to make it better.

8606
03:58:55,700 --> 03:58:56,750
And I appreciate that.

8607
03:58:56,780 --> 03:58:58,220
We took a lie detector test,

8608
03:58:58,221 --> 03:58:59,150
but as a good friend,

8609
03:58:59,180 --> 03:59:02,510
I have to throw things through a
filter and when you tell me something,

8610
03:59:02,511 --> 03:59:04,610
I have to go skeptical.

8611
03:59:05,570 --> 03:59:06,403
Skeptical.

8612
03:59:06,680 --> 03:59:07,610
I love this dude.

8613
03:59:07,611 --> 03:59:09,110
But let me see where I go with this.

8614
03:59:09,140 --> 03:59:11,710
[inaudible] he goes [inaudible] yeah.

8615
03:59:12,200 --> 03:59:12,501
Hey,

8616
03:59:12,501 --> 03:59:13,490
I took a lie detector test.

8617
03:59:13,491 --> 03:59:13,851
He asked me,

8618
03:59:13,851 --> 03:59:14,181
I said,

8619
03:59:14,181 --> 03:59:16,730
ask me all the tech went on
your site or your psycho.

8620
03:59:16,790 --> 03:59:17,091
No,

8621
03:59:17,091 --> 03:59:18,600
the problem was it then
I should go to your,

8622
03:59:19,430 --> 03:59:21,380
that's us when Brian tells any story.

8623
03:59:21,650 --> 03:59:22,610
So what happened?

8624
03:59:22,670 --> 03:59:22,821
Well,

8625
03:59:22,821 --> 03:59:23,540
she said,

8626
03:59:23,540 --> 03:59:23,931
she goes,

8627
03:59:23,931 --> 03:59:26,830
I live across the board about
everything that she said.

8628
03:59:26,890 --> 03:59:29,690
He lies about everything you
are true of the ass mate to see.

8629
03:59:29,691 --> 03:59:30,081
And it was,

8630
03:59:30,081 --> 03:59:31,100
it just didn't work out.

8631
03:59:31,101 --> 03:59:33,170
So I went and I sweat.

8632
03:59:33,300 --> 03:59:35,090
Here's the thing about
a lie detector test.

8633
03:59:35,120 --> 03:59:35,480
Okay,

8634
03:59:35,480 --> 03:59:36,260
here's the thing.

8635
03:59:36,260 --> 03:59:37,910
As soon as you're measuring something,

8636
03:59:37,911 --> 03:59:41,170
you're changing what that thing is
because you're making someone conscious of

8637
03:59:41,171 --> 03:59:42,230
the fact that you're measuring it.

8638
03:59:42,590 --> 03:59:47,590
And so if you were a completely
self conscious person who
is always aware of how

8639
03:59:47,691 --> 03:59:48,560
people are viewing him,

8640
03:59:48,710 --> 03:59:49,820
like Brian Cowen,

8641
03:59:50,030 --> 03:59:51,740
which is one of the reasons
why you're so entertaining.

8642
03:59:51,770 --> 03:59:53,360
It's cause you really
want everybody around you.

8643
03:59:53,480 --> 03:59:54,500
You're very accommodating.

8644
03:59:54,560 --> 03:59:54,831
Yes.

8645
03:59:54,831 --> 03:59:56,000
And you're a very like,

8646
03:59:56,030 --> 03:59:56,863
like Brian,

8647
03:59:57,020 --> 03:59:58,160
like way more than me.

8648
03:59:58,640 --> 04:00:01,250
He suffers fools were around fools.

8649
04:00:01,251 --> 04:00:01,580
I'm like,

8650
04:00:01,580 --> 04:00:03,950
I am seeing us fucking wasted time.

8651
04:00:03,980 --> 04:00:05,030
Is a cloud common.

8652
04:00:05,180 --> 04:00:06,140
We've got to get in the car.

8653
04:00:06,141 --> 04:00:06,711
We got to get out of.

8654
04:00:06,711 --> 04:00:07,544
Brian loves him.

8655
04:00:07,780 --> 04:00:08,270
Oh my God.

8656
04:00:08,270 --> 04:00:08,900
He loves it.

8657
04:00:08,900 --> 04:00:09,710
He loves it.

8658
04:00:09,710 --> 04:00:11,920
He loves him a doofus and loves him in.

8659
04:00:12,250 --> 04:00:14,060
But it's because he's so accommodating.

8660
04:00:14,090 --> 04:00:14,450
Yeah.

8661
04:00:14,450 --> 04:00:15,620
He's like such a nice guy.

8662
04:00:15,621 --> 04:00:17,520
He's a cop and I can't do it any.

8663
04:00:17,521 --> 04:00:20,120
One of my favorite pastimes is to
go through my life and think about

8664
04:00:20,130 --> 04:00:23,550
all how much time I would have saved
if I had just walked away from certain

8665
04:00:23,551 --> 04:00:24,780
people and just listened to me.

8666
04:00:25,230 --> 04:00:27,150
How many times have I told you yes,

8667
04:00:27,270 --> 04:00:28,830
this has been a dozen times.

8668
04:00:28,831 --> 04:00:30,210
Like a lot of skies retarded.

8669
04:00:30,360 --> 04:00:31,380
This girl's crazy.

8670
04:00:31,430 --> 04:00:31,620
Yeah.

8671
04:00:31,620 --> 04:00:32,820
Like we've got to get away from him.

8672
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:33,120
Yeah.

8673
04:00:33,120 --> 04:00:35,040
Like this guy is gonna
fucking take you to jail.

8674
04:00:36,610 --> 04:00:39,420
You and I will both tell
him about the same guy.

8675
04:00:39,510 --> 04:00:39,661
Oh,

8676
04:00:39,661 --> 04:00:40,500
you don't know or no,

8677
04:00:40,530 --> 04:00:41,340
hold up.

8678
04:00:41,340 --> 04:00:42,420
You don't know the same guy?

8679
04:00:42,421 --> 04:00:42,930
No.

8680
04:00:42,930 --> 04:00:45,840
See I bet cha no you do not.

8681
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:48,480
I know by 1994

8682
04:00:52,510 --> 04:00:55,980
I can count from for 28 years old.

8683
04:00:55,981 --> 04:00:56,431
This is like,

8684
04:00:56,431 --> 04:00:56,870
you know,

8685
04:00:56,870 --> 04:00:57,421
rock card.

8686
04:00:57,421 --> 04:00:59,230
Do you know how you have those uh,

8687
04:00:59,250 --> 04:01:01,380
those goggles that people
wear when they go swimming,

8688
04:01:01,381 --> 04:01:02,430
they doing laps in the pool.

8689
04:01:02,670 --> 04:01:07,670
Imagine if you took those and you painted
black around everything except like a

8690
04:01:08,311 --> 04:01:12,090
pencil eraser and the seven in
the center of each one of those.

8691
04:01:12,090 --> 04:01:13,350
And that's how you looked at the world.

8692
04:01:13,760 --> 04:01:16,560
That's how Brian would narrow life.

8693
04:01:16,561 --> 04:01:17,394
Just girls,

8694
04:01:17,400 --> 04:01:19,260
girls and Butare hints

8695
04:01:21,030 --> 04:01:22,190
and good food when he,

8696
04:01:22,191 --> 04:01:24,090
he'd have these friends
and I'd meet these guys,

8697
04:01:24,100 --> 04:01:24,720
but I'll be like,

8698
04:01:24,720 --> 04:01:25,021
oh yeah,

8699
04:01:25,021 --> 04:01:25,201
Hey,

8700
04:01:25,201 --> 04:01:25,681
nice to meet you.

8701
04:01:25,681 --> 04:01:26,430
Come here.

8702
04:01:26,430 --> 04:01:27,590
You gotta get the fuck away from this guy.

8703
04:01:27,630 --> 04:01:28,450
What are you doing?

8704
04:01:28,450 --> 04:01:31,680
But throw in two dogs
and parents and parents,

8705
04:01:32,700 --> 04:01:33,140
girl,

8706
04:01:33,140 --> 04:01:38,140
while I'd read Chris' House
and he's got no door knob.

8707
04:01:38,670 --> 04:01:38,941
Okay?

8708
04:01:38,941 --> 04:01:39,420
First of all,

8709
04:01:39,420 --> 04:01:40,040
I have no door.

8710
04:01:40,040 --> 04:01:40,770
No,

8711
04:01:40,770 --> 04:01:41,660
he lives in Venice beach.

8712
04:01:41,661 --> 04:01:42,494
He's got no door on.

8713
04:01:42,730 --> 04:01:43,561
I walk in this house,

8714
04:01:43,561 --> 04:01:46,260
he's got a book sitting on the table
and it's like a check Carol Dweck book.

8715
04:01:46,261 --> 04:01:46,471
I'm like,

8716
04:01:46,471 --> 04:01:47,221
you're not reading that book.

8717
04:01:47,221 --> 04:01:48,870
You want girls to think
you reading that book.

8718
04:01:48,990 --> 04:01:49,141
Well,

8719
04:01:49,141 --> 04:01:49,651
I called you.

8720
04:01:49,651 --> 04:01:50,590
Remember I called you?

8721
04:01:50,720 --> 04:01:51,270
You fucking,

8722
04:01:51,270 --> 04:01:51,870
I called him up.

8723
04:01:51,870 --> 04:01:52,081
I go,

8724
04:01:52,081 --> 04:01:52,380
dude,

8725
04:01:52,380 --> 04:01:53,260
I'm laying book.

8726
04:01:53,400 --> 04:01:54,091
There's this girl.

8727
04:01:54,091 --> 04:01:54,751
I went to Princeton.

8728
04:01:54,751 --> 04:01:55,820
She was fucking really smart.

8729
04:01:56,040 --> 04:01:56,811
And I called Joe like,

8730
04:01:56,811 --> 04:01:56,931
Oh,

8731
04:01:56,931 --> 04:01:57,900
I have to call you because I,

8732
04:01:57,901 --> 04:01:59,250
you need to know that I'm a fraud.

8733
04:01:59,251 --> 04:02:00,300
But if I tell you I'm a fraud,

8734
04:02:00,450 --> 04:02:01,830
I'm not good bro.

8735
04:02:01,860 --> 04:02:04,740
I'm laying books out about
around my fucking place.

8736
04:02:04,950 --> 04:02:06,740
So the girl things I read and I'm keeping,

8737
04:02:06,930 --> 04:02:08,460
I'm opening the pages,

8738
04:02:09,840 --> 04:02:12,870
but the fact that I'm telling my
my best friend and I'm doing that,

8739
04:02:13,070 --> 04:02:18,070
it means I'm not a fraud like I'm lying
but I'm not lying to you is a true

8740
04:02:18,571 --> 04:02:18,991
statement,

8741
04:02:18,991 --> 04:02:20,220
but the chronology code,

8742
04:02:20,340 --> 04:02:21,750
the chronology is broken.

8743
04:02:22,050 --> 04:02:26,400
I had informed him first that he was a
fraud with his books on the coffee table

8744
04:02:26,430 --> 04:02:30,990
and I knew it and he was and he denied
it and then admitted it and then called

8745
04:02:30,991 --> 04:02:31,500
me.

8746
04:02:31,500 --> 04:02:31,981
All right.

8747
04:02:31,981 --> 04:02:32,830
That's the actual,

8748
04:02:32,831 --> 04:02:33,330
there you go.

8749
04:02:33,330 --> 04:02:34,320
I don't know about that.

8750
04:02:34,410 --> 04:02:35,460
It's 100% true,

8751
04:02:35,910 --> 04:02:40,910
but you did come clean actually
you have to come clean.

8752
04:02:41,131 --> 04:02:42,570
You cannot lie to your friends.

8753
04:02:42,571 --> 04:02:43,940
Your friends have to know who you are.

8754
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:44,161
Man.

8755
04:02:44,161 --> 04:02:44,911
Isn't that funny?

8756
04:02:44,911 --> 04:02:49,911
Is that like like being a guy who was
like secretly deep is attractive somehow

8757
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:52,890
to the genetics of a woman.

8758
04:02:52,891 --> 04:02:56,610
It's searching for a man with character
because the guy who secretly deep who

8759
04:02:56,611 --> 04:02:57,444
can deal with shit,

8760
04:02:57,450 --> 04:02:58,590
maybe it gets up in the morning,

8761
04:02:58,710 --> 04:03:01,140
sets his alarm clock or 4:00
PM and goes running up a hill.

8762
04:03:01,290 --> 04:03:05,950
That guy can understand what it's
like to overcome pressure and that's,

8763
04:03:06,030 --> 04:03:11,030
that's a peeling to women's genetics
because they know that this whole

8764
04:03:11,671 --> 04:03:14,070
supermarket highway thing,

8765
04:03:14,340 --> 04:03:16,690
this ain't going to last
if shit hits the fan.

8766
04:03:16,990 --> 04:03:18,010
This is great

8767
04:03:18,040 --> 04:03:20,800
for like a small brief window of history,

8768
04:03:21,010 --> 04:03:24,910
but there's a thing called a super
volcano and it's sitting in Yellowstone

8769
04:03:24,911 --> 04:03:29,911
national park and it's a continent
killer and every six to 800,000 years he

8770
04:03:30,681 --> 04:03:35,681
fucking explodes and everything dies
and the earth gets cool because it goes

8771
04:03:36,461 --> 04:03:41,461
into nuclear winter and the last time it
happened was 800,000 years ago and it's

8772
04:03:41,771 --> 04:03:42,604
fucking dumb.

8773
04:03:43,540 --> 04:03:45,340
So they need to know you better,

8774
04:03:45,341 --> 04:03:46,174
enjoy this,

8775
04:03:46,570 --> 04:03:47,261
enjoy this.

8776
04:03:47,261 --> 04:03:49,500
So fuck the muscular guys
that wake up in the morning,

8777
04:03:49,501 --> 04:03:50,140
be ready.

8778
04:03:50,140 --> 04:03:50,591
You listen,

8779
04:03:50,591 --> 04:03:55,591
you don't understand for
what a fucking volcano lava,

8780
04:03:56,381 --> 04:03:58,330
you pausing and I hunt.

8781
04:03:58,570 --> 04:04:00,220
You stayed behind me once again,

8782
04:04:01,030 --> 04:04:02,260
find the fucking food.

8783
04:04:02,261 --> 04:04:03,094
This is what I think.

8784
04:04:03,230 --> 04:04:04,390
You can't control your breathing.

8785
04:04:04,391 --> 04:04:06,250
We're going to starve the universe.

8786
04:04:06,520 --> 04:04:11,520
The universe is just as content with
us being hit by a fucking asteroid and

8787
04:04:11,741 --> 04:04:14,920
being knocked back down
to single celled organism.

8788
04:04:14,921 --> 04:04:16,630
This is as it is.

8789
04:04:16,680 --> 04:04:16,871
You know,

8790
04:04:16,871 --> 04:04:20,410
they don't kill us succeeding and
figuring out a way to get to Mars.

8791
04:04:20,590 --> 04:04:22,160
The universe is just as good,

8792
04:04:22,240 --> 04:04:23,920
just as happy with either result.

8793
04:04:23,950 --> 04:04:28,210
You can find out all this paperwork in
that fucking air force base in Laurel

8794
04:04:28,210 --> 04:04:28,710
Canyon.

8795
04:04:28,710 --> 04:04:32,940
[inaudible]

8796
04:04:33,460 --> 04:04:34,293
into it.

8797
04:04:35,220 --> 04:04:36,250
I am going to listen.

8798
04:04:36,310 --> 04:04:37,870
I get home Tom's,

8799
04:04:38,000 --> 04:04:41,290
there can be no doubt that the
government has tried to manipulate the

8800
04:04:41,291 --> 04:04:43,060
consciousness of the population.

8801
04:04:43,650 --> 04:04:44,470
It can be no doubt,

8802
04:04:44,470 --> 04:04:45,303
boom,

8803
04:04:45,530 --> 04:04:47,860
power over people form should do it.

8804
04:04:47,861 --> 04:04:48,760
And Nixon was,

8805
04:04:48,910 --> 04:04:52,600
Nixon was like a fucking
total sneaky piece of shit.

8806
04:04:52,780 --> 04:04:54,670
I mean that's what
Nixon is hold Dame hook.

8807
04:04:54,671 --> 04:04:58,870
They proven that Nixon's war on drugs
was about controlling the civil rights

8808
04:04:58,871 --> 04:05:01,060
movement and controlling
the antiwar movement.

8809
04:05:01,061 --> 04:05:02,530
It's 100% been proven.

8810
04:05:02,680 --> 04:05:06,250
It's one of the things that's
being discussed right now
in mainstream newspapers

8811
04:05:06,251 --> 04:05:07,600
and mainstream magazines.

8812
04:05:07,900 --> 04:05:11,710
The reason why they went after marijuana
and mushrooms and LSD is cause they

8813
04:05:11,711 --> 04:05:12,550
wanted a silence.

8814
04:05:12,551 --> 04:05:15,190
The antiwar people in
the civil rights period,

8815
04:05:15,240 --> 04:05:15,930
Ooh,

8816
04:05:15,930 --> 04:05:16,310
Ooh,

8817
04:05:16,310 --> 04:05:17,650
but they didn't create the doors.

8818
04:05:17,920 --> 04:05:18,250
No,

8819
04:05:18,250 --> 04:05:19,430
what's your split?

8820
04:05:19,750 --> 04:05:20,650
But they did,

8821
04:05:20,680 --> 04:05:21,850
but they didn't mean to.

8822
04:05:21,880 --> 04:05:22,630
Here's the thing,

8823
04:05:22,630 --> 04:05:25,000
you can't engineer beautiful creativity.

8824
04:05:25,150 --> 04:05:26,920
Don't you love her badly?

8825
04:05:27,100 --> 04:05:27,933
You can't do that.

8826
04:05:28,030 --> 04:05:28,863
You can't do that

8827
04:05:31,330 --> 04:05:32,650
reg on through

8828
04:05:34,400 --> 04:05:35,233
that guy.

8829
04:05:36,790 --> 04:05:37,100
Eddie,

8830
04:05:37,100 --> 04:05:37,630
you are,

8831
04:05:37,630 --> 04:05:40,960
you're a brilliant creative guy and
one of the reasons why you're brilliant

8832
04:05:41,130 --> 04:05:41,560
creative,

8833
04:05:41,560 --> 04:05:43,060
thank you this because you,

8834
04:05:43,090 --> 04:05:44,980
you were repressed as a child.

8835
04:05:45,190 --> 04:05:48,520
You encountered a lot of stress
and bullshit and a lot of,

8836
04:05:48,521 --> 04:05:48,911
uh,

8837
04:05:48,911 --> 04:05:52,360
a lot of people that were
like counting against you.

8838
04:05:52,400 --> 04:05:52,630
Yeah.

8839
04:05:52,630 --> 04:05:57,220
They were rooting against you and you
figured out a way to rise through that and

8840
04:05:57,221 --> 04:06:00,190
figure your way through this
maze of life on your own.

8841
04:06:00,370 --> 04:06:04,720
And it's because of that pressure that
created this creativity in my opinion.

8842
04:06:04,750 --> 04:06:04,931
I mean,

8843
04:06:04,931 --> 04:06:05,520
I might be wrong,

8844
04:06:05,520 --> 04:06:06,730
liked the doors of Jujitsu,

8845
04:06:06,760 --> 04:06:07,570
but I think that's it.

8846
04:06:07,570 --> 04:06:09,460
This the same thing that
happens to a lot of guys,

8847
04:06:09,461 --> 04:06:11,890
whether it's Kurt Cobain
or Jimi Hendrix or,

8848
04:06:12,050 --> 04:06:13,060
or Jim Morrison,

8849
04:06:13,061 --> 04:06:14,160
I think you,

8850
04:06:14,180 --> 04:06:16,070
you deal with the wrong,

8851
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:17,330
you see the wrong thing.

8852
04:06:17,330 --> 04:06:22,220
You see a dad was an alcoholic or beats
his mom and this fucking chaos in the

8853
04:06:22,221 --> 04:06:27,020
house gets repossessed and you see all
the flaws of the people before you and

8854
04:06:27,021 --> 04:06:30,260
oftentimes the most together people are
the people that grew up with parents

8855
04:06:30,350 --> 04:06:32,030
that were in together
because they realize,

8856
04:06:32,031 --> 04:06:32,720
Whoa,

8857
04:06:32,720 --> 04:06:35,660
I got to realize what these people are
doing wrong and I've got to get it right

8858
04:06:35,661 --> 04:06:36,350
myself.

8859
04:06:36,350 --> 04:06:38,690
So when you see a guy like Jim Morrison,

8860
04:06:38,691 --> 04:06:43,370
is this like fucking brilliant
freak who came out of nowhere.

8861
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:45,590
If you really look at musical history.

8862
04:06:46,120 --> 04:06:46,440
Exactly.

8863
04:06:46,440 --> 04:06:47,300
This is what I'm saying.

8864
04:06:47,480 --> 04:06:51,890
If you look at musical history like the
1950s we're like the doorway to this

8865
04:06:51,891 --> 04:06:52,970
rock and roll thing.

8866
04:06:53,210 --> 04:06:56,870
Like Elvis came through and Cherry
Lee Lewis and there's trust,

8867
04:06:57,680 --> 04:07:00,680
but there's all this weird music came
through and then the Beatles and then

8868
04:07:00,681 --> 04:07:04,610
there was these rock motherfuckers
and there was all these drugs that are

8869
04:07:04,611 --> 04:07:08,360
involved and there's also the war and
everybody's trying to get the fuck in the

8870
04:07:08,361 --> 04:07:12,260
civil rights movement and the civil
rights people that and be able to vote in

8871
04:07:12,261 --> 04:07:14,780
1964 was when they were given
granted the right to vote.

8872
04:07:14,800 --> 04:07:19,800
So it has all 1964 it has all the
elements of of classic suppression and

8873
04:07:20,811 --> 04:07:23,720
Response to the suppression
creative outburst.

8874
04:07:23,780 --> 04:07:28,780
But isn't that creative outburst is one
of the most beautiful in like artistic

8875
04:07:29,120 --> 04:07:31,520
accomplishments of the human race.

8876
04:07:31,790 --> 04:07:34,280
If you look at the 1960s
look at the Beatles,

8877
04:07:34,460 --> 04:07:35,990
you look at the led Zepplin,

8878
04:07:36,020 --> 04:07:36,771
look at the doors,

8879
04:07:36,771 --> 04:07:41,420
look at the who look at the music of
the 60s look at Jefferson star ship.

8880
04:07:42,140 --> 04:07:43,160
Oh my God,

8881
04:07:43,161 --> 04:07:43,580
no one's,

8882
04:07:43,580 --> 04:07:47,060
no one's writing great music
depressants and it's not happening.

8883
04:07:47,300 --> 04:07:49,100
All I'm saying is I don't
know what the fuck's going on.

8884
04:07:49,101 --> 04:07:50,690
All I'm saying if it's true,

8885
04:07:50,750 --> 04:07:52,070
if it might not even be true,

8886
04:07:52,220 --> 04:07:57,220
if it's true that all those bands came
from Laurel Canyon and they were all kids

8887
04:07:57,530 --> 04:08:00,380
of air force intelligence officers,

8888
04:08:00,680 --> 04:08:01,700
that's fucking weird.

8889
04:08:01,760 --> 04:08:03,100
Maybe that's what they related on,

8890
04:08:03,680 --> 04:08:06,130
but you do understand
that they would ship,

8891
04:08:06,160 --> 04:08:07,970
the parents would be busy at work.

8892
04:08:08,090 --> 04:08:10,400
They don't even have time to spend
time with their fucking kids.

8893
04:08:10,690 --> 04:08:13,450
The kids eventually wind
up being drug out x.

8894
04:08:13,460 --> 04:08:14,031
They go to school,

8895
04:08:14,031 --> 04:08:14,870
they smoked cigarettes,

8896
04:08:14,871 --> 04:08:18,440
a hand with the cool kids and go hang
out by the fucking the auto shop and they

8897
04:08:18,441 --> 04:08:20,820
learn how to fix tires and none of them,

8898
04:08:22,880 --> 04:08:25,180
none of them got drafted without a doubt.

8899
04:08:25,400 --> 04:08:26,091
Without a doubt.

8900
04:08:26,091 --> 04:08:29,020
The parents would use their influence to
keep their children from being drafted.

8901
04:08:29,030 --> 04:08:29,300
Course,

8902
04:08:29,300 --> 04:08:30,860
it's happened throughout
throughout history,

8903
04:08:31,410 --> 04:08:32,420
dig train.

8904
04:08:32,440 --> 04:08:34,790
They become rock stars and coincidentally,

8905
04:08:35,000 --> 04:08:35,960
but Eddie Cox,

8906
04:08:36,740 --> 04:08:38,940
it's a coincidence that
you're assuming that,

8907
04:08:39,040 --> 04:08:41,450
but you're assuming you're assuming.

8908
04:08:41,451 --> 04:08:41,721
Yes.

8909
04:08:41,721 --> 04:08:42,381
All the bands.

8910
04:08:42,381 --> 04:08:42,710
Yes.

8911
04:08:42,710 --> 04:08:46,040
You're assuming the Muller
postures thing there all Friday,

8912
04:08:46,340 --> 04:08:46,671
Eddie.

8913
04:08:46,671 --> 04:08:49,160
Now you're assuming the
most preposterous thing.

8914
04:08:49,430 --> 04:08:54,430
You're assuming that the most creative
beautiful moment in music history,

8915
04:08:55,640 --> 04:08:59,120
arguably the 1960s that is
what is traded by retards.

8916
04:08:59,210 --> 04:09:00,530
So fucking stupid.

8917
04:09:00,531 --> 04:09:01,850
That got a job with the government.

8918
04:09:02,360 --> 04:09:03,193
Correct.

8919
04:09:03,320 --> 04:09:04,153
How dare you?

8920
04:09:04,270 --> 04:09:06,540
Shit so farfetched.

8921
04:09:06,940 --> 04:09:07,800
Weary Eddie.

8922
04:09:07,820 --> 04:09:10,240
It's obvious we're suppression and this.

8923
04:09:10,290 --> 04:09:13,560
Why don't you read but don't do not.

8924
04:09:13,561 --> 04:09:14,394
Do not,

8925
04:09:15,720 --> 04:09:17,170
do not recognize the pressure.

8926
04:09:17,220 --> 04:09:21,090
Air Force intelligence space making
propaganda films in Laurel Canyon.

8927
04:09:21,240 --> 04:09:22,110
All those bands.

8928
04:09:22,111 --> 04:09:23,430
You can name them all the doors,

8929
04:09:23,431 --> 04:09:24,031
the eagles,

8930
04:09:24,031 --> 04:09:24,870
Linda Ronstadt,

8931
04:09:24,871 --> 04:09:25,540
all of them.

8932
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:26,520
They were all kids.

8933
04:09:26,521 --> 04:09:27,360
Let me ask you this,

8934
04:09:27,361 --> 04:09:28,370
let me work there.

8935
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:29,730
What would be the benefit?

8936
04:09:30,540 --> 04:09:33,130
What would be the benefit
the government would have?

8937
04:09:33,131 --> 04:09:37,260
I'm making off awesome music like
the doors be besides being awesome.

8938
04:09:37,261 --> 04:09:37,860
I don't know.

8939
04:09:37,860 --> 04:09:38,251
I don't know.

8940
04:09:38,251 --> 04:09:39,084
You tell me.

8941
04:09:41,640 --> 04:09:43,020
The government doesn't
have a music department

8942
04:09:44,520 --> 04:09:44,851
since.

8943
04:09:44,851 --> 04:09:45,684
Father,

8944
04:09:47,370 --> 04:09:48,121
what about your dad?

8945
04:09:48,121 --> 04:09:48,960
What about my dad?

8946
04:09:48,961 --> 04:09:50,460
I didn't even tell and dude,

8947
04:09:51,020 --> 04:09:52,220
he didn't orchestrate that.

8948
04:09:52,320 --> 04:09:53,430
What I'm talking about,

8949
04:09:53,431 --> 04:09:54,181
that's what I'm talking about.

8950
04:09:54,181 --> 04:09:56,190
Both of us don't even talk to our dads.

8951
04:09:56,340 --> 04:09:59,010
Why the fuck would you assume that
Jim Marrs and talked to his dad?

8952
04:09:59,160 --> 04:10:01,680
I would assume that it's
such a bad motherfucker.

8953
04:10:01,780 --> 04:10:03,030
He was close to his fall.

8954
04:10:03,030 --> 04:10:03,451
Come on.

8955
04:10:03,451 --> 04:10:04,320
If you're close to your dad,

8956
04:10:04,321 --> 04:10:05,011
you don't do acid.

8957
04:10:05,011 --> 04:10:06,900
You don't pull your dick out
of Miami and get arrested.

8958
04:10:06,901 --> 04:10:08,670
So legit point guys is good dads.

8959
04:10:08,671 --> 04:10:09,320
Don't pull it.

8960
04:10:09,320 --> 04:10:09,921
That's that.

8961
04:10:09,921 --> 04:10:10,271
Sam,

8962
04:10:10,271 --> 04:10:11,104
you guys,

8963
04:10:12,000 --> 04:10:14,640
this podcast is out of fucking
control and these handlers,

8964
04:10:14,641 --> 04:10:17,280
how far on the whole 10
control and that's velvet

8965
04:10:18,810 --> 04:10:19,643
mule deer,

8966
04:10:19,880 --> 04:10:20,280
Rochelle,

8967
04:10:20,280 --> 04:10:22,020
the cuts or eyes fucking mule deer.

8968
04:10:22,021 --> 04:10:22,620
They're much,

8969
04:10:22,620 --> 04:10:22,990
hey,

8970
04:10:22,990 --> 04:10:23,680
are we going to,

8971
04:10:23,680 --> 04:10:25,690
we're going to shoot some
mule deer with Mongo.

8972
04:10:25,770 --> 04:10:28,650
You just no way you
were doing by that time.

8973
04:10:28,651 --> 04:10:30,650
Unless we get some serious practices.

8974
04:10:30,660 --> 04:10:30,961
Look at me.

8975
04:10:30,961 --> 04:10:32,710
I don't think you
understand this difficult.

8976
04:10:32,800 --> 04:10:34,050
It is target.

8977
04:10:34,080 --> 04:10:34,913
I'm getting my,

8978
04:10:35,850 --> 04:10:37,110
I'm getting my boat fixed.

8979
04:10:37,680 --> 04:10:38,341
I got to pay.

8980
04:10:38,341 --> 04:10:40,740
Did Not certainly did not have,

8981
04:10:40,770 --> 04:10:41,820
he's never even shot an arrow.

8982
04:10:41,970 --> 04:10:42,940
He came over my house once.

8983
04:10:42,941 --> 04:10:44,770
He couldn't pull my Boback bullshit.

8984
04:10:44,820 --> 04:10:45,653
I wasn't there.

8985
04:10:46,170 --> 04:10:47,003
You tell the truth.

8986
04:10:47,460 --> 04:10:48,293
What happened?

8987
04:10:49,200 --> 04:10:50,340
I had a fucking trick.

8988
04:10:50,341 --> 04:10:51,174
I have a trek shoulder.

8989
04:10:52,730 --> 04:10:53,563
His jet,

8990
04:10:53,720 --> 04:10:54,720
so he fuck.

8991
04:10:54,721 --> 04:10:55,391
Fuck that Nigga.

8992
04:10:55,391 --> 04:10:56,580
He hasn't got a 60 pounds.

8993
04:10:56,590 --> 04:10:58,440
Hasn't pull the bow back yet,

8994
04:10:58,890 --> 04:10:59,723
but we have to.

8995
04:11:00,840 --> 04:11:05,550
It's not ethical at this stage because
we're talking about going out in August

8996
04:11:05,551 --> 04:11:06,870
and right now it's almost June.

8997
04:11:08,650 --> 04:11:09,610
Cyber progressed.

8998
04:11:09,620 --> 04:11:12,570
You think you're killing cause you started
small with the little birds and shit.

8999
04:11:12,830 --> 04:11:16,050
Do you think you'll ever get to
that now you're a bears and shit.

9000
04:11:16,490 --> 04:11:17,323
I didn't know

9001
04:11:19,400 --> 04:11:22,740
the first wife killer where you don't
eat them and they're intelligent.

9002
04:11:23,070 --> 04:11:23,581
I don't want to eat.

9003
04:11:23,581 --> 04:11:24,870
Scars are very smart.

9004
04:11:24,900 --> 04:11:28,350
They're smart compared to what they know
to eat their babies because the baby's

9005
04:11:28,351 --> 04:11:29,680
going to come back to haunt them later.

9006
04:11:29,890 --> 04:11:30,723
That's awesome.

9007
04:11:32,750 --> 04:11:36,420
Intelligence Bro.

9008
04:11:36,440 --> 04:11:37,261
That's a vision,

9009
04:11:37,261 --> 04:11:39,960
that argument that's
like this motherfucker.

9010
04:11:39,990 --> 04:11:41,550
He's a little baby right now,

9011
04:11:41,700 --> 04:11:42,533
right now,

9012
04:11:42,540 --> 04:11:43,830
but he's going to grow up really quick.

9013
04:11:44,150 --> 04:11:44,461
Buck,

9014
04:11:44,461 --> 04:11:45,870
I'm going to try to fuck my shit up.

9015
04:11:46,050 --> 04:11:46,950
I better eating one of these,

9016
04:11:46,951 --> 04:11:48,030
a little baby after a,

9017
04:11:48,130 --> 04:11:49,720
you learn that in the wild.

9018
04:11:49,770 --> 04:11:51,780
That's the law of the fucking wilderness,

9019
04:11:51,810 --> 04:11:53,010
not why they kill each other.

9020
04:11:53,160 --> 04:11:56,070
They kill their babies because it brings
the female back into heat so they could

9021
04:11:56,071 --> 04:11:58,210
fuck them like that.

9022
04:11:58,520 --> 04:12:02,760
So what happens is the female have a cub
and then they'll go into their Dan and

9023
04:12:02,761 --> 04:12:03,594
they'll hibernate and their,

9024
04:12:03,760 --> 04:12:06,360
and they come out in the
spring and the mail be horny.

9025
04:12:06,361 --> 04:12:08,190
But the females like
I already have babies.

9026
04:12:08,191 --> 04:12:09,000
Fuck you.

9027
04:12:09,000 --> 04:12:10,760
And then so the male eats the typical not,

9028
04:12:11,180 --> 04:12:11,640
yeah,

9029
04:12:11,640 --> 04:12:12,430
it's

9030
04:12:12,430 --> 04:12:13,510
the same old shit.

9031
04:12:14,430 --> 04:12:15,251
This species,

9032
04:12:15,251 --> 04:12:15,911
the species.

9033
04:12:15,911 --> 04:12:16,900
It's the same shit.

9034
04:12:17,470 --> 04:12:18,510
He got crazy at all.

9035
04:12:23,800 --> 04:12:25,360
I got to pee.

9036
04:12:25,361 --> 04:12:25,691
Hold on.

9037
04:12:25,691 --> 04:12:27,940
You guys talked about
this for the first time.

9038
04:12:27,941 --> 04:12:29,460
I've bet four hours,

9039
04:12:29,700 --> 04:12:30,533
man.

9040
04:12:31,470 --> 04:12:35,620
24 20 Oh my God.

9041
04:12:35,740 --> 04:12:38,330
My wife's going to kill me
20 minutes as a podcast.

9042
04:12:39,210 --> 04:12:39,500
Kate,

9043
04:12:39,500 --> 04:12:40,630
someone keep the podcast.

9044
04:12:41,560 --> 04:12:42,520
Let me just some doors here.

9045
04:12:42,521 --> 04:12:43,770
Okay then gentlemen,

9046
04:12:43,840 --> 04:12:44,673
Jim Morrison,

9047
04:12:46,770 --> 04:12:51,650
texting [inaudible] bad ass.

9048
04:12:51,670 --> 04:12:55,420
You want to do some of your how
you want to be a fucking warrior?

9049
04:12:55,421 --> 04:12:56,830
Show me Eddie.

9050
04:12:57,090 --> 04:12:57,310
Eddie,

9051
04:12:57,310 --> 04:12:57,840
right here.

9052
04:12:57,840 --> 04:12:58,631
You want to be a warrior?

9053
04:12:58,631 --> 04:13:00,880
Tell me how bad you want
to be a fucking warrior.

9054
04:13:00,940 --> 04:13:01,990
Tell me how bad you want it.

9055
04:13:02,110 --> 04:13:02,870
You want it bad?

9056
04:13:02,870 --> 04:13:06,790
I fucking practice psychic until
I started coming off the ground.

9057
04:13:07,010 --> 04:13:07,140
I,

9058
04:13:07,140 --> 04:13:07,830
that's what I heard.

9059
04:13:07,830 --> 04:13:08,010
Yeah.

9060
04:13:08,010 --> 04:13:09,280
Cause that's where can I be honest?

9061
04:13:09,320 --> 04:13:10,180
I'm not trying to be a dick.

9062
04:13:10,210 --> 04:13:12,340
My Jab to practice my jab,

9063
04:13:12,341 --> 04:13:13,510
I catch birds out of the air.

9064
04:13:13,570 --> 04:13:14,880
I know it sounds weird by her.

9065
04:13:14,920 --> 04:13:15,440
Hey,

9066
04:13:15,440 --> 04:13:16,780
I hate to be a dick.

9067
04:13:16,781 --> 04:13:21,781
But the other day Brian was telling me
how he thinks the whole nine 11 things

9068
04:13:22,541 --> 04:13:24,280
just you think you're full of shit.

9069
04:13:24,340 --> 04:13:25,151
Of course he's on that.

9070
04:13:25,151 --> 04:13:26,230
Sarah said he's on that side.

9071
04:13:26,231 --> 04:13:27,150
I love Eddie like you know,

9072
04:13:27,850 --> 04:13:28,450
no matter,

9073
04:13:28,450 --> 04:13:28,991
no matter what,

9074
04:13:28,991 --> 04:13:31,290
I'm getting so much that I
never argued matter what he's,

9075
04:13:31,291 --> 04:13:32,124
he's your donors

9076
04:13:34,190 --> 04:13:35,350
because I like any too much.

9077
04:13:35,351 --> 04:13:37,470
I don't argue about how many
times I've said it on our podcast.

9078
04:13:37,471 --> 04:13:38,050
I go,

9079
04:13:38,050 --> 04:13:40,150
I even when he goes into his,

9080
04:13:40,360 --> 04:13:40,540
no,

9081
04:13:40,540 --> 04:13:41,570
because I liked him too much.

9082
04:13:43,480 --> 04:13:46,060
I would love to believe that government
and everything that I say to I would

9083
04:13:46,061 --> 04:13:46,450
fucking,

9084
04:13:46,450 --> 04:13:47,283
no,

9085
04:13:47,970 --> 04:13:48,120
no,

9086
04:13:48,120 --> 04:13:48,300
no.

9087
04:13:48,300 --> 04:13:49,133
I'm talking about Brian.

9088
04:13:49,150 --> 04:13:49,983
He believes everything inside.

9089
04:13:50,090 --> 04:13:50,801
So no,

9090
04:13:50,801 --> 04:13:51,634
I don't think he does.

9091
04:13:52,080 --> 04:13:54,730
Why he doesn't believe
everything the government says.

9092
04:13:54,731 --> 04:13:56,760
Tell me one big incident.

9093
04:13:56,770 --> 04:13:58,030
Once that he doesn't trust them.

9094
04:13:58,210 --> 04:13:58,421
No,

9095
04:13:58,421 --> 04:14:01,060
he totally does because he trusts
everything about nine 11 and there's holes

9096
04:14:01,061 --> 04:14:01,690
everywhere.

9097
04:14:01,690 --> 04:14:05,350
So if you trust watching
tower seven completely free,

9098
04:14:05,351 --> 04:14:08,920
fall on video from five different
angles and you believe the government,

9099
04:14:08,921 --> 04:14:10,690
eight years later when I
finally came out and they said,

9100
04:14:10,860 --> 04:14:11,210
oh,

9101
04:14:11,210 --> 04:14:12,070
it got too hot,

9102
04:14:12,740 --> 04:14:13,780
you believe that Shit,

9103
04:14:14,200 --> 04:14:15,040
you're on that side.

9104
04:14:15,041 --> 04:14:15,840
There's nothing.

9105
04:14:15,840 --> 04:14:16,240
There's,

9106
04:14:16,240 --> 04:14:17,620
that's the litmus test.

9107
04:14:17,650 --> 04:14:19,300
There's nothing you
could say to those guys.

9108
04:14:19,450 --> 04:14:21,270
Nothing I give up as soon as that's the,

9109
04:14:21,340 --> 04:14:22,780
that's why I go to tower seven I go,

9110
04:14:22,781 --> 04:14:25,900
do you believe tower seven collapse
at free fall speed because it got hot.

9111
04:14:26,350 --> 04:14:27,161
If they say yes,

9112
04:14:27,161 --> 04:14:27,994
then I'm done.

9113
04:14:28,060 --> 04:14:28,480
I'm done.

9114
04:14:28,480 --> 04:14:29,291
Well does that to me?

9115
04:14:29,291 --> 04:14:30,350
He believes all gum.

9116
04:14:30,370 --> 04:14:30,880
No that,

9117
04:14:30,880 --> 04:14:31,090
no,

9118
04:14:31,090 --> 04:14:31,321
no,

9119
04:14:31,321 --> 04:14:31,481
no.

9120
04:14:31,481 --> 04:14:33,100
If you believe that that's the worst one.

9121
04:14:33,190 --> 04:14:34,030
It's on video.

9122
04:14:34,031 --> 04:14:35,230
Five different angles.

9123
04:14:35,410 --> 04:14:40,410
There's many on video demolition
experts looking at this and saying,

9124
04:14:41,440 --> 04:14:42,273
hey,

9125
04:14:42,870 --> 04:14:44,160
experts that don't agree with that.

9126
04:14:44,710 --> 04:14:46,850
You don't have any video American sizing.

9127
04:14:47,470 --> 04:14:48,281
Amazing.

9128
04:14:48,281 --> 04:14:50,680
There's no amazing debunking
all of your theories.

9129
04:14:50,930 --> 04:14:51,763
Okay,

9130
04:14:51,870 --> 04:14:54,850
so you believe tower southern collapsed
at free fall speed because it got too

9131
04:14:54,851 --> 04:14:55,150
hot.

9132
04:14:55,150 --> 04:14:56,140
I don't know anything about,

9133
04:14:56,410 --> 04:14:58,060
I know nothing about that stuff.

9134
04:14:59,150 --> 04:14:59,983
When they ask,

9135
04:15:00,130 --> 04:15:00,921
when do you know what?

9136
04:15:00,921 --> 04:15:01,270
Let me,

9137
04:15:01,270 --> 04:15:02,680
let me educate you a little bit.

9138
04:15:02,920 --> 04:15:04,840
When they had a press conference,

9139
04:15:05,270 --> 04:15:06,670
a press conference with Nist,

9140
04:15:06,790 --> 04:15:08,740
the National Institute of
Standards and technology,

9141
04:15:08,890 --> 04:15:10,750
they're the ones that came out
and explained what happened.

9142
04:15:10,780 --> 04:15:11,390
Tower something.

9143
04:15:11,390 --> 04:15:12,880
When they asked them widened.

9144
04:15:13,060 --> 04:15:14,450
Did you guys check for explosive

9145
04:15:16,000 --> 04:15:16,833
exclusives?

9146
04:15:17,030 --> 04:15:17,930
It's really simple.

9147
04:15:18,080 --> 04:15:19,010
It's like kindergarten shit.

9148
04:15:19,011 --> 04:15:20,570
When they asked the head of kindergarten,

9149
04:15:20,571 --> 04:15:22,910
why didn't you check for explosives?

9150
04:15:22,970 --> 04:15:25,280
Why didn't you test for
explosives on tower seven?

9151
04:15:25,460 --> 04:15:27,160
They said there was no reason to.

9152
04:15:27,170 --> 04:15:28,560
There was no ties to any hunches.

9153
04:15:28,650 --> 04:15:29,750
There was no witnesses.

9154
04:15:29,780 --> 04:15:30,590
Meanwhile,

9155
04:15:30,590 --> 04:15:32,720
there's about an hour of witnesses,

9156
04:15:32,780 --> 04:15:33,321
firemen,

9157
04:15:33,321 --> 04:15:33,760
policemen,

9158
04:15:33,760 --> 04:15:35,030
insane bombs went off.

9159
04:15:35,180 --> 04:15:35,580
Bumps.

9160
04:15:35,580 --> 04:15:36,080
Well,

9161
04:15:36,080 --> 04:15:37,920
there's video of Brian's going up.

9162
04:15:38,060 --> 04:15:39,950
Bombs went up and the guy said,

9163
04:15:40,280 --> 04:15:44,990
we didn't check for bombs
because there was no witness.

9164
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:46,050
What about that ceremony?

9165
04:15:47,090 --> 04:15:47,923
Who flew those planes?

9166
04:15:50,990 --> 04:15:51,501
Nothing.

9167
04:15:51,501 --> 04:15:53,260
Anybody can say it was remote control.

9168
04:15:54,240 --> 04:15:55,520
I can say to you,

9169
04:15:55,780 --> 04:15:56,240
you,

9170
04:15:56,240 --> 04:16:00,650
there's nothing I can say I provide
a complete video evidence for you.

9171
04:16:00,800 --> 04:16:02,150
I broke it down for you,

9172
04:16:02,370 --> 04:16:04,310
but you're still saying you're still,

9173
04:16:04,480 --> 04:16:05,530
it's still not enough.

9174
04:16:05,531 --> 04:16:06,140
How much?

9175
04:16:06,140 --> 04:16:07,300
Nothing I can say.

9176
04:16:08,900 --> 04:16:09,860
I haven't said anything.

9177
04:16:11,550 --> 04:16:12,383
Well,

9178
04:16:13,150 --> 04:16:14,130
let me play devil's advocate.

9179
04:16:14,900 --> 04:16:15,733
He's fucking

9180
04:16:17,330 --> 04:16:18,163
momentarily.

9181
04:16:18,320 --> 04:16:18,920
Um,

9182
04:16:18,920 --> 04:16:22,670
when you look at tower 70 clearly
looks like you can control demolition,

9183
04:16:22,700 --> 04:16:23,090
right?

9184
04:16:23,090 --> 04:16:24,350
It looks like the way it implodes,

9185
04:16:24,360 --> 04:16:27,680
and I seen it so long because it
looks like a controlled demolition.

9186
04:16:27,830 --> 04:16:32,830
Is it possible that you could get a
diesel fire in a building where the fuel

9187
04:16:32,901 --> 04:16:37,901
burns so hot that it fucks up all of the
supporting beams to this building and

9188
04:16:38,031 --> 04:16:40,370
it all just gives out and
impossible takes on each other.

9189
04:16:40,400 --> 04:16:40,650
That's an,

9190
04:16:40,650 --> 04:16:41,980
I'm not a structural engineer,

9191
04:16:41,990 --> 04:16:43,660
so that's what I'm saying.

9192
04:16:43,670 --> 04:16:44,990
I don't understand what happens.

9193
04:16:44,991 --> 04:16:49,790
There's 100,000 architects and engineers
in the association and one by one it

9194
04:16:49,791 --> 04:16:52,580
was like 200 then it
was 1,530 2000 that no,

9195
04:16:52,581 --> 04:16:52,701
no,

9196
04:16:52,701 --> 04:16:53,130
it's true.

9197
04:16:53,130 --> 04:16:54,890
It's not that you're simply wrong.

9198
04:16:55,180 --> 04:16:56,013
Hold on.

9199
04:16:58,040 --> 04:17:00,530
Fires made the building do that fire.

9200
04:17:00,531 --> 04:17:01,364
I don't know,

9201
04:17:03,910 --> 04:17:07,340
but maybe you don't trust the government.

9202
04:17:07,400 --> 04:17:09,220
You think the government blame me,

9203
04:17:09,320 --> 04:17:09,980
but,

9204
04:17:09,980 --> 04:17:12,320
but you don't think that's fucking fishy.

9205
04:17:12,430 --> 04:17:13,850
A detective would be all over that.

9206
04:17:13,851 --> 04:17:16,440
Like a fuck like flies
on schematize something.

9207
04:17:16,470 --> 04:17:17,600
If that was my building,

9208
04:17:17,601 --> 04:17:19,100
I bought my fucking money back.

9209
04:17:19,940 --> 04:17:20,220
Shit,

9210
04:17:20,220 --> 04:17:21,053
crump,

9211
04:17:21,720 --> 04:17:23,090
there's some kind of hypnosis.

9212
04:17:24,870 --> 04:17:25,710
Who's fluid?

9213
04:17:26,600 --> 04:17:26,880
No,

9214
04:17:26,880 --> 04:17:27,030
no,

9215
04:17:27,030 --> 04:17:27,863
no.

9216
04:17:30,280 --> 04:17:31,390
We're not talking about that.

9217
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:32,330
Nope.

9218
04:17:32,330 --> 04:17:33,770
That was three that went down.

9219
04:17:33,980 --> 04:17:37,640
But the third one was reported on because
they knew the majority of the people

9220
04:17:37,880 --> 04:17:41,260
like you real smart would not even let go.

9221
04:17:41,270 --> 04:17:43,060
He said real smart after
you just shit on you.

9222
04:17:43,070 --> 04:17:43,903
This shit on you.

9223
04:17:44,390 --> 04:17:46,010
Eddie is swaying the fuck out of me.

9224
04:17:48,230 --> 04:17:48,621
Kissing.

9225
04:17:48,621 --> 04:17:48,891
Listen,

9226
04:17:48,891 --> 04:17:50,300
three buildings went down,

9227
04:17:50,930 --> 04:17:52,550
two of them got hit by a plane.

9228
04:17:52,670 --> 04:17:53,600
One didn't.

9229
04:17:53,960 --> 04:17:57,650
I detective would be so all over at
lawyers would be all over that shit.

9230
04:17:58,400 --> 04:18:00,020
And you don't trust the government.

9231
04:18:00,080 --> 04:18:02,060
You believe that government are criminals,

9232
04:18:02,180 --> 04:18:03,920
but yet you've got their back on this

9233
04:18:05,940 --> 04:18:08,930
than the tower dropping it.

9234
04:18:09,070 --> 04:18:10,980
Paul says there's a problem.

9235
04:18:10,981 --> 04:18:11,371
I know.

9236
04:18:11,371 --> 04:18:12,091
Is that possible?

9237
04:18:12,091 --> 04:18:12,451
But Eddie,

9238
04:18:12,451 --> 04:18:12,961
here's the problem.

9239
04:18:12,961 --> 04:18:15,180
None of us really understand
structural engineering.

9240
04:18:15,220 --> 04:18:18,000
But understand what happened here.

9241
04:18:18,060 --> 04:18:18,271
None.

9242
04:18:18,271 --> 04:18:18,781
Exactly,

9243
04:18:18,781 --> 04:18:21,150
but when you hear guys that do one by one,

9244
04:18:21,170 --> 04:18:22,003
not all of them.

9245
04:18:22,060 --> 04:18:27,060
[inaudible] scientific American
was scientific American architect,

9246
04:18:27,510 --> 04:18:28,343
their own,

9247
04:18:28,740 --> 04:18:29,700
they're all bought off.

9248
04:18:29,701 --> 04:18:30,031
Dude.

9249
04:18:30,031 --> 04:18:31,720
If you just look at scientific Americans,

9250
04:18:31,740 --> 04:18:34,170
but when you look at what's going on,

9251
04:18:34,280 --> 04:18:36,220
like when people look at
what trends are going on,

9252
04:18:36,240 --> 04:18:37,680
this is the trend that's going on.

9253
04:18:37,830 --> 04:18:42,830
The trim is that there's
100,000 architects and
engineers in the association and

9254
04:18:42,991 --> 04:18:45,480
bit by bit it's growing and
growing because you know what?

9255
04:18:45,630 --> 04:18:46,140
The Guy,

9256
04:18:46,140 --> 04:18:47,920
that's the head of all that.

9257
04:18:48,200 --> 04:18:52,340
He's sitting down you saying there's
100,000 architects and engineers and died

9258
04:18:52,360 --> 04:18:56,090
11 in some some clubs,

9259
04:18:56,091 --> 04:18:58,770
association of architects and engineers.

9260
04:18:59,310 --> 04:19:01,500
There's a national association.

9261
04:19:01,501 --> 04:19:05,690
There's a 2,500 there's 100,000
of them will and 2,500 plus.

9262
04:19:05,700 --> 04:19:05,810
No,

9263
04:19:05,810 --> 04:19:05,990
no,

9264
04:19:05,990 --> 04:19:06,170
no,

9265
04:19:06,170 --> 04:19:07,360
there's not.

9266
04:19:07,440 --> 04:19:07,730
No,

9267
04:19:07,730 --> 04:19:07,890
no,

9268
04:19:07,890 --> 04:19:08,040
no.

9269
04:19:08,040 --> 04:19:08,820
That's different.

9270
04:19:08,820 --> 04:19:11,100
100,000 in the whole association,

9271
04:19:11,190 --> 04:19:12,900
not including that 11
they don't give a fuck.

9272
04:19:12,901 --> 04:19:13,171
I know.

9273
04:19:13,171 --> 04:19:18,171
I'm saying 2,500 think is because Joe
and I take a piss and I was lost that

9274
04:19:20,341 --> 04:19:21,174
Brendan,

9275
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:23,873
Brendan,

9276
04:19:24,210 --> 04:19:25,950
Brendan thing.

9277
04:19:26,070 --> 04:19:27,870
It's the same thing that we
were talking about before.

9278
04:19:27,990 --> 04:19:28,800
It's the same thing.

9279
04:19:28,800 --> 04:19:29,940
It's the same thing and everything.

9280
04:19:29,941 --> 04:19:30,810
It's exact same thing.

9281
04:19:30,990 --> 04:19:32,280
There's two ways you
could look at it like,

9282
04:19:32,400 --> 04:19:33,030
Hey,

9283
04:19:33,030 --> 04:19:34,170
let me ask some questions.

9284
04:19:34,260 --> 04:19:39,000
Out of the hundred thousand did these
2,500 km from the hundred thousand being

9285
04:19:39,001 --> 04:19:44,001
shown the evidence and only 2,500
believe it or we're only 2,500 shown.

9286
04:19:45,180 --> 04:19:46,320
Does that make a difference?

9287
04:19:46,410 --> 04:19:47,470
Does that make a difference in your,

9288
04:19:47,560 --> 04:19:49,250
in you whether you jumped?

9289
04:19:49,350 --> 04:19:50,310
Of course it does.

9290
04:19:50,490 --> 04:19:53,520
So the reality is the hundred
thousand don't even know.

9291
04:19:53,580 --> 04:19:55,710
Most of them don't even
know three towers went down.

9292
04:19:55,890 --> 04:19:56,730
These are architects,

9293
04:19:56,731 --> 04:19:57,131
engineers,

9294
04:19:57,131 --> 04:19:58,080
that tends to look into it.

9295
04:19:58,240 --> 04:19:59,280
So one by one,

9296
04:19:59,420 --> 04:20:02,700
one by one that it's growing and
growing because 50 at a time,

9297
04:20:02,701 --> 04:20:03,900
they're getting 15 at a time.

9298
04:20:04,080 --> 04:20:05,520
They're showing them the
evidence of it going,

9299
04:20:05,690 --> 04:20:06,540
Holy Shit.

9300
04:20:06,870 --> 04:20:08,130
Mother fuckers were brought down.

9301
04:20:08,280 --> 04:20:09,210
That's what's going on.

9302
04:20:09,211 --> 04:20:10,550
But it's like what we're talking about,

9303
04:20:10,560 --> 04:20:12,000
what going steady it shot,

9304
04:20:12,001 --> 04:20:12,570
what's going on.

9305
04:20:12,570 --> 04:20:12,690
He,

9306
04:20:12,690 --> 04:20:14,640
anybody examining the
evidence is gonna know.

9307
04:20:14,641 --> 04:20:15,810
Three towers went down.

9308
04:20:15,840 --> 04:20:17,940
Everybody knows three times
when people don't know.

9309
04:20:17,941 --> 04:20:21,600
Three towers went down now got
talking about the do architects,

9310
04:20:21,610 --> 04:20:22,440
engineers,

9311
04:20:22,440 --> 04:20:25,410
you don't think the
predominant group of art,

9312
04:20:25,560 --> 04:20:27,690
if you looked at a million
architects and engineers,

9313
04:20:27,691 --> 04:20:32,691
you don't think that like 999,999
would fucking know that tower seven was

9314
04:20:35,281 --> 04:20:36,840
brought down with tower one and tower to,

9315
04:20:36,870 --> 04:20:38,340
can I talk just because

9316
04:20:40,450 --> 04:20:43,710
it's like I just cannot go.

9317
04:20:43,860 --> 04:20:44,580
Oh my gosh.

9318
04:20:44,580 --> 04:20:45,413
Just because,

9319
04:20:46,630 --> 04:20:47,200
yeah,

9320
04:20:47,200 --> 04:20:50,810
just because you're an architect and an
engineer and you're registered nothing

9321
04:20:51,250 --> 04:20:53,190
and you're registered in the association.

9322
04:20:53,610 --> 04:20:57,930
Just because you're an architect and
an or an engineer and on and you're

9323
04:20:57,931 --> 04:20:59,340
registered in the association,

9324
04:20:59,450 --> 04:21:02,370
does it mean you have extra,

9325
04:21:02,430 --> 04:21:05,100
you're privy to extras knowledge,

9326
04:21:05,130 --> 04:21:05,320
right?

9327
04:21:05,320 --> 04:21:06,010
On nine one

9328
04:21:06,010 --> 04:21:07,780
one because the overall,

9329
04:21:07,840 --> 04:21:12,010
the overall knowledge of nine
11 is most people don't know.

9330
04:21:12,011 --> 04:21:13,660
Three towers went down.

9331
04:21:13,900 --> 04:21:14,980
That's an actual effect.

9332
04:21:15,010 --> 04:21:17,920
So these agree at he's architects
and engineers don't even know,

9333
04:21:17,950 --> 04:21:19,060
but when they get to sit down,

9334
04:21:19,120 --> 04:21:20,830
all of them 100% when it gets into,

9335
04:21:20,831 --> 04:21:22,240
I know the guy had them on my pocket.

9336
04:21:22,390 --> 04:21:23,470
He's the head of all this shit.

9337
04:21:23,650 --> 04:21:24,610
Every one of them goes,

9338
04:21:24,820 --> 04:21:25,653
oh shit.

9339
04:21:25,840 --> 04:21:27,120
We've been hunting edict.

9340
04:21:27,280 --> 04:21:28,480
That's what's going on.

9341
04:21:28,780 --> 04:21:30,040
11 not 11

9342
04:21:31,960 --> 04:21:34,060
you saw tower seven go down with that,

9343
04:21:34,120 --> 04:21:34,960
but hold on a second.

9344
04:21:35,270 --> 04:21:40,270
Architects and the engineers don't know
about tower seven but you do know of

9345
04:21:41,801 --> 04:21:42,251
course,

9346
04:21:42,251 --> 04:21:44,050
because they didn't look
into their normal people.

9347
04:21:44,470 --> 04:21:46,240
They do think just because
you're an architect,

9348
04:21:46,241 --> 04:21:46,661
an engineer,

9349
04:21:46,661 --> 04:21:47,220
you're going to get,

9350
04:21:47,220 --> 04:21:48,340
you're going to get an email,

9351
04:21:48,580 --> 04:21:50,050
you're going to get an email.

9352
04:21:50,110 --> 04:21:51,600
Most people don't know.

9353
04:21:51,640 --> 04:21:52,241
Even today,

9354
04:21:52,241 --> 04:21:53,380
I don't even know about three times.

9355
04:21:55,260 --> 04:21:56,650
You're going to get an email.

9356
04:21:56,710 --> 04:21:57,610
They're not researching it.

9357
04:21:57,611 --> 04:22:00,220
The ones that did contact or an engineer,

9358
04:22:00,221 --> 04:22:04,120
and you've passed through some sort of
architectural course and you assume,

9359
04:22:04,150 --> 04:22:08,800
I assume you got some sort of a master's
degree in engineering and someone asks

9360
04:22:08,801 --> 04:22:13,801
you to commentate on one of the most
historic attacks in human civilization.

9361
04:22:14,590 --> 04:22:15,520
After some research,

9362
04:22:15,550 --> 04:22:16,480
you're going to do some research,

9363
04:22:16,840 --> 04:22:18,940
but you're going to look at
all the different buildings,

9364
04:22:19,700 --> 04:22:24,700
100% talking about Eddie 100% if you ask
them to examine what happened at tower

9365
04:22:25,271 --> 04:22:28,180
seven they're going to look at tower seven
if you think they're going to talk to

9366
04:22:28,181 --> 04:22:31,720
them about nine 11 and not bring
up tower seven that's crazy.

9367
04:22:31,990 --> 04:22:32,823
That's like,

9368
04:22:35,140 --> 04:22:37,810
that's like covered is up any,

9369
04:22:37,880 --> 04:22:38,770
nobody's covering it up.

9370
04:22:38,771 --> 04:22:40,820
You don't get to that level
eight without research,

9371
04:22:41,230 --> 04:22:41,580
right?

9372
04:22:41,580 --> 04:22:42,710
Not any.

9373
04:22:42,870 --> 04:22:43,630
It's not,

9374
04:22:43,630 --> 04:22:44,740
it's not covering up.

9375
04:22:44,770 --> 04:22:46,660
It's just there's so
much going on that day.

9376
04:22:46,661 --> 04:22:50,700
The tower seven seemed less important
and because of the media to tower one and

9377
04:22:50,710 --> 04:22:51,543
two,

9378
04:22:51,550 --> 04:22:53,180
which were both hit by plane,

9379
04:22:53,890 --> 04:22:55,390
but whatever it was,

9380
04:22:55,420 --> 04:22:56,253
it didn't.

9381
04:22:56,290 --> 04:23:00,610
Whether it was an intentional cover up
tower seven or it was a cover up because

9382
04:23:00,880 --> 04:23:02,020
there was so much hoopla.

9383
04:23:02,170 --> 04:23:04,900
Most people don't know
this is what's going on.

9384
04:23:04,901 --> 04:23:07,060
So what Richard Gauges,

9385
04:23:07,720 --> 04:23:08,240
Jed.

9386
04:23:08,240 --> 04:23:08,471
Eddie,

9387
04:23:08,471 --> 04:23:10,060
why don't you think that
architects don't know?

9388
04:23:11,470 --> 04:23:13,060
Why would you think that
engineers don't know that?

9389
04:23:16,420 --> 04:23:16,871
We don't know.

9390
04:23:16,871 --> 04:23:17,321
You don't know?

9391
04:23:17,321 --> 04:23:17,651
I don't know.

9392
04:23:17,651 --> 04:23:19,630
But what we do know is sit down.

9393
04:23:19,720 --> 04:23:20,290
They say,

9394
04:23:20,290 --> 04:23:21,080
Oh shit,

9395
04:23:21,080 --> 04:23:21,913
I didn't know.

9396
04:23:22,240 --> 04:23:22,800
Maybe.

9397
04:23:22,800 --> 04:23:23,633
Oh Eddie,

9398
04:23:23,650 --> 04:23:24,483
calm.

9399
04:23:24,810 --> 04:23:25,511
Come on man.

9400
04:23:25,511 --> 04:23:26,141
That's not true.

9401
04:23:26,141 --> 04:23:26,651
You don't know that.

9402
04:23:26,651 --> 04:23:27,484
That's

9403
04:23:28,690 --> 04:23:29,800
crazy about this.

9404
04:23:29,801 --> 04:23:31,030
You're getting so emotional.

9405
04:23:31,320 --> 04:23:34,090
We were not involved in this like
it's not a part of our lives.

9406
04:23:34,660 --> 04:23:36,850
And you don't know what
they knew before they look.

9407
04:23:36,851 --> 04:23:37,240
You want to,

9408
04:23:37,240 --> 04:23:40,260
you want to think the tower seven
collapse because they got hot to you

9409
04:23:43,030 --> 04:23:44,660
want what I want.

9410
04:23:44,760 --> 04:23:45,340
I don't know what.

9411
04:23:45,340 --> 04:23:48,310
I don't want to make a conclusion
without having any facts.

9412
04:23:48,730 --> 04:23:52,420
What I look at tower seven Heti not true.

9413
04:23:52,421 --> 04:23:55,780
It looks like your control
can be used in court.

9414
04:23:55,960 --> 04:23:59,560
There's plenty of expert testimonials and
that kind of shit can be used in court

9415
04:23:59,561 --> 04:24:00,370
to prove a case.

9416
04:24:00,370 --> 04:24:05,060
And there's plenty of expert testimonial
on video by nine 11 but you know

9417
04:24:05,061 --> 04:24:08,260
there's also expert testimonial
that the diesel fuel from the

9418
04:24:09,770 --> 04:24:10,431
basement.

9419
04:24:10,431 --> 04:24:11,264
Show me that

9420
04:24:13,340 --> 04:24:13,940
there isn't.

9421
04:24:13,940 --> 04:24:15,370
Well show him a townie.

9422
04:24:15,440 --> 04:24:15,831
Many.

9423
04:24:15,831 --> 04:24:20,831
And how many architects medialink
afternoon telling you anything you can

9424
04:24:25,130 --> 04:24:25,963
send you links.

9425
04:24:26,280 --> 04:24:26,661
Come on,

9426
04:24:26,661 --> 04:24:27,560
crush your shit.

9427
04:24:30,830 --> 04:24:32,570
You're talking about some
links that don't exist.

9428
04:24:34,240 --> 04:24:37,180
You're talking about is
looking right at you.

9429
04:24:39,340 --> 04:24:40,173
Yes.

9430
04:24:41,460 --> 04:24:46,430
He's pointing right at
Chavez Chavez and of mouth

9431
04:24:47,990 --> 04:24:48,600
shop.

9432
04:24:48,600 --> 04:24:49,433
They try to educate.

9433
04:24:49,440 --> 04:24:53,450
You probably think that 11 was committed
by motivated Islamic fundamentalist.

9434
04:24:53,451 --> 04:24:55,850
We should take this time to
address all the nerds out there,

9435
04:24:55,860 --> 04:24:57,140
the feel disenfranchised,

9436
04:24:57,160 --> 04:24:58,680
but all this violent testosterone.

9437
04:25:00,230 --> 04:25:01,063
We love you too.

9438
04:25:01,070 --> 04:25:01,903
We all love each other.

9439
04:25:01,910 --> 04:25:02,580
We love everybody.

9440
04:25:02,580 --> 04:25:04,210
And you didn't say a word and uh,

9441
04:25:04,310 --> 04:25:05,510
Brian dogging this.

9442
04:25:05,511 --> 04:25:06,740
Brian has some thoughts on this.

9443
04:25:07,790 --> 04:25:12,790
I'll just wrap it up for let's say it's
amazing that Eddie has an inside scoop

9444
04:25:13,401 --> 04:25:16,790
when every major publication
from the Guardian,

9445
04:25:19,430 --> 04:25:23,290
from the York Times The New York Times to,

9446
04:25:23,820 --> 04:25:26,660
to Lawrence Wright or won a Pulitzer Prize
winning book called the looming tower

9447
04:25:26,661 --> 04:25:30,140
that actually trace don't
his fucking quote people to,

9448
04:25:30,240 --> 04:25:30,860
to,

9449
04:25:30,860 --> 04:25:31,400
to,

9450
04:25:31,400 --> 04:25:32,510
I mean Time magazine,

9451
04:25:32,511 --> 04:25:33,344
Newsweek.

9452
04:25:33,430 --> 04:25:33,830
Uh,

9453
04:25:33,830 --> 04:25:34,221
I mean,

9454
04:25:34,221 --> 04:25:38,060
they've all been bought off by the
Illuminati or the government and Eddie's

9455
04:25:38,150 --> 04:25:40,160
youtube and his,

9456
04:25:40,190 --> 04:25:45,190
his inside inside scoop has the
truth and all the rest of us are.

9457
04:25:49,260 --> 04:25:52,160
I want to thank Eddie for being who
the fuck he is because he's a national

9458
04:25:52,161 --> 04:25:54,140
treasure and I fucking love the guy.

9459
04:25:56,170 --> 04:25:56,961
I love Ed.

9460
04:25:56,961 --> 04:25:57,794
He's a good person.

9461
04:25:58,190 --> 04:25:59,660
As a good my fucking,

9462
04:25:59,750 --> 04:26:00,730
I want a fee.

9463
04:26:00,860 --> 04:26:03,130
Jack says I want to get on that call,

9464
04:26:03,140 --> 04:26:04,070
but I agree.

9465
04:26:05,780 --> 04:26:08,310
Please let me in this
little petty you what?

9466
04:26:08,360 --> 04:26:09,260
I don't like the government.

9467
04:26:09,261 --> 04:26:12,530
You'll get them to stop
talking over each year,

9468
04:26:13,010 --> 04:26:16,910
the Illuminati one of these days and I'm
going to make a false flag directly for

9469
04:26:16,911 --> 04:26:18,860
Warner brothers and you're
going to believe all that shit.

9470
04:26:18,920 --> 04:26:19,753
I want it.

9471
04:26:21,310 --> 04:26:22,470
That's definitely going to happen.

9472
04:26:22,471 --> 04:26:23,690
I'm glad we're talking about it.

9473
04:26:24,410 --> 04:26:25,850
That's totally not a waste of time.

9474
04:26:25,851 --> 04:26:26,060
No,

9475
04:26:26,060 --> 04:26:26,561
not at all.

9476
04:26:26,561 --> 04:26:27,261
We make it happen.

9477
04:26:27,261 --> 04:26:30,620
Watch Eddie Bravo is a national
treasure and they have it in my head.

9478
04:26:30,680 --> 04:26:32,870
I just want you to not give
the government so much credit.

9479
04:26:32,871 --> 04:26:34,830
They're not that
organized was also a real,

9480
04:26:34,831 --> 04:26:35,664
that one

9481
04:26:37,440 --> 04:26:40,850
they couldn't do as a real benefit to
not getting emotional and yelling about

9482
04:26:40,851 --> 04:26:42,350
things that you're not exactly sure about.

9483
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:43,920
And when we talk about some client,

9484
04:26:45,030 --> 04:26:47,510
what's the better approach
to step back and go,

9485
04:26:47,690 --> 04:26:49,420
what are the possibilities to the,

9486
04:26:49,460 --> 04:26:54,460
how much do I have invested in one
particular argument that I've already like

9487
04:26:54,651 --> 04:26:57,650
the old chairs and I go to tower seven
is cause that's the most obvious one.

9488
04:26:57,730 --> 04:26:58,563
That's the snap.

9489
04:27:00,440 --> 04:27:02,250
It's fucking curious for sure.

9490
04:27:02,251 --> 04:27:04,400
But it's not obvious you need a,

9491
04:27:04,410 --> 04:27:08,130
you need a new nor I as an
architect or an engineer.

9492
04:27:08,160 --> 04:27:12,450
But it's obviously it looks
like a controlled demolition
is not obvious why it

9493
04:27:12,451 --> 04:27:13,284
fell a bar.

9494
04:27:13,830 --> 04:27:15,180
Shuri is not an expert.

9495
04:27:15,181 --> 04:27:20,181
So when a jury sits in and they
listened to expert testimony research

9496
04:27:22,790 --> 04:27:25,480
and I was talking to you,

9497
04:27:25,600 --> 04:27:28,260
you know there's people out
there to beat believe crazy shit,

9498
04:27:28,950 --> 04:27:29,783
right?

9499
04:27:32,060 --> 04:27:34,560
Like lipstick converting and
you know what I'm talking about.

9500
04:27:34,590 --> 04:27:35,820
Have you ever listened to people,

9501
04:27:35,980 --> 04:27:37,290
you don't need this shit.

9502
04:27:37,590 --> 04:27:38,423
Come on man.

9503
04:27:38,780 --> 04:27:43,780
I ride the middle of a fucking 47 tower
of 47 story fucking skyscraper collapses

9504
04:27:44,821 --> 04:27:47,910
a free fall speed and you're going to
believe fire fucking did that shit.

9505
04:27:47,970 --> 04:27:48,803
Is the earth flat?

9506
04:27:49,950 --> 04:27:50,730
No,

9507
04:27:50,730 --> 04:27:51,780
it's fucking round.

9508
04:27:51,781 --> 04:27:52,800
Is it like a pair?

9509
04:27:52,830 --> 04:27:53,250
Right?

9510
04:27:53,250 --> 04:27:53,820
We should have what?

9511
04:27:53,820 --> 04:27:54,990
Tyson Muckross he says,

9512
04:27:56,580 --> 04:27:57,940
God Damn Daddy

9513
04:28:00,010 --> 04:28:01,710
Grassy was the pitch.

9514
04:28:02,360 --> 04:28:03,250
Is the Russell,

9515
04:28:03,360 --> 04:28:05,020
is there a flat lays and gentlemen,

9516
04:28:05,610 --> 04:28:07,290
there's no evidence
that the earth is flat.

9517
04:28:07,410 --> 04:28:07,951
But you know what?

9518
04:28:07,951 --> 04:28:10,080
There is evidence is there's pure,

9519
04:28:10,170 --> 04:28:15,170
there's evidence all over the place
that NASA is posting Cgi pictures of it.

9520
04:28:15,480 --> 04:28:17,320
[inaudible] come on.

9521
04:28:18,130 --> 04:28:19,650
[inaudible]

9522
04:28:20,230 --> 04:28:21,570
came to Thrones is on tonight

9523
04:28:23,190 --> 04:28:24,040
is round.

9524
04:28:26,280 --> 04:28:26,580
No,

9525
04:28:26,580 --> 04:28:26,701
no,

9526
04:28:26,701 --> 04:28:27,534
I'm not done.

9527
04:28:29,190 --> 04:28:29,771
I'm talking about that.

9528
04:28:29,771 --> 04:28:34,170
But NASA Sherlyn they have
a snapchat account and uh,

9529
04:28:34,320 --> 04:28:35,250
just like girls,

9530
04:28:35,400 --> 04:28:36,860
Joe Rogan's flat earth tonight,

9531
04:28:36,890 --> 04:28:39,480
please don't you just hook them up.

9532
04:28:39,500 --> 04:28:40,201
You don't look,

9533
04:28:40,201 --> 04:28:41,700
that guy never said the earth is flat.

9534
04:28:42,650 --> 04:28:44,310
It's not flat.

9535
04:28:44,400 --> 04:28:46,500
If people are mad at me
for saying it's not flat,

9536
04:28:46,501 --> 04:28:46,891
really.

9537
04:28:46,891 --> 04:28:49,320
Bj Penn apparently
thinks the earth is flat.

9538
04:28:49,380 --> 04:28:50,180
Oh,

9539
04:28:50,180 --> 04:28:50,800
TNC.

9540
04:28:50,800 --> 04:28:52,860
Tila Tequila retweeted her the other day,

9541
04:28:52,861 --> 04:28:54,560
thinks the earth is flat.

9542
04:28:55,080 --> 04:28:56,030
She's so spoiled.

9543
04:28:56,310 --> 04:28:57,143
I love Tila.

9544
04:28:57,480 --> 04:28:58,510
Fuck man.

9545
04:28:58,511 --> 04:28:59,520
She was like a fun gap.

9546
04:29:00,220 --> 04:29:02,520
A lot of people think it is flat.

9547
04:29:02,740 --> 04:29:03,320
Hey listen,

9548
04:29:03,320 --> 04:29:04,330
I don't know what you're feeling.

9549
04:29:04,340 --> 04:29:06,810
You can't be my friend and do
you believe we went to the moon?

9550
04:29:08,420 --> 04:29:09,940
Do you believe we went to the [inaudible]?

9551
04:29:09,960 --> 04:29:10,620
Of course you do.

9552
04:29:10,620 --> 04:29:12,840
Do you believe we went to
the moon six times and back?

9553
04:29:13,140 --> 04:29:13,471
He goes,

9554
04:29:13,471 --> 04:29:14,910
of course we did.

9555
04:29:15,750 --> 04:29:16,160
You don't know.

9556
04:29:16,160 --> 04:29:16,993
You're on the fence.

9557
04:29:17,010 --> 04:29:17,910
He's from Ohio.

9558
04:29:18,030 --> 04:29:19,410
You don't know for sure.

9559
04:29:19,411 --> 04:29:20,610
We went in for sure.

9560
04:29:20,611 --> 04:29:23,370
We for sure went to the
moon was on the stage.

9561
04:29:23,570 --> 04:29:24,860
I am not going to debate it.

9562
04:29:24,870 --> 04:29:27,390
I just want to know what
you guys got your research.

9563
04:29:27,480 --> 04:29:28,210
Listen man,

9564
04:29:28,210 --> 04:29:28,620
he's,

9565
04:29:28,620 --> 04:29:32,880
here's 100 that shit I don't believe for
one motherfucking second we went to the

9566
04:29:32,881 --> 04:29:33,714
fucking moon.

9567
04:29:33,800 --> 04:29:37,290
Six God damn times and back
and we can't do it now.

9568
04:29:37,410 --> 04:29:38,091
We can't do it.

9569
04:29:38,091 --> 04:29:39,100
We can do it now.

9570
04:29:39,650 --> 04:29:40,350
Says we can do.

9571
04:29:40,350 --> 04:29:42,300
We got to figure out how
to get through the van.

9572
04:29:42,301 --> 04:29:44,330
Allen radiation now.

9573
04:29:44,340 --> 04:29:45,060
That's what they said.

9574
04:29:45,060 --> 04:29:45,930
They're on record.

9575
04:29:45,931 --> 04:29:46,764
There's videos of it.

9576
04:29:46,800 --> 04:29:49,050
They're on record saying that now
they're going to get two videos.

9577
04:29:49,051 --> 04:29:49,501
Brian,

9578
04:29:49,501 --> 04:29:50,580
we're going to get to the moon.

9579
04:29:50,910 --> 04:29:53,550
As soon as I talked to her
house around three things,

9580
04:29:53,670 --> 04:29:54,181
three things.

9581
04:29:54,181 --> 04:29:54,750
They've got to figure it out.

9582
04:29:54,750 --> 04:29:55,710
They've already said it.

9583
04:29:55,711 --> 04:29:56,544
They were already admitted.

9584
04:29:56,590 --> 04:29:58,020
They've got to figure out
how to get to the van.

9585
04:29:58,021 --> 04:29:59,130
Allen radiation belts.

9586
04:29:59,410 --> 04:30:01,210
They admitted that once
they figured that out,

9587
04:30:01,270 --> 04:30:02,640
then they can have a man mission to them.

9588
04:30:02,680 --> 04:30:02,860
Like,

9589
04:30:02,860 --> 04:30:03,311
wait a minute.

9590
04:30:03,311 --> 04:30:06,940
Do we go six times and
conditions change conditions.

9591
04:30:09,190 --> 04:30:09,521
Okay,

9592
04:30:09,521 --> 04:30:10,090
beautiful,

9593
04:30:10,090 --> 04:30:10,540
beautiful.

9594
04:30:10,540 --> 04:30:11,260
And then the next,

9595
04:30:11,260 --> 04:30:12,430
the next thing they said,

9596
04:30:12,580 --> 04:30:16,990
they got to figure out the right uniform
took to handle that kind of radiation.

9597
04:30:17,140 --> 04:30:19,360
They haven't figured out
the right space soon.

9598
04:30:20,770 --> 04:30:21,640
Right back today,

9599
04:30:23,780 --> 04:30:26,690
because I never said that from Brendan

9600
04:30:29,950 --> 04:30:30,783
[inaudible]

9601
04:30:33,500 --> 04:30:34,380
in this room.

9602
04:30:34,540 --> 04:30:35,620
I love everybody in this room.

9603
04:30:35,760 --> 04:30:36,490
Please say goodnight.

9604
04:30:36,490 --> 04:30:37,510
We're wrapping this bitch up.

9605
04:30:39,940 --> 04:30:42,190
Congratulations so smoothly.

9606
04:30:42,370 --> 04:30:44,500
Unlike every other government agency,

9607
04:30:44,710 --> 04:30:46,270
you guys got this shit down.

9608
04:30:46,400 --> 04:30:47,150
You'll figure it out.

9609
04:30:47,150 --> 04:30:49,180
We had manipulated media.

9610
04:30:49,750 --> 04:30:52,240
You figured out a way how
to create Jim Morrison,

9611
04:30:52,241 --> 04:30:54,880
who's obviously one of the
greatest musicians of all time.

9612
04:30:55,060 --> 04:30:58,790
He's done an amazing job and
congratulations on tower seven

9613
04:31:00,670 --> 04:31:01,930
fell like butter.

9614
04:31:02,050 --> 04:31:03,310
You guys are wizards.

9615
04:31:03,830 --> 04:31:04,531
That's not odd,

9616
04:31:04,531 --> 04:31:05,364
motherfucker.

9617
04:31:05,530 --> 04:31:06,670
There's a way.

9618
04:31:07,030 --> 04:31:08,530
There's a way and whatever,

9619
04:31:08,650 --> 04:31:09,670
whatever way that is,

9620
04:31:09,671 --> 04:31:10,504
you guys,

9621
04:31:10,640 --> 04:31:11,473
you got it.

9622
04:31:13,080 --> 04:31:13,960
I'll do all that shit.

9623
04:31:13,961 --> 04:31:15,280
I was in the speed metal.
