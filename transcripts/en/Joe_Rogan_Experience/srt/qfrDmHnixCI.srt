1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,463
Wow.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,570
We're live. Good googly Mowgli. Jeff Ross,

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,830
push that fucker up to your face and
say hello to the world. Hello world.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,970
Are you taking off the, you know, know
headphones or you grab all your Rabel.

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,510
You don't give a fuck. You look
great. You look great as well.

6
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,370
Fellow black belt in Tae Kwon.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,250
I saw a picture of you
and you're a little kid.

8
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,810
Somebody posted it up on my message board.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,990
He wouldn't be like the youngest black
belt in New Jersey or something crazy

10
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:36,580
like that. Yeah. Second. Yup. Second
in the country. He fucking savage.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,480
You were dropping some, uh, some
knowledge about all of this. Uh, we,

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,510
we started the podcast up quick. Look
at that. Look at that fucking wow.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,140
That's bad ass little kid. I never knew
that. I'm a 10 and a half in that picture.

14
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:50,530
Right. Chop and pitches. Am I
still a blackbelt Joe? Technically,

15
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,430
if it doesn't fit around my waist anymore,
you are s you have earned it.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,400
Whether or not you were at black
belt level or not, that's debatable.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,240
But you have earned your black
belt so you are a black belt.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,340
It's like the marine. I love that.
Once you go black, you never go back.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,840
Um, we were talking, we started the
podcast up abruptly because, uh,

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:13,810
we were talking about, um, how do
you, wait, one question for you.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,820
How do you think being a black
belt is affected your comedy? My,

22
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:21,100
I don't, I don't know. None. Not at all.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,550
I don't think I would have the confidence
to talk shit if I didn't get a black

24
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:29,530
belt early on. Really? Yeah. It probably
helps something come on of course. Sure.

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,840
And that way out about it.
Well definitely helps.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,490
Like you not be worried
about confrontation as much?
Well, at least. Yeah. Oh,

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,290
for sure. Like having that, uh, what do
they have around Israel? Cone of silence?

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,170
No, the uh, the Dome,

29
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:48,730
something they have a dome is
like a defense system. Oh, I see.

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,900
Right, right, right. So you
have a defense system in place.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,890
It might be a little rusty and a
little, you know, in need of some tuna,

32
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,700
but it's there. Well, anybody
that would, most of the time,

33
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,000
anybody that would hackle you
or think about attacking you,

34
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,340
usually they're so fucking stupid.

35
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,520
Like the vast majority of
hecklers are so God damn dumb.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,250
But I've been around so many
people that can kick my ass.

37
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:15,250
I'm don't feel very confident
it'll work in for the UFC.

38
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,390
I'm just constant around people
that could just fuck me up anytime.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
I've just don't feel very confident.
I like with regular people maybe,

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,990
but to some to humbled by my job
with a bunch of fighters. Yeah.

41
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,290
What have you been doing with them? Joe?
Daddy Stevenson. Yeah. Joe Stevenson

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,030
Mentor and like fighting
coach for the show kingdom

43
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,520
MMA fighters and underground scene.
That's a direct TV show, right?

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,250
[inaudible] on that
towns on it. Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,580
That's cool that directv is doing
their own programming. It's nice.

46
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,070
It's like there's so many different
avenues for programming now.

47
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:49,000
It's pretty fucking bad.

48
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,470
Make show and then they show the show and
now it's on iTunes and I'm on the next

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,330
season. It's a cool thing because it's
fun to see the fight world get dramatized.

50
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,740
It's like Friday lights

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,590
for uh, for fights. Right. Are there good
scenes though? Like very aggressive. Yeah,

52
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:08,110
of course. As a fan you're going to,
fans would roll their eyes and go,

53
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,530
how realistic could be,
I've only been to one fight.

54
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,370
It was the one you and Ari invited me to.
Which one was that?

55
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,990
You mean Coover few years back
and a have to think of who was,

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,050
might've been turned. That sounds like,
I think it was Jon Jones, was it John?

57
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,740
John Kerry, John Jones and
Gustafson. Was that Vancouver?

58
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,650
My jaw was dropping at the
blood. It's crazy. Never been.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,650
So now these fight scenes
we should at night.

60
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:37,210
So it's very realistic and
it's surprisingly authentic.

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,130
It's all real fighters and boxers
fighting the actors on this show.

62
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:46,330
Nick Jonas music superstar.
When the Jones brothers on the show,

63
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,640
not one of the Jonas brothers,

64
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,490
like the guy who's got the number one
music career right now is also playing a

65
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:56,110
fighter and he's a total bad ass. And I
know it sounds crazy, but he's ripped.

66
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,330
He's in these scenes for six,
seven hours a night, two,

67
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,760
three nights in a row shooting these,
just the fight scenes.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,900
Then the next day or all day he's got
to do like actual dramatic acting.

69
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:11,950
But the files are really well
done. They're, they're raw.

70
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,540
People get hurt. There's a lot of real
blood mixed with the acting blood.

71
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:21,460
You know right here. Look at his
fucking Stud. I'm telling you man,

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,630
I was so impressed.

73
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,830
Looks like Tj Walberger I play a sleazy
promoter that hires him even though he's

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,370
uh, out of medical leave from
fighting. It's a handsome bastard.

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,990
Does he actually know martial arts?

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,680
He is very believable as a fighter.

77
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:39,610
Like some of the fighters said he's as
good. Joe Daddy actually told me this.

78
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,480
I don't know if I'm supposed to,

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,380
but he thinks he's as good as some of
the fighters that they have come train

80
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:48,130
them. Really? That if he was fighting,
he would beat this guy for real.

81
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,870
Like he was doing the senior of the night.
And that's what Joe Daddy,

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,040
that gay scene right there,
right there that's going on right there.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,350
That looks like,
I dunno what's going on,

84
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,730
whatever. By the time they get
under hooks to fight him off,

85
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,690
get that right under hook. It's a very
intense show. There's a lot of tears.

86
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,270
And is that a drugs and fucking,

87
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,630
are those tattoos on his arm or is he
just like really in a tape? What is,

88
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,630
what is that? As soon as thing bro, like
duct tape up before I leave my house,

89
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:23,810
Bro. I think he's taped up.
It's a bad technique, right?

90
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:26,570
They're getting a little upset
about being naked. Choke technique.

91
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,210
What's he doing with his right hand?
Why isn't it behind the guy's head?

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,810
You are not watching a sanction
clip from the show. I'm watching.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,330
This is what I do when I'm fucking,

94
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,230
I think you're watching this John Long
wash to start questioning your sexuality.

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,800
Alan,
you catch have done that,

96
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,020
but I don't quite sync the choke in.

97
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,230
You've started fuck staring at Nick
Jonas getting choked out for almost three

98
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:56,240
minutes now. Hypnotize. It's like one
of those fucking clocks. Tick Tock,

99
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,800
tick tock.
Hamu

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,530
I'm getting so if you
ever been hypnotized, no,

101
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,220
I got hypnotized reasonably for the first
time ever. Was very interesting. Yeah.

102
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,100
This guy who uh, Vinny shoreman,
it's been on the podcast,

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,240
he hypnotize a lot of fighters,
da. He's like kind of a mind coach,

104
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,560
knows a lot about like uh,
how to uh,

105
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,000
eliminate barriers that
people have set up.

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,420
I could send them to you buddy
kicked this fucking cigarette habit,

107
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,920
get you on the road to recovery.
But um,

108
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,070
it's very interesting because when you
get hypnotized you're aware of what's

109
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,330
going on.
You're totally aware,

110
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:32,960
but you are definitely in some sort of
fucking weird dreamland. Very strange.

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,990
Where you completely sober? 100%.
Yeah. 100% sober sitting on the couch.

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,240
Was it just the adventure where
you're trying to cure something? Why?

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,330
I'm curious cause I wanted to know what,

114
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,960
cause I know a lot of fighters have
used it and had very good results.

115
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,330
Like it's alleviated a
lot of anxiety with them,

116
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,600
giving them a lot of confidence and
they've attributed to a lot of their

117
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,830
positive performances. It's not foolproof.
Better man always wins every time,

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,161
you know.

119
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,950
And sometimes fighters who don't have
a mind coach will still beat fires that

120
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:04,580
have a mind coach.
But I think all things said,

121
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,280
if you add all the different things
that a fighter has to be aware of,

122
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,340
you have to be in shape. You have to
know your techniques, you have to be,

123
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,560
you know,
motivated.

124
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,430
It's a lot of stuff going on in a
fighter's head that it has to be lined up

125
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,520
properly and a mind coach,
not a bad idea.

126
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,850
Having someone who can hypnotize you
and give you a tenants to live by and

127
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,720
pathways that you could
follow that are positive.

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,320
I think that's fucking super
important for, for anybody,
for fighters, for anybody.

129
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
So I just wanted to try it.

130
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,320
I wanted to see when I see if what
it does for fighting can actually,

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,720
you'll actually do for stand up.
Did you trust this guy?

132
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,850
Did you notice hypnotists?

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,400
Like he didn't pay any crazy things
that you make chicken noises, but no,

134
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,790
no. It was just, uh, I mean
I wasn't, it wasn't like, you
know, take your pants off.

135
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,190
Suck my deck. It wasn't
like Addie. No, I know.

136
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,500
It wasn't because I was awake
the whole time like you're awake.

137
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,440
It's a weird feeling man.
It's like you're, you're,

138
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,690
you're listening to him but it's almost
like you're in a room and he's coming in

139
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:09,770
over a loudspeaker and your, your eyes
are closed. That's what it feels like.

140
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,300
It's very strange. Very
strange there. Anything you
can compare it to? Is it yoga?

141
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,500
Is it like, no, it's
like a little bit like a,

142
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,140
something that might happen in a sensory
deprivation tank because it seems like

143
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:25,700
you go into this weird alternate state
and that's a sort of how he describes it,

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,351
that you're,

145
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:29,930
you're actually entering into an alternate
state of consciousness and like I'm a

146
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,330
different mind state. Very,
very interesting stuff.

147
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,080
I was always curious because you
ever seen a r rated hypnotist?

148
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,810
The guys that are really good, you ever
see Frank Santos wasn't, he was on,

149
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,260
I remember him in Boston. Yes.
She's the best. Who's the best?

150
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,790
That guy can seem creepy to me.

151
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Like he had the hottest wife imaginable
and he looked like a frog and he knocked

152
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,880
it out of the park.
Who's a great guy though.

153
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,310
I just kept looking at her trying to
think of whatever the that say the code

154
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,840
word was,
snap her out of it.

155
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,490
Just tickles randomly Graham crackers just
to see what she's like, why don't you,

156
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,290
I'm married to who? Wait, wait.

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,260
I was at a corporate
party. What happened? No,

158
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,170
I'm married to a hypnotist.

159
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,190
He would have guys come in their
parents all the time. He would a,

160
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,840
this is back when Madonna was hot.

161
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,710
It was like the 1980s and
he had some guy and he,

162
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:28,560
the guy was like doing pushups
on stage and he told them,

163
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,370
now Madonna's underneath you and she's
naked and you're having sex with her and

164
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,070
you could see the guy literally thank,

165
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:39,630
he was having sex with Madonna
and he would come, Jesus,
are you going to go back,

166
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,350
have more suicides like sessions
and like tried to do it again.

167
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,720
I would definitely do it again.
The hypnotizing thing,

168
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,500
I think I would do it again.
Vinnie lives in England,

169
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,780
so he's only a here occasionally.
But uh,

170
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,020
if I found someone that was good
that was in this area, I would do it.

171
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,070
I think there's something videotape
it though. Right? So creeped out.

172
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,550
I'm not scared. Yeah, I'd
be her scope. That shit.

173
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,170
At least I have to suck your Dick.

174
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,150
Blotching did it from their phones and
their car fall asleep at the wheel and

175
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,980
drive out in the trap. But they all
fall asleep along with me. Wait,

176
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,820
why haven't, why hasn't it like a TV
show? If hypnotism does exist or like,

177
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:20,130
and it's true, why hasn't a
TV should done that? Like,

178
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,760
like have like a 15 minute opening where
they just hypnotize everyone that's

179
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,830
watching it. It's good. Yeah.
Actually you should do it.

180
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,760
That's how the Jonestown massacre started.

181
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,660
You know what?
Skype hypnotizing is a way a cult.

182
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,310
You could get a group of
people to sacrifice to a crime.

183
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,480
He does stuff over Skype.
There's probably laws,

184
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:45,481
there should be anti hypnotism laws
for more than small groups of people.

185
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,550
I don't know if it works like that.
What if Hitler was just a hypnotist,

186
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,490
that those big crowds, he's like, fuck it.

187
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,350
Don't you think that when you're staying,

188
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,130
you're onstage and you're killing when
you're locked in? Don't you think?

189
00:10:57,131 --> 00:11:00,760
That's kind of a sense, like sort of
a massive gnosis and a lot of ways,

190
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,060
don't you feel like that? Like that?
I never thought about it that way,

191
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:04,930
but I could see that.

192
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,170
You know how like when you're in the
middle of your material and you're locked

193
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,640
in,
you're tuned into the audience,

194
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:12,670
the audience is tuned in to you and
they're kind of thinking like you're

195
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,310
thinking.
I feel that way when I watched somebody,

196
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,980
if I watch somebody really good, so I'm
like, I'll watch bird the other night.

197
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:22,030
He was hilarious. And I feel like
when you watch someone is really good,

198
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,380
you're tuning in to what they do. Like
you're, you're, you're in their head,

199
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,340
like they're in your head, I guess more.
And you're like, you're just kind of a,

200
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,090
like an empty vessel and your brain
is filled up with their ideas.

201
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,000
And when someone's captivating,
especially like d as the other,

202
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:40,150
I had this fucking Cosby
bit that was killing me,

203
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,900
fucking killing me.
And when he's doing it,

204
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,290
you're thinking the way he thinks.
Like your eyes are open,

205
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,700
you're anticipating
what he's going to say.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,950
You don't have any room in
your head for anything else.

207
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,700
Like you're thinking the way he's
thinking. Got, he's inside your head.

208
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,970
He's hypnotizing entire crowd.
He's taking you for a ride.

209
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,060
Even if you didn't believe weren't
with them. Now you are. Yeah.

210
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:02,260
He's taking you for a ride.

211
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,490
He's taking you for a ride and a lot of
ways he's on the same ride. You know?

212
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,670
I always feel that way too. Like a
lot of ways, I've always said this,

213
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,230
that when I'm at my best,

214
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:15,590
I'm as much of a passenger
as I am a driver, you know,

215
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,570
I kind of have to make the turns and
steer the car and figure out which way the

216
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,460
bits are going to go.
But when I'm locked in,

217
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:25,450
I feel like I'm just riding it like it's,
I just have to get out of my own way.

218
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,080
You know?
Until you feel like that

219
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,160
I can understand being on a role and
not thinking how's this going or what

220
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:32,771
should I do?

221
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:37,270
Just talking your as if you're talking
to your buddy in the back seat of your

222
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,104
car.

223
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,630
Well especially your style too
because you like to fuck with people.

224
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,810
Right and so when you're fucking with
people you're coming out of nowhere.

225
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:47,120
I mean you just pulling
them out of the universe.

226
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,063
Yeah.

227
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,630
I remember hearing once how important
there was an article a long time ago,

228
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,230
maybe it was in a book about late
night hosts and you have to listen.

229
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,400
Just as soon as I stopped trying to
think of jokes and just started to listen

230
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,670
and trust that whatever I said
would be entertaining in some way.

231
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,830
Eventually if I just stay in it and
just listen to the other person. If,

232
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,590
if a funny character is presented
in front of me, if someone's boring,

233
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:18,820
you might have to try to write a
joke on the spot and your head,

234
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:22,780
but if they're an interesting person you
could just talk to them and eventually

235
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,060
it's going to land on something funny.

236
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,010
Yeah, that is a problem with some comics
is that they're so in their own head.

237
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,390
They don't listen to the
person they're talking.

238
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,660
I had a lady on stage in Chicago and
so speed roasting the crowd and Gosh,

239
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,630
she was like a really round person with
a crazy yellow Mohawk way over the top.

240
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,010
And she was tiny little thing
but built like a little mailbox,

241
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,320
the big mouth, just a funny,
funny body. And she came on,

242
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,520
just threw herself up on stage one
or to be roasted. And I was like,

243
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:04,110
uh, you said a lot of, a lot of people,

244
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,270
I think I said a lot of people couldn't
pull off that outfit and you're two of

245
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,460
them.
I don't know what the Shit,

246
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:14,940
I'm relearning a crime with a fond memory.

247
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,930
He came to you out of nowhere.
Uh, I got to remember the joke.

248
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,500
We came to you and they're like,
yeah, you're just listening and boom.

249
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:26,700
That's the home run that people remember
because it wasn't thought about ahead

250
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:30,150
of time was just listening to the looking.
And you know,

251
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,840
when you're roasting people listening is
also looking like taking a good look at

252
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,510
assessing exactly what's
been put in front of you.

253
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,220
Do you,
uh,

254
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,010
when you were doing the prison thing and
you talked to the guy and you said you

255
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,800
look at a combination of a
child and a child molester.

256
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,310
Yeah, yeah. They're rare
personal click a child,

257
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:51,290
not a child molester at the
same time. And he did, you know,

258
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,000
it wasn't like Fidel. He
did. Yeah. Nailed it there.

259
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:58,610
I just say try to say out loud what
people normally would say behind people's

260
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,120
backs.
Hence the karate self defense.

261
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,160
I do remember early instances of hecklers
before I knew anything about roasting.

262
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,790
I was just a comedian, you know,
usually emceeing, uh, you know,

263
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,650
on the road or a jersey,
you know,

264
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:17,510
or you had a lot of characters
and in the audience.

265
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:22,511
And I remember a few times people taking
swings at me or just walking on stage.

266
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,640
I was working with rich vos
at a firehouse. You know,

267
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:29,960
I'd only been doing comedy a year or
two and I opened for him at some sort of

268
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:33,720
fundraiser to firehouse.
And Ah,

269
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,730
I was about five minutes into
my routine Saturday night.

270
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,200
These firemen are in their firehouse.
There's, this is, you know,

271
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,620
this is before there were any rules
to anything as far as you know,

272
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,430
uh, and just, just, they kept telling
me, make fun of Larry, make fun of Larry.

273
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,050
He loves it. Make Fun of Larry and I
don't know who Larry is and you know,

274
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,050
of course Larry turned out to be the
biggest asshole on the planet who doesn't

275
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:00,950
love it at all.

276
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,600
And he literally was gigantic and walked
up on stage and took the microphone out

277
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,300
of my hand, put it in the mic
stand and said, you're done.

278
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,770
Wow.
The audience laughing before that.

279
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,620
I don't remember. I'm sure they
weren't laughing enough. You know,

280
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,290
I just remember it being so
hard and it just builds up your,

281
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,810
you have to have thick skin and
you got to be able to like stare.

282
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,910
You got to have confidence that you
know, you're, you're in the right.

283
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,820
Well, you definitely would get
a little bit more confidence.

284
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:38,090
Haven't gone through martial arts cause
you've, you've done some difficult stuff.

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,220
Been involved with a
little bit of conflict.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,090
I mean I did karate
tournament as a kid and

287
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,890
it's like you never feel more
alive than when you're competing.

288
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,460
And I love when comedy
has a little tension to,

289
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,110
it doesn't have to be
all about what I think.

290
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:59,111
I sometimes I remember getting it as
heckling became more and more pro in the

291
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,540
audiences. You just more and more
you heard people heckling and uh,

292
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,710
there were famous instances of hecklers
and audiences and stuff like that and I

293
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:13,160
said, fuck it. People are going to
videotape to shows. It's so annoying.

294
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,600
Why don't I just go one step further
and put the audience on stage? Well, I,

295
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,030
so that's when he started speed roasting,
interactive.

296
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,440
I wanted my show to be more interactive
and I, I'm still partially like that,

297
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,730
but I think the audience is a big part of
the experience now. We'll also for you,

298
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,430
because that's your, it's
your style. Like, you know,

299
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:36,140
maybe that wouldn't work for some guys,
but you it just fits. Yeah. So you do it.

300
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,230
Yeah. And I grew up at a catering
hall. I like talking to people.

301
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:43,850
I like knowing why they're at my show
and [inaudible]. Yeah. My grandparents,

302
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:47,930
my uncles, my cousins. Me. So you
just always around people. Uh,

303
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,890
food people.

304
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,710
He dancer tons with stars.
You were telling me that you got your,

305
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,110
I fucked up and dance with the star.

306
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,130
Had a scratched cornea on
the last rehearsal on the
first day of the live show

307
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:04,050
and went to the hospital and
danced. Anyway, it was just,

308
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,260
I got the lowest scores since,
since,

309
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,830
I dunno know Larry Flynt wheelchair
flipped over and season two.

310
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,740
So you just couldn't see. Oh, you had
an eye patch while you were doing.

311
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,790
Wow. Do Lucky. You'll fucking
look pretty thin there. Yeah.

312
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,800
Well there's a lot of way doing that
show. I lost about 20 pounds. Yeah.

313
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,190
How much is your ego away the year he
goes off five pounds for sloths. That too.

314
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,780
But I look good. That's editor.
She's awesome. Yeah. You.

315
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,170
You have to practice every day
for that shit. I practiced.

316
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,470
I was in the best shape of my
life. Yeah, I did a all day.

317
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,640
I did a dancing scene with Leslie
Bibb in the movie zookeeper.

318
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,480
We had to do this fucking crazy dancing
scene, so we had to take dancing lessons.

319
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,310
It's hard. It's fucking hard to do.
And here's the thing, I don't like it.

320
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,800
I love it. I didn't want to do it. Do you
pull it out? The roast battle? We have a,

321
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,010
no, I don't want to do already on the back
bar. Really at the comedy store. Dance,

322
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,890
dance, dance like 30 people to me. Why is
it 150 degrees in here? Any reason? Maybe.

323
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:11,350
Let's see if there was an ac things
work. It's hot as fuck in here, isn't it?

324
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:15,900
I do the whip. I'm sweating
too. Then ne Ne. What does
that, it's a new dance craze.

325
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,410
Oh, whip and the DNA name.
Do you know what it means?

326
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,830
It means when you break your leg and you
had a cast on and you take off the cast

327
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:26,720
and it stinked like the stinky leg.
So what it means. The kid had it here.

328
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,220
All the kids are going crazy. You ever
heard of stinky leg? What do you do?

329
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,090
You not even on the mic and
you're not making any sense.

330
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:36,180
Go put the AC on and come back and we're
formulate your thoughts while you're

331
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,014
out there.

332
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,960
That's Brian two hits and that's what
happens to hits and he forget. He just,

333
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,440
he just doesn't make sense to anybody but
him to him. It's totally making sense.

334
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,090
It's just so fun. Thanks buddy.
Nice studio. Glad to be on the show.

335
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,030
It's comfortable, right?
First Time. Finally Dude,

336
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,450
I've been asking You keep saying no.
Well you know,

337
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm just happy to be here. I'm happy
to have you here man. I get to see you.

338
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:07,290
We've been friends a long
time. Long fucking time. Back
before you were Jeff Ross.

339
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,160
That's right. I knew you would do
different numb diploma. Lift Schultz. Yes.

340
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,930
Back Up. What made you change it
to Ross? It's enough. Enough. Well,

341
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,550
technically Ross. Well Ross is my middle
name and I'm still Jeff. Flip shoulds,

342
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,900
what I call your driver's license.
Certain things, taxes and shit. And

343
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,580
I was on star search.
That's why I changed it.

344
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,670
And Ed Mcmahon kept
mispronouncing my name.

345
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:36,540
This is my first time on TV and I was
so, it just threw me, I was so new,

346
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,820
I didn't know he just couldn't handle,

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,230
please welcome your challenge or Jeff
Lifshitz and it's just come out from my

348
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,650
three minutes, like all frazzled,
trying to make my family proud.

349
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,590
I'd never been on TV. So now
their names wrong, you know? So,

350
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:53,740
and then you also had to use a smaller
font on the screen when they introduced

351
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:57,360
me and it made me crazy. Jeff Lifschultz.
It took up the whole, Oh right.

352
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,320
So on the flight home,
after I lost,

353
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:04,090
I said I gotta do something and I just
started using my middle name Ross named

354
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,850
after my great grandmother
Rose Lift Schultz,

355
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:10,060
who was the greatest cater in New Jersey.
And it all comes full circle.

356
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,260
Well it's good too because it's
the same letters, Jeff Ross,

357
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:19,090
the same amount of letters, foreign for
Bam. And that only started in solid. Yeah,

358
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,350
it feels good. Solid. I
like it. Hey man, it works.

359
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,620
And by the way, when I was bad, when I
was a kid, they called me that anyway.

360
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,350
Jeffrey Ross. Javier. Oh really? Yeah.
Oh well that's perfect then. Yeah.

361
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,730
What made you decide to
do this thing in a prison?

362
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,300
Because that was a fucking
risky, ballsy move. You know,

363
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,300
we talked about it and like Paul
Rodriguez had a special that he did in the

364
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:45,010
prison, but uh, quite honestly, he looked
a little nervous. It's back in the day,

365
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,180
it looks a little nervous. This
was many years ago. He did a,

366
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,390
an HBO special live from that prison
critique that he looked nervous and a

367
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,600
prison. Of course it's because
you didn't look nervous.

368
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,900
You watch carefully enough
because I was fucking,

369
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,700
I can hear myself stuttering and
I can see my sub shaking. And,

370
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,900
but you were pretty remarkably relaxed
for the fact that you were roasting

371
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:12,610
prisoners. I mean, you were having
fun with it, man. It was fun.

372
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,350
And you even speed roasted them on stage.

373
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,230
So you turned your back to
these fucking guys. Like,

374
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,970
did you know who they were or
what they did? No. No idea. No,

375
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:26,440
but I, I thought it would be disrespectful
not to do it. Like a doing normal show,

376
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,930
right? No, no. I didn't
know a lot about them.

377
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,310
I just tried to be in the moment and
learn about them as I went along and I

378
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:37,210
learned a lot. Well you wrote
something, was it for huff post?

379
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,090
Is that what you wrote it for?

380
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,020
And I read it and then I
retweeted it because it was,

381
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,910
it was fucking really powerful man.

382
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:46,690
And that's one of the things about
their is I went to a Texas jail to Rosia

383
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:47,020
inmates.

384
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,110
You here what I learned about
incarceration in America
and then in the corner is

385
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:53,590
a girl arrest. Um, but it's also,

386
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,670
it wasn't just that, it wasn't
just this, this article too,

387
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:00,140
but also the little pieces that you had a,

388
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,890
in the videos where
you had like the stats,

389
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:07,891
like one out of every 100 Americans is
in jail and there's more black men in

390
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:13,270
jail right now than there were slaves in
the 18 hundreds. Right. Fucking a man.

391
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,340
It's an emergency. It's an embarrassment
to America when you think about that,

392
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:20,290
if that many people are in jail and

393
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,890
you know it is one good piece of positive
news I saw is that they're commuting

394
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:30,640
some sentences of nonviolent
drug offenders. You know,

395
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,880
it'll only be in the hundreds,
that 65 so far,

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,620
which is done or what I saw the other
day in one article at least. Yeah.

397
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,630
So maybe there's some hope that, I
don't know. I do feel like the show,

398
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,270
the roast helped people talk about it
in a way that there's a little more

399
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,820
accessible because it wasn't
something I knew a lot about.

400
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,300
And as I started writing,
I really just wanted a roast criminals.

401
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,790
I thought it'd be funny.
And as I started writing the act,

402
00:23:55,791 --> 00:24:00,791
I did a stand up act for months in
rehearsal in just to acclimate myself and

403
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:06,620
then have an act that would kill in
front of people that are locked up.

404
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,454
Right now.

405
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,940
I learned so much and that's what I think
is the greater good for me is that not

406
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,840
only that I make them laugh, but I
got something out of it too. I mean,

407
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,530
it's embarrassing that we have more
people locked up in America than anywhere

408
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:24,230
else in the world.
And we're supposed to be a free country.

409
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,860
And the reasons why they're locked up,
that's what's fucked up.

410
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,690
And the also the idea that like
someone in his world can't fuck up.

411
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
You can't make a mistake.
And if you do make a mistake,

412
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,710
then you get locked in a cage.

413
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,770
Especially a mistake if you're thinking
about someone who's coming from a really

414
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,840
poor background who needed money,

415
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,020
took a chance and sold
some drugs and that's it.

416
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,270
And then you're locked in a cage.
And that's,

417
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,030
I'm sure a lot of the people
that you were talking to,

418
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,530
a lot of people that you were looking at,

419
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,560
they were in there for some
sort of nonviolent truck crime.

420
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,220
It's a big percentage of our,
our, our prison population.

421
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,970
And when we were in the parking lot
of the comic store, we had that,

422
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:05,250
a conversation about it. It's,
uh, it's pretty obvious that,

423
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,470
I don't know if it changed it.

424
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,150
Could I say it changed you or it
certainly affected you in a big way, man,

425
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:14,330
you were,
you were really taken aback by it.

426
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,180
And just the sheer numbers
and the experience itself.

427
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,260
Everybody in there is a human being.
You know,

428
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,590
you look at those orange jumpsuits on the
news or on lock up and people are just

429
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:28,760
getting tossed around and pushed around.
There's parts of jails.

430
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,760
And even I didn't get to shoot in,
you know,

431
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,761
there's in the 70s hundreds of thousands
of beds in mental hospitals just closed

432
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:38,690
down.

433
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,690
This is the way we run mental illness
and America changed in the 70 so now the

434
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:45,110
jails will become

435
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,710
de facto mental hospitals and these
jailers have to babysit people that are

436
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,100
crazy.
And that's not what the job is.

437
00:25:55,101 --> 00:26:00,101
And these places become very complicated
to run and we just lock these people

438
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:06,250
away. They come back over
and over and over like human
dust. We forget about them.

439
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:09,200
If you lock them, put them over there.
We don't have to think about them,

440
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:13,610
but the food sucks.
Solitary confinement is barbaric.

441
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,470
You know,

442
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,760
we should just sort of be talking about
that should be the biggest thing they

443
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:23,330
talked about in that Republican. I hardly
heard anything about prison reform.

444
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,170
It seems to me like this is an emergency.
It does seem like that.

445
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:31,130
Did you hear they put Chelsea manning
and solitary because her toothpaste was

446
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:35,420
expired. They can do whatever they want.
It's like, I wish I was making it up.

447
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,820
Jamie. Pull it up. Why? What
was the reason for that?

448
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,140
Not supposed to have expired toothpaste?
She wasn't brushing her teeth enough.

449
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,020
It was just one of those
things where they just, they

450
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,300
had a violation. They fucking hate
this girl who used to be a guy.

451
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,560
If you don't know the whole story,
she is the former formerly artist,

452
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,530
formerly known as, what was it written?
The middle of the original name?

453
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,570
Bradley Manning. Yeah, Bradley. And uh,

454
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,760
he gave all the files to wikileaks
and a look at this wikileaks source.

455
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,100
Manning convicted over magazines and
toothpaste. Well, what does it mean?

456
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,700
What does the article say?

457
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:16,701
They're convicted of
violating the espionage act

458
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,050
and prison for providing classified docket
stop guilty on four charges to inmate

459
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:27,720
tweeted. I'm receiving 21 days of
restrictions and on recreation,

460
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,240
no gym library or outdoors.

461
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:34,320
Manning tweeted those four
charges included medical issue,

462
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,290
prohibited property,
disorderly conduct and disrespect.

463
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,830
Can't break the rules in medicine.

464
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,970
Charge came after officials discovered
expired tube of toothpaste in cell.

465
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,380
That's the medicine charge.
Wow.

466
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,600
So they're just fucking
weather contraband.

467
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,310
Karma came in the form
of books and magazines.

468
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:58,020
There's just a copy of Vanity
Fair magazine featuring
Caitlyn Jenner lol and a

469
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:02,640
copy of Cosmopolitan magazine featuring
an interview with manning. Oh Wow.

470
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,680
She's not allowed to have
an interview with herself,

471
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:08,250
but according to Chelsea manning.org she
received the reading material legally

472
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:11,880
through the prison's open mail system.
Yeah, they're fucking weather, dude.

473
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,510
They're fucking weather. They
can. They're fucking criminals.

474
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,650
Just lock that person
up and take away all,

475
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,030
all the rights, all, all
that's any privacy, the,

476
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,950
any ownership they have over their own
body or even what they want to read.

477
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,390
Imagine that Vanity Fair's fucking
contract band. You can get,

478
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,700
you've locked up in
solitary for a vanity fair,

479
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,010
fuck sick. It's sick. And you know,

480
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:45,360
look at that whole thing, the way
it went down. That poor guy, um,

481
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,710
uh, Julian Assange, he still
locked up in that fucking, he's,

482
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,400
he's still in that house, in the, uh,
what do, what do you call those things?

483
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,530
Embassy. He's still in the
Ecuador. Ecuador's embassy,
something like that. Uh,

484
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:01,320
in London, like you can't leave if
he steps foot out of that building,

485
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:05,190
he's fucked. So the dude's not getting
any vitamin D, he's not going outside.

486
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,070
Super unhealthy.
It really is unhealthy.

487
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,670
Like you really need to be outside
poor fucker. You can't lose,

488
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,410
you can't walk out the door. Yup.
Exactly. But you know what they're saying?

489
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,670
They're saying it.
They,

490
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,200
what they're saying is that it's a sex
case that he had sex with a woman and

491
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:25,860
then in the middle of the night, uh,
he stuck it in again without a condom.

492
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,910
It's called surprise sax. Like they
were cuddled together naked and, uh,

493
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,380
he didn't put a condom a second time.

494
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:35,700
And I don't even know if the woman
is pressing charges. I mean I don't,

495
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,660
I don't know what's going on.

496
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:39,810
But they were trying to extradite
him for that like, right. Yeah.

497
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,190
That's what you're doing. Yeah. Right.

498
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,010
Like that's why this guy locked
up in an embassy to manage.

499
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:49,000
If every time a guy tried to cuddle
with a chick and sneak it in without a

500
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,361
rubber,

501
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:53,770
that guy will get locked up in an embassy
and behold up there there'd be the

502
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:57,790
secretary of state. That'd be
it. Every embassy in the world.

503
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,580
You one of those surprise
sex, enthusiastic. I love
slipping it in it for $30

504
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,643
that's a,

505
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,350
it's not in tactically rape because I
guess she was asleep and they had already

506
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,450
had sex and they were,
you know,

507
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,600
cuddled together and this little
spooning type position, you know,

508
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,150
Dick to Vijay Jay right from behind.
I don't know.

509
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,550
I'm just making it up cause I
don't really know what happened.

510
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,480
Nobody knows what happened. He says
it's all bullshit. And, but the,

511
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,290
the idea that they got this guy locked
up for that and that's why they know it's

512
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,140
not, it's Wiki leaks. It's the
fucking information they released.

513
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,050
That's what they're trying to try to get
them on a loophole. And we all know it.

514
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,380
It's going on right in front of our eyes.
It's fucking crazy.

515
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:43,381
It's just right in front of our eyes
that Ashley Madison finally got leaked,

516
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,370
uh, yesterday. So whoever did that,

517
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm sure he's going to be the next one
of these guys if they find out who it is.

518
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,120
But that could just be a hacker though.
And I could just be like the,

519
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,740
the fat burning people,
they just tap into kind of fucking mask,

520
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,780
cock blocking that job.

521
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,920
Ashley madison.com. So are getting
laid there. Like fucking thumb,

522
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,430
not getting laid. Nobody's getting
laid. I should tick it's out.

523
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,850
I saw it too. And it was scary as it.
Not only does it have all the names,

524
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:17,020
it has like all the information. So they,
they leaked the credit card information.

525
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,160
They leaked everything.

526
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:21,310
So did they lead who they had sex
with or who they think that, yeah,

527
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:25,000
cause you make an appointment with
the other person. So like there's all,

528
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,940
everything in there,
an appointment,

529
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,860
you're pretty much buying an escort,
but it's not an escort.

530
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,370
And so you're using your service.

531
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,630
Did you hear about that Uber for escort
APP that they have in Germany and they

532
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:42,460
were like a Uber for escorts.
It's like, it's, you know,
it's like, like using Uber,

533
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,390
except you have the escorts. You just
fucking look at your phone. You say, Hey,

534
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:50,290
I want to get my dick sucked when you
put the thing up there and then really?

535
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah. And then Uber, Debbie's on
her way over, you know, Bluer.

536
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,531
That was hilarious.

537
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:59,380
When you call it the lesbian and the
crowd for being looking like exactly like

538
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:00,214
Justin Bieber.

539
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,430
It was perfect in the women's jail. Yeah.
The women's jail was an interesting one,

540
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:11,020
man, because they fucking laughed
hard day, laughed harder, needed it.

541
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,890
They did and they needed it in a
whole nother way. Then the guys,

542
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,930
what did it feel like?
What is the difference tune?

543
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:19,750
What does a woman's GL feel like
as opposed to a male men's jail?

544
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:23,350
Cause you don't feel it's like physically
threatened, right? It's a little bit,

545
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,980
a little bit right. I'm sure.
I mean it was fine, you know,

546
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,920
but I wasn't thinking about my own safety.

547
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:34,510
I was more thinking about how to make
this the most like at night my instincts

548
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:39,100
were to make it like a nightclub. Treat
the women as women, not as inmates.

549
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,130
Right.
And make

550
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,720
it the same way. I would add an
comedy club and that's what I did.

551
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:48,800
And they were shrieking with the light
cause no one had spoke to them as women.

552
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,020
They're always as yelled
at in order to around and,

553
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,650
and that came through that they really
needed a laugh and to just be girls,

554
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:01,751
women ladies for an hour and
they wind up being so great.

555
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:06,230
It was a warm up for me for the next
night when I did two shows for the guys.

556
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,180
Oh see do the ladies first.
Yeah.

557
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,100
And you said you had a real hard time
trying to find prisons that would let you

558
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:13,934
do this.
Yeah.

559
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,650
I W we reached out to 150 or so
until finally we found one in Texas.

560
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:25,130
That one, one. Wow. And whose decisions?

561
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:29,510
The warden's decision.
There's a few people who have to agree.

562
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,370
Wayne Dickey as the jail administrator
at Brazos county jail and he stepped up

563
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,790
and had confidence in his institution,

564
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,070
in his facility and he wanted her,

565
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,640
he wanted everyone to see his staff and
how great they were and to see how, uh,

566
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,540
his inmate behavioral programs worked
where he incentivizes the inmates.

567
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,460
How does that work in good behavior and
they get rewards if you do your time

568
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:59,900
without messing up. There are huge rewards
on, one of them was coming to see me.

569
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,470
These guys had to behave for one
month in order to see my show.

570
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,020
And then I took that as a huge
compliment that so many people,

571
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,160
uh, did that not everybody,
but most of the jail,

572
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,910
more than half came to my shows and they,

573
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,660
they were appreciative
and I felt that too.

574
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,380
That's why the show came off because
not only were they good sports,

575
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:28,670
but they knew what they were signing
up for ahead of time because they had a

576
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,440
month to notice that I was coming there
to roast them and I s there were posters

577
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:36,230
around the jail and said, you
know, if you can laugh at yourself,

578
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,150
you're one step closer to freedom.

579
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,780
And they came and when
I asked for volunteers,

580
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,700
guys were running down from the balcony.

581
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,070
They're not allowed to
even be in the same room.

582
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:51,071
It was a communal experience for the
different sex and gangs and types of

583
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,490
people,
you know.

584
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,640
It was all dudes and squeezed into
this one room with the most dangerous,

585
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:02,861
closer to the stage by the door and the
least dangerous packed into the rafters.

586
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,000
Wow. So if there was a problem, they could
handle it. The jailers can handle it.

587
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,980
It was very calculated. And as far as
the safety of how it would go down,

588
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,210
did you get your front kick ready? I was
someone I was charging stayed in it, man.

589
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,970
I was,
I didn't want anybody near the stage.

590
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:24,050
I wanted it to be the
most like a comedy club,

591
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,070
I can make it for them.

592
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,030
So that was the only time that they were
ever jammed into a room like that. Yeah.

593
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:32,900
And you know that's a
real security concern.

594
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,090
That takes quite a bit
of planning to take five,

595
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,460
six pods of dudes and
put them in one room.

596
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,570
They can overpower the jailers,
they could over do whatever they want.

597
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,430
There's cameras in there. I'm in there.
So there was a huge trust factor. Wow.

598
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:52,020
That went on between the jailers
and the inmates, myself on my crew.

599
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,650
So what kind of security that they have
in place in case the shit hit the fan.

600
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,740
I did ask about my security if I had
any special person or a way out and they

601
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:05,760
said absolutely not,
which I couldn't believe at first.

602
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,430
I think I took them off guard.
They just didn't get to that.

603
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,570
But their assumption was beyond me
was there will not be any problems.

604
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,530
So I am no more special than anyone else
in that room be the way they set it up,

605
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,900
which I respected.
There was not going to be a problem.

606
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,680
Where did you come up with this idea and
what made you decide to film a special

607
00:36:25,681 --> 00:36:30,600
this way? Um, who, well,
I wanted to make it

608
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,640
purposeful.
I wanted to learn something.

609
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,800
I wanted to initially think of
the funniest thing, which would be

610
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,450
okay.

611
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,560
Crime in America.
And I talked to a lot of people.

612
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,370
I'm friends with Tony Hinchcliffe,
Mike Ferrucci,

613
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,790
George Ryan Blatt, my cousin, Ed Larson.

614
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:55,310
We just brainstormed and tried
to think of the funniest,

615
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,590
craziest Shit we could do.

616
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,040
And somehow roasting criminals.

617
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,780
Yeah.

618
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Seem like a hilarious way for me
to do what I do face to face you,

619
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,660
you know,

620
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,660
roasting concepts as one thing or
roasting people from behind a desk has all

621
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,400
been done and,

622
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,830
but go into it like getting into
something, immersing in an environment.

623
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,030
That's my specialty. I love that. To
me it's like a corporate gig. You know,

624
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,600
you're writing a special
act for a certain night,

625
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,740
then you're never going to
do it again. Right, right.
And I love that it's a roast.

626
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,790
So that's what you like about roads.
You like preparing for roasts?

627
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,930
Like I've seen you at
the S. Dot. The clubs,

628
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:42,770
the Improv and the store
getting ready pages and notes.

629
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,670
Like you liked the whole event.
Like there's an event coming up.

630
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,500
I liked the writing. Yeah. The
event is the is the payoff,

631
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,460
but you have to enjoy the process.
Say I like writing the jokes.

632
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,430
So you just like a subject to focus on.
Yeah,

633
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,070
I liked that.

634
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,960
I something that I love
that I'm interested in or
curious about are a fan of,

635
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,440
you know, it's gotta be something meaty,
you know? I mean I can riff if I don't it,

636
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,950
but if I'm invested in it somehow,
like with the jail,

637
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:16,491
I thought like,

638
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:20,040
how did I like smoke so much pot and had
so much fun in my life and never get in

639
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:24,110
real trouble. I sold weed in high school.
Like this could have been me. Yeah.

640
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,790
You know,
this could have been me.

641
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:30,791
So I got curious and as I get personally
curious and invested in something,

642
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:35,560
I can start to see, find the
hypocrisy that go into it. Hello.

643
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,550
How

644
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,460
the humanity can be lifted out of it.

645
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,260
And I started to see that this is a sad
place and it's kind of like doing a Uso

646
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,900
tour. And I told that to the
jailers when I met with them.

647
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,970
I had to go down there and ask permission
a couple times and they had to trust

648
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:56,920
me. You know that I wasn't
there to humiliate anybody
or expose anything that was

649
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,280
not just, I don't know, I
wasn't, I didn't have an agenda.

650
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,930
What it's going to make it real.

651
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,240
I was really just going
to go there and see what,

652
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,370
see if people had a sense of humor.
It was simple. And as I got into it,

653
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:13,960
I realize how lucky I am that
I never got in real trouble,

654
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,620
that I never got busted for anything.
And then if I had,

655
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:22,450
I'm not sure I would've survived. Well,
especially if you were selling pot, right?

656
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,050
If you were selling pot, you could
have got caught and you also go to,

657
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:28,120
got talked into selling more pot.
We've ever heard of those stories,

658
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,150
like DEA agents go undercover and
they'll talk a kid into a glisten.

659
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:35,590
I'm going to put a deal together.
You know, if you're a part of this,

660
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:40,591
there was a story that they did in
rolling stone about a DEA undercover agent

661
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:45,520
who talked this kid into a big cocaine
deal that wasn't real. It wasn't real.

662
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,570
There was no real cocaine,

663
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,750
but he talked this kid into selling it
and this kid is in jail for life now.

664
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,920
Kid was just a low level dealer. He was
selling, you know, a little bit here,

665
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,300
a little bit there and nothing big.

666
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,690
And this DEA guy essentially talked to
him into doing some gigantic deal that

667
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:05,800
put them in jail for 25 to life. And
that can happen to anybody. You can.

668
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,590
I look,
I've made some big fuck ups in my life.

669
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,530
I've been an idiot many times in my
life. I've, I've, you know, there's no,

670
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,730
I don't know, a single person who hasn't
made mistakes. We all make mistakes. It's,

671
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,770
but it's whatever the environment is
that you're growing up in dictate how bad

672
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:24,250
your situation is, whatever, you
know, whatever you were exposed to.

673
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,690
And that might be a factor
in the level of your mistake.

674
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,490
So the dumb mistakes that I made
with a pretty uneventful childhood.

675
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,740
Nothing too serious. Good parents,
nice folks. My mom's a sweet person,

676
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,660
you know, love my sister. It's like
pretty easy life growing up in Newton,

677
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:47,050
Massachusetts. Not Hard, not hard at all.

678
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,190
I imagine just a much more chaotic
situation with the same person living in

679
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,660
Inglewood, you know, whatever. Watts,

680
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,350
Detroit in some fucking hopeless
place where you can't get out.

681
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,410
And then next thing you know,
you're in fucking jail.

682
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,320
You're in jail and you're going
to be in jail for five, six years.

683
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,590
And during that time you go from being
21 to 26 and now you getting out and

684
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,190
you're fucking, you're a man and you're
a convict. You can't get a fucking job.

685
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:18,820
And you're just trying to figure out
how scratch and survive. It's fucked.

686
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,900
It's fucked.
You know,

687
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:23,680
it's fucked that there's so many people
out there that just don't get a chance

688
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,090
or whatever chance to get, you know,
and it's, a lot of people go off,

689
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,190
you just follow the law, but to get
the fuck outta here, that's nonsense.

690
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,680
Especially when it comes to selling
drugs just doesn't make sense.

691
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,080
It doesn't make any sense
of these kids just doesn't.

692
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,670
And then I saw guys 18 1920 years old,
been already been in one, two, three times

693
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,780
and imagine what their parents are like
imagining what their neighborhood was

694
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:49,420
like.
Imagine what their uncle was like,

695
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,330
whatever the fuck they encountered from
the time they were a baby until the time

696
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,164
they're a prisoner.

697
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,910
And then the fucked up thing is you just
become kind of a human battery because

698
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,520
all you do is you generate
money for private prisons.

699
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,060
Every one person that goes into those
private prisons is worth a certain amount

700
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,660
of money for those companies and
they sell that. That's what their,

701
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,930
that's their business.
Their business is making money,

702
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,860
extracting money at a prisoners and
there's a whole system that's involved in

703
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,900
doing it all the way from the guards,

704
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:22,340
the guard unions make sure that they
keep certain drugs illegal and make sure

705
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:25,640
that certain laws stay on the books and
certain penalties are still in place.

706
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,450
It's fucked, man. It's fucked. You know,

707
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:31,700
I had this guy on the other day we were
talking about and he was saying that one

708
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:35,060
of the only things that keeps it from
getting even worse is that the private

709
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:38,740
prisons and the the guard
unions don't get along like the,

710
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:42,650
the guards want certain things at the
prisons don't because the prisons don't

711
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:45,350
want to pay the guards. So there's the
fucking, there's a little internal struck,

712
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:49,730
but if they work together it
would be even worse. Terrible.

713
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,730
You could have been a prisoner. You
could have totally fucked up. Huh?

714
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,100
I was in prison or jail at I. That's
where I learned what hooch was. Well,

715
00:42:57,101 --> 00:43:00,430
you went to jail for something you
didn't even do. You got, you got,

716
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,350
you are at all the dudes I've ever met
and of all the guys that I've ever met

717
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,090
who have run across crazy women that
get really fucking angry at you when you

718
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:12,060
break up every fucking girl you've ever

719
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,000
dated since I've been friends with you,
they get furious at you when it's over.

720
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,810
Where they want to kill you. Yeah,
I've seen it in person. I just not,

721
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,400
it's not just granted you
inspire that in some men as well.

722
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,640
I just date those crazy bitches.

723
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,080
I don't know what I really,
uh,

724
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,590
I think I mentioned whatever
attract my attraction.

725
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:41,591
My smell that I like on women is ones
that are more entertaining than boring,

726
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,280
I guess. Well, you liked those
dirty girls to a lot of times,

727
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:51,100
dirty girls that are involved in
naked things. No, those girls wilder,

728
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,860
they're more fun. You know, I was
thinking like, I want to meet a girl that,

729
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:59,360
that every time she goes to Vegas to
hang out with her friends like that,

730
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:00,680
she sends me a photo of that.

731
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:04,190
I'm not looking at the wallpaper and
then comparing it to like Dan Blitzer in

732
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,710
Instagram photos, you know,
like I'm like, wait a second,

733
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:11,000
it looks like the same cup on his
nightstand damn bills area, whatever.

734
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,270
I just found out about that guy.
Like I,

735
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,370
I'm like the last person I just went
to his Instagram and she's like, wait,

736
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,990
this is what everyone's
been talking about.

737
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,220
That's amazing that he's made
millions of dollars playing poker.

738
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,800
Apparently more than a hundred
million dollars playing poker,

739
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:29,120
but he got all his money from his dad
to his dad was a some famous character,

740
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:32,010
so he's like been rich.
His life doesn't

741
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,000
give a fuck. Hey, it looks like
here's a lot of fun. What Jamie?

742
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:38,160
Where's those as well? I would lytros
we'd give you some of those night crump.

743
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,130
Nitros nitros no,

744
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,310
nitro coffee. Caveman
coffee. Those nitrogen native
brewed cold brewed coffees.

745
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:50,730
I'm addicted to those little things right
now. They're awesome. You ever have one?

746
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,320
Do you drink coffee? Sure. Get one for
Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross would like a night.

747
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,450
What? Cause be drinking?
Fuck fucking Jamie.

748
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,110
He drank all of them. I had three
of those. You fucking savage.

749
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,450
Give him the real one and get me a
uh, a bottle of water. No, no, no.

750
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,820
It's okay. That other stuff.
Same Shit. Just fucking around.

751
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,070
He does drag him everyday. Those savage,
you got to order something, Jamie,

752
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,640
if you're going to drink them every day.
You got to order.

753
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:20,130
I'm okay fucking animal.
Thank you sir.

754
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,800
Do we have any cold water's in there.

755
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,810
What did you think about the
whole fat Jewish thing? Yeah,

756
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:31,620
that's what we're talking about
actually. Before the show, um,

757
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,950
you were saying that you think that
the networks need to loosen up on the

758
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,290
Internet needs to tighten up.
What'd you mean by that?

759
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,220
Oh, I was just saying, I was
just talking off the cuff,

760
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:45,430
but thanks buddy.
You know,

761
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,520
we're talking about this guy who goes by
the fat Jewish on Instagram and I would

762
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:54,100
follow him in. I'd see funny stuff on
there. So I kind of knew about him.

763
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,400
I didn't know a lot about how
he collected his material.

764
00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:58,570
I guess I didn't think about it.

765
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:03,280
Like most of the 5 million people
who follow him, they don't care.

766
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:06,100
They just want to laugh. They're not
thinking about anything, you know?

767
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,060
And then I started to see that he was
collecting whatever he thought was funny.

768
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:14,990
I'm not sure, I don't
know a lot about it, but

769
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,000
he makes me robbing people's names out.
He wasn't just collecting things.

770
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:23,200
He was actively trying to make sure that
he didn't show who created it and he

771
00:46:23,201 --> 00:46:25,840
just put it on his page. So he didn't
give credit to the people that made it.

772
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,250
That's what the big problem was. Everybody
read tweets, things you retweet things.

773
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:33,520
I read someone,
one of our friends said something funny.

774
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,530
It helps them when you retweet it and
it shows first of all entertains that

775
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,510
people that get to read it on your
Twitter feed and it gives that person to

776
00:46:40,511 --> 00:46:43,820
credit. It's a great thing. There's
nothing wrong with re tweeting.

777
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,720
I think if he did that,
he would have the same amount of people.

778
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,780
If he really was a true aggregator,
like huffpost,

779
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,300
they credit everybody that they use.
Yeah.

780
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,170
So what I'm saying is this
is an aggregate, the Internet
my entire career, like

781
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,650
I've never made money off all the millions
of clips that are out there. Right.

782
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,940
You know, millions of views and
people are always shooting comedians.

783
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:07,040
Comedians get annoyed, you
know our material. You know,

784
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,680
you see a lot of comedians
when it's shut down,

785
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:11,920
phones at their shows because they don't
want their half written jokes on the

786
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:16,210
internet or they don't want their fans
to see their material without having to

787
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:17,560
pay for it either.

788
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:21,820
Live at a show or buying
their specials online.

789
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,290
So I go, it seems MTV seems
restricted all the time.

790
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,100
So maybe what do mean by TV's restricts it

791
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,680
all the time?

792
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,520
Well, you know, you have in the
networks are trying to be edgier,

793
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:38,660
but there's still bleeps and they're
still censorship and there's all sorts of

794
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,330
regulations. But with the Internet,
everyone always explained it was a wild,

795
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:46,520
wild west, you know, and you
can just do whatever you want,

796
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,630
like all the time you'll see people will
make videos and comprehends and they'll

797
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,830
edit famous movies and you just use
whatever footage and no one ever cares.

798
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,080
Then now people are starting
to care a little bit.

799
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:01,070
They're looking for ways the last five,
10 years to monetize the Internet.

800
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,720
And to me it's coming very close
to being how we watch everything.

801
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:10,750
I hardly ever watch TV
anymore and when I do,

802
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:15,140
it's a big live event. In the end
they're just all starting to become does.

803
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:16,820
No more of the Internet.
There's no more TV,

804
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:21,470
it's just programming and it's different
brands and you go to those brands.

805
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,000
So I go at some point,

806
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:26,570
the regulations for the Internet and
television should be the same and they

807
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:30,050
should be, they should get
together and it should just be,

808
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,650
do you mean it's once a set
of standards for now on,

809
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,720
but what do you mean by standards?
Do you mean as far as

810
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,200
for, as far as, um,

811
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,760
the music rights and how it all goes
down and the stuff we have to, you know,

812
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:44,990
the residuals and those sorts of things
and how the unions operate on the

813
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:49,270
Internet as the actors and directors
and writers unions, you know,

814
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,480
the fees and the rules
for the internet or,

815
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,990
or different payment minimums
are different from the
Internet and television.

816
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,980
Right now I'm in the
writer's guild and I dunno,

817
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:03,560
I mean it's all the
same now at this point.

818
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:08,000
And I feel like the Internet needs to
step it up and they should be crediting

819
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:08,820
stuff and

820
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,050
paying for rights.
And

821
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,450
to some extent I think it's happening.
And I think that's good.

822
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,230
I think you're right. I think the, for
a long time it was innocent. You know,

823
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,040
like someone would post a funny meme
right on their Instagram and no one cared

824
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:26,820
because it was just, just
people being funny like, God,
this is, this guy's funny.

825
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,660
But then when people started making
a lot of money off of it and then you

826
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:34,230
realize, well what made that guy
famous? Well he's just an aggregator.

827
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,400
All he's doing is collecting all the shit
that's online and instead of the row,

828
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,510
the actual writers of each one of those
individual bits getting some credit,

829
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,220
all the is going to him.

830
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,360
So now what he's doing with this guy who
calls himself the fat Jewish is doing

831
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,020
is he just puts the guy's name at the
end or the girl's name at the end.

832
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,830
So he steals her picture, puts it up
on his site. And instead of saying,

833
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,790
this picture was made by Jeff Ross,
the real Jeff Ross,

834
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,740
it now just has an un [inaudible],
just a tag, you know at.

835
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:09,210
And then whoever's name it is with no
mention of where you know that this person

836
00:50:09,211 --> 00:50:12,090
created this originally, it just,
they just throw their name up there,

837
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,870
which is stupid.
Like,

838
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:18,450
all you have to do is this hilarious
meme was created by boom and then that

839
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:20,730
person gets credit.
That person probably happy,

840
00:50:20,731 --> 00:50:21,870
they'll get a shit load of fucking,

841
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:25,830
people will come to visit them and sign
up and follows. He's not doing that.

842
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:30,830
And I did notice he sorta does it at
the end of whatever the new comment is.

843
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,920
So it almost looks like the person
who wants to give credit to,

844
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:38,780
he's actually giving credit for the
comment. Not In some ways. In some ways,

845
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,740
yeah. It's just not, it's not an
open, you know, it's just like, it's,

846
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,690
it's reluctant.
It's a reluctant credit at the end.

847
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,310
What else is he funny? I haven't seen, I
don't know. I mean, he's a good marketer,

848
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,670
obviously. He's really smart at putting
it all together. He's eating, he's not,

849
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:59,450
by the way, he's not even giving
proper credit on a lot of them.

850
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:03,890
I've noticed like he's, uh,
he's, he's saying that accounts,

851
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,590
like he's saying that
that person made this,

852
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,950
but then you go to their account and
they don't have that on their Instagram.

853
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:15,190
There's a few instances
where he's crediting these
people that didn't make it,

854
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,640
aren't even active.

855
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,320
Like one of the people ha even used
their Instagram for like 12 months and it

856
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:23,690
was just like if you went
go through all his photos,

857
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,780
it has nothing to do with what he like,
why he credited.

858
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,880
So it's weird why thing he's doing that.
Um, what the Internet is saying. Uh,

859
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,770
allegedly I gotta protect myself.

860
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,060
I talked to my lawyer yesterday about
all these. Really? Yeah. Why? Uh,

861
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,430
just cause I don't want to get s get in
trouble or anything like that. You know,

862
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,890
we need to have somebody that's Jewish
and the first thing you think of that

863
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,250
you're going to get sued.
If you could talk about how's that?

864
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,580
She'll tell you, sit next to
this guy. Kidding. But Damn,
man, I German, you know.

865
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,240
No, no Irish. Brian was Shelly. No,

866
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:00,410
you wrote on your page this fat German I
know is going after this fat Jew. Yeah.

867
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:04,790
Uh,
but now what was I talking about?

868
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,950
You tell me. What was I
talking about? Who Cares? Yeah.

869
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,480
You were talking about him not giving
credit to Internet is saying is that he's,

870
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:22,440
uh, that he has a lot of these interns
supposedly that are half the accounts, uh,

871
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,470
that he, uh, credits.

872
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,790
So he has his intern take it from somebody
else and put it on, on his account,

873
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:32,630
and then he credits his intern
so that it's still in the family.

874
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:34,910
Like he's not gay. You
know what I mean? Yeah.

875
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,300
It's kind of like a loophole that's a big,
allegedly you don't have any,

876
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,120
well this is just what the
Internet, Internet, which forum?

877
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,490
There's Reddit, Reddit, Reddit,
a forum. I, there's, yeah,

878
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,460
I think both of them are on reddit and
there's another website that's doing it

879
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:51,440
also, but if you just Google him, uh,

880
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,520
there's a lot of message boards that have
been talking about him for years, uh,

881
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,900
and breaking down everything. He's
stolen and, and, and, and it's, um, it's,

882
00:52:58,970 --> 00:52:59,930
it's very interesting.

883
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,100
Did he call himself a curator or
something on this Instagram pages?

884
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:08,660
Me Sort of saying this is what I do. Is
that what he's saying? I Dunno. I Dunno.

885
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:13,700
Um, we should say though, because
somebody posted this yesterday that, um,

886
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,160
you know, we were talking about that
girl, she's really funny. Um, that, uh,

887
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,930
we were saying, what was her name
again? Pistol. Sherman. Yeah.

888
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,070
Um, people so that she has, uh,

889
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,200
uh, misappropriated people's stuff
as well. I don't know how that works.

890
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:34,770
So yeah,
I don't know if it's true or not.

891
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,420
I think she is a,

892
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,130
I think she's kind of admitting that she
has definitely put some stuff up that

893
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:42,570
somebody sent her that
she thought was funny,

894
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:47,100
but I think she said 80% of this stuff
is hers. But you know what I mean?

895
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,881
A lot of people,

896
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,310
they're just finding memes that are
funny and they put them on their page.

897
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,240
It's kind of innocent in some ways.
Right. That's what I mean, the Internet,

898
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,220
I don't know.
It's for amateurs or something.

899
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:58,740
Still we've got to figure out how
to make it, but how do you, I mean,

900
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:02,820
jet Brian Rather did a great
job of actually finding the,

901
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,940
the original image and finding the time.

902
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:09,960
The original image was posted in the
day and that's how he credited people.

903
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,220
And that's how he actually discredited
a couple of people that originally were

904
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,500
trying to claim that they
came up with it first.

905
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,500
But it was proven that somebody else had
it posted the exact same image to the

906
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,090
exact same tax before them.

907
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:26,930
Yeah, it's kind of sucks cause
if we want reg regulations,

908
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,150
if we want to make change how it is now,

909
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:32,090
what it's going to happen is it's like
when you have a youtube video and it

910
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:35,210
detects that there's
copyright and material in it.

911
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:38,390
So now anytime we want to post
like a photo on our Facebook or,

912
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,740
or tweet something,

913
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,520
we're going to have like a block
and we kind of don't want that.

914
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,290
You can't fuck with the Internet, man.
They find you. They find you. When you,

915
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:51,670
when you tried to sell them a
plate of bullshit, people find you.

916
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,070
They just figure it out.
You can't get away with it.

917
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:59,680
You just can't do you see the aspree
thing [inaudible] look at this.

918
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,420
Dave Asprey put up a photo

919
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,780
of his stomach of a fake,

920
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,930
a fake photo of stock photo of
someone else's abs shredded and said,

921
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,050
you know,

922
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:16,050
this is my stomach after a 4,500 calories
a day and no working out and it's just

923
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:17,290
a stock photo.

924
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:21,400
It's a stock photo and he's trying to
say that his bulletproof diet gives you

925
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,920
that. In his defense, if
you click on the link,

926
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,200
there's an actual photo of
his actual abs that Jamie,

927
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,800
thanks a photo shopped allegedly Jamie,
thanks for allegedly Photoshop.

928
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,420
You don't even need to say it. Let's not
even pull it up, but it's the same thing.

929
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,420
It's the same thing. You can't
fuck with these people if you're,

930
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:42,160
if you're blatantly bullshitting
and stealing, they cannot find you.

931
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,390
That's the, that's really funny
though. Like, like I said, he did that,

932
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,650
like I put working out and just post
like that guy has muscles everywhere.

933
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,131
If you,

934
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:55,000
if there was really a way that you can
get a body like that guy's without ever

935
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:58,780
working out, you would have to be
some sort of a genetic manipulation.

936
00:55:58,781 --> 00:56:01,900
You have to be some experiment.
That's, that's not just apps.

937
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:04,270
That guy has chest muscle,
shoulder muscles.

938
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,700
It's a guy that trains
probably on our daily basis.

939
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,180
The fact that he would put that picture
up. It's just so crazy. It's funny.

940
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,960
He's so crazy.
Just so it's so fucking nuts.

941
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:18,640
People were out of their goddamn minds.
They really are. And the Internet, it's,

942
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,560
you know, it's kind of fucking expose.
That shit just takes a matter of time.

943
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,130
You got to go see shows.
Live

944
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,050
standup you mean? Yeah, the less
jokes on the internet than I used to.

945
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:33,160
I put less jokes on Twitter than I used
to because I want my best material for

946
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:37,930
when you come see me live and that's
much more unique and exciting experience.

947
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,010
People get mad sometimes if you
talk about something on the podcast,

948
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:44,370
even if you bring up the subject and
then have a bit about it on stage. Oh,

949
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,610
you were talking about doing on the pond
curves like do you not want us to talk

950
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:50,740
about funny shit on the pod passed?
Can you,

951
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:55,860
can you allow us to come up with ideas
spontaneously on the podcast and then

952
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:59,830
talk about them on stage as well? You
fucked. Yeah, I've done that before.

953
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,680
That's just, you know, they
want to know that. Well,

954
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,450
they just want to fucking let you know
that they're listening to the Rudy.

955
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,970
Don't you think though that it's good
though, that they keep you on your toes?

956
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,200
I think even with the hyper criticism
like each, you don't want to dive into it.

957
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,130
Like you don't want to just do a
Google search on your name final.

958
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:22,600
All the people talking shit about you.
It's not good.

959
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:27,040
But knowing that they're there probably
gives you an edge. It gives you,

960
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,550
keeps you sharp. I can see that.
I think so. Keeps you sharp.

961
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,350
I try not to read the bad comments.

962
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,270
I try to stay away from the haters and
stay positive. Well, you try hard though.

963
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:38,440
When you work hard at what you do,

964
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:41,590
it's not like you're slacking off and
someone's coming along and calling you on

965
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,410
it. If they're saying something
mean shit, they just don't like you.

966
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:45,880
They might not like your style.

967
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:50,050
There's going to be people that like
you know him or like anybody, you know,

968
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:53,440
they like a certain style and they don't
like your style or they do like your

969
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:56,500
style. You don't like somebody else's
style. They're not right or wrong.

970
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:00,220
They just have their own taste. No,
they're wrong. Everyone likes my style.

971
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,120
Would you read it though? Some of them
are so fucking mean. And why is that?

972
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,560
Just because they want you to notice them.

973
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,250
They want to make it a lot of people
sometimes. Yeah, they're outlet.

974
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:13,340
Just rude and mean. It's mine. Why would
it, what am I argue with them? I don't.

975
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,670
I ignore them. I don't
want him to block him. No,

976
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:20,590
because then they know you saw it. Well
cares. Why do you care if they know?

977
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,970
I don't want them to put that. Just want
them to float in the sea and not do.

978
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,890
But you did see it.
Yes.

979
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:30,280
So why acknowledged some piece of
shit then he can just keep doing it.

980
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,030
You're going to get Twitter bomb now.
They gonna bomb you real Jeffrey Ross,

981
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:38,710
bring it on.
I'm ready.

982
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,700
What are you going to tell
me? I don't know. Already.
Fucking know, you know, fucker.

983
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:46,150
What are you going to tell me? Real
Jeffrey Ross Christ are so aggressive.

984
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,630
Come on, bring it on. You think? I don't
know. I look like Bruce Willis drowned.

985
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,500
Bring it on mother fuckers.
I'm ready for some.

986
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,920
Bruce was wishy looked like you
write down on my Twitter right now.

987
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:02,080
Bruce Willis looks like shit. He
wishes to execute now. Poor bastard.

988
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:07,300
I just spent a week at the beach. This is
his tan as I'm ever gonna to look good.

989
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,360
I feel very healthy. You look vibrant.
Thank you. We're gonna say I've, uh,

990
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,580
I've toned it down more
on Twitter than I used to.

991
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:19,930
Like making fun of people or like
attacking people. You know, on Twitter,

992
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,070
I used to be, I think, you know, back

993
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,080
in the early days of your
message board and stuff,

994
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:28,010
we used to have like kind of fun,
like having online battles with people.

995
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,440
You know, Moore's Florence flame
wars, that's what we used to call it.

996
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,410
We so called flame wars. Yeah,
those were fun. They were fun.

997
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,420
But too many people jump in.

998
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:38,630
Now there's the other thing is it's not
just two people going back and forth.

999
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:41,270
It's a bunch of people that would decide
that they're on the other guy side or

1000
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:43,850
this guy side and jump in.
Like you get a lot of that now.

1001
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:48,080
There's a lot of what you see online
when there's any sort of a debate about

1002
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,060
something as pylons,
you know,

1003
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:54,290
there's a bunch of people pile on
one side or the other. You know,

1004
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:58,640
I tweeted something the
other day and this guy's a,

1005
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,833
he's up for,

1006
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,700
he might go to jail in Canada because
he's been tweeting at this girl and

1007
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,400
apparently there was like some agreement
that he wouldn't tweet at her anymore,

1008
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,890
but he used to,
he used to be on her side.

1009
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,870
I think he actually even
did some artwork with her,

1010
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,680
but she's like this radical feminist and
you know, and she took them to court.

1011
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,050
Like she, she called the police on him.
This guy was harassing her like she,

1012
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:23,480
it was even sometimes she would write
something about him and the fact that he

1013
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:26,900
responded to her about him,
she was saying he was harassing her,

1014
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,430
which is kind of hilarious.

1015
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,850
But all I did was there was
an article and a video and uh,

1016
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,880
I retweeted it cause I was
like, oh, this is interesting.

1017
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,450
The exact title of the video is what came
up on my tweet in the exact same order

1018
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:44,030
because I just went to the youtube thing
where it says share. And I tweeted it.

1019
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:48,290
I didn't put any commentary, I didn't
have any editorial control over it.

1020
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,770
And so many fucking people were angry at
me saying that I'm a misogynist and why

1021
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:57,320
would I post this?
And like it's a woman in the video,

1022
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,440
an older woman in the video
is talking about this case.

1023
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:05,530
So it's a woman's video about a woman
who's suing a man and the man might go to

1024
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:08,690
jail because the man was tweeting at a
woman who didn't want him to tweet at her.

1025
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:14,480
This is like, this is crazy. But I looked
at the comments, I was like, Jesus Christ.

1026
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,040
Like the fucking mean.

1027
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:19,940
People piling on an angry
at me that I tweeted this.

1028
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,140
I guess you could kind of think that maybe
this is my opinion instead of me just

1029
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:28,110
sharing something, but I share shit.
I don't believe in at all. I share it.

1030
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,160
I'll share some flat earth shit or some
big foot shit or any I share nonsense.

1031
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,100
I'll, I'll retweet people that think
the earth is less than 10,000 years old.

1032
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:41,040
I do that all the time. This is one dummy
that I fall. I retweet them while I'm,

1033
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,530
I don't retweet them anymore because I
don't want them to know that I follow.

1034
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,630
I do. I do read his shit.
It's just so ridiculous.

1035
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,860
Some of his stuff is soak. It's all
anti. Oh, it's either he hates Obama.

1036
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:55,340
I wish I remembered his name.
Joe Summon up something starts with C,

1037
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,180
but he's like one of the dumbest religious
guys online and everything is like

1038
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:03,460
either anti-Obama or anti
evolution or anti, uh,

1039
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,520
the earth is, you know, four
point whatever they think it is.

1040
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:08,810
4.6 billion years old.

1041
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,000
He's convinced it's less than 10,000
years old and he's a real guy. It's not,

1042
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:17,630
it's not, it's not a parody
account. There's this MTV celebrity,

1043
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:20,160
I don't want to say who she is,
but she's always

1044
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,790
on TMZ and it's always her being like,
like,

1045
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,520
don't you know who I am and
getting arrested and like,

1046
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,510
like she's just like this like,

1047
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,220
like privileged white girl
celebrity from MTV. And I,

1048
01:02:33,221 --> 01:02:37,710
I tweeted her something cause he was a
recently she hit a cop or something like

1049
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:40,620
that and she's just that they're drunk
and they're just recording her outside of

1050
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:42,150
a club handcuffed.

1051
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,010
And I tweeted or something and it got a
lot of retweets and last night I was at

1052
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:51,410
the thing and she was there
staring me down. I'm like,
this is it. I can't do this.

1053
01:02:51,411 --> 01:02:53,100
She's going to attack me right now.
And I was,

1054
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,010
that's one of those things that are like,
I wish I never tweeted that.

1055
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,780
Cause now she knows like as an enemy.
Yeah, she's an enemy for no reason.

1056
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,790
Like it was just me. Like, dude,
I should have said that. You know,

1057
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,520
to myself instead.
Right. Tweeting it. Yeah.

1058
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,380
You that you could definitely
create little enemies, you know,

1059
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:13,280
by tweeting something that you think
is going to be funny again to get a big

1060
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:17,240
rise. Right. And then, you
know, you realize, especially
if you get high, right,

1061
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,240
you get really high and you go, why
am I doing this? I'm creating enemies.

1062
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:21,960
What am I doing? Joe's, wait,

1063
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:26,330
I was put it in my notebook and wait
till the morning. That's a good move.

1064
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,870
But sometimes you gotta be on the ball.
You've got to be the first one to attack.

1065
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,530
Yeah. Those days are over. Who
Cares? I took two hits today.

1066
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:36,620
I went to yoga and it was breaking
down my whole life in that yoga class.

1067
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:41,540
Oh my God. The things chat about
things I don't get upset about.

1068
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:46,280
Just I need to be nicer.
Just calm the fuck down too.

1069
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,550
Worked up. I get to, I think I'm
doing too many things in my life.

1070
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,650
I really think that
that's what I'm thinking.

1071
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:56,030
I'm thinking I'm under too much pressure
and stress and even though I'm cool

1072
01:03:56,031 --> 01:03:56,811
about most things,

1073
01:03:56,811 --> 01:04:00,860
like there's certain times where I
have a perfect reaction to something.

1074
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,090
Like I always bring up this
time, whether the guy hit me, uh,

1075
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,720
on the highway and my,
uh,

1076
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,320
my car fucking texting rear
ended me smashed into me.

1077
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,670
But I had gone to yoga that day just
from uncle, a little rainfall felt great.

1078
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,960
I was loved, I loved the world.
I got out, I was fine. I did,

1079
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,480
I wasn't hurt and I wasn't even mad at
the guy went over to him, I go, you okay?

1080
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,920
And he's like, I'm sorry.
You know, I fucked up. I go,
it's okay. We all fuck up.

1081
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:28,580
And then I go, do you have a license?
Cause I don't have a license.

1082
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,940
He didn't have a license, he
was illegal. He's from May call.

1083
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,930
And I thought about it, I said, all
right, I'm outta here. And I just bailed.

1084
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,890
And I said,
I'm not,

1085
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:40,010
I don't want to call the
cops cause I don't want them
to go to jail because look,

1086
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,280
his car's fucked. His car was
fucked. Anyway, his car was totaled.

1087
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,420
He had a civic and he, uh, he, you
know how sometimes you hit the brakes,

1088
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:50,450
your car goes down,
like you go under the car.

1089
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,400
So his car went kind of under my car,
lifted my car up and sent my car flying.

1090
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:58,070
So my car,
what did not have that much damage?

1091
01:04:58,071 --> 01:05:01,760
It was only a beam that needed to
be replaced in the back bumper area,

1092
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,140
but which was all plastic.

1093
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:05,450
So they just put a new piece of plastic
and they replaced the beam and it was

1094
01:05:05,451 --> 01:05:08,210
good to go. I had it back in
a couple of weeks, but, uh,

1095
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,880
I've thought about this total
and you would've ruined his life.

1096
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,840
And he told the cop, no, I would have
had to, they would have had a tow me,

1097
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:19,090
so they would have known. But I thought
about, and I was like, this guy,

1098
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:23,260
you know this guys, he's got a shit. Roll
the dice. He got to shit, roll the dice.

1099
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:27,670
He made a mistake. I'm not hurt like
I'm okay and I can pay for this.

1100
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:30,010
I can figure it out. Like, I'm going
to just get the fuck out of here.

1101
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,350
I just said I'm just gonna go.
All right man. Nice to meet Ya.

1102
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,040
Took a picture of his fake license.
Yeah,

1103
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,340
just in case some weird shit happened
and he said I did something and you know,

1104
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:44,170
you never know and just get out of there.
Apparently he has insurance. I might be,

1105
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,880
I might actually get paid for this,

1106
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,180
but the point being that
the way I reacted to it,

1107
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:51,250
I wish I could react to
it like that all the time,

1108
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:54,370
but I don't know if I would like,
if I'm stressed out,

1109
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,920
I got a bunch of shit going
on and there's blood fucking,

1110
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,160
you hit this boiling point where you
come in on a four or five instead of at a

1111
01:06:02,621 --> 01:06:06,040
zero. He coming in hot already, you know?

1112
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,730
And I was thinking about that while
I'm a in Yoga class. I was like,

1113
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,500
there's times where I'm,

1114
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:16,501
my reaction to the thing is not entirely
warranted by the situation itself,

1115
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,630
but it's more dealing with
all the different shit that
I've got going on in my

1116
01:06:19,631 --> 01:06:23,020
life. It's too many. I have too
many things. This is what I think.

1117
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:25,740
Okay,
this might be crazy,

1118
01:06:25,741 --> 01:06:30,210
but I think this is part of the problems
with police brutality and some of the

1119
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:33,070
mistakes of cops have
made is they come in hot,

1120
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:38,490
their job is tough and other stuff's going
on and then you'd come from one thing

1121
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:41,010
to another and they warrant different

1122
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,250
roles and disciplines and,
and danger levels.

1123
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:51,680
But they coming in not knowing or,
you know,

1124
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,630
fired up their blood pressure.
I've talked to cops,

1125
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:59,520
especially in New York and Chicago where
they're on blood pressure medication

1126
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:04,500
and their families are stressed
out and um, their, their,

1127
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:06,930
their job is more intense
than it ever has been.

1128
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,370
Oh, it's an incredibly intense job.
I couldn't even imagine it. I mean,

1129
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:13,740
do you know cops?
Do you have any friends that are cops?

1130
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,990
I'm getting to know more and more cops.
I've known cops all my life.

1131
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,060
My karate teacher was a cop,

1132
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,610
so is mine. My original cried teacher
was Joe Esposito, Newton, Massachusetts,

1133
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,900
Kelly, Newark, New Jersey.
A lot of cops learn karate.

1134
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:32,280
Italian cops. Exactly right.
Isn't that a, it's just,

1135
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:33,870
it's,

1136
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:38,870
I just think that the job of doing a cop
doing police work is probably not only

1137
01:07:40,261 --> 01:07:42,690
is it not for everybody,
probably too easy to get,

1138
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,450
it's probably too easy to be a cop.
Like some people,

1139
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,100
they don't have the
right mentality for it.

1140
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,630
I want a roast cups from my next comedy.
That was a great idea.

1141
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,100
That's a great idea.
It's not easy. Oh really?

1142
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:01,100
I think la would let you, yeah.
Burbank, Burbank. [inaudible]

1143
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:05,610
tell the story, but maybe,
I don't know. I might do it,

1144
01:08:05,611 --> 01:08:09,990
but I might do a bunch of
precincts. Yeah. Coming in hot,

1145
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,260
so I figured that out in Yoga class.
I just figured out I need to do yoga more.

1146
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,270
I'm going to do something every day
before I go out and face the world every

1147
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,370
day.
Blow offs and stress.

1148
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:27,260
I spent some time and at the beach lately
and that can also help, but that's,

1149
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,423
yeah.

1150
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:32,330
Why do you think people at the water
or so mellow Paul Beach Communities and

1151
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:36,950
mellow? It's just so relaxing,
man. It, it's also humbling.

1152
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,970
Did a week at the Jersey shore and
a few days a Malibu and it just,

1153
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,390
we had some shit fixed
and our kitchen and uh,

1154
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:48,220
so I rented a house for a while in Malibu.
I would never, I would never buy it.

1155
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:49,880
I don't think I'd buy a
house like on the water.

1156
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,560
I think it's fucking crazy that waves come
in. You never know when again, come in.

1157
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:58,580
Yes, we went out. I went out at
night by myself down to the water.

1158
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:00,320
It was scary, dark, scary.

1159
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:05,630
I felt like you're having a trust
with the ocean at any minute.

1160
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,490
It knows they could just swallow you up,

1161
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:11,460
but instead just creeps up to
your feet and just says hi.

1162
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:16,500
Well I was Pam at any second steamrolled
highways that had two floors and one

1163
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:19,100
four was above the water looking down.

1164
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:24,200
But the first floor was like the water
would go right under the fucking bedroom.

1165
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:28,070
Like you would see the waves come in
and you would hear them crash underneath

1166
01:09:28,071 --> 01:09:29,930
you.
And it was dark.

1167
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:33,860
And I'm looking out this window and I
was high as fuck and I was looking out

1168
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:37,640
this window. It's like, oh my God, this
is crack. Can't sleep here. I was like,

1169
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:41,600
this is nuts and I know that this fucking
building's been here for who knows,

1170
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:42,560
10 years,
whatever.

1171
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,590
I don't know that a lot of the house has
been there since the 50s his pictures

1172
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,500
this like there's a one of
those restaurants down there
that has these old black

1173
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:51,860
and white pictures on the wall, but
when you, when you're there at night,

1174
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,630
it looks like a monster and the day it's
like this beautiful friend in the day.

1175
01:09:56,631 --> 01:10:00,800
You look out there like I'd have breakfast
and I'd sit down this little table,

1176
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:04,070
look out the window and eat eggs.
I'm like, God, this is amazing.

1177
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:09,420
Look how beautiful it is just to
be like next to this alien world,

1178
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,150
this beautiful alien world,

1179
01:10:11,151 --> 01:10:15,200
and I'd see sea lions or seals or
whatever the fuck they are and birds.

1180
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,280
Occasionally you'd see a fish splash
around, but like this is so beautiful,

1181
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,450
but at nighttime, goddamn
terrifying, but it's humbling.

1182
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,480
I think that's one of the reasons why
people that live in beach community is so

1183
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:30,470
nice because you just look out and
just smacks you in the face with you.

1184
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:33,200
Ain't shit is so like that.

1185
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:38,530
I was thinking you get as holding a
glass of sparkling water like Perrier or

1186
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:44,660
something out on the beach by myself
and I was half done with it and I just

1187
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:47,480
tossed it down into the ocean.
You just think that's,

1188
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,400
it's such a great equalizer is fancy
cup of Perrier thinks it's so fucking

1189
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,480
important and high and mighty. You just
drop it into an ocean. It's nothing,

1190
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,130
just nothing. It makes no impact. Nothing.

1191
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,050
All beach communities are filled with
mellow people. Right? Pretty much.

1192
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,360
Never heard of an aggressive
beach community, Long Beach. Nah,

1193
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,980
that's like snoop Dogg's, naval
architects, builders, contractors

1194
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,900
could spend 10 years building a skyscraper
and most beautiful people will never

1195
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:23,160
stare at it. And the way they stare at
the ocean, which is in the air, floating,

1196
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,810
splashing. Well, it just gives
you this feeling of like this.

1197
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:30,950
It's a totally different world in
front of you. Alright, Jersey shore it.

1198
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,290
No one's cool there, right? Like that's
not even paying attention. The water,

1199
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,650
they're just doing steroids
and fucking fist pump.

1200
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,550
What happened to that?
How come that show went away?

1201
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:46,290
I don't know which ever bring it
up under the car. Hurricane Sandy.

1202
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:50,610
That's what did it. Oh yeah,
that's right. Did it? No.
Yeah. That beech is fucked. No,

1203
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:53,070
people just got tired.
They just got some back.

1204
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:56,970
I was just down at the Jersey shore.
A lot of construction happening,

1205
01:11:56,971 --> 01:12:00,730
lot of activity, a lot of people out
having fun at the boardwalk, so it was,

1206
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,830
it was great. I can't wait to go
back. I used to do gigs out there.

1207
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,110
I used to do gigs for Bob Gonzo
stationed down there. I don't even do it.

1208
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,160
I didn't get on stage once.
It was,

1209
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,550
the beaches are beautiful
and the weather was perfect.

1210
01:12:14,551 --> 01:12:16,680
The water was just as warm as it is here.

1211
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:19,560
Don't people have a bad opinion of
the Jersey shore though? Don't they?

1212
01:12:19,561 --> 01:12:23,850
Think of it as you go there. It's
just a bunch of Orange Guido's. Yeah.

1213
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,180
Fucking shit out of each other.
It's not like that. Maybe. Maybe.

1214
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,450
It's evolved or maybe that was just
a show showed it in a bad light,

1215
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:33,960
but it was great. There's that showed
this old house, they just did it.

1216
01:12:33,961 --> 01:12:37,020
They did a long special about rebuilding
the Jersey shore and it's really

1217
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:39,570
interesting. I didn't I, that's what
I thought also is just like this,

1218
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,790
like myrtle beach spring break thing
the whole time. He didn't know.

1219
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,160
It's very beautiful there.
While my uncle lives there,

1220
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:48,060
my uncle lives on Jersey
shore. He just sent me a some
drift. What? He's an artist.

1221
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:53,010
Some shit like the Hamptons
or any fancy beautiful beach.

1222
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,170
It's back.
It's done sending them back.

1223
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,660
It doesn't already have a place
down there. I was there last week.

1224
01:12:57,661 --> 01:13:02,250
I sent the picture you guys together and
he has a beautiful a house right on a

1225
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:05,130
lake. I mean he has to
dream. He has a late,

1226
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,700
you walk into Artie Lang's house and the
Jersey shore and if he didn't tell me

1227
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:12,690
he lived there, I would think like Mary
Lou Henner live there is something,

1228
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,390
it's immaculately decorated,
perfect nautical theme,

1229
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:20,220
the white pillows everywhere. There's
no chance. And he's like, yeah,

1230
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:22,260
my sister's a designer.
She did everything.

1231
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,330
So does he stay there all the time or
sometimes I think he's there most of the

1232
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:31,170
time and he has his whole man cave
with all this Thurman Munson themed

1233
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,740
memorabilia and he's just the best.

1234
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:37,470
And he's got a place in Manhattan too.
Is that how he does?

1235
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:41,370
I think he lives a place in
Jersey. Hoboken, right near
Manhattan. Oh that's right.

1236
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:45,150
Yeah. Already can't leave New
Jersey. That's hilarious. No,

1237
01:13:45,151 --> 01:13:47,030
literally has like a
bracelet on his ankle.

1238
01:13:50,370 --> 01:13:54,090
He got, he got visibly upset when I
told them that I don't follow sports.

1239
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:59,400
Like you could see, he was like,
like I was less of a man in his eyes.

1240
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:01,500
Really? Yeah. Yeah, I could see it.

1241
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,730
There's guys that are fucking
crazy sports fanatics. We tell him,

1242
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:05,940
you don't give a shit about sports.

1243
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,840
The only thing that saved
me is I'm actually a sports
commentator, so I'm Kinda,

1244
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,860
I kinda, you know, I fall into the

1245
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,770
Hippie, hipster, whatever category that
he would hate the most. But it was,

1246
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:21,280
he was disappointed in me as
a man. Really? That's strange.

1247
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:24,820
But I guess he does love sports,
man loves it. Well, yeah,

1248
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:28,030
that's ports show that he was doing
for a while with Nick Depaulo.

1249
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,770
I'm getting more into it. Sports, doing
a fantasy football app. Get the fuck out.

1250
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,610
Draft an APP comes out in a few weeks.
Really producing an APP.

1251
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,050
I'm like the voice spokesman of it.
Look at you funny videos.

1252
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,590
That's a good idea. Play fantasy
football and talk shit. Or your friends.

1253
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,740
Do you know football? Do you
understand it? Of course.

1254
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,930
I played high school football. Yeah.
What's that guy's name with a giant arms.

1255
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:54,370
Jamie know that Popeye. What's
his name? Ron Land. Do you know?

1256
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:58,180
He is a picture. Do you know
who he is? I think Ron Landry.

1257
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,880
You obviously don't know
like Jamie knows it.

1258
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,570
Maybe you need a man like Jamie on
your team. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's not.

1259
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:07,960
This fucker knows a lot. Look at this
guy's arms. He showed me this yesterday.

1260
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:11,650
Get the fuck out of here.
What is that?

1261
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:15,190
He said the dude's been busted a few
times for steroids. I said, no way.

1262
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:20,350
He's obviously had no shirt on
over that thing. He just does it.

1263
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,850
Shirt scared shirt just
goes over. Okay. Okay man.

1264
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,930
Jesus Christ. Scroll, Scroll up. What does
that one with him holding the camera up?

1265
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:32,620
He's got the phone up to the far right.
What the fuck is that?

1266
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:37,970
Jesus Christ.
That is an enormous human being.

1267
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:41,110
Didn't even make people like that a
hundred years ago, but he's a safety too.

1268
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:44,730
So those guys are tended to be a little
smaller than like a linebacker alignment.

1269
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,240
How much does that guy way about how tall
is he rather? Uh, I'll find the stats,

1270
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:53,050
but yeah, find a stats if, but if he, it
depends on, I mean he could be like five,

1271
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:57,670
seven and he'd still be 230 pounds. Wow.
Built like that. He's a fucking giant.

1272
01:15:57,671 --> 01:16:01,300
He's beautiful. You like
it? Six feet tall. Two 20.

1273
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,560
It's just an ape filled with
fucking testosterone and fury.

1274
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,020
God Damn,
that's an athlete.

1275
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,610
That's about as strong an athlete as you
get human bins there. He like, you know,

1276
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,260
great slave auction are back in the day.

1277
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:25,500
Look at them that way. But we're all
apes. I'm an eight year an ape waves.

1278
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,400
It's what humans are just saying.

1279
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:31,610
The way you break down a person's physical
appearance. That's what I do. I'm an,

1280
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:35,980
I'm a sports commentator.
If you remember full stick testosterone,

1281
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:39,490
that guy's a fucking dat is a silver back.
That's a silver back gorilla.

1282
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,110
Yams on that guy.

1283
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,210
I mean you'd never had a human being
that was built like that a hundred years

1284
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:48,460
ago.
This is an entirely new era of humanity.

1285
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,200
Like you look at those Greek statues,

1286
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:53,830
those were exaggerated and that was the
best they could imagine in their head.

1287
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:57,680
Those guys are pussies. Every one
of those key Greek guys was good.

1288
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:00,820
It looks like they barely work
out. You know like the, the,

1289
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:05,440
the biggest stud Greek statue.
Like how's it compare to this guy?

1290
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,870
Not even close. Yeah.
Show me a Greek statue.

1291
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:13,110
Show me like the best Greek statue
with the most muscular of all the,

1292
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:18,080
the Romans or the Greeks.
Shit. Some fucking animal.

1293
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,440
I want to see what it looks like cause
I guarantee it didn't look nothing like

1294
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:26,150
that dude. They just didn't even know the
people are capable smuggling these. Wow.

1295
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:28,190
That's actually a pretty big,
that guy's pretty yoked.

1296
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,920
He's pretty studly except
for his little cock.

1297
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:36,260
I wonder if people really did have little
dicks back then or if they just made

1298
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:39,350
them have little dick so that everybody
looking at the sculptures didn't feel

1299
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:42,080
bad because like look at that guy's dead.

1300
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,320
That's an enormous man
with a fat guy's Dick.

1301
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:50,330
That is what like a mushroom
cap and the guy looks huge.

1302
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,320
It looks like the hulk.
I take back everything I said.

1303
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:56,950
I take back everything I said though.
Cause that guy's giant. Look at them.

1304
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:01,970
Does that real? The guys back?
Is that real? Come on. Yeah,
they were really fit, man.

1305
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:06,710
That's real from a computer.
That doesn't seem real to me.

1306
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:11,750
For some reason that we're looking at
this guy's back that is insanely muscular

1307
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:13,160
and it's a sculpture,

1308
01:18:13,161 --> 01:18:16,070
but his ass cheeks are a little too big
and he's holding something in his hands

1309
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:20,120
or you get to play your Nick
Jonas Gilfoyle rent. Come on,

1310
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,410
look at the muscles on that guy's back.

1311
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,930
He looks like Vandelay Silva when
he was fighting in pride. Yeah.

1312
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:31,170
See that guy. That guy's a pussy.
Okay. It looks like a big condos. Yeah.

1313
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,630
It looks like you've never
done a squat in his life.

1314
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:39,140
None of these guys who make
the NFL. No, no fucking way.

1315
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,420
Not with the athletes they have today.

1316
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:45,770
I think we all agree that the NFL athletes
are the most impressive athletes in

1317
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:47,390
all sports. Right? Can we agree on that?

1318
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,240
As far as like horsepower
about what they can do,

1319
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:55,520
the speed coordination,
right. W we all agree and I,

1320
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,410
you know,
obviously I work for the UFC.

1321
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:59,990
I think UFC athletes are
incredibly impressive,

1322
01:18:59,991 --> 01:19:02,480
but as far as like what
they have to be able to do,

1323
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:05,690
UFC athlete has to be able to fight.
If it's championship fight,

1324
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:08,840
you have to be able to fight five rounds,
five minutes each round.

1325
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,900
You just can't do that. If you're built
like an NFL player and you just can't,

1326
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:16,130
you can't do it. It's not possible.
So that is a bodybuilder though.

1327
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,940
That's totally different. That's
modern. That's a modern bodybuilder.

1328
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,420
Like that guy, that guy could never
fight in the UFC match. She would never,

1329
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:26,990
I mean, unless he won in the first
30 seconds, which is possible.

1330
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,010
Does the only way he'd be able to do it,
he just wouldn't have the juice.

1331
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:34,970
Does no way. You'd have the
capacity to fight for five frowns.

1332
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:35,900
There's just no way.

1333
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,730
Muscle or current statutes like new
statutes that are made today of naked men

1334
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:45,620
are their cocks the same size. It's a very
good question. I'm so glad you're here.

1335
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:51,830
Let's go look.
Let's look for giant Cox on naked.

1336
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,470
Homosexual.
Least a lot of rumors times are changing.

1337
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,700
We just a lot of rumors, but what do I
look for that new? That's black cock.

1338
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:06,110
Cause Google. Yeah. This duplo
olive garden. Black Cock. Seven

1339
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:12,390
eat anything around here.
Jerky. We got some Cherokee. No.

1340
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,850
What you want. Oh wait,
we give you some food.

1341
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,310
But if you talk into the microphone way,
he never one's going to be mad at you.

1342
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:18,144
Oh,
I won't.

1343
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:23,730
Jeff Ross trove through
traffic. Did you Uber. Uber.

1344
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,190
Did you have a feel uncomfortable at all?

1345
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,380
Why did you ever get a an
uncomfortable Uber driver? Oh, I,

1346
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,120
it's only annoying when they're, you
know, they want to talk to you about,

1347
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:39,760
you know, they want to come
into the show like, well, like,

1348
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,880
yeah.

1349
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,940
I only hate if you're on a date because
then you have some other dude's just

1350
01:20:43,941 --> 01:20:44,600
listening to your [inaudible]

1351
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,810
bullshit. Oh yeah. You're
trying to get some thanks dude.

1352
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,430
Those cashews are very yummy. All that
stuff's good. Those bars are great.

1353
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:56,460
It's pro bars. Those are the best.
I won't make any noise, but if I do,

1354
01:20:56,461 --> 01:21:00,320
I'm so don't worry about it.
Don't mind having a good time.

1355
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,830
Enjoying the vibe.
Um,

1356
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,720
you were at the roast battle pretty much
every week when you're in town, right?

1357
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:09,230
Yeah.
That was a Jim Carrey last night.

1358
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:13,070
That was the first place that I
went back to when I came back to La,

1359
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,420
came back to the comic store.

1360
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:16,850
The roast battle was one of
the reasons why I did it.

1361
01:21:16,851 --> 01:21:20,450
It's a movement is a movement,
right? It feels like, it feels like,

1362
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:23,240
like I was talking about this
on the message board today.

1363
01:21:23,241 --> 01:21:26,690
Someone was bringing up, uh,
I, it might've been trolling,

1364
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:30,320
I might've got sucked into a troll.
It's actually about the old days.

1365
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:33,610
Guys used to, uh, borrow each
other's jokes and you know,

1366
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,710
it was like a tighter community
back then. It was like, man,

1367
01:21:36,711 --> 01:21:37,580
I don't know about all that,

1368
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:41,280
but I think this is the tightest
community ever for standup.

1369
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,910
I think this is the best
time ever for standup comedy.

1370
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:46,940
I really do as far as
like, I love that. Yeah.

1371
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,830
It's like you love what you just did.
Montreal all comedy

1372
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:52,940
festival. I'm hosting odd ball starting
next week and I love comedians.

1373
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:56,410
I do these festivals because I
love being around comics. Yeah.

1374
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,400
It's like a religion.
I feel like it's a real,

1375
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,620
I feel like I'm a comedian before
I'm anything else. Yeah. Yeah.

1376
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:06,920
I agree with you. I just want to see
comedians hang out with comedians.

1377
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,120
I remember going to a Christmas
party once at Al Roker his house,

1378
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:14,480
if I should tell this, but go
ahead. And it's very fancy.

1379
01:22:14,481 --> 01:22:18,140
Upper East side Christmas party
for charity fundraiser thing.

1380
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:21,200
And I walk in and there's like a,
you know,

1381
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:26,260
people in Tuxedos taking your coat when
you come in and very handing out hors

1382
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:31,991
d'oeuvres and big
beautiful home fireplace,

1383
01:22:32,421 --> 01:22:36,650
Christmas music. And I look over at the
people that coach people. It's like two,

1384
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,750
three people just sitting
there and Chris Rock.

1385
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:43,070
Like he would rather talk to the coat
check people. Then these fancy people.

1386
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,860
He was so bored. And then, and then I
walk in, he's like, he ran over to me.

1387
01:22:47,861 --> 01:22:51,080
He's like, oh my God, a comic. I can
talk to a comic. This is so great.

1388
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,870
It just comics need to talk to comics.

1389
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,810
That's how I felt last night at this
party. It was just like Samsung. Yes.

1390
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,800
I went to this cool Samsung Party
where asap rocky and performed it.

1391
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,890
And that was really cool.
What does that asap rocky is a musician.

1392
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:09,730
He's good. Yeah. Yeah.

1393
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:14,920
Well I live a bad pitches.
That's my fucking problem.
Really. I love bad bitches.

1394
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:18,490
That's my fucking problem. That's what's
the Jeffrey Ross team song. But uh,

1395
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,060
it was, you know, Super Hollywood Douche,
like I hate those kind of people. Uh,

1396
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,100
it was like in a studio lot where I
think right next to Oprah is building a,

1397
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:28,060
so we don't know what studio.

1398
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:32,380
That was some weird studio lot and it
was this humongous party was awesome. Uh,

1399
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,410
Samsung was showing all
their new phones and uh,

1400
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:39,520
I didn't want to talk to anyone because
everyone was like beautiful models and

1401
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:42,460
just like, you know, I was just
sitting there like, this is gross.

1402
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,790
Then I see Stephen Glickman, uh,
across the the room. I'm like,

1403
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,960
I love you.
And I'm just like giving them

1404
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,550
big hug.

1405
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:53,070
It was like the best day of my life just
because I saw a comedian that I knew.

1406
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,910
Yeah. I've been in that
situation before. It's cool.

1407
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:58,610
Those situations are cool when you,
you know, you have that camaraderie,

1408
01:23:58,611 --> 01:24:02,090
you run into someone that you
know. Yeah. The old days baby,

1409
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:07,670
I used to do a news radio right next
to what Greg Geraldo had a sitcom for

1410
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:12,590
awhile and Geraldo Sitcom lawn.
Yeah. They'll be right next door.

1411
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,350
And uh, I'd go out, hang with him.

1412
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,530
We just hang out in the parking lot and
shoot the shit. But it was always like,

1413
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,970
you're not even in an actor,
a comedian. Look how x, right.

1414
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,810
We talk about it and he talked about
how frustrating it was. Cause you know,

1415
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:31,310
trying to do is show his way, all the
producers and every, the, you know,

1416
01:24:31,311 --> 01:24:34,250
the network and all that jazz that you
have to deal with and trying to put

1417
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:38,540
together a sitcom. It was like, you
know, I just run in Emory. Yeah.

1418
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:40,220
There was a few guys like Lanny Clark,

1419
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:43,930
Lenny Clarke was also on the
set on the a lot rather than,

1420
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:47,660
cause he was on that show with John.
What the fuck?

1421
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:51,830
I want to say Lithgow, but
it's not Lithgow. It's the
other guy. Larry cat. Yes.

1422
01:24:51,831 --> 01:24:55,460
Thank you. He was on that show
with John Leora cat to John,

1423
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,920
I guess it was called the John Leora
cat show. And uh, I used to, uh,

1424
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:04,280
run into Lenny, you know,
just run the Lenny. Hey, what
the fuck? How I yeah, yeah.

1425
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,730
I'm doing this fucking show.
This cranky bastard was Lithgow.

1426
01:25:07,731 --> 01:25:11,360
What's fucking scream at everybody?
We'd watch the close circuit monitors.

1427
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:16,280
Lithgow would get mad. Remember?
You're fucking crazy and shit,

1428
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,070
but you know,
you're running into a comic,

1429
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:22,700
whether it's at the airport or anything,
it's, it's a, it's a nice thing.

1430
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:27,140
We're always on the move comics in
an airport on a Sunday or a Thursday.

1431
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,150
Yeah,
that would be a good show.

1432
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,550
Just comics running into
each other at an airport,

1433
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:32,951
a podcast.

1434
01:25:32,951 --> 01:25:36,610
He just gets randomly connected with
another comic that just happens to be at

1435
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:37,510
the same airport.

1436
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,660
Well, if you did that, you know, like
for real, if you want to do a show,

1437
01:25:40,661 --> 01:25:42,400
say like Dallas is a big port,

1438
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:46,750
there's always big ports and you set up
a podcast studio in that port and said,

1439
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,920
you know,
we'll be here.

1440
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,750
We're going to be here from 9:00 AM to
3:00 PM let us know if you're coming

1441
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,540
through. And you know, maybe
you could schedule your layover,

1442
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,300
you could create a studio in
one of those like lounges,

1443
01:26:01,301 --> 01:26:03,920
like the American airline
lounge and then you can help the

1444
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:08,140
community. And he's like, yeah, hey
comedian. Stopped by, you know, the,

1445
01:26:08,141 --> 01:26:13,100
the comedy louder and celebrities and
wants you to do by Kate, by tournament,

1446
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:18,140
by my gate. 67. A like, you know what, you
could do two. You could have one of those,

1447
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:20,150
you know those massage places
where they rub your back.

1448
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:22,820
You have those let you sit in those
chairs that your face goes first.

1449
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,550
You could do that. Like we'd sit
next to each other and get a massage.

1450
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:30,360
Talk some shit. How the microphone
looking up at us. How's uh, those uh,

1451
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,980
Asian ladies a rubbing your back.
Just make it great idea.

1452
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:39,040
It's not a bad idea to just have
people lead that are out on a Gig.

1453
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,570
Right? Where are you going? Here's
the idea. It's okay. You do like,

1454
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:47,770
you do like women have like a little
spa where they get their hands on it.

1455
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:52,010
Just do for guys like guys spa.
Yeah, but you don't want to get,

1456
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:54,920
you want to get your hands done.
No, you don't have to maybe do that,

1457
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:58,070
but others toes done. Did you
get it? You listen to them.

1458
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:01,880
You're going to ever play some ping pong.
That wouldn't be bad.

1459
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:05,180
If there's a spot where you could go
and hang out like a bar, like a little,

1460
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,040
you know the comedy store
has that private bar.

1461
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:11,450
If you could set something like that.
I danced there last night that you dance.

1462
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:16,560
It's so fun there. Yeah, got chew. Don't
worry about it. He's like hold him,

1463
01:27:16,561 --> 01:27:19,890
but he's doing very well done and then
I to gold this long without knowing

1464
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:22,880
what's not about. When I get off
stage, I'll do an hour, hour,

1465
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:25,430
15 minutes when I'm headlining
and I literally will have,

1466
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,540
they'll still be clapping and I'll already
be halfway through a chicken salad on

1467
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:34,160
pita bread. Really? And if you have a
second show you'll do that. You'll eat in,

1468
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:37,920
which I always eat before the first show
we did between the second show was free.

1469
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:41,360
I just need food all the time.
I can't eat before I go on stage.

1470
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:46,220
If I do it slowly go on stage.
If I'm hungry, I lose my
mind. Really. I'm too mean.

1471
01:27:46,221 --> 01:27:50,840
I lose. I just wow. Jeff Ross, all those
little cranky I, it's not fun for me,

1472
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:53,510
but I think it's still funny for the
audience cause I used to have an old

1473
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:53,871
girlfriend.

1474
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:58,871
He used to say the crankier I was the
funnier it was like if I got really mad he

1475
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:02,430
would just be so fun. That's what she
likes. She likes getting dirty. Yeah.

1476
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:08,560
That's all. Yeah. I,

1477
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:12,530
I try, I try to eat before and
I just fall asleep. I like,

1478
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,610
I mean I feel like I'm really tired stage.
You've got to digest that stuff.

1479
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:18,260
Like you would never eat before he fought.

1480
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,070
Even never like have a sandwich
and then go fight ever. So like,

1481
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,350
because you wouldn't have all
your resources, your, your body,

1482
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:27,550
there's a certain amount of your body that
would be breaking down your food. Huh?

1483
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:32,240
I guess, but not quite the same
as telling jokes for an hour.

1484
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,740
Not quite the same, but the energy
level won't be the same. Your,

1485
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:41,330
your energy level, like you, you won't
have as much resources dedicated to like,

1486
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,220
have you ever gone on stage dehydrated?
That's a problem. That's bad.

1487
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:50,480
That's harder for me. I did just been
drinking too much coffee. I haven't slept,

1488
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:52,040
haven't had enough water.

1489
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,330
I was in planning land all day once
all day in the summer, like July.

1490
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,320
It was bad.

1491
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,830
It was fucking hot as shit and I was
there with my kids and we stay the night

1492
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:02,160
there.

1493
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,341
You know,

1494
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:05,970
you get a hotel room at the Disneyland
Hotel and the whole deal and you know

1495
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:07,860
you're,
you're fucking going through the park.

1496
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:11,340
It's hot as shit as a million people.
You might not drink enough water.

1497
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:12,930
And that night, man, I hit the wall.

1498
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,250
I did two shows and the first show
I pulled it off at the second show.

1499
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:20,190
My fucking head was throbbing
and I was thinking of stuff like,

1500
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:22,470
I'm really dehydrated here.
This is not good.

1501
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:25,650
It's probably one of the worst ways
to be on stage. It'd be dehydrated.

1502
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:28,320
He brain just doesn't work right.
She doesn't fire.

1503
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,080
I told him I had that in Iraq.

1504
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:35,410
I got dehydrated and couldn't after a
bunch of shows and traveling and not drink

1505
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:39,870
enough water and over caffeinating to make
up for not sleeping and being nervous.

1506
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:42,300
That was what happened.
At sent me to the infirmary,

1507
01:29:42,301 --> 01:29:43,950
to the medical tent in the middle of,

1508
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:48,750
I think it was Alice sod or Falucia
Jesus Christ with an ivy bag.

1509
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:52,470
How many times you've been over
there? A couple. Yeah. You like it?

1510
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,980
I'm not sure what you mean.
Well, you were saying that you,

1511
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:59,760
it was pretty straight forward question.
I love going to Iraq.

1512
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:03,480
It is so much specially around my
birthday and when I can really party.

1513
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:11,280
You were saying that the great
clubs and Todd you were saying,

1514
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:16,350
you were saying that doing the prison
was a lot like doing a u s o Gig in that

1515
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,940
you're bringing laughs whether
normally aren't any and it's, you know,

1516
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,250
politics and all that and whether
people deserve a show and all that.

1517
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:27,660
You can just put down the side
for a second as a comedian
just going in and that

1518
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:31,920
challenge of making people laugh that
are miserable. I love that. You know,

1519
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:35,880
I feed off that and we're trying to
make my mom laugh when she was sick and

1520
01:30:35,881 --> 01:30:37,280
stuff. You know, just the,

1521
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:42,380
I love that challenge of trying to break
somebody who's just a little frozen.

1522
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:43,683
Mm.

1523
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,780
You like a little little,
little run up hill.

1524
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,100
Yeah. Jeff Ross. Yeah,

1525
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:52,650
I remember being an early in my career
seeing him Buddy Hackett perform.

1526
01:30:52,651 --> 01:30:56,970
I didn't know him, but I knew his
son, Sandy and sandy let me come, uh,

1527
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:01,710
by myself, the end of a run in Atlantic
city and buddy was there the next day,

1528
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:06,711
so I stayed an extra day to see the Buddy
Hackett shell this like kind of a late

1529
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,640
afternoon, early Sunday show. And I
remember buddy right out of the gate,

1530
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,720
saw some lady taking notes.

1531
01:31:14,721 --> 01:31:17,630
She was a reporter and he didn't know
about it ahead of time or whatever.

1532
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,180
He called her a cunt.
Right.

1533
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:24,080
And literally the first 45 seconds of
walking on stage and just the whole

1534
01:31:24,081 --> 01:31:28,600
audience taken. Yeah, she was
mortified. She tried to say,

1535
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:31,610
I'm from the so and so Harold did that.
He just wouldn't hear it.

1536
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:33,860
And he just called her content.

1537
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:39,530
He just put a really weird vibe in the
room right out of the gate. And, you know,

1538
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:44,690
eventually the show went on and,
and it was amazing and I,

1539
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:47,270
but literally a decade later,

1540
01:31:47,271 --> 01:31:52,271
but he became a very close pow and I
could ask him anything and I said that

1541
01:31:52,451 --> 01:31:53,840
you'd never remember this man.

1542
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:57,620
But like 10 years ago in Atlantic city
at the Trump hat, castle, whatever,

1543
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,960
some lady, you know, he's like, wow,

1544
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,610
I go, I go, why would you do that?
Like right away, just for no reason.

1545
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:04,780
Just what was,

1546
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:07,470
how could you imagine what might've
been happening in your head buddy?

1547
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,030
And he's like, he's like,
oh, I do that all the time.

1548
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:12,910
I like to dig myself a hole
just to make it interesting

1549
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:20,620
just to see if I could dig myself out of
the halt. It does make an interesting,

1550
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:25,000
do you do that with new bits? I'll do
the new bits sometimes. How do you mean?

1551
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,160
I keep myself like a pause and a new bit.

1552
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:30,320
I'll give myself like a
fucking dead end where I've,

1553
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,870
I have to come up with some way to get
out of it like a low myself. Anyway,

1554
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,460
sometimes you, Tommy
Sigora says this best, uh,

1555
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:43,240
the best, uh, description of
like when a bid is not that good,

1556
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:45,790
but you kind of jazz it up and
make it good. You try too hard.

1557
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:49,750
He calls a dance moves, you know,
like I'll have a bit, and I, I,

1558
01:32:49,751 --> 01:32:50,531
the way I used to say,

1559
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:53,900
I said I used to call it English
like English and acumen along. Yeah,

1560
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,980
it's spinning around too much. I might,
those balls are spinning around too much.

1561
01:32:56,981 --> 01:33:00,850
It's too much English on this fucking set.
It's just too much nonsense and jazz,

1562
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,640
you know?
But Tommy had a better expression,

1563
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:07,960
dance moves and that's what kind of what
it is sometimes like sometimes a bit,

1564
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,950
it's not that good. Like it's,
it starts out kind of good.

1565
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,740
You have an idea and you're trying
to figure out which way to take it.

1566
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,310
But sometimes you jazz it up too much
with the performance but not enough with

1567
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:20,440
substance and you just kind of
try to figure out what's the,

1568
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:23,200
what's the line between those two things.
You know,

1569
01:33:23,201 --> 01:33:26,890
how to hold you up sometimes when
you know you got something and you're

1570
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:30,310
developing it and you have a couple of
tent poles that maybe you won't need once

1571
01:33:30,311 --> 01:33:35,110
the whole thing's bills. It's
like a, it's like a scaffolding.

1572
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,700
Yes.
That's how I describe it.

1573
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:39,850
The same way I was having a conversation
with Tony Hinchcliffe about this,

1574
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,730
cause it was a subject that,
it was a little kid,

1575
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,440
he was doing a subject that
was kind of mean and I said,

1576
01:33:44,441 --> 01:33:48,160
you're dedicating a lot of time to this
bit that I know you don't really think

1577
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:51,100
like this. Like you don't mean this.
Right. And he goes, no. I'm like,

1578
01:33:51,101 --> 01:33:54,610
well what if somebody has this disease
is in the audience and they hear this or

1579
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:56,350
someone who knows somebody.
I go,

1580
01:33:56,351 --> 01:33:59,290
you're taking all this time and creativity
and you're putting it together with

1581
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,870
something you don't necessarily
believe in. And I said,

1582
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:05,590
you got to think of a bit as like
a subject is the scaffolding.

1583
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:09,280
And then inside that scaffolding you
put all your material and that's what

1584
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:12,070
you're doing. You know? And
when you create a new bit,

1585
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:14,350
sometimes you do have those dance moves.

1586
01:34:14,351 --> 01:34:18,060
Sometimes you do have those and sometimes
I'll just chop them down and leave and

1587
01:34:18,061 --> 01:34:19,450
I'll start it out good.

1588
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:24,451
And I'll just hope there's a pathway
that opens up in my brain when I'm in the

1589
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:28,910
moment and contemplating the bit where
I know there's a lull there and I know I

1590
01:34:28,911 --> 01:34:32,470
got to dig myself out of the lull.
Maybe I'll find it and I don't find it.

1591
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,480
Sometimes I don't find it.
You know,

1592
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:37,750
sometimes like sometimes you'll do a
bit three, four times and you're like,

1593
01:34:37,751 --> 01:34:40,960
I'm ready to abandon this motherfucker.
And then boom,

1594
01:34:40,961 --> 01:34:44,490
something pops up and you're like,
oh, this is it. All this is it.

1595
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,310
You go back to it. Yes. Or you go back
to it. Yeah, he take a little time off.

1596
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,120
Put it aside.
You know what else I noticed?

1597
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:53,290
I don't think this happens
as much anymore, but

1598
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:58,040
you'll have a bit that you're
not. When I was beginning, this

1599
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,210
is good for beginning comics. You
have a bit that's okay. And you know,

1600
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,550
he kind of like it but
it doesn't quite work.

1601
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:09,040
And I went back to old notebooks or
it just came back to me one night. Um,

1602
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,490
and when you become a better performer
and you can sell them more different type

1603
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:17,060
of bit, it's more in your new voice
or your can just sell it better.

1604
01:35:17,061 --> 01:35:22,061
Or you know the English better like you
say and you can go back to an idea that

1605
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:27,380
you, you weren't ready for.
Yeah. Like maybe you didn't
see the the way out, right?

1606
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:30,890
You didn't see the pathway fit with your
bullshit act that you were doing when

1607
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:33,320
you were starting. Yes. I like,

1608
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:35,570
how are you doing this right now
with a fucking mouthful of food?

1609
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:37,790
Like a squirrel,
but you're completely professional.

1610
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:42,440
You tuck it all the side Shit, monks
style and you didn't chew once on the mic.

1611
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,930
Brian Cowen can learn from you.
I've been doing this awhile.

1612
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:51,110
This is my first podcast. Joe
Rogan. Do you have a podcast? No.

1613
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,270
How the fuck is that
possible? I, I don't know.

1614
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:57,590
I could barely work a garage door opener.
This would be really hard for me.

1615
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,850
Just get somebody like Jamie or Brian
to do it so I don't have a fucking

1616
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:07,130
remodeled garage that I can put up.
Three pictures of Elvis.

1617
01:36:07,131 --> 01:36:11,620
Jimmy still trying to figure out
a Rosa Rosa parks. Really? Yeah.

1618
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:15,710
Okay. She was hot. No, no.

1619
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:20,750
Casey. No, you're just
crazy. Now we know your type.

1620
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:25,870
Let the record show al Qaeda has the
same decorators is the Joe Rogan studio.

1621
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:31,370
Really just in the Rosa
parks saying pictures of,

1622
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:35,120
I found out that Hendricks is not the
real fucking Hendricks mugshot from

1623
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:38,810
Toronto. Yeah, sons of bitches. Wow.
They sold this to me and Hawaii too.

1624
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,130
That's a iconic Jimi Hendrix
photo that they stuck on.

1625
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:48,010
The actual writing from when his
mugshot was, I bought the real mugshot.

1626
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:51,560
Jamie, do we have it in the
back? Don't worry about it.

1627
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:56,690
I got the real mugshot from Hendrix, so
that will be replaced with the real one.

1628
01:36:56,691 --> 01:37:00,340
Interesting. So they, my new studio,
I'll take it. You can tell you actually,

1629
01:37:00,341 --> 01:37:02,690
this is all very cool. Thank you. Um,

1630
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,650
do you know a youtube star or have you
ever heard of a guy named Joey grass

1631
01:37:07,651 --> 01:37:12,190
stuff? Uh, grasp this guy right
here. Uh, this guy right here? No.

1632
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:17,460
Uh, so he is like this really super
popular famous Youtube Star I guess.

1633
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:19,110
And there was this guy named Brock Baker,

1634
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,040
a really funny comedian and writer here
in Los Angeles and he makes these really

1635
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:24,660
funny videos called angry man.

1636
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:28,680
And he did this thing and he talks about
this youtube star because he has a book

1637
01:37:28,681 --> 01:37:31,590
out.
And if you read the back of the book,

1638
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,840
what it says on the
back of the book cover,

1639
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,810
it is one of the most
creepiest things ever.

1640
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,920
The guys 24 and all his fans
are like young kids, like,

1641
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:45,360
like eighth grade to like
13, 14, 15. You know,

1642
01:37:45,361 --> 01:37:50,130
kind of like the twilight or kids. That's
his fans. That's his fans. And He's 24,

1643
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:52,770
uh, if you've read the back,
Jamie, do you have it pulled up?

1644
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,130
Because it'd be funnier if
you check this out. Read this

1645
01:37:56,130 --> 01:38:00,630
right here. It's not what you begin that
matters. It's where you end up. Go ahead.

1646
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:02,670
All right.
24 year old Joey,

1647
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:07,020
whatever has captured the hearts of more
than 4 million teens and young adults

1648
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:10,800
through his playful,
sweet and inspirational youtube presence.

1649
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:14,100
Not to mention his sparkling
eyes and perfect hair.

1650
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,200
This is like a book about him and he
has his on the back of his car anyways.

1651
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,910
Uh, Joey wasn't always comfortable in
his skin and in this candid memoir,

1652
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:27,990
he thoughtfully looks back on
his journey from pain to pride,

1653
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:32,790
self doubt to self acceptance.
That's an important message.

1654
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,820
If you just Google this guy's name,

1655
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:39,360
the images that come up is some of
the funniest shit ever cause he,

1656
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:43,740
he really does. Like, he's in love with
his hair. So you just made another enemy.

1657
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,560
Just like you said, you're going
to run it in the next Samsung par.

1658
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,800
Are you going to see this fucking guy?
He's going to want to feed you your teeth.

1659
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,090
It's so funny though. I, I,
I dunno, just look at the
youtube videos. It's hilarious.

1660
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:55,290
He's really addicted to his hair,

1661
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:57,900
what we talked about earlier and just
write that down and think about whether or

1662
01:38:57,901 --> 01:39:00,490
not you want to talk about it.
Right. Make making fun of it. Oh,

1663
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:02,610
yesterday who are really likes his hair,

1664
01:39:02,611 --> 01:39:07,050
but all his pictures on Google are just
perfect hair like this. Okay. Crazy.

1665
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:11,760
Johnny Bravo here. Nevermind.
It's okay. Good. Look at,
it's funny. I'm not going to,

1666
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:15,780
but thank you for your suggestion. You're
going to look at it later. Jeff Ross,

1667
01:39:15,781 --> 01:39:18,210
what do you got going on man? Besides
odd ball, you got some gigs coming up.

1668
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,460
University Rhode Island's coming up. I
think you're doing, that's interesting.

1669
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:24,520
You can do in college is still what?

1670
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:27,630
This fucking big backlash lately the
kids are saying that everybody's too

1671
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:29,430
politically correct to do colleges.
Yeah.

1672
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:30,900
Well Seinfeld doesn't want to do colleges.

1673
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:34,990
Christopher Nolan and I find a
really cool college. Do you think so?

1674
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:37,770
University of Rhode Island's a good spot.
What's a,

1675
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:40,220
did they let you do anything
and get away with anything?

1676
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:41,760
They haven't been given any restrictions.

1677
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:45,270
Do you feel like kids are a little
bit more sensitive these days though?

1678
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:49,230
That's the big people I like.
People are more sensitive.

1679
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,220
Do you think they're more sensitive or
do you think they have the opportunity to

1680
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:58,110
complain more? Both. I
think it's become, you know,

1681
01:39:58,111 --> 01:40:02,040
the egg before the chicken and
the egg because I don't know,

1682
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,163
how's it?

1683
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:09,030
I think people are just looking for
things that everyone feels like a victim.

1684
01:40:09,031 --> 01:40:11,070
Everyone's sounds like
a victim all the time.

1685
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:15,570
I feel offended or I don't have my head
to see this or I'm glad to hear that are,

1686
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:19,680
you know, they found another
guy faking black [inaudible] no,

1687
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,800
I've seen that in other guy.
Part of the black lives matter that

1688
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,680
I feel like people have been
doing this forever. Yeah.

1689
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:31,620
But these are like activists that are
doing it, which is kind of adorable.

1690
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:35,100
It's on Breitbart,
young man named Sean King.

1691
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:39,060
There's another fake black guy,
you know the Rachel Doles all.

1692
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,830
She claimed to be black,

1693
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:43,650
but she was actually white and she
said she identifies with black.

1694
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:47,700
You know that they found another dude who
does the same thing and he's a part of

1695
01:40:47,701 --> 01:40:52,020
the black lives matter. Oh God. Really?

1696
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:54,130
Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting.

1697
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,650
I mean he looks really,
really white and,

1698
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:59,860
but he has that kind of creepy mustache
to some black guys can pull off.

1699
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:04,540
There's his dad. His mom is white as well.
There's photos of him as a young kid,

1700
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,403
totally white,

1701
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:10,210
but talked about his struggles of
being an African American. How's,

1702
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:15,211
he was always bullied and throws a lot
of pictures up against that are black and

1703
01:41:15,401 --> 01:41:17,230
white. And here's the thing, you know,

1704
01:41:17,231 --> 01:41:20,480
there's nothing wrong with being a white
guy that works for black tweeted lot of

1705
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:25,090
my blackness. Then yours,
Daddy said, oh my God, awesome.

1706
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:30,760
He's got black sunglasses on or glasses
and agriculture. What does that,

1707
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:34,870
does that mean? Oh, I
hate those Goddamn popups.

1708
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:37,120
I feel like I'm color blind.
I don't even see,

1709
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,320
I don't even assess people's
race right away. Me Neither, man.

1710
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:46,810
I'm fucking completely colorblind in
the human and natural progression of the

1711
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:51,170
way people think. Just weird, weird people
like this are going to crop up. Whoa.

1712
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:55,420
This guy that I really like,
Milo Yiannopoulos,

1713
01:41:55,421 --> 01:41:59,680
I'm not exactly sure how to say his,
his last name correctly, but it's Nero.

1714
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:04,450
Any r o on a, on Twitter and a,
he's a fucking funny writer man.

1715
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:07,360
And he's a really good speaker
too. He's hilarious on these. Uh,

1716
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:10,450
he does his interview shows and he's,
uh,

1717
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:14,770
he's always like saying logical things
and having logical arguments against

1718
01:42:14,771 --> 01:42:16,690
feminists. If you, uh,

1719
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:21,720
if you like Google some of these Milo
Yiannopoulos and they can't fucking say

1720
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:27,430
anything about him because he's gay
and he has blonde hair and he's super

1721
01:42:27,431 --> 01:42:30,520
articulate. So because he
doesn't look like, you know,

1722
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:32,980
like one of the guys from Jersey
shore, he's not like, you know,

1723
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:37,150
a lot of these guys that are representing
men's rights, they, Kyle look douchey.

1724
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:41,590
You know, they kind of look
like Bros. He's gay. So because,

1725
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:45,520
and he's open about it and he's fabulous
and he's got a great vocabulary.

1726
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:46,683
But when he's,

1727
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:50,980
when he's describing or when he's giving
these arguments in debating rather

1728
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:51,814
these women,

1729
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:55,600
he's crushing them cause it's like it was
talking about diversity in science and

1730
01:42:55,601 --> 01:42:57,100
he's like,
well the cold hard truth is,

1731
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,980
it's not that women are
discouraged from doing science.

1732
01:42:59,981 --> 01:43:01,480
This is a lot of them
aren't attracted to it.

1733
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:05,590
Men and women have different states of
mind and boys and girls when they're

1734
01:43:05,591 --> 01:43:08,680
young, if you give them
like equal access to toys,

1735
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:12,850
boys naturally will gravitate towards
like trucks and cars and girls were

1736
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:16,660
naturally gravitate towards dolls. It
has nothing to do with it. Yeah. Here's,

1737
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:19,720
here's one of them on Sky News.
Why men are better at chess,

1738
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,610
listen to by look at them.

1739
01:43:21,611 --> 01:43:26,611
You feel about being different because
of your hard wired differently.

1740
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:32,350
So it's not something you've
have a failed to hear before.

1741
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:35,380
It just seems to keep cropping up.
Is it necessary?

1742
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:39,970
It's just, it's ridiculous.
It's his 50s thinking, you know,

1743
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:44,350
I mean it's just so ridiculous.
This biological determinism,

1744
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:49,090
frankly, you know, interests
and talent and you know,

1745
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:53,850
passions for particular topics,
subjects or arts,

1746
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,010
whatever. Like they're not
relegated to either gender,

1747
01:43:58,011 --> 01:44:02,390
but unfortunately because of
some stereotypical thinking,

1748
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:06,500
often one gender is encouraged to pursue,
you know,

1749
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:09,410
a sport or an art more so than the other.

1750
01:44:09,730 --> 01:44:13,880
And my colleague at the Telegraph,
Radica Sigourney,

1751
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:18,300
she wrote a piece just this
morning speaking to, um,

1752
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,640
like young girls who play chess and
actually what she found out that they're

1753
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:26,600
dropping out at the age of
12 probably because you know,

1754
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:28,490
they're not encouraged or you know,
there's,

1755
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:31,880
I don't want to me telling them that
it's not for them, it's not called,

1756
01:44:31,881 --> 01:44:33,800
et Cetera, et cetera. So you know,

1757
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:38,450
this hardwired brain staff
like is it's retro sexism,

1758
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:43,100
Barlow, you're not plus
bashed, smiling, laughing.

1759
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,000
Ben and women are wired differently,
have different skills. No,

1760
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:49,940
it doesn't matter in the sense
that they are equal but different.

1761
01:44:49,941 --> 01:44:53,690
But it simply isn't true to say that
there is no difference whatsoever between

1762
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:55,460
the attitudes of men and women.

1763
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:59,780
And it is without question true that
there are some biological differences

1764
01:44:59,781 --> 01:45:02,060
between men and women.
And we know that from our anatomy.

1765
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:06,440
But we also know it from experiments
that we do on young children.

1766
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:08,390
Before they've had the
opportunity to be socialized,

1767
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,940
the sorts of toys that they go for.
And that holds true.

1768
01:45:10,941 --> 01:45:12,500
Actually for them it's the
animal kingdom as well.

1769
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:17,150
Some of the reasons why girls drop out
of stem subjects at college and, uh,

1770
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,100
chess clubs is because they keep losing.

1771
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:22,610
And one of the reasons they keep losing
is that it does seem to be the case that

1772
01:45:22,611 --> 01:45:26,060
chess as a game plays to some of
the male intellectual virtues.

1773
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,370
And when Simon Baron Cohen
talks about this, is he,

1774
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:32,600
the way he describes it as men are good
at systematizing and women are good at

1775
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:37,220
empathizing and there is some reason to
suppose that that may have some basis in

1776
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:38,054
biology.

1777
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:41,390
It's very trendy these days to say
that everything is socially determined,

1778
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:44,900
but that's not what the science says.
And it's not either what common sensors,

1779
01:45:44,901 --> 01:45:46,760
because if it were true these days,

1780
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:49,610
there would be a lot more
representation of women in the sciences,

1781
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:52,700
in astrophysics, in philosophy,
in mathematics, and in chess.

1782
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:57,530
But there isn't so ready. Does
that, does that make sense? That's,

1783
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:01,340
that's done. That chick should just go
home. She just pooped hers just go home.

1784
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:03,920
Cause it's true.
That's the idea.

1785
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:06,230
It says is that saying that men
are better or women are better,

1786
01:46:06,231 --> 01:46:10,940
but the idea that there's no difference
between us and biological determinism is

1787
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:12,590
bullshit.
It's just ridiculous.

1788
01:46:13,130 --> 01:46:16,520
So that dude is hilarious and
he's the guy who busted this guy.

1789
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:21,200
He's the guy who I had the article on
Breitbart about this guy who's actually

1790
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:24,680
white, pretends to be black. He's
great though. I love his writing.

1791
01:46:24,681 --> 01:46:27,530
I love listening to him talk. The
guys just, he nails it every time.

1792
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:32,820
It was hilarious. Yeah. Yeah.
He'll be on soon. He's going,

1793
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:36,590
he'll be on here and a couple of
weeks working something out. Hmm.

1794
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:40,640
Jeffrey Ross is here now though
and now he's had some food.

1795
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:45,200
Expertly eaten off Mike and Nobody
would know anything if you didn't call.

1796
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:50,070
I been all carved up and
rejuvenated and what you did,

1797
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,300
I love how you handled it.
Did it professional,

1798
01:46:52,301 --> 01:46:57,260
got to watch some fucking bullshit
about shit. I don't care about you.

1799
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:00,150
Care about fucking knew.
What do you think about Trump?

1800
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:01,320
What do you think about Trump?

1801
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:06,830
I feel like he has a Charlie sheen
writing is material. We're nature.

1802
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:11,640
Nova loses. I need to be aware as, yeah.

1803
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,490
If he wins. I said this at the comedy
store last night. If he wins a,

1804
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:21,510
it's proof that there's an Illuminati
in this country or he's a part of it or

1805
01:47:21,511 --> 01:47:24,690
he's a part of it. But that seems unlikely
that he's a part of the Illuminati.

1806
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:29,490
Yeah. Why would they want to billionaires
and the Illuminati? He's rogue.

1807
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:33,060
He's on his own. He's fucking crazy.
I've roasted them a couple times. Yeah.

1808
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:35,790
He's a good sport. He doesn't
show it, but he is really,

1809
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,490
what's he like as a person?
Uh,

1810
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:43,050
he's engaging and he likes to ask a
lot of questions about Mexicans. Nah,

1811
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:47,520
we were on a pleasure trip.
Got Into Mara Largo on his plane.

1812
01:47:47,850 --> 01:47:52,020
Me and Bruce Smear Knauf really quite
a while ago. Nice. Be Back in the day.

1813
01:47:52,021 --> 01:47:56,390
I haven't heard that name. And forever. I
was very generous. He, Bruce Knauf. Yeah.

1814
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,350
The proofs and I on,
on Trump's plane.

1815
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:03,600
I remember the Donald in the nineties
yeah. Something like that. No,

1816
01:48:03,601 --> 01:48:07,530
early two thousands I
think. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:08,700
So you're chilling on his plane.

1818
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,380
We go down to Mara Largo you
have in Palm Beach, Florida,

1819
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,670
Donald Trump's golf country club facility.

1820
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:19,500
They're very fancy,
very beautiful.

1821
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:23,760
And he gave us a Cadillac Bruce Tonight
at tool around with for the weekend.

1822
01:48:23,761 --> 01:48:27,870
I did a show on the Saturday night.
Donald brought me up himself.

1823
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:32,340
Really? Not An easy crowd,
I wouldn't think so.

1824
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,800
You know, very formal,
you know the whole thing.

1825
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,050
Bunch a creepy one percenters on Adderall,

1826
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:42,630
but a very,
very elegant and in the end,

1827
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:44,340
very appreciative crowd.

1828
01:48:44,341 --> 01:48:49,320
And I roasted them at the friars club
once when I roasted them on comedy central

1829
01:48:49,321 --> 01:48:50,154
ones.

1830
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:56,100
I remember him not laughing at all for
like three comedians and I went up to him

1831
01:48:56,101 --> 01:48:57,930
and during the commercial
break and I'm like, Donald,

1832
01:48:57,931 --> 01:49:01,560
you have to at least smile so we have
something to cut to other than other

1833
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:04,230
people laughing at you. And he's
like, oh, okay. I get it now.

1834
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:09,330
I think sort of smiling and enjoying
himself a little bit. That's hilarious.

1835
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,820
That's a what? A what a
weird guy. He is, Huh?

1836
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:17,490
He's in a strange there is right there.
Nice and orange.

1837
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:20,070
Yeah. What's the orange all
about? He wears a lot of makeup.

1838
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:25,390
Is that makeup or is that like
Spray Tans Shit from my HDTV,

1839
01:49:25,410 --> 01:49:29,220
I'd always looks like caked on makeup.
He's got the original kissy face.

1840
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:32,740
Go back to the lessor to push,

1841
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:36,150
get a plus on sourpuss but
there he doesn't have it.

1842
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:40,680
So what does he do in the how?
That's powder Donald Trump.

1843
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,650
You think it's possible that he could win?

1844
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:48,270
How close do you think he's going to get?
Oh man,

1845
01:49:49,430 --> 01:49:53,740
he's, he's kind of a shoe in
for the Democrats is what he is.

1846
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:54,760
What do you mean?

1847
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:58,240
Because a lot of people that would vote
Republican are going to vote for him if

1848
01:49:58,241 --> 01:50:02,110
he stays in. If he stays
in, it's gonna make thing.

1849
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,810
Especially if he goes independent,
which is totally possible. Right?

1850
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:09,880
If he goes independent, he could be Ross
Perot in this motherfucker. He could,

1851
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:14,881
a Ross Perot sunk the ship of Herbert
Walker Bush because everybody was torn

1852
01:50:16,481 --> 01:50:17,440
between who to vote for.

1853
01:50:17,441 --> 01:50:20,500
There was a libertarian people that
would have maybe possibly voted more

1854
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:21,520
fiscally conservative.

1855
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:24,340
So they had gone with the Republicans
and instead they went with Ross Perot

1856
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:28,060
cause he was laying it down how the
taxes were and what the fuck was actually

1857
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:32,080
going on. Whereas, uh, that, that
like opened the door for Clinton.

1858
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,790
What do you think about
Bernie Sanders? Uh, like, um,

1859
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,320
like what he's saying about education
and all I fucking hate when people say,

1860
01:50:38,321 --> 01:50:40,420
you know, yeah, that's great.
Good at fucking people.

1861
01:50:40,421 --> 01:50:43,870
Be Nudge gay on my tax dollars.
What about more tax dollars?

1862
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:45,850
What about war that you know,

1863
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:49,110
how much more it costs to go to war than
it costs to educate people? You know,

1864
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,300
don't you think it would be better if we
had less people that were uneducated in

1865
01:50:52,301 --> 01:50:56,290
this country or if we had less people
that were leaving college in fucking

1866
01:50:56,291 --> 01:51:00,760
massive debt? If you're a kid,
okay, if you're 18 to 21 years old,

1867
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:02,170
which is most people that are in college,

1868
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:06,310
you don't need to be saddled down with
hundreds of thousands of dollars in

1869
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:09,400
education debt. That's
fucking gross. It's gross.

1870
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:13,420
And it's stupid and it speaks to
poor management of our civilization.

1871
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:17,800
That's what I think about our situation
in America when it comes to colleges and

1872
01:51:17,801 --> 01:51:22,180
the amount of money that
kids get straddled down with
saddled down rather with

1873
01:51:22,181 --> 01:51:24,990
debt, they're fucked. You
know, especially if you go,

1874
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,250
if you talked to someone who goes to
medical school, Jesus Christ, right?

1875
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:29,950
My friend was,

1876
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:34,720
he was hundreds of thousands of
dollars in debt before he, he,

1877
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,670
before he left a medical school,

1878
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,760
hundreds of thousands
of dollars just fucked.

1879
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,760
Like it takes you forever to make that
money because you don't just make the

1880
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:43,960
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1881
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:48,580
You gotta make a living too
and incentivize you to deal
with the system the way

1882
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:53,080
it is and not adapt to some new, yeah,
health plan in this country, whatever.

1883
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:56,740
You've just got to get your nut while
it becomes a game becomes a game.

1884
01:51:56,741 --> 01:51:59,260
Just like the cop thing, we're
talking about the comp thing, cops,

1885
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:02,500
it becomes a game of convicting people,
going after people, convicting them,

1886
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:05,590
getting the win, getting the
victory. Well with doctors,

1887
01:52:05,591 --> 01:52:09,160
it becomes a matter of getting
people to have surgery. I had um,

1888
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:11,920
a friend of mine telling me he
started when he was 16 years old,

1889
01:52:11,921 --> 01:52:16,280
he was working as a like a
like some vacation resort,
you know, he's working on,

1890
01:52:16,281 --> 01:52:19,720
it's like somebody who works at the
resort and he said he overheard these

1891
01:52:19,721 --> 01:52:24,550
fucking doctors talking about talking
someone into getting an operation and they

1892
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:27,550
were going chit chain. They were
just talking about how the, you know,

1893
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:29,910
I talked him into getting this
and that means I get this,

1894
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,370
like they were talking about it like a
guy who was talking about selling Chevys.

1895
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:37,090
It's like [inaudible] these all
doctors that they were together.

1896
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,490
So just like comics would get
together and shoot the shit.

1897
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:41,830
Doctors get together and shoot the shit.
What did you do?

1898
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:46,790
I told him I got a fucking fake knee
given each other knock goals, any goes.

1899
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,150
It changed forever the way I thought
about doctors. He goes, I, I left.

1900
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,710
You know what didn't work there anymore.

1901
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:54,800
I never thought about doctors the same
way because of that conversation those

1902
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:58,130
guys had. I would've never been privy
to that in any of the circumstances.

1903
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:02,990
But a few guys sitting around at a resort
having a couple of cocktails, again,

1904
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:06,590
a little loose with the lip, he found
out what they were really all about.

1905
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:10,730
It's because they're fucked. They're
fucking, they're, they're, they're fucked.

1906
01:53:10,731 --> 01:53:14,780
Not just with the amount of money that
they have to pay for their education,

1907
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:18,140
but also malpractice insurance is crazy.

1908
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:23,270
My cousin is a surgeon. He was in
practice in New Jersey for years and said,

1909
01:53:23,271 --> 01:53:26,480
fuck it. I'm going to work for
an emergency room where I share.

1910
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:31,580
And it just took a lot of pressure
off him in his life and I think he got

1911
01:53:31,581 --> 01:53:35,480
happier and probably became
a better doctor. Yeah,

1912
01:53:35,481 --> 01:53:38,650
well that's what I think a lot of
responsibility, a lot of red, you know,

1913
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:42,920
constant work to run the practice,
act yourself.

1914
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,940
It is. It is. And you know, people
do do need to be protected. I mean,

1915
01:53:46,941 --> 01:53:48,140
there are doctors at fuck up.

1916
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:52,030
We showed that lady who got her feet
fucking amputated in her hands amputated

1917
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,090
and they fucked up.
But she,

1918
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:56,630
they'd literally amputated the
wrong person's feet and hands.

1919
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:00,080
He's fucked up.

1920
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,130
You see this Sarah Silverman, uh, Bernie
Sanders video. She did a speech for him.

1921
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:06,110
It was really powerful and it,

1922
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:10,880
and it's really cool that she did that
because you know, uh, Bernie somebody,

1923
01:54:10,881 --> 01:54:15,590
I think a lot of people, younger
people, uh, would like also like,

1924
01:54:15,591 --> 01:54:19,020
cause I'm Facebook, a lot of the
younger people I'm friends with, uh,

1925
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,110
or always posting burns.

1926
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:24,520
My friend's a little kids, man. The fuck's
going on talking to six year olds. No,

1927
01:54:25,990 --> 01:54:26,950
but did you see the uh,

1928
01:54:26,951 --> 01:54:30,610
the giant rallies that he's put
together and including one in la?

1929
01:54:30,611 --> 01:54:34,450
There's like 18,000 people. So you have
them in la. That's great. Well the,

1930
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,040
he gives you a hope that there's some,

1931
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:40,180
someone that represents
a more open minded,

1932
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:44,230
a more current point of view,
I think. And I think, you know,

1933
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:48,310
there's this fucking like Ted Cruz and
all these people that are running and

1934
01:54:48,311 --> 01:54:51,730
they're like, you're like, Ooh, I like
is you like you look at them and you go,

1935
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:55,960
this guy can't win Kenny, can
he win? Lucky you seek guys
like that and you go, oh,

1936
01:54:55,961 --> 01:55:00,670
come on Bri. Is this real like Chris
Christie? Is that Breal it? Can he really,

1937
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:05,690
when you get more standoffish
and scared by it than anything,

1938
01:55:05,871 --> 01:55:09,460
he had to run because of all
the scandals he had. Otherwise,

1939
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:12,060
what made him seem guilty really,
but I think,

1940
01:55:12,061 --> 01:55:16,120
I think he had had to run node or
to go, everything's fine. Yeah.

1941
01:55:16,690 --> 01:55:20,950
That's an interesting way of looking at
it. I'm from New Jersey, just me too.

1942
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:25,330
I was born in Newark, me to
shut the fuck up. That's crazy.

1943
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:28,930
When we born 65 you're older than me.

1944
01:55:29,110 --> 01:55:34,110
67 August 11 September 13th Jesus Christ
basically two years apart from each

1945
01:55:35,831 --> 01:55:40,780
other, pal. Here we are. Same Hospital.
Maybe. What hospital? Beth Israel.

1946
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:42,340
Is that the name of it?
I don't even remember.

1947
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:44,850
I was hoping would say something and
I go, that sounds like mine. Yeah.

1948
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:49,260
I'll have to ask my mom. You guys
didn't go like know each other at all?

1949
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:54,410
We met each other in New York in like
1990 maybe 91 when did you start?

1950
01:55:55,321 --> 01:56:00,060
What year did you start doing
stay? A April fool's day? 1989 wow.

1951
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:04,950
Yeah, I started um, in 88, August 27th,

1952
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:09,300
1988 stitches Boston
and uh,

1953
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:11,400
I made it to New York somewhere on 90 91.

1954
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:16,320
It was probably when I met you back it
up at catch a rising star. Ah, it didn't,

1955
01:56:16,321 --> 01:56:20,850
we meet at a Boston comedy maybe.
Probably met hosts there and do spots.

1956
01:56:20,851 --> 01:56:23,910
There is a great little spot. It wasn't,
it was good. That was a great little spot.

1957
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,980
That was one of those really tiny rooms.

1958
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:31,370
Like that was a 90 cedar like maybe
didn't even see 90 probably something like

1959
01:56:31,681 --> 01:56:35,640
that. Maybe a little more in the villa.
They say 120, but I could be a crazy,

1960
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:38,910
let's say a hundred. Yeah,
it was a great little spot.

1961
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:41,070
Charlie Barnett,

1962
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:43,460
there's a cool article about him
in the New York Times last week.

1963
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,870
Trolley Bailey who died of
AIDS. Sad, sad, sad story.

1964
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,193
But

1965
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:53,560
he was the king of the park in Washington
Square Park and he would go on at that

1966
01:56:53,561 --> 01:56:55,660
Boston comedy club and the comedy cellar.

1967
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:59,250
Well he would do a lot of
sets, uh, out on the street.

1968
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,860
When we do shows in the street,
he'd throw his hat down and uh,

1969
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:04,710
Dave Chappelle used to like,
he learned from him. Right.

1970
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:07,220
Chappelle used to do a lot
of shows like that where he,

1971
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:11,040
I saw him do it in Montreal. We did a
show at club soda. I Remember Club Soda.

1972
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:14,270
It's still there. Yeah, it's a call
that something different now, isn't it?

1973
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:16,830
I think so. Anyway, they did a,

1974
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:21,831
we did a show at club soda and then
outside Dave just starts just like gather

1975
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,570
round, gather round, and
he starts doing standup.

1976
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:26,560
Got All that from Charlie.
Yeah.

1977
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:30,760
Dave and I both lived on the sides of
that park and we used to watch Charlie all

1978
01:57:30,761 --> 01:57:33,850
the time.
And then I think when Charlie passed away,

1979
01:57:33,851 --> 01:57:38,320
Dave kind took over that mantle in the
fountain on the weekends and sometimes

1980
01:57:38,321 --> 01:57:41,950
during the week and he really found
his voice I think in that park.

1981
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:45,940
So you guys used to go and watch Charlie
perform in the powers and just hang out

1982
01:57:45,941 --> 01:57:48,760
with like, it was great. It was, you know,

1983
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:54,160
you had to get your work done back
then we lived in small apartments. He,

1984
01:57:54,190 --> 01:57:56,320
there were no cell phones and you weren't,

1985
01:57:56,500 --> 01:58:00,610
you had to do whatever you were going to
do. If there was an email or phone call,

1986
01:58:00,611 --> 01:58:03,520
you had your phone in your house and
you went and did all that and you left

1987
01:58:03,521 --> 01:58:07,420
messages and got messy and you went out
and when you were out you were present

1988
01:58:07,421 --> 01:58:09,820
in the moment and you are
loving every second of it.

1989
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:14,290
Dave and I would hang around Washington
square park and try to talk to Nyu girls

1990
01:58:14,291 --> 01:58:19,060
who are studying and whatever we could
do and find some weed and we would

1991
01:58:19,061 --> 01:58:23,560
brainstorm and write jokes and we'd eat
lunch in the park and listen to music.

1992
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:26,710
There was always a,
the acrobats were in the park and,

1993
01:58:27,110 --> 01:58:30,970
and masterly karate,
he comic would come.

1994
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:35,450
And Charlie Barnett,
this guy that was just hilarious would,

1995
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:39,520
you know, like you said, he would
jump up on the fountain show time.

1996
01:58:39,521 --> 01:58:42,160
It's showtime and all
jokes are real simple

1997
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,880
and he could work the crowd. A
homeless guy walks by, he had a joke.

1998
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:50,050
Japanese tourists walks by. He
had a joke in mimic him, you know,

1999
01:58:50,051 --> 01:58:54,820
and you know, uh, it was
a great show for anyone.

2000
01:58:55,450 --> 01:58:58,750
Eight to 80, rich or poor. Even
if you don't speak English,

2001
01:58:58,751 --> 01:59:03,660
you're laughing at Charlie. He
was so physical and funny and, and

2002
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:09,120
it was a great time. I remember
there were riots in Los Angeles.

2003
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:13,360
It might've been Rodney king and we
got warnings in New York to be careful.

2004
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:17,350
It might be riots in New York and
trolley. Walk me home. He's like, yeah,

2005
01:59:17,351 --> 01:59:20,230
I'm going to have your end word walk,
walking home.

2006
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:26,560
Just really endearing. And I loved him.
He was what? He was supposed to do,

2007
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:30,550
siren live. But apparently when he got
there they realized that he couldn't read.

2008
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:34,060
Yeah. It's kind of a crazy
story, you know? I mean they,

2009
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:37,660
he was like a hot comic.
A lot of people wanted him to do things,

2010
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:42,790
but he didn't know how to read.
I don't know. He was super,

2011
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:46,290
super funny. It's interesting
that he had that style, you know,

2012
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:51,400
that style influenced a lot of people,
that style of like doing street comedy,

2013
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:54,340
you know,
just gathering a crowd out of nowhere.

2014
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:57,430
I never had the guts to
go on outside like that,

2015
01:59:57,431 --> 02:00:01,000
but Chappelle watched them and watched
them and watched him and Charlie sort of

2016
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:05,590
bringing them up every now and then he
let them do a few minutes and eventually

2017
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:10,600
Dave, that just became one of his
chapters. It was amazing to watch.

2018
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:14,890
Charlie was loud and his
jokes were really short.

2019
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:19,270
Dave was more soft spoken
and his jokes were longer.

2020
02:00:19,490 --> 02:00:24,250
To see that in the park was fascinating
because the park had to come to Dave a

2021
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:29,251
little bit and you've really saw at
least I really saw having hung out there

2022
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:32,380
every night that every day.
You know,

2023
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:36,160
sometimes Dave would do a few couple of
shows on a Sunday in the park and he'd

2024
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:41,161
make real fans and he got a real sense
of who he was right there doing that.

2025
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,860
I mean it was magic to see uh,

2026
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:51,690
a young genius in the middle of the public
just being him and having the public

2027
02:00:52,721 --> 02:00:55,510
come to him gravitate to him.
Uh,

2028
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:59,950
it was once in a lifetime thing to say.
That's cool.

2029
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:03,580
I got a chance to see him perform
at catch a rising star when he was,

2030
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:07,030
he might've been 18 thing.
How old's Dave now

2031
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:09,970
don't ask.

2032
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:14,830
Look on the fucking computer cause
you got a computer in front of 45.

2033
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:16,510
How it is stage of Hill.

2034
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:23,710
Okay, so he's six years,
seven years younger than me.

2035
02:01:24,190 --> 02:01:25,810
So that doesn't even make sense.

2036
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:30,940
So cause I was only like 23
how, how's that? Is that true?

2037
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:35,380
Maybe he didn't get that right.
41 that doesn't make sense.

2038
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:39,980
He's 42 because he was born August 24th,
1973 and

2039
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,980
I was born in 74 and I'm 41
means he turns 45 days from now.

2040
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:50,330
This is the 24th, 1973 though.
He's 42 next week. Next week.

2041
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:52,090
Next week is 42.

2042
02:01:55,060 --> 02:02:00,020
He got mad, dammit. My
math skills. Uh, so,

2043
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:04,610
uh, so if he's 42, um, I must fuck man,

2044
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:07,460
that doesn't make any sense.
I guess maybe I was too.

2045
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,990
So He's six years younger
than me, so I was, man,

2046
02:02:11,991 --> 02:02:15,440
that seems weird because that
was really early twenties.

2047
02:02:15,441 --> 02:02:19,650
I was like 21 or 22 at the most.
I was 24.

2048
02:02:19,651 --> 02:02:24,530
I was doing comedy is high schools too.
Yeah, I guess he was 18 and I was 24.

2049
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:28,010
That, that makes sense now
that I think about it. But, uh,

2050
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:31,310
I got a chance to see him at catch
a rising star. I was like, wow,

2051
02:02:31,311 --> 02:02:32,750
what a precocious young man.

2052
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:38,060
He was like so advanced for his
age and it was a a lot like, um,

2053
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:43,310
uh, Tony Woods. I remember Tony
Woods or also from DC. Hilarious guy.

2054
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:46,520
I think Tony and him
probably work together

2055
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,510
together. I think they will fully
admit that he was influenced by Tony.

2056
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:55,120
Tony. They were, you know, they were good
buddies. I think they still are. Yeah.

2057
02:02:55,810 --> 02:03:00,640
Um, you always had this love for
the older comics, like always.

2058
02:03:00,641 --> 02:03:03,820
I remember that like you were one of the
first guys going to the friars club and

2059
02:03:03,821 --> 02:03:04,121
I was like,

2060
02:03:04,121 --> 02:03:07,330
look at Jeff and his fucking twenties
is hanging out the Friar's club.

2061
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:11,960
I a love for all comics and that's where
the older comics were and they had,

2062
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:15,350
they were smart.
I learned a lot just about how life works.

2063
02:03:15,351 --> 02:03:17,060
Not just show business.
That's obvious.

2064
02:03:17,061 --> 02:03:19,070
You get to talk to an older
comic about show business.

2065
02:03:19,071 --> 02:03:24,071
But I would talk to Buddy Hackett for it
hours about guns and pussy and politics

2066
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:29,240
and travel and food and booze.
And he knew everything.

2067
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:34,800
Isn't it weird that there's a club Friar's
club like dead dedicated Comedians,

2068
02:03:34,801 --> 02:03:35,600
club

2069
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:40,160
comedy show business? I see politicians
and musicians, they're agents, lawyers.

2070
02:03:40,161 --> 02:03:42,410
Is that still going on?
Thriving?

2071
02:03:42,411 --> 02:03:46,490
The Friar's club on 55th street between
park and Madison in New York City.

2072
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:50,300
So it's not just comics? No, it
wasn't always just comics. No,

2073
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:54,890
it's well known for the roast
comics are identified with it,

2074
02:03:54,891 --> 02:03:57,890
but it's a fraternity for show business,

2075
02:03:57,891 --> 02:04:02,730
basically a show business themed club
and it's in New York and in La is the one

2076
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,620
and only in New York. Only in wasn't la
for a long, long time, but not anymore.

2077
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:09,650
When did it, uh, when Milton Berle
died had kind of died with him.

2078
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:11,810
What year was that?
10 years ago I think.

2079
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:13,110
Hmm.
Wow.

2080
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:18,190
You ever meet Bob Hope? I never met Bob
Hope. And that's, uh, I met him once.

2081
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:22,420
What was that like? I was just a
kid, but he was very nice. He, uh,

2082
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:25,990
he was golfing and I was at
the memorial tournament and uh,

2083
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:29,380
there was this huge crowd of people
and he was just walking by and he just

2084
02:04:29,381 --> 02:04:32,230
looked over at me for some reason,
just walked up to me and goes, hey kid.

2085
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:37,410
And he signed my, uh, uh, like the
little paper thing and then just away.

2086
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:38,040
Didn't take anyone

2087
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,820
else's like photos or a sign,
anyone else's shit.

2088
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:45,420
I didn't even do anything different.
Like he just came right up. It was weird.

2089
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:49,680
Well back in those days there was not
that many photos because you didn't have a

2090
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:53,750
camera on me when I met
Bob hope everybody's got a
camera on them now I'm at

2091
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:54,390
honey young men,

2092
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:58,200
Henny Youngman when I was a little kid
and he gave me a card and I still have it.

2093
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:02,220
I mean I kinda like that charity
in your pocket. You just pointed.

2094
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:06,570
You would just reach for your wallet.
Do you still have it? No, I do,

2095
02:05:06,571 --> 02:05:10,260
but not on me. It was a music note
with his name, with his autograph.

2096
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:15,240
He played violin and his, actually,
he had a music. Take my wife,

2097
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:19,380
take my wife please.
He was a funny guy. He,

2098
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:22,560
his picture is still hanging up at
the friars club by Leroy Neiman.

2099
02:05:22,561 --> 02:05:25,530
A beautiful painting. There's
no, it's like a living,

2100
02:05:25,531 --> 02:05:27,600
breathing museum of show business

2101
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:30,930
places like that in la anymore.
No. Too Bad, Huh? Yeah.

2102
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:34,650
Or they're that many old comics
that are still kicking around.

2103
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:39,800
Well, you know there's always
an an old comic. Yeah. Yeah.

2104
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:43,590
He might not be from the Dean
Martin from Fryers, you know,

2105
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:47,750
Co celebrity roast era,
but there's always a new old comic.

2106
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:50,670
Have you ever seen some of the memorabilia
they have laying around at the store

2107
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:53,400
from back when it used to be Ciro's
and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis used to

2108
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:54,810
perform that haven't,
oh,

2109
02:05:54,811 --> 02:05:58,590
you got to go into the office and see
some of the cool posters and that old ciro

2110
02:05:58,591 --> 02:06:02,970
sign was Bugsy Siegel's
joint. Pretty wild. Fuck all.

2111
02:06:02,971 --> 02:06:05,370
That's why everybody thinks it's haunted.
They think so many people were killed.

2112
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:10,260
There is a tunnel in the back of the
comedy store that did they close it off as

2113
02:06:10,261 --> 02:06:11,094
it closed off?

2114
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:14,120
Yeah, it's closed off by
concrete I think. Right?

2115
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,330
Something,
I dunno,

2116
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:19,260
but there was a tunnel that went from
the comedy store up the hill to a house

2117
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:23,070
that like people could escape through
where they could fucking move shit too.

2118
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:23,671
You know,

2119
02:06:23,671 --> 02:06:27,450
the comedy store is just
filled with catacombs and
says fucking so clustered and

2120
02:06:27,451 --> 02:06:29,760
confusing. If you don't know
your way around that place.

2121
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:34,520
Of your some cop and we'll confirm Meyer
Lansky and he fucking just skirts out

2122
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:38,940
the back and I've seen both the hill and
stuff. That's what it looked like. Wow.

2123
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:44,110
Go big screen on that. Fuck man.
Look at that. That's the main rule,

2124
02:06:44,111 --> 02:06:48,330
man. Holy Shit. How weird is that?

2125
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:50,610
Because you kind of
recognize it a little bit.

2126
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,820
It's like Jessica Rabbit should
come out and start singing,

2127
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:58,230
which probably would be dead back then
or some facsimile. Whoa, look at that.

2128
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:00,810
That's what the stage looks like.

2129
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:07,280
Maybe that might not be the
same place that seems off,

2130
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:11,810
but the other one was
Ciro's, right? Yeah. Wow.

2131
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:16,820
Who was the girl? A stripper stripper.
Lil Saints for, what was her name?

2132
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:20,840
Let's see here. Lili St Cyr. See
why are, how do you say that?

2133
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:25,550
Performing at Ciro's nightclub.
A stripper at Ciro's. Wow.

2134
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:26,540
How weird.

2135
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:31,610
Great. What are these old ladies
watching this? It looked like,

2136
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:33,920
scroll down and look at the photo down.
Look at that.

2137
02:07:33,921 --> 02:07:36,010
That's the fucking front
of store, man. That's

2138
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,610
nuts.
That is not God.

2139
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:42,970
It looks so similar to where
it looks like that car.

2140
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:47,800
That's a cool old car. My those cars
are worth a fuck load of money. Now.

2141
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,180
That house isn't there anymore.
Right.

2142
02:07:49,181 --> 02:07:53,260
That's where the hotel is to the
right of it or chop their pitch down.

2143
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:56,860
But that's definitely the store.
Like the patio there. Still intact.

2144
02:07:56,920 --> 02:08:01,000
Look at the sign. Sammy Davis
Jr. Wow. Who's that guy?

2145
02:08:01,001 --> 02:08:05,500
Will Mastin? That was his
dad was it? Yeah. Really.

2146
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:10,390
His uncle, that was his uncle he
worked with. Wow. Look at that.

2147
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:14,830
Everybody pulling in the front.
Fuck. That's crazy to see.

2148
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:18,490
It's crazy to see a plug. That's
the fucking back parking lot, man.

2149
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:22,420
That's the side area.
Jesus Christ.

2150
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:27,610
That is so weird. It's so weird
to see that place like that. Wait,

2151
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:30,640
so that's where the belly room
is, right? I think, isn't it?

2152
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:34,330
Yeah.
I mean doesn't that look like the corner?

2153
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:40,250
It looks totally like the corner and so
I guess there's a sign in the front or

2154
02:08:40,251 --> 02:08:44,260
was it the front of the building know
that has to be mark as a front of the

2155
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:47,740
building. Yeah, that's up front. They
just, it just looked way different.

2156
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:51,730
It was just set up way
different. Wow. It's amazing.

2157
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:56,020
There's so much history in that place,
that place it feels like like comedy,

2158
02:08:56,021 --> 02:08:57,250
musical chairs too.

2159
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,190
Cause it feels like the music's going to
stop and everyone's going to be really

2160
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:04,930
sad because when Mitzi dies, who knows
what that place is going to become?

2161
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:08,340
What is it? Who is that guy?
What the fuck was that? What was,

2162
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,960
what the hell is that?
What is that guy doing when his dick

2163
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:15,150
as he thrown a girl up in the air.
Okay.

2164
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:20,200
He's got his hands over
his Dick Doing Voodoo.

2165
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:24,850
He's barefoot like guys barefoot and
he's throwing that woman in the air.

2166
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:28,660
Wow.
It's crazy.

2167
02:09:28,661 --> 02:09:31,030
I wonder if anybody's ever
done a documentary on Ciro's.

2168
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:36,550
New York doesn't really have a club like
that. Huh? They don't have an old club.

2169
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:39,490
Like what's the oldest club in New York?
Comedy cellar.

2170
02:09:40,090 --> 02:09:41,590
But that's like the 80s right?

2171
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:45,490
No settles seventies that's pretty old.

2172
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:49,990
So seller is the oldest place you think
so a comic strips have been here a long

2173
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:54,520
time, but nothing is like, this catch
was great. That was a great little room.

2174
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:58,240
That was a great little spot,
man. This is freaking me out.

2175
02:09:58,280 --> 02:10:01,510
These photos of Ciro's you,
you go back and forth,

2176
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:04,000
you go back and forth from New
York to La and New York and La.

2177
02:10:04,001 --> 02:10:08,200
I'm bi-coastal so you just have fun.
Just do whatever the fuck you want. Well,

2178
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:09,910
I mean kind of live in a dream Jeff Ross,

2179
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:13,930
things are good but you kind of live
in a dream, you know the way you do it.

2180
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:14,640
It just,

2181
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,860
I see you dick and pictures like there
was a picture of you the other day with

2182
02:10:17,861 --> 02:10:21,070
Ray Romano and the seller and then boom,
all of a sudden you're at the store.

2183
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:25,630
You know like you would just hop back
and forth and Ari's doing that to ours.

2184
02:10:25,660 --> 02:10:29,050
Your peers doing that too? I
like it man. I like, you know,

2185
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:34,130
you make the world smaller and I don't,
I'm happy

2186
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:38,660
in both places. I like to move
around. I like, I like life on both.

2187
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,210
I don't know.
Where do you like performing better?

2188
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:47,570
I don't know. I don't, I guess
generally I like New York as a city,

2189
02:10:47,571 --> 02:10:50,360
but I have all my friends
out here and I don't know.

2190
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:52,970
Do you keep an apartment out here?
I have a house here.

2191
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:56,600
So you have a house here in a place
back there to get she fucking animal.

2192
02:10:58,030 --> 02:11:02,630
I like it. Whatever happened to the burn.
What happened? Comedy Central One. Yeah.

2193
02:11:02,631 --> 02:11:06,500
They didn't make it after two seasons.
That was a fun show. Yeah. So fun.

2194
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:10,760
Fucking love that. But you'd be tied
down then you have to stay here.

2195
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:14,090
That's all right. That's not what a
dinner for that and all my buddies,

2196
02:11:14,091 --> 02:11:17,060
they're working. It was awesome.
You got anything going on right now?

2197
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:20,630
Working on the next special and when
a roast cops, right? He told about,

2198
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:21,491
talked about that earlier.

2199
02:11:21,491 --> 02:11:26,491
Hosts the odd ball tour with Amy and Aziz
and among kingdom couple of new ideas

2200
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:33,410
coming up. Things are good, man. It's good
to see you buddy. It's just so much fun,

2201
02:11:33,411 --> 02:11:37,010
dude. You seem like you seem
overwhelmed. What do you mean?

2202
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:45,410
He's just very low key? Very low key.
She ever meet Steve Martin? Uh, no.

2203
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:47,990
Never met Steve Martin.
Is there a comic that you want to meet,

2204
02:11:47,991 --> 02:11:52,250
do you haven't met? Oh boy. I never
met Woody Allen. That would be cool.

2205
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:56,060
What do you think that conversation would
be like? I had to keep it about comedy.

2206
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:57,133
Yeah,
you'd have to.

2207
02:11:57,990 --> 02:12:02,200
If you ventured into girls that
would get a little weird sweaty.

2208
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:06,590
It'd be a fun conversation.
You think so? I think he would.

2209
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:09,620
We would open up to a comic before
he would open up to anybody else.

2210
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:14,690
Don't you felt like you'd just tell Woody
Allen everything? Me? Yeah, definitely.

2211
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:17,840
Pull them aside
and be like,

2212
02:12:17,841 --> 02:12:21,260
he'd be very open minded
maybe. Who knows? You know?

2213
02:12:21,261 --> 02:12:24,200
It's all depending on who you're listening
to. If you listen to me or feral. No,

2214
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:28,640
not so much, you know? But he's
obviously a creative genius obviously,

2215
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:31,730
but you know,
I got to know Mel Brooks.

2216
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:34,880
That's my other one
where that's a big one.

2217
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:39,560
Spend a lot of dinners at Caesar's
house. Listening to Mel. Really?

2218
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:44,480
Oh yeah. Wow. That's huge. That's
gigantic. I asked my uncle Murray,

2219
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:47,660
he's coming out to visit a
couple of years ago. I said,

2220
02:12:48,490 --> 02:12:51,380
if he could meet anybody. He never been
to la. I've been all over the world.

2221
02:12:51,381 --> 02:12:55,550
He's a purple heart, Silver Star
recipient, World War II army medic,

2222
02:12:55,790 --> 02:12:59,570
helped liberate a concentration camp,
dined all over the world,

2223
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:04,100
best restaurants in the world
was a caterer, had a great
life, outlive two wives,

2224
02:13:04,130 --> 02:13:08,030
loved them both. He's never been to
la. I said, what do you want to do?

2225
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:11,660
If he could meet, do anything, what would
do? He's like, I like to beat Bill Brooks.

2226
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:15,140
I was like, well, what's your second
choice? Because that's not happening.

2227
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:17,780
And you know,

2228
02:13:17,781 --> 02:13:21,590
he's coming and he's coming in and
it's getting closer and so fuck it.

2229
02:13:21,591 --> 02:13:25,520
I write a letter to mail
books. A letter. Yeah. Wow.

2230
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:27,720
And I knew where his office was and I,

2231
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:32,130
I knew Mel a little bit because I
had sat with sit Caesar's house for

2232
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:36,930
different holidays and birthdays and
he'd always pop in with Carl Reiner.

2233
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:38,910
Even when sid was frail and old,

2234
02:13:39,210 --> 02:13:44,210
Mel and Carl would make a big entrance
male with lean white innocence

2235
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:45,960
wheelchair.
Mel said,

2236
02:13:45,961 --> 02:13:50,961
it's Mel Brooks and Colorado
and you see scintillate up.

2237
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:55,020
It was great. And you know,

2238
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:57,600
it was like 4th of July
weekend a couple of years ago.

2239
02:13:57,601 --> 02:14:01,350
And finally I'm like fuck my uncle's only
here for another couple of more days.

2240
02:14:01,351 --> 02:14:02,550
We're having a great time.

2241
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:07,440
We went to Fred Willard and Mary Willard's
fireworks party and I took him to the

2242
02:14:07,441 --> 02:14:12,441
Polo Lounge with Bob Saget and we'd
been having so much fun and he saw Renee

2243
02:14:12,740 --> 02:14:16,770
Taylor gang is cone Chinese restaurant.
He got a picture and you know,

2244
02:14:16,771 --> 02:14:19,650
my uncle is having the best time
but man he did say, you know,

2245
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:22,860
months ago that would be the one thing
with the Creme de la creme would be,

2246
02:14:22,861 --> 02:14:25,870
you know, just a handshake
and a photo at Mel Brooks.

2247
02:14:25,871 --> 02:14:28,620
So I'm a little embarrassed.

2248
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:32,310
So I go into the bathroom and I called
Mills Office cause I don't want my uncle,

2249
02:14:32,311 --> 02:14:34,560
they hear me even though
he was 90 you know,

2250
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:39,180
and I'm like I just make sure he got
the letter, you know, following up.

2251
02:14:39,181 --> 02:14:43,120
I'm just like being as humble and yeah.
Yeah.

2252
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:46,230
Mel's been out of town off.
I'll, I'll, I'll see what,

2253
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:47,730
I'll see if I can get an answer at.
Boom.

2254
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:51,990
I have to go to emergency dental
appointment. I think a filling fell out.

2255
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:56,760
So I took my uncle to the
dentist with me. I'm done.

2256
02:14:56,761 --> 02:15:00,360
It's 10 30 now. I'm like, how do
I kill our last day with my uncle?

2257
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:04,050
I love my uncle Murray. He's just
the family. Ballbuster mean Marie.

2258
02:15:04,051 --> 02:15:08,970
We called him and he just basically made
fun of me as a kid and taught me how to

2259
02:15:08,971 --> 02:15:13,350
take a joke, like a real Jersey
guy, you know, lifelong caterer.

2260
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:18,990
Just super funny. And we're
up, I'm showing them, you know,

2261
02:15:18,991 --> 02:15:22,380
Mulholland and this and that and we're
right at the top of Laurel Canyon and

2262
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:26,100
Mohan and my cell phone rings hold
from Mel Brooks. I'm like, Oh,

2263
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:29,700
this is where he's calling. Like,
there's going to be no service of here.

2264
02:15:29,701 --> 02:15:34,490
This is terrible. Like
this is, Mel gets on.

2265
02:15:34,491 --> 02:15:37,830
And he's like, he's like, um,

2266
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:41,840
basically. So what's going on?
What's happening? And I'm like, oh,

2267
02:15:41,930 --> 02:15:46,440
we were trying to talk and drive down
this hill a once. And I'm like, well,

2268
02:15:46,441 --> 02:15:49,590
you know, I think he would be
so nice of you and my uncle,

2269
02:15:49,591 --> 02:15:52,890
he just loves you and visit
whenever I can say I think you guys,

2270
02:15:53,070 --> 02:15:55,290

We have a lot you'll have,

2271
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:56,910
you might have a lot in common.
And Mel goes,

2272
02:15:56,911 --> 02:16:00,510
the only thing I have in common with you
and with your uncle is that I'm a nice

2273
02:16:00,511 --> 02:16:02,010
guy.
So come on over.

2274
02:16:02,011 --> 02:16:06,450
It had hour and a half over to my office
or the barber shop, I don't know yet.

2275
02:16:06,451 --> 02:16:11,010
I'll call you back click. I go down
the hill and we're both in shorts.

2276
02:16:11,011 --> 02:16:12,270
So might were panicking.

2277
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:17,340
So we're racing down Laurel Canyon and
we run home to put long pants on and just

2278
02:16:17,341 --> 02:16:19,590
comb her hair or whatever.
I was coming from the dentists,

2279
02:16:19,591 --> 02:16:24,330
he knows just sweat and on my
uncle is like, he doesn't ever,

2281
02:16:27,431 --> 02:16:30,940
he's like a very proud stubborn
guy, you know, seen it all.

2282
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:34,750
And he's like nervously rehearsing
opening lines to say to Mel Brooks.

2283
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:39,960
I say to him, he's like, how's
this? He goes, well, I'll

2284
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:42,520

spot on the lot right next to Mel's

2289
02:16:57,401 --> 02:17:00,940
