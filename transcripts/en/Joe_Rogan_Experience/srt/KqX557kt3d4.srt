1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,410
Isn't,
aren't they making James Bond a woman?

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,070
I think they are magazines by a woman.
I hope it's a black woman who's queer.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,340
The only way for justice to be served 
and nonbinary.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,510
Yes,
but what does that mean?

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,763
She's.
Her gender can switch throughout the 

6
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:23,040
film depending on,
on Binary gender flux.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,020
Gender fluid.
I thought that was gender fluid.

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,060
Sorry,
what's your Pronoun Today?

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,250
Uh,
I'm always wanting to have a z in there.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,280
Caesar.
Cool.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
Yeah,
I feel like your highness.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,450
Oh,
that's good.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,190
That's good.
That's good.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,740
Yeah.
Your Highness can be a guy or a girl.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,140
Whoa.
Whoa.

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,990
It's gender neutral.
Your Highness.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,180
Now if you said I'm a princess,
I would go,

18
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,250
okay,
well you're gendering yourself.

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,720
That's true.
That's true.

20
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:01,320
And I refused to do that.
I have two little boys and you know,

21
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:05,150
we forced them to be gender neutral.
They don't always watch a show on that.

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,510
A legit show on that from Cambridge.
This couple was raising their kid gender

23
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,670
neutral.
They have two kids and they're both like

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,620
wearing like whatever.
They're wearing weird clothes.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,970
Like it didn't necessarily agree they're
wearing boys clothes or girls' clothes.

26
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,680
When they didn't call them girls or 
boys,

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,370
they let them play with anything they 
wanted and they didn't call them boys.

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,760
What would they say?
It was fucking weird.

29
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:34,761
It was just some poor guy who stuck with
some crazy bitch and she's,

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,173
you know,
and he was probably trying really hard 

31
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,300
to be like progressive and like figure 
out,

32
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:39,990
uh,
what,

33
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,050
you know,
how do we not gender our children and.

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,993
Yeah,
and it's interesting you do that voice 

35
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,464
because they all do up speak at do the 
only way to show your progressive 

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,380
because if you didn't know it is 
conservative,

37
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,780
people just don't talk like that.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,000
No need to stop the caravan before it 
gets to the wall.

39
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,280
Donald trumps our savior because he's 
like the one who really appreciates like

40
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:12,630
American values and never hear that.
It's only,

41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,270
it's only,
it's a super liberal calling.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,440
It is.
It is.

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,960
Back to this non binary.
We,

44
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,903
we did a clip on your mom's house.
There was a couple somewhere in the 

45
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,334
Netherlands and they had a three year 
old zamzar child and another and every 

46
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,690
day they would ask the three year old,
what gender do you feel like today?

47
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,700
And I'm talking about the pressure and 
I'm like,

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,420
I have a almost three year old.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,550
He doesn't think in terms of,
yeah,

50
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,350
he's like,
I don't know,

51
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,460
I'm whatever.
But to put the pressure like,

52
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,290
what are you today,
what are you feeling?

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,503
My eight year old loves to play with 
things like race cars and she used to 

54
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,810
love to play with trucks and she still 
loves it.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,273
She's a

56
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
friend.
She,

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,113
she,
she loves to play with superheroes and 

58
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:09,880
things like that.
Like some of them are like very.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,953
But then again she loves pink and she 
likes getting her nails done and she 

60
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,274
likes looking pretty and she's,
there's some cool shit that boys like 

61
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,120
that girls like to like she's pretty 
aggressive,

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,210
which takes MMA classes and she throws 
boys around.

63
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,330
She gets like super hyped up when she 
has to wrestle with boys.

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,053
She,
she,

65
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,933
it's crazy to watch,
like a little psycho aggressive eight 

66
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:36,100
year old,
but she's also like really sweet,

67
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,963
like the sweetest kid.
Everybody just gets like real 

68
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,930
competitive with that kind of stuff.

69
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,183
Yeah,
they say that that's the magic age 

70
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,063
eight,
nine and girls and then a where they're 

71
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:48,904
very confident.
It's like the end of the confidence era 

72
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,560
and then puberty strikes and the 
hormones takeover and the pressure.

73
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,490
Yeah.
To be sexy.

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,430
So Pippi longstocking that coolest 
character.

75
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,264
Who was doing that shit.
Remember Pippi longstocking beating up 

76
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:04,210
cops.
Shannon.

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,960
She had like a treasure trove.
So she was like,

78
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,480
she was a millionaire on her own.
Her Dad was a pirate.

79
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,660
Really?
Yeah,

80
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,660
I do remember those old Pippi 
longstocking.

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,410
He's longstockings very much.
And remember the name.

82
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,520
I don't remember the narrative.

83
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,550
Oh,
she was great.

84
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,770
And it was subtitled,
poorly in her lips,

85
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,604
you know,
didn't match up with what she was 

86
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,074
saying.
It was on channel five and la every 

87
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,920
Sunday afternoon.
Where's it from?

88
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,690
Originally?
A Sweden,

89
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:29,524
I believe.
Astrid Lindgren wrote these books about 

90
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,940
her daughter who was that age,
eight,

91
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,920
eight years old as a magic age.
There she is,

92
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,920
the original one who'd be long stockings
and she said,

93
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,320
girls are kind of smelly,
kind of awkward,

94
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,330
and that's before puberty robs you of 
your,

95
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:44,164
uh,
you know,

96
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,130
fuck this new school I'm talking about.
Oh,

97
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,640
there she goes.
Just got a monkey.

98
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,230
Hey,
had a monkey.

99
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,610
I know you love monkeys.
Monkeys.

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,250
Is that a monkey?
A scarf?

101
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,840
Yeah,
I do choose bad.

102
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,600
She beat the shit out of people.
Wow.

103
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,693
But yeah,
I think I play with a boy stuff to my 

104
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,850
dad.
I was raised by a single dad somewhat,

105
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,650
so he gave me like a bmx dirt bike and I
would write it in the La River,

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,390
you know?
And then I liked dolls too.

107
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,900
And that's what makes a female comics.
So you might have,

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,690
there's always something fucked up 
because none of us,

109
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,970
none of us are normal.
That's a fact.

110
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,860
Find one that is.
I never met one

111
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,120
as much.
My husband.

112
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,420
I'm sorry.
Mr Polowski do you love it?

113
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,980
Garth Brooks is doing that.
Have you seen.

114
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,250
It's fucking hilarious.
What is that?

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,140
It's.
I think it's somebody.

116
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,580
People don't know what we're talking 
about.

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,200
Okay,
so garth brooks,

118
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,450
who is infinitely talented.
I'm not saying the guy's not talented.

119
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,470
He's a mega,
mega,

120
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:58,010
mega star is he started doing social 
media and it's

121
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,280
his fucking strange as can be.
It's so strange.

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,450
Yeah.
He doesn't quite know how to do.

123
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,040
I think someone was telling him like,
Hey,

124
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,840
just be personable,
be fun.

125
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,460
He just seemed so weird.
And Tom is like constantly on it.

126
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,960
Oh yeah.
We make fun of him relentlessly.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,330
It is nonstop because he'll be like,
he'll be like,

128
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,590
hey everybody.
It's me garden.

129
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,290
I studio g and he has a thing called 
studio g for golf.

130
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,293
Forgot our.
Her dog studio g cassette tape cassette 

131
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,704
tape at his audience.
So in some fucking China as places he 

132
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,253
really is.
And so he does these posts where he's 

133
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:48,800
like,
it's a,

134
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,480
it's tricia's birthday.
That's why everybody's sent her pictures

135
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,910
of your favorite cupcakes.
Cupcakes with Hashtag Fun.

136
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,380
Hashtag Mr.
Hashtag gear it.

137
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,850
Doing him doing the Hashtag was rough.
Like what the fuck garth.

138
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,020
Your Mom's house is a fun show.

139
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,540
When I,
whenever I want just silly.

140
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,730
I tune in to you guys.
Thank you.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,620
Because you rarely deviate from silly 
nose.

142
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,460
It just just goofing off on shit all the
time.

143
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:23,090
It's always completely preposterous.
And this new guy that you guys have been

144
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,650
following the try it out.
Guy,

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,040
what the fuck can we play him?
Yes,

146
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,100
we can play out,
man.

147
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,350
This guy's guys.
This is a real guy.

148
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,370
I thousand percent real and by the way,
we loved you on your mom's house.

149
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:41,780
You fit right in.
Thank you and I hope you come back.

150
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,060
I would love to do it anytime.
Please.

151
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,230
Oh,
we're all in the neighborhood.

152
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,390
We're all close by.
Yeah.

153
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,243
It's only about farts and dicks and guys
who don't know how to ask for a lady's 

154
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:53,864
affection properly.
Will you also find people online that 

155
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,180
are just the most preposterous people?
So this is the guy.

156
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,460
Give me some volume in this guy,
this guy.

157
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,810
I think this is the right clip he's 
looking for love.

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,460
There's also on,

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,280

161
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,740

162
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,650

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,400

177
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,263
I'm looking at hard rock and ice and 
Munich want to do it and I want to 

178
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:55,440
deliver it.

179
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,020
Buy

180
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,100
Trash.

181
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,970
Let's fuck white church.
Come dump.

182
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,840
Fuck.
Oh my God.

183
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,150
You got to see them folks just 
listening.

184
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,163
You gotta see this guy,
the fucking sincerity in his eyes and 

185
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,780
he's saying this thing needs to.
Watching your face.

186
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,770
Watch the tryout was probably my 
favorite thing in life.

187
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,500
What did I do?
It was like a look of like,

188
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,940
oh,
like it made you sad.

189
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,660
Did it for him?
It didn't make you feel like it made you

190
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,690
feel.
I didn't feel sad.

191
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:33,330
It's weird that I looked sad.
Maybe I.

192
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,580
Maybe I'm hiding that.
I'm sad to myself.

193
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,503
Maybe I'm hiding it from myself,
but this guy really needs it and he 

194
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,450
really puts it out there.
Try it out.

195
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,373
I'm pissed off.

196
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,330
I'm a white trash.
Like,

197
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,430
whoa buddy.
Anybody men from jail.

198
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,120
Just an animated version of it.
So it started a flurry of animated.

199
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:57,954
Try it out guys.
And then people started to submit their 

200
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,640
own.
Takes these.

201
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:06,641
There's Tommy.
Don't try stupid.

202
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't care how many fucking free food.
Free writes from jail,

203
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,410

Dog want to come.

204
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,063
True,

205
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,960
Free.

206
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,330
Lisa Kay.
Fuck me.

207
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,890
Piss.
Somebody beat me at home.

208
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:36,030
Yeah.
Now you can rewind it just a little bit.

209
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,864
Jamie.
He goes,

210
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,190
he goes,

211
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,680
Pissed off.
Beat me home.

212
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,340
You know what's that?
What's that?

213
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,180
Homey.
Mel,

214
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,580
what do you think he said?
Good question.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,833
One more time.
Right?

216
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,890
Fuck me.
Piss somebody beat me home.

217
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:50,910
You know,
you see me more?

218
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,823
What does it?

219
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,890
We'd have to go through that.
Like this approved or film?

220
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,970
Well,
what do you hear?

221
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,090
My now seem like a word to me.
Home home.

222
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,950
Home.
Home.

223
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:07,784
Man.
Out.

224
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,840
Fuck me.
But somebody beat me.

225
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,010
I know right now.
What is that?

226
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,840
Whoa.
Whoa,

227
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,910
Whoa,
whoa man.

228
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,730
Whoa.
A man out is one that again,

229
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,550
maybe that's it.
Fuck me.

230
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,090
Piss.
Somebody beat me home.

231
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah.
Now these could be anything.

232
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,460
Now.
Just another language.

233
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,343
Holeman.
Yet we were like working for the 

234
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,700
government and we're trying to decipher 
the tape.

235
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,803
Like we have to find out where the 
kidnappers are being held home and now 

236
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,380
they have to like strip the audio.
I hear a train in the distance.

237
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
We will be audio experts in a room 
somewhere.

238
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,810
We've got it.
We've got whole man out.

239
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,200
Whole man out hold,
man man.

240
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,680
Oh Man.
Out Prostitute.

241
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,860
It could be or it could be.

242
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,753
I'm home.
I'm home here now because he gives out 

243
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,000
his address.
He goes,

244
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,100
no.
One more time at 23,

245
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,150
95 and we cut it off.
We cut it out for beat me home now.

246
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,110
These could be anything.
I'm home,

247
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,480
homey on now.
Anyway,

248
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,480
huge debate in my mom's house community.
Um,

249
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,740
there's no final answer on.
You'd have to talk to him.

250
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:26,140
Have you reached out to him?
We've tried,

251
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:26,974
yeah.
There's a few of your mom's house stars 

252
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:30,520
I believe in.
Um,

253
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,790
oh my gosh.
Maybe on the east coast somewhere.

254
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,220
Sorry,
I don't sleep very much.

255
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,054
Yeah.
Um,

256
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,990
we've reached out to him.
I'm three months deep in the game,

257
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,550
Bro.
I'm going crazy.

258
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,803
Him and I can't ask.
Rubber won't respond and we've reached 

259
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,110
out with offers of money and really not 
there.

260
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:49,570
You won't do it.
And it's so weird.

261
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,860
It's always the ones we want the most.

262
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,090
That never quite the king would be just 
farting in your room though in.

263
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,740
Oh yeah.
Would you want that?

264
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,360
I'd like to talk to him in the room.
What it does,

265
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,710
right?
He farts all the time.

266
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,690
Yeah.
But I'm curious,

267
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:05,524
what's the drive like?
He's clearly not driven by sex because 

268
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:08,674
that's really re repellent to women or 
maybe maybe like for him it's a turn on 

269
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,633
to fart.
Like even though it's probably 

270
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,324
disgusting to women,
maybe for him it's a turn on to be 

271
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,440
disgusting.
Ah,

272
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,520
the repulsion.
Thanks.

273
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,050
So she's like,
oh my God,

274
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:28,050
you're so nasty.
And then she's.

275
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,283
Yeah,
there's like some boys who were spanked 

276
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,570
for shitting their pants and stuff when 
they were young,

277
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,613
they developed this weird thing about 
shit like being naughty and they even 

278
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,404
connect sexually.
Being Naughty was shit and farts and 

279
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,680
things like that.
Fetish.

280
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,040
That's.

281
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,790
They say that's how the fetish starts,
right?

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,590
Chris Ryan was trying to explain it to 
me.

283
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,400
So one day Dr Chris Ryan from a sex at 
dawn,

284
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,323
the book,
and he was saying that there's an 

285
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,874
imprinting stage in young men's lives 
were like the a young man that's not 

286
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:04,504
gay,
like say during this imprinting stage 

287
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:06,754
when they're very young,
if they get their dick sucked by a guy 

288
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,180
and they,
they orgasm,

289
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,283
they could potentially get turned on by 
guy sucking their dick even if they're 

290
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:20,290
not gay because it's imprinted on them 
at a very early age.

291
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,290
Like by them getting molested at an 
early age.

292
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,153
It fucks with their sexual,
like what in their mind is considered 

293
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,520
sexual pleasure.
Yeah.

294
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,383
I can see that the wires get crossed 
early and maybe you're attracted and 

295
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:39,631
repulsive at the same time to the man.
And I don't know if I'm gay or I kind of

296
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,240
want to do this,
but I don't want to do you.

297
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,650
You were molested,
but yet you're also turned on.

298
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,680
Yeah,
shame a lot of fame,

299
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm sure attached to that too.
Oh,

300
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,190
for sure.
Yeah.

301
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,213
And a lot of anger.
You know what's really strange is when 

302
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:59,531
you go back through history,
how often men were having sex with young

303
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,340
boys.
I know the Greeks love to do that.

304
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,320
Romans,
Greeks,

305
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,483
many,
many different ancient civilizations 

306
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:13,580
thought it was normal for men to have 
young boys,

307
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,210
as you know,
as sex partners.

308
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,980
Fucking the fucking strange.
Yeah.

309
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:24,380
And then the Christians right in the 
Christians come along and they're like,

310
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,880
wait a minute,
we will show you how to do this.

311
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,890
Only with priests.

312
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,970
Only the elite gets a rape children.
Uh,

313
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,130
it is crazy.
To this day,

314
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,113
my most shocked that I ever am when 
people get upset at me is want to shit 

315
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,584
on.
Catholicism is want to shit on child 

316
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,283
molesting.
I'm like,

317
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,730
what are we pretending that this shit 
isn't happening constantly.

318
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,103
I mean,
if,

319
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,750
if they were anything else,
like say it was the NBA,

320
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,450
the NBA was traveling around just 
fucking kids.

321
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,570
They're playing basketball.
They're fucking kids.

322
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,920
Like who would say,
yeah,

323
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,050
but the man,
they played good basketball,

324
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,330
fucking Dunkin that lay out show three 
pointers from the outside.

325
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:12,110
They are playing some serious basketball
and sometimes they fucked some kids.

326
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,620
Oh,
I typed in with Catholic priests.

327
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,900
There's three different stories in three
different spots.

328
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,790
Buffalo,
Catholic diocese.

329
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,813
How do you say the diocese diocese,
new list of priests accused of sexual 

330
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,260
abuse.
Yup.

331
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,490
Catholic priest react to clergy sex 
abuse.

332
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,323
Meeting with Bishop Malone,
Catholic priests removed from ministry 

333
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,280
in Oklahoma.
This is just one day's worth.

334
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,060
Then there was that thing in 
Philadelphia that was just last month.

335
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,953
Where was it?
A thousand different kids had been 

336
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:43,620
molested by these priests.
Yeah.

337
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,940
Thousand different children in 
Pennsylvania.

338
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:51,830
Like what in the fuck folks,
so why are they protected from law?

339
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,713
Like I know,
because in the church you said they 

340
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:54,190
moved them around,
right?

341
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.
The archdiocese or whoever goes,

342
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:56,834
yeah,
that guy's a pedophile and let's just 

343
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:00,920
move them to a different thing.
They're protected because people believe

344
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:03,710
in God.
They're protected because people believe

345
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,210
in Christianity.
Yeah,

346
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,044
and they.
They don't.

347
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,123
They don't want to attack priests 
because they feel like that's an attack 

348
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,034
on the church and they feel like there's
going to be blow back politically and 

349
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,700
they're worried about it because people 
have this need for church and they're,

350
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,030
they're.

351
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,130
They're terrified.
If someone comes along and says,

352
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:19,964
hey,
we're going to do like as the 

353
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:21,914
international is going to do a full 
scale investigation into the Catholic 

354
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,900
Church and we're going to lock people 
up.

355
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,180
That's the reason why the Vatican has 
its own country.

356
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,700
You know the Vatican,
you have to have a fucking passport.

357
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,710
Like it's an actual country separate 
entities,

358
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,700
little tiny ass place filled with kid 
fuckers.

359
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Like if you looked at the per capita kid
fuckers of people in the Vatican,

360
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:44,451
you'd be like,
oh my God,

361
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:49,451
it's a nation of kid fuckers so fucked 
up and they're in untouchable.

362
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,260
Well for now,
but eventually people are gonna.

363
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:56,820
Realize how irrelevant a lot of these 
ancient fucking cults actually are.

364
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,300
Whether you believe in whether you 
believe in God or not.

365
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,373
Those are cults are ancient cults.
Whether you believe in the scripture or 

366
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,840
not,
the Catholic church is clearly a cult.

367
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,170
It's a cult that I was a part of.
I mean,

368
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,510
I went to Catholic school.
My,

369
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,310
my family was Catholic.
I'd been around it my whole life.

370
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,010
Nobody ever molested me and the church,
but I got lucky.

371
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,590
I know I got lucky,
I know people that got molested.

372
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,424
I have friends that told me stories,
but being chased by priests and I have 

373
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:27,420
friends that told me stories about a guy
that they knew that got molested,

374
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,740
like damn,
he got them.

375
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,574
He got them like they knew about this 
priest and he got one of their friends 

376
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,480
and this is just all across the country 
and the,

377
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,030
the numbers that went to justice so 
small,

378
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,600
so small in comparison to the actual 
acts.

379
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,163
It's,
it's really crazy that people would get 

380
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,260
upset at you saying this.
Like it's,

381
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,760
it's crazy,
right?

382
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,340
Like,
let me defend my pedophile priests.

383
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,600
Like I love this guy.
Like,

384
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:53,670
what?
Why are we still invested in this?

385
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,460
And you know,
I have been ever since I had kids too,

386
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,294
I,
I kind of see the world a lot 

387
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:59,650
differently,
you know?

388
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,380
And I,
before I had children I was like,

389
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,101
sure,
you know,

390
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,890
God could exist.
I'm spiritual and now I'm like,

391
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:05,724
I just got to defend my children from 
the fucking evil and insanity of this 

392
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:11,520
world.
And it's jungle law.

393
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,170
And like I,
I don't know,

394
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't,
I'm not spiritual really.

395
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,510
People can go bad for sure.
There's,

396
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,380
there's something about people that when
it goes wrong,

397
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,161
you know,
whatever,

398
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,590
for whatever reason,
people can go back,

399
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,950
they can go bad serial killer style,
they can go bad rapist style.

400
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,933
I mean,
how many guys are out there dropping 

401
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,090
pills into girls drinks,
still still,

402
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,820
still hundred,
100 percent.

403
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:38,220
It's happening all across the country,
all across the world.

404
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,383
All the time.
There's just fucking disgusting human 

405
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,310
beings.
There's bad people out there and there's

406
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:47,250
people that got fucked over and they 
want to pay people back.

407
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,330
You know,
they're upset,

408
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
they're upset that they got a shit deal 
and they want,

409
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,030
they want other people to suffer.
Yeah,

410
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,650
it's traumatized people,
right?

411
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,970
Doing all this shit traumatize people.
It was definitely some of that.

412
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,890
But that makes me also too,
like I always laugh at the,

413
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:07,510
uh,
the anti bullying stuff.

414
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,383
Like I'm not pro bullying clearly,
but it's such a misguided effort to try 

415
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,910
to completely eradicate the world of 
bullet.

416
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:15,930
We're going to stop like,
no,

417
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:16,764
you're not dude,
because you have to stop stupid if 

418
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,720
you're going to stop the bullying 
because stupid people have kids.

419
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,920
They don't raise the kids.
Well,

420
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,754
those kids are angry because they have 
stupid parents and they're being abused 

421
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:26,484
at home and then they hit your kid and 
so what'd you can do is teach your kid 

422
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,480
to not be a victim and to fucking kick a
guy in the nuts,

423
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,553
but now we don't teach that to children 
to defend yourself and then your kid 

424
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,190
would be the problem.

425
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,330
You have to show a reason to express 
violence.

426
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,150
God dammit.
Yeah,

427
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,993
there's,
there's a time for violence and that 

428
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,064
time is when you're defending yourself 
because someone is fucking with you and 

429
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,380
if you don't do something,
they're gonna do something to you.

430
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,390
There's times when no one's there to 
save you.

431
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,120
That's real,
and if you don't teach your kids that,

432
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,390
they're going to be real confused.
If that moment does arise,

433
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:03,910
they're going to look around for someone
to save them and there's no one there.

434
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,760
Exactly,
and that's very unfortunate.

435
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:07,730
No one wants it,
you know?

436
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,870
No one wants that to be the case,
but it is the case.

437
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,610
It's a reality.
You know,

438
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,473
if you just,
if you're just around a bunch of bad 

439
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,190
people and you hope that nothing goes 
wrong,

440
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,113
it's,
that's not an effective way to prepare 

441
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:26,380
yourself for what could happen.
That's the thing about having kids,

442
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,050
right?
You start thinking of the world.

443
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,030
It's been like this like danger written 
place.

444
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,680
It's,
it becomes a different world.

445
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,680
Fucking cess pool.
Yeah,

446
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,553
and especially with the Internet now you
can see exactly who's crazy before you 

447
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:40,731
were like,
I don't know,

448
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:41,564
people are generally okay and then 
you'll see the fucking try it out guy 

449
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,490
and you're like,
oh my gosh,

450
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,090
beat on me.
Try it out.

451
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,743
Bring your friends.
They can live here to doug asking for 

452
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:55,320
thugs to fuck them and piss on them,
but you get a and a key.

453
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,300
Yeah.
But he also wants him to beat them.

454
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,740
Beat me,
piss on me.

455
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,920
That's the problem.
Like how much of that do I have to do to

456
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,080
have to fuck you?
Or can I just go over and kick your ass?

457
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,310
You take anything,
he would take it as a guy.

458
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:09,840
You can go over his house and just fuck 
them up.

459
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,580
There is,
but yeah,

460
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,370
but once you punch hima couple times 
going to go,

461
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:14,900
fuck me.
Now.

462
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,733
They're like,

463
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,220
no.
I'm just going to beat you up.

464
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,980
I'm just here for the beating man.
Fuck you up.

465
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,530

I mean,

466
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:23,364
not at that level.
We're talking about goes lately on your 

467
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:32,634
mom's house.
We've been featuring desperate dude who 

468
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,580
are like making videos like this to try 
to court a lady or a gentleman,

469
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:41,450
but maybe kind of misguided,
like not,

470
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,190
yeah,
let's try it out or whatever.

471
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,690
Whatever.

472
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:46,524
Like we know you're horny bro.
You can't just come out and say I'm 

473
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,650

dudes.

474
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,311
Yeah.
Like,

475
00:22:53,311 --> 00:22:55,830
but a woman's not going to respond.
Yeah.

476
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:56,730
Women.
That's why.

477
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,280
Why playgirl didn't really work.
We don't want to look at Dick's.

478
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,560
Playgirl was for Dudes,
right?

479
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,960
Scores.

480
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,630
What were those dating services like in 
the eighties where you'd pay?

481
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,493
I mean it was like a joke on mad TV.
Your snl were like the past tapes and I 

482
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,790
could make a video,
a video dating profile.

483
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,360
Did that ever work or is it only keep 
the guys too?

484
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,270
Yeah.
People that need a dating services.

485
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,790
Back in the eighties,
those people were losers.

486
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,560
I mean people.
Most people just found somebody.

487
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,573
Okay.
Bars go somewhere like a normal fucking 

488
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,780
person.
You meet people fucking Weirdo,

489
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,973
but nowadays it's way more common 
because of like tinder and normal folks 

490
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:41,414
do.
A Chris Rock was talking about being on 

491
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:45,050
dating apps.
Chris Rock's on dance.

492
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,370
Well,
I think he has a girlfriend now,

493
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,110
but for a while,
yeah,

494
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:50,150
he was on dating apps and someone was 
like,

495
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,130
why would you do that?
You're Chris Rock.

496
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,180
He goes,
because I'm Chris Rock was like.

497
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,270
He was joking around about it.
It's like the how.

498
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,280
This is a great way to meet them.
Now they know who I am.

499
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,420
Pam.
That's right.

500
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,850
And there's like celebrity ones,
right?

501
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,370
Like you just.
You just exclusive to celebrities.

502
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,213
So there's some celebrity,
one where you just date and gold 

503
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:10,640
diggers.
Just girls to get same as future reality

504
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,610
stars,
future housewives of Beverly Hills.

505
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,740
Those fucking crazy bitches.

506
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,450
So my mother,
her second husband,

507
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,540
they met on a dating ad in the back of 
like an Indian newspaper.

508
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,640
My mother,
like Indian guys Indian.

509
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:30,120
Like,
like from Punjab.

510
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

511
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,660
I always answered you in Hungarian.
Yes.

512
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,700
Enza.
So she put an ad,

513
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,440
Indian guys,
Indian men.

514
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,274
So her thing was she,
she believed that Indian men were more 

515
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:43,260
educated overall.
She liked them.

516
00:24:43,261 --> 00:24:44,250
I liked them.
Tall,

517
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:48,240
dark and handsome.
She was a Hungarian lady and uh,

518
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,220
she,
she just thought that they had more,

519
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,113
more money and more smarts,
so show me the money and she wanted to 

520
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:59,810
be wiped up and taken care of.
So she put an ad in the back of the hunt

521
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,803
Indian newspaper.
She said Buxom some European woman 

522
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:05,760
looking for.
Was it wealthy?

523
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,730
Indian guy from marriage?
Dude,

524
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,560
we got a bag of letters,
like a bag from every Indian dude in the

525
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,393
La County.
And she sent a picture of himself in an 

526
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,890
Armani suit.
This is like 1989 with his Mercedes.

527
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,210
All school cell phones like that big ass
one.

528
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,783
And she was like,
that's the one they were married one 

529
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:28,841
month later.
That's my boy fucking cell phone for the

530
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,813
Wall Street movie.
I remember Michael Douglas Walking 

531
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:39,590
around with that brick on the beach 
balling so hard.

532
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:40,424
He's talking to people.
He didn't give a fuck about his cell 

533
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:43,244
phone.
Bill was just talking to people on the 

534
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,700
beach.
Yeah.

535
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,950
Did you have one of those memory in your
car?

536
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:50,750
The old school had one that was in the 
car.

537
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,080
It was connected to the car.
It was like permanently in the car.

538
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,540
It was on the floor.
It was bolted in.

539
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,673
And then I would,
I could make a phone call from the 

540
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,870
Indian.
That speakerphone.

541
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,704
I can talk.
I driving speakerphone in 1988 Honda 

542
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,440
crx.
I was a little tiny thing.

543
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,220
Michael Douglas.
I didn't have one of those.

544
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,670
That was two baller from me.
I think mine,

545
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,553
uh,
I could take out and put in a suitcase 

546
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,330
too,
if I remember correctly.

547
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,710
Yeah,
that's pretty dope.

548
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,450
Maybe not.
Maybe another one.

549
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:23,000
Maybe I got another one afterwards.
It was like a suitcase one.

550
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,640
Do you?
My Dad had a Jag in the eighties and the

551
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,360
he had like a tiny tv,
put it on the radio.

552
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,493
They had tiny little square television 
is black and white and I could watch 

553
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:33,730
watch cartoons

554
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,490
on the way to school and I was like,
this is the future.

555
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:41,491
We're all going to have tvs in our cars 
and my kids zone out when they get in my

556
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,580
car because

557
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,410
my lexus has these things in the back 
seat where there's like a little ipad on

558
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,244
the back screen and watch a screen.
It's like a 10 inch screen on the back 

559
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,620
headrest.
So they.

560
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,454
They watch movies.
It's the for kids like those rear 

561
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,784
entertainment systems.
If you have a long trip like see if you 

562
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,440
got to drive to San Francisco.
That's three movies.

563
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,990
That's all that is.
That's three movies.

564
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,820
What do you guys want to watch now?
You guys hungry.

565
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,770
Who has to pee?
We got to pull over.

566
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,340
There's no fighting is watching movies.
Otherwise it would be.

567
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,610
She's touching me with her feet.
Stop it.

568
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,970
Stop touching me.
I can't wait for all that.

569
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,043
Yeah,
that's great.

570
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,970
I can't wait.
It's fascinating.

571
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,433
You know,
and then you see like other people's 

572
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:30,350
really shitty handiwork in terms of like
the way they're raising their kids,

573
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,233
like oh my goodness,
tell me about it because I'm only at a 

574
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:34,554
three year old and a three month old,
so I'm just now in the kind of the 

575
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,000
preschool and I see other parents and 
I'm like,

576
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,770
this is what you got to be careful of.

577
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,633
You've got to be careful of the parents 
that liked to go to parties and they 

578
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:44,844
leave their kid outside with other kids 
and they go inside and drink and they 

579
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,830
don't watch their kid at all and it's 
usually,

580
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,173
it's usually boys.
People are boys and the boys usually 

581
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,014
wind up hitting kids and what's going on
is that kid is not getting any fucking 

582
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:59,244
attention and not getting any parental 
guidance and they're just loose and 

583
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:05,850
wild.
And I've had this incident happened more

584
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,684
than once,
but one of them agreed honestly with 

585
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,374
this kid hit both of my kids and one of 
them more than once and the parents are 

586
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:17,910
still inside drinking,
pulling hair in their little.

587
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,410
They're like six.
And they're like,

588
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,700
Yo man,
you got to watch your kid.

589
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,020
He's aggressive.
He's a good kid.

590
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,270
He's always a good kid.
You don't even know you're in here.

591
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,080
Drunk your kids out there jumping around
in a fucking trampoline,

592
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,943
beaten kids in the head,
stepping on their hair like literally 

593
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,034
the kid was like a little aggressive kid
called another kid a loser and pushed 

594
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,210
him,
called him a loser.

595
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,253
What kid call someone a loser.
Someone who gets called to loser at 

596
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:40,644
home.
Yes.

597
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,530
Will someone's calling someone a loser 
in front of that kid.

598
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,393
Six year old calling people losers.
And every now and then I see the 

599
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,481
parents.
I'm like,

600
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:49,314
Jesus Christ,
just kind of get the fuck away from 

601
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:51,774
them.
I had to have a conversation with the 

602
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:54,690
dad and he's trying to tell me his kid's
a good kid.

603
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,521
I'm like,
okay,

604
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,270
your kid's a good kid.
I tell them,

605
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,104
you,
your kid pushed kid and called him a 

606
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,730
loser at that didn't happen.
Oh,

607
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,510
it didn't happen.
All right man,

608
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:05,580
I don't know what to do other than what 
I want to do,

609
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:06,570
which is freak out.

610
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,610
I want to freak out.
And start yelling at you,

611
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,610
you fucking asshole.
You drunk piece of shit in here.

612
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,170
You're not even paying attention to your
kid.

613
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,183
You got a bad kid.
You got a kid that you haven't been 

614
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,344
paying attention to your.
These are older people and they had a 

615
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:22,050
kid late in life.
They are barely paying attention.

616
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,230
One kid not really into it.
Let's just roam.

617
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,480
Just let them roam.
Yeah,

618
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,363
that ain't cool.
Especially get a lot of that shit and 

619
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm going to go get kids that have cell 
phones at like six years old.

620
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,340
I've heard this.
And then these little fucking sluts.

621
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,010
Send your boys a naked picture picks and
then my boys

622
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,200
accountable.
If he sends it to another kid,

623
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,670
got dirty little slots.
Now how am I going to get these stuff?

624
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,533
These hoes I got stopped the boys.
That's what to stop the boys from 

625
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:53,050
sending pictures.
Tell them,

626
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:56,290
tell them about the law and definitely 
tell them no pictures of your Dick.

627
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,233
Fuck,
I don't even know who's doing it as an 

628
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:02,080
adult sending your dick to a fuck.
I don't know.

629
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:02,943
There's not one way to find them because
how long have you been with your lady 

630
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:07,744
now?
Long enough to not send her any 

631
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,490
pictures.
If I sent her dicks.

632
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,810
It's other people's like,
what do you think of that?

633
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,213
Do you get sent Dick Pics from Tom?
Tom will send me whatever red hen or a 

634
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,820
girl.
It's.

635
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,330
I think that that is one of the most 
misguided things ever.

636
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,530
Like the random Dick pick the guys that 
don't even know a girl will send,

637
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,130
but that's the thing too is like it goes
back to what women don't want.

638
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,780
Like I'm not like sweet cock,
like get over it and also like if a girl

639
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:45,690
just sends you a picture of her pussy,
like Whoa,

640
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,150
how many people she's sending that 
picture to paint that picture.

641
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,984
If you could like go,
go through her phone and if there's a 

642
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,440
record of how many times have pictures 
been?

643
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:58,441
Said a girl says pussy pictures.
She's sending them to everybody.

644
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:01,540
She's just,
she's just scattershot.

645
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,060
Just shooting into the cosmos.
Bang,

646
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:04,894
Bang,
Bang.

647
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,600
Someone's gonna.
Someone's gonna be into it.

648
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,190
Some chick.
Is that the thing?

649
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:13,030
He does it because it's worked.
Some somebodies going to be like,

650
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,040
oh yeah,
that's the one.

651
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:15,903
How many.
There are so many thirsty girl pages of 

652
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,630
like girls sticking their butts out,
girls in underwear.

653
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,050
There's so many of those pages,
like thirst traps,

654
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,060
but there's not that many for guys.
Just like a few guy bodybuilder type.

655
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,610
Third laughter show me right now.
You know,

656
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,453
they're people.
They're real people who know their 

657
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,113
thirst traps,
like dudes looking for Dick or dudes 

658
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:44,620
looking for girls.
The ones I've seen,

659
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,070
it's,
there's.

660
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,591
Yeah.
Okay,

661
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:47,050
I'll,
I'll,

662
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:52,050
we'll do it on.
There's a few choice ones kind of outing

663
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,374
these losers.

664
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,581
Well,
my favorite.

665
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,920
Okay.
My favorite trap though is the girl that

666
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:04,921
puts it out there and then when the guys
are like nice to it would,

667
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,973
you know,
and in some respects and then they get 

668
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,700
mad.
Like don't just look at me for my tits.

669
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,690
Like well probably,
you know,

670
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,270
you kinda didn't.
She is not the reaction you were kind of

671
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,510
looking for and it's like you put your 
boobs out there.

672
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,823
I mean,
I don't do that because I don't want 

673
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:21,150
people to write that stuff,
you know,

674
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,700
it's kind of not on my agenda.
Well,

675
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,870
we want a very specific reaction,
which you don't necessarily.

676
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:30,670
You're not entitled to a specific 
reaction.

677
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,030
You're entitled to nothing.
You get reactions,

678
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,320
you're entitled to nothing distinction.
When you put photos of your tests,

679
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,340
your ass on the Internet,
you're not entitled to anything.

680
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,240
You're not entitled to respect.

681
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,860
Do you mean total to anything?
And I want to give away your bit,

682
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,590
but you'd discuss Megan Kelly,
you can give it away.

683
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,550
It's already out,
right?

684
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,301
Okay.
I just didn't know.

685
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,570
Some people haven't watched it yet,
which is a fan.

686
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,280
It's an amazing special.
But uh,

687
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,650
yeah,
but she's on a news channel,

688
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,250
not dressed like a newsperson vagina.
Kurt and I have a friend who,

689
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:06,260
I didn't know this until after the 
special came out,

690
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:10,780
she came up to me and said that she used
to work with Meghan Kelly Fox News shoes

691
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,400
to be one of her assistants.
And she was like,

692
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,220
she would tell the,
the wardrobe people to make the dress is

693
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:17,990
shorter.
Like that's too long.

694
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,030
Make that dress shorter.
Wow.

695
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,800
Well she knew that she.
But she was cute.

696
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,663
She knew.

697
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,790
I wish I could tell she was so hot back 
then.

698
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,770
I mean,
she's still a beautiful woman,

699
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,590
but God damn,
during like 10,

700
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,470
15 years ago,
she was a fucking smoke show,

701
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,203
man.
She's a gorgeous woman and I don't hate 

702
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:45,380
on women for being 30 and bought hate.
I don't hate on him for fucking using it

703
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,214
either.
Just like I don't hate on Arnold 

704
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,330
Schwartzenegger for being a bodybuilder,
you know,

705
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,350
depending on how you present yourself,
that's kind of what you are.

706
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,530
You're not entitled to any specific 
reaction.

707
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,680
You're going to get reactions and people
are entitled look,

708
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:05,681
as long as they're not threatening you 
or you know,

709
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,460
physically doing anything to what 
they're doing is reacting to what you're

710
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:11,294
putting out.
They don't have any obligation to react 

711
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,140
the way that you would like.
No,

712
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,540
no,
not at all.

713
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,450
Look,
tits and ass.

714
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,570
I'd like to just those ass tits and your
mouth right now.

715
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,800
You're a picture on my phone and I'm 
jerking off to like,

716
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,960
what's wrong with you?
You don't,

717
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,420
you don't know.
I just,

718
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,720
I,
yeah,

719
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,180
I guess I never,
I never led with that.

720
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,290
Good.
But not because I'm A.

721
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,240
I'm not.
Listen,

722
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:43,250
I'm just as thirsty as is that bitch.

723
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,010
Were strippers to comedians are fucking 
strippers,

724
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:51,680
like we want the attention,
but I don't want it for this.

725
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:54,050
I prefer to get it for my mind or 
wherever.

726
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,660
Whatever it is.
I'd prefer to get it from.

727
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,210
Well,
it's,

728
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,330
it's a difference,
right?

729
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,570
It's this,
this tripper thing comes from for sure,

730
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:04,404
a variety of different places.
There's definitely women that are 

731
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,334
strippers that are doing it just because
they're pretty and it's a good way to 

732
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,724
make a lot of money.
It's a great way to make a lot of money 

733
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:14,150
fast from what I understand.
Nothing wrong with it.

734
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,353
The other wrong with it,
but there's also ones that are doing it 

735
00:35:17,751 --> 00:35:20,930
because they have sorbent need for 
attention,

736
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,123
an extraordinary need for sexual 
attention and a lot of them had been 

737
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:30,221
molested and that's more the case with a
porn stars.

738
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,830
Apparently.
There's some crazy study on porn.

739
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Stars were there,
there were going over,

740
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,081
just,
you know,

741
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:39,914
they did like a random survey and went 
to them and ask them how many of them 

742
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,510
have been molested.
It was like 10.

743
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,120
It was like some crazy number.
It's like when you,

744
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,930
when you're watching people fuck on 
camera and you know,

745
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,490
a lot of people watch it.
I mean,

746
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,483
I would,
I would imagine the vast majority of 

747
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:02,871
males specifically watch porn or some 
kind of porn and you're,

748
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:04,064
you're essentially watching the product 
of either a completely sexually 

749
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:10,290
liberated,
liberated woman who likes doing that,

750
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,320
which is possible.
Sure.

751
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,200
Allegedly,
some like Dr.

752
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,640
drew doesn't believe it's possible at 
all.

753
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Can I tell you?
Yeah,

754
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,823
I,
I,

755
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,950
I've heard this argument,
the impairment.

756
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,180
I read a book even from a woman who who 
said yeah,

757
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,014
this is from an empowerment angle.
She'd gotten into an ivy league school 

758
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:25,590
and wanted to pay for it.

759
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,920
It definitely exists in the world.
However,

760
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,040
in my experience,
experience and estimation,

761
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,810
I would say it's likely lasted and then 
that's what you mean.

762
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,010
It's possible,
right?

763
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,790
It's not probable.
So if you're a woman out there that's so

764
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,643
sexually liberated person who enjoys 
doing porn is you don't have any more 

765
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,400
molestations and your past,
you're getting upset right now,

766
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,780
will we knowledge we acknowledge that 
you exist,

767
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,440
not trying to diminish your perspective,
but it's just,

768
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,010
it's an odd thing that,
that leads to all this sex.

769
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,143
And then it's also an odd thing when you
look at the sheer volume of people 

770
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:03,834
fucking uh,
like for a living that's a lot of 

771
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:11,520
foreign born and I have to say it can't 
be that lucrative anymore because of the

772
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,040
Internet to have a joke about it where I
was like,

773
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,980
I need to bring it back and figured out 
how to do it correctly because I kind of

774
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:17,814
abandoned it.

775
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,030
But the premise was who's seen all the 
porn?

776
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:25,470
Like why are they making new porn porn?
Like,

777
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,460
what are you guys doing?
You fucking,

778
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:30,690
you suck everybody's fucking sucking.
Like if you are you just looking to beat

779
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:31,524
off,
are you wasting your whole life will 

780
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:37,350
look like super specific scenes.
Doggish down.

781
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:40,770
I want to be able to see her feet,
the back of her feet.

782
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:44,250
I wonder if in a certain position like 
take a break,

783
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,953
take a week off,
but apparently there is a need for it 

784
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:53,661
because they're making it and people are
consuming this really these niche lanes.

785
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,653
Right.
Well I think it has to do with the fact 

786
00:37:56,911 --> 00:37:59,940
that people are always ramping up and 
like if you,

787
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,820
if you give person a car that has 150 
horsepower,

788
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:03,654
they want a car that is 200 horsepower 
and then next year that car better be 

789
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:07,980
faster than the year after that.

790
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,813
A better breathe better.
And then he after that and they were 

791
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:12,840
constantly trying to get that new 
charge,

792
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,450
like the iphone.
And so if it's just regular sex.

793
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,031
Okay.
Wow.

794
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:17,490
I can't believe I'm watching this 
regular sex.

795
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,750
Wow.
I'd like to see in an hd.

796
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,490
Okay,
why don't you come in her face?

797
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,410
Okay.
What's tickling her ass?

798
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,670
Then come her face.
Whoa.

799
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:26,190
Now we're getting crazy and this is 
where it all goes.

800
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:29,460
Like asked to mouth and gagging,
gagging,

801
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,323
all that crazy shit comes from people 
like watching so much porn than just 

802
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,830
regular stuff's not doing it anymore.
They want to.

803
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,440
They want to grow to be smacked.
They want to come out of her mouth,

804
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,610
tears to come out of her eyes.
They want all that stuff that's.

805
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,890
And like,
I don't fucking get it,

806
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:48,920
but it,
it's,

807
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:54,030
it's this psychological trait that 
people have is ramping up the bigger,

808
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:56,470
better deal.

809
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,340
Constantly wanting something more 
extreme violent movies today,

810
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,920
like Julie and I were talking about the 
extra sister the other day,

811
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,690
which is extremely violent,
terrifying movie for the time,

812
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:09,460
but stay.
It would be so boring.

813
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,493
Wasn't he talking about the girl,
Linda Blair who played that Shit fucked 

814
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:15,341
up now.
A dog.

815
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:18,040
There's no way.
He was thinking crucifixes in your pussy

816
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:20,460
and your normal now.
God,

817
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,540
he always has the best take on share.
Right?

818
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,390
I think Linda Blair was kind of fucked 
up from that.

819
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,233
Admittedly force let me.
She was like 12 years old doing that 

820
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:34,030
movie,
Ram it up across in her pussy.

821
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,860
Of course,
John Jesus.

822
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,573
Jesus traumatize me and it was sound and
the King of the Greens and you forget 

823
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,240
how slow that movie is.
Like watch it now and the pacing of it,

824
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,370
you're like,
holy,

825
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,700
let's get to something.
You know,

826
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,950
because now it's,
I don't even watch the shit now.

827
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,590
Scary movies,
but it's way more.

828
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,060
Uh,
did you see the new Halloween?

829
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:01,751
No,
it didn't,

830
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:04,060
but I heard it's good.
Who saw Tony?

831
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,640
Tony Hinchcliffe loved it.
He said it was awesome.

832
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,503
He said she's a bad ass and she's a 
Jamie Lee Curtis is like preparing for 

833
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:13,290
when he returns and she lives in a 
compound box,

834
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,143
got fucking guns and shit.
And she's like the locked and loaded 

835
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,343
ready to fuck up.
Michael Myers becomes out of the grave 

836
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:19,421
again.
I love it.

837
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,890
Like that.
Terminator check.

838
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,960
Remember when she was working out 
waiting for him.

839
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,270
The names everybody.
Linda Hamilton.

840
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,200
I have a,
a millennial babysitter who works for us

841
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,040
and I was like,
Hey,

842
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,530
did you,
did you know that Jamie Lee Curtis was a

843
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,790
Hermaphrodite?
And she goes,

844
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,000
it's intersects now.
And I was like,

845
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,400
oh,
interesting.

846
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,410
But is that true about Jamie Lee?
Curtis,

847
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,430
my gynecologist says it is true.
Go to college.

848
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,510
This might be a piece of shit.
Allegedly I actually knew was like,

849
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,860
yeah,
tell everybody.

850
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,310
Well tell everybody I saw it.
It's a guy and he says,

851
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,144
yeah,
that she in fact was and they cut off 

852
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,030
the painter and she was so hot when she 
was young.

853
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,350
She was a hot,
gorgeous,

854
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,730
statuesque,
gorgeous wiggle and google,

855
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,903
Google real.
The problem with the real estates is 

856
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,620
then you have a couple of kids and you 
breastfeed.

857
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:18,280
Then they turn into sloppy hangers,
which is what I got.

858
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,980
I got to do something about it.
You're going to fill them up.

859
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,490
Am I going to fill them up?
I'm going again.

860
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I'm a lifted and just put in the same 
place they were and maybe reduce steven.

861
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
Yeah.
I don't like big.

862
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,260
It's no fun when you really have an ex 
who had a big old today's.

863
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,520
She was born with them and they were so 
bad,

864
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,950
but when I met her she had already had a
breast reduction.

865
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,640
She is still a pretty big old titties,
but she just was,

866
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,580
you know,
she had like double f's just naturally.

867
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,340
Those are big.
Yeah.

868
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,290
But they were also like,
it was so annoying because it's all guys

869
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,260
would see big giant tits coming their 
way.

870
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,070
Poor girl.
Yeah.

871
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,100
She said she had back problems to do a 
lot of pilots to strengthen the back,

872
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:06,370
to keep my tits up,
keep them strong.

873
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:07,204
Yeah.
You got to keep going to keep the frame 

874
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:09,074
that holds the tits.
Keep all that frame locked up every 

875
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,240
place.
There's nothing like that for dudes.

876
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,650
Right?
With kids too big.

877
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,740
Like no dudes are out there getting Dick
Reduction.

878
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,730
So you know what dudes do get though.
Here's the thing,

879
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,740
man.
I've been fucking.

880
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,230
I got a pro.
I turn on TV once,

881
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,640
just a couple months ago and I just 
stumbled upon this show called botched.

882
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,960
Yes.
I like this.

883
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:34,640
This is on the channel.
Yes.

884
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,570
Pretty sure.
Yeah.

885
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,700
So maybe maybe I want to these.
What is it on?

886
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,530
Seems More Bravo because it's super 
good.

887
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,690
I know,
I love it.

888
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:44,750
There's a lot.
There's,

889
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:49,751
there's this one guy who was on who was 
helping the guy that got like surgery.

890
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,510
Yeah,
and the guy who was helping,

891
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:54,344
the guy who got started,
one guy was getting surgery because he 

892
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,880
got his peck replaced.
He had to like a peck problem.

893
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,660
That seems crazy to me.
Well he,

894
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,553
he was actually,
he had like some sort of an accident 

895
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:07,700
where he lost his pack.
So the game of Pec implant seemed pretty

896
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:09,710
normal.
He looked better.

897
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:14,711
He was pretty happy,
but the guy who he was working with him,

898
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,883
I don't know what relationship they had 
in the scene where this guy was the 

899
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,870
doctor or what it was.
This guy was like a plastic man,

900
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,560
like his forehead was locked down.
It wasn't going nowhere.

901
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,423
It was botox to the oblivion.
He had cheek shots and his facial 

902
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,300
fillers.
His eyebrows had been done.

903
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,460
He had fake Tan.
He had.

904
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,290
That's.
There you go.

905
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,480
That's the guy.
Definitely heterosexual.

906
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,980
Well,
whatever he is,

907
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,960
he has all these implants.

908
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,853
He has implants in his chest and 
implants in his biceps and he was doing 

909
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:51,014
all that like to look good.
Somebody was joking around about how 

910
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:54,614
even though it has all these implants,
he's still not strong so it couldn't do 

911
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,890
a chin up.
I'm like,

912
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:00,750
this is so crazy.
Like this person is this.

913
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,270
But he was the one that was helping the 
other guy through plastic surgery.

914
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,870
He was helping the other guy,
the other guy who had a problem,

915
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,503
peck implant came out normal,
just had a peck problem and then filled 

916
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:16,880
it in and then it looked like,
oh yeah,

917
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:19,210
look at the guys got to Pex now.
Boy.

918
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,433
But that show is insane.
You see these people that get this sort 

919
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:25,664
of,
um,

920
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,623
what's that word for it?
This morphea bodybuilders get it and 

921
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,130
erect six,
get

922
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,150
it.
You know,

923
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,220
girls who have double f tits and then 
want a bigger.

924
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,920
I haven't,
I've done botox twice in my life.

925
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:42,340
I'm always reluctant to go back just 
because like,

926
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,390
who am I fooling?
I'm 42 years old.

927
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,320
It's okay.
I'm not.

928
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,670
What is it doing to you?
What does it,

929
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,490
what does.
So they paralyzed.

930
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:52,400
They put botulism in your face,
which is why I'm also reluctant because,

931
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,590
you know,
that shit's not been studied really.

932
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,401
I mean,
come on.

933
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,130
How do we know what's going to happen?
So I got a wrinkle here,

934
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,970
so they'll put it here and they freeze 
the muscle at paralyzes it.

935
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:05,870
So you can't make,
you can't scowl scour.

936
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,650
Scour.
That's my.

937
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:12,740
What the fuck is going online?
I got the same one.

938
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,450
Got It.
Uh,

939
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,750
so at paralyze it.
So you can't do the gesture that creates

940
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,600
the wrinkles.
So it's more of a preemptive measure.

941
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,670
So you should start doing early is what 
they say,

942
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,683
right?
But what about being a comic and making 

943
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,410
expressions?
That's the problem.

944
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:29,360
So when you're on stage,
you end up getting migraines because you

945
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:30,194
can't because you.

946
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,280
Yeah.
Move your eyebrows.

947
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,570
I'm surprised with squares on welcome.
I make my eyes water.

948
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,683
You want to see a show?
There's a show on netflix where people 

949
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:48,160
go to Thailand for cheap plastic 
surgery.

950
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,100
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

951
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,080
Have you been in Thailand?
Never have yelled.

952
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:54,641
Awesome.
Yeah,

953
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,540
it just went to summer camp,
the whole family.

954
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,160
Where did you go?
Chiang Mai.

955
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,770
Where's that?
It is a northern Thailand.

956
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:03,440
It's really close to where those kids 
got trapped in the cave.

957
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,363
Oh yeah.
We got there right after they got 

958
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:06,770
rescued,
so it's happy times.

959
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,633
Thailand is dope though.
The people are so friendly and the food 

960
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:12,320
was amazing.
That's what I hear.

961
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,213
We took cooking classes.
We hung out with elephants and an 

962
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,873
elephant sanctuary.
That was pretty bad ass on your 

963
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:20,330
instagram.
Elephants are sweet.

964
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,100
They're so nice.
They're so kind.

965
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,920
You get super nervous around him when 
you first around them because they're so

966
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:25,754
goddamn big.
But then afterwards you realize like 

967
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,750
they're just gentle giants there.
They're so sweet.

968
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,750
And these animals at this one place that
we went to,

969
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:36,110
it's a rehabilitation place,
so they would take animals that had been

970
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:36,944
to the circus and they'd been harmed or 
mistreated and they'd bring them back 

971
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,690
and they even released them into the 
wild.

972
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,980
Wow.
That's cool.

973
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,843
Yeah,
because they wander around with them in 

974
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:46,694
the woods,
like we took them for this long hike 

975
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,690
where you ride them all through the 
woods,

976
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:51,524
so it was like a couple miles who went 
and they just stop and eat things so 

977
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,820
they don't have to worry about feeding 
them.

978
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,910
They're are fucking pretty confident 
that they know what to eat.

979
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,050
They just grab leaves and starts shoving
them in the trunk and then they shit and

980
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:10,330
piss and you can't believe the volume.
The you hear the logs hit the ground.

981
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,420
You're like,
what is happening?

982
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,430
And then you look down there shit and 
you're like,

983
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,270
oh my God.
It was just was just bushels of shit.

984
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,193
Boom,
boom,

985
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,620
boom clubs,
heavy.

986
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:24,650
Just giant clumps of broken down.
Vegetable matter.

987
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,270
They're herbivores.
Yeah,

988
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,400
that's all they eat.
They're so sweet though.

989
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,660
Dillard up to you rub their head and 
they like,

990
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,260
you actually kind of bond with them 
because you feed them sugar cane.

991
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,690
Like when you get to know them,
you wash them.

992
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,390
The first thing they have you do is you 
wash them and you feed them.

993
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,400
So we're,
I think we fed them first.

994
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:48,170
Then washed them and we have these like 
just big piles of sugarcane and you hand

995
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:50,150
them these pieces of sugarcane is 
chewing,

996
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,350
crunch it and swallow it,
and then they and they take it from you,

997
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:57,730
like real gentle.
It was a fucking 2000 plus pound animal,

998
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:00,370
whatever the hell it is.
Probably bigger than that and there's so

999
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,440
kind,
just like real easy.

1000
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,250
They know they walk around you,
they don't try to knock you over there.

1001
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,740
Just real relaxed.
They help you get up if you want to ride

1002
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:11,650
them,
lift their arm up so you can step on the

1003
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,760
arm and then you climb onto their back.
Are you going to get a pet elephant?

1004
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,200
No,
but they're.

1005
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:19,390
They're interesting animals.
They really are.

1006
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:20,224
They're.
They're really sweet and this area that 

1007
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,580
we're at,
they.

1008
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,470
They actually have elephants that live 
in Thailand.

1009
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,110
They actually live in the wild because 
not that many of them,

1010
00:48:29,111 --> 00:48:29,944
but they've introduced,
I think they said seven new ones to the 

1011
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:34,900
wild from this sanctuary,
so it was pretty.

1012
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:38,080
It was pretty bad ass,
but it's interesting that you get to see

1013
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,550
them where they're.
They're free,

1014
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,640
they're free roaming,
they roam all around that area.

1015
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:45,490
They're not in pens,
they're not captive.

1016
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,150
They're basically just freely roaming 
and then they feed them and take care of

1017
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,984
them and they know the food's going to 
be there and then they just eventually 

1018
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:54,820
get them to the point where they can be 
free again.

1019
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,060
Oh Nice.
That was pretty bad ass.

1020
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:59,940
But.
But the people were so friendly,

1021
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,043
so nice.
See this on that show because they're 

1022
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,270
always smiling.
They're super,

1023
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,870
they're really friendly.
Like you run into that all,

1024
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:10,430
all throughout the country.
People super friendly.

1025
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,980
Like don't elephants gestate for like 
years.

1026
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,500
Yeah.
Long time something.

1027
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,920
Something like that.
To be pregnant for that long.

1028
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,013
I Know God count myself.
How about getting fucked by another 

1029
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:25,170
elephant?
Could you have never seen it?

1030
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,180
Have I seen an elephant deck?
I don't think so.

1031
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:29,460
Does it come out of a sheet?
I'm sure.

1032
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:33,840
Like that head and the alien with 
Whitley strieber.

1033
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,570
Not Whitley strieber.
Sigourney weaver,

1034
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,440
striper.
Willis' driver's Whitley strieber.

1035
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,810
As the guy who was behind,
he wrote,

1036
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,840
he's an author.
It's the whole store is really suspect.

1037
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:47,360
He wrote,
uh,

1038
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,010
that movie,
what was the movie?

1039
00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:53,610
He wrote it.
He wrote up one of those alien movies,

1040
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,180
an alien abduction movies,
and he wrote it that it was based on his

1041
00:49:57,181 --> 00:49:58,014
own life that it actually happened.
The problem was he was already this 

1042
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:02,214
fiction novelist who's writing these 
wild stories and they decided to say 

1043
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:08,970
this one's real and it got all sorts of 
traction,

1044
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,223
but you know,
it's all like being abducted in the 

1045
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,323
middle of the night and taken out of his
bed by aliens and brought to ships and 

1046
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,300
scientific experiments like that kind of
stuff.

1047
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,233
Cool.
Do you think there's aliens doing that 

1048
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:27,950
kind of stuff?
I don't think they care about your,

1049
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:28,610
but

1050
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,100
that's the weirdest thing is that they 
have to go up your butt.

1051
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,500
It's always a homoerotic sort of fantasy
and anal fantasy with the alien.

1052
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,700
Why does it always turn sexual?

1053
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,553
I think because if you're paralyzed,
the number one fear is that someone's 

1054
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,380
going to put something up.
Your bought

1055
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:46,550
were out at the time.
I,

1056
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,580
I,
yeah,

1057
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,650
I don't,
I don't do,

1058
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:52,520
but stuff for that re unlike.
The other thing is,

1059
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:53,354
um,
I think a combined with the other thing 

1060
00:50:57,711 --> 00:50:58,544
is I think they worry people worry about
being impregnated or having their baby 

1061
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,530
taken them.
Oh yeah.

1062
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:05,540
The aliens.
That's a common theme too.

1063
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:07,850
I'd be afraid of that.
Have you been to Roswell,

1064
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,641
New Mexico?
No,

1065
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:09,474
I have not.
I went there for some TV show I worked 

1066
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:12,710
on like a decade ago.
And they,

1067
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,060
you know,
they claim that's where the,

1068
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:19,090
the aliens is that they live with.
That's where the crash happened in 1947.

1069
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,450
When I say that there's like a museum 
you can go to and see.

1070
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,500
I don't know,
whenever I bought a tee shirt,

1071
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:25,334
it was great.

1072
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,160
Yeah.
The whole story is super suspect.

1073
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,890
The story of what happened.
It's like a,

1074
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,233
there was some records they found.
They flew the wreckage in two separate 

1075
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:38,750
planes to Wright Patterson Air Force 
Base and Truman actually met them.

1076
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,860
They're like,
whatever the fuck did crash.

1077
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,933
It was,
have enough importance that Truman flew 

1078
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:47,774
out and they flew it in two separate 
planes in case one of the planes went 

1079
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:51,250
down.
This was the,

1080
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:52,084
this is the folk lore and then the next 
day they had this press conference and 

1081
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:55,371
they're like,
oh,

1082
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,204
we made a mistake.
It was just a balloon and then you know 

1083
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,020
my joke that I used to do it was like,
well,

1084
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:04,400
what about the aliens?
Those are Mexicans.

1085
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:09,070
Theory got drunk.
There were mistook the balloon for Jada.

1086
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,410
Everyone's fine,
but the.

1087
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,253
The whole story behind it.
The problem was it got put in the 

1088
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:19,400
Roswell daily record that the military 
is recovered,

1089
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:23,210
a crashed flying disc and then everybody
went fucking bananas,

1090
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,243
so no one,
no one really knows what actually 

1091
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:26,510
happened,
obviously.

1092
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:27,723
No.
Did you ever hear why they picked right 

1093
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:31,100
pat?
Because it's in the middle of Ohio.

1094
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,940
I don't know.
In Roswell is pretty far.

1095
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,340
I think he's just a big air force base.
Isn't that right?

1096
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:40,250
Patterson Air Force Base where I'm 
hanger 18 was.

1097
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,810
Yeah,
I guess that Dayton,

1098
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:43,923
but I don't like,
but hang on a team was another famous 

1099
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:49,220
thing and Ufo folklore,
folklore.

1100
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:50,054
There was like this,
suppose it hanger 18 and find out where 

1101
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:54,434
that is.
Hangar 18 was supposed to be this place 

1102
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:57,794
where they stored all of the crashed 
wreckage from various ufo over the last 

1103
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:06,780
few decades because apparently there's 
been numerous crashed Ufo,

1104
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,470
great on alien planets.
That's what it says.

1105
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,190
Is that right?
18.

1106
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,680
There's like a website about it.
Yeah.

1107
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,180
But yeah,
so it's that right pat.

1108
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,010
Long as there's a website about it 
traces a squarespace website.

1109
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,180
We believe Jerry.
No,

1110
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,710
it's uh,
what was the ones?

1111
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:29,930
Cities remember those with the animated 
little gifts school?

1112
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah.
What about the moon landing?

1113
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:35,040
Did you see the movie Ryan Gosling?
No,

1114
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:37,140
I did not.
I heard it was good though.

1115
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:38,580
I heard it was really good.
Did you love.

1116
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,433
It wasn't controversial,
like they didn't put the American flag 

1117
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:46,581
down.
It was something so cool.

1118
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:52,280
Right to listen.
Music video.

1119
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,080
There was something.
He brought his daughter's necklace up.

1120
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,960
He has his young daughter.
I want to give it all away,

1121
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:01,960
but then he put his daughter's necklace 
there and I don't know,

1122
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,760
based on real life that the.
Yes,

1123
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:06,210
loosely.
That's what they're saying.

1124
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,750
It's probable that that happened.
The flag thing,

1125
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,800
I don't even.
I don't remember.

1126
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,460
I'm sure there was some sort of 
controversy,

1127
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:13,323
didn't plant the US flag,
people were upset and they were saying 

1128
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:17,310
that,
you know,

1129
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:18,143
in this climate they just thought it 
wouldn't be a good idea to express 

1130
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,540
nationalism or something.

1131
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:27,510
So I remember reading some cockamamie 
reason why they didn't have the flag.

1132
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,630
They actually had the flag.
You fuck there actually,

1133
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:31,464
if you believe in the moon landing,
you believe it happened and you want to 

1134
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:35,400
show you a movie of it.
You got to show the flag.

1135
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,920
They put it in the ground is a big part 
of the program.

1136
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,310
Here's our flag.
It's in the,

1137
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,740
in the fucking dirt on the moon.
So that's right.

1138
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,580
It's there.
And now he also paid brown on the way up

1139
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,430
on the 40 day journey.
And I heard you just Pete Brown,

1140
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:50,801
uh,
Pete,

1141
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:51,634
a little brown.
It was more like amber colored ice tea 

1142
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,600
colored while I was a little worried 
about.

1143
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,434
There's something called rhabdomyolysis 
that when you do crossfit or actually a 

1144
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:03,894
couple of fighters have died from it.
I actually just found out about that 

1145
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:06,474
this weekend,
that fighters who had been overtrained 

1146
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:09,324
going into fights and then exerted 
themselves to extreme during the fight 

1147
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,430
and then died afterwards.

1148
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,830
A couple of them turned out to have had 
rhabdo my locis,

1149
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,600
which is,
uh,

1150
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,350
the,
your,

1151
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,183
your muscle tissue breaks down your 
liver crashes or your kidneys crash 

1152
00:55:23,761 --> 00:55:24,900
rather.
I didn't have that.

1153
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,580
I just,
I was just dehydrated.

1154
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,580
Oh yeah.
That was pretty gnarly.

1155
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:34,700
I was sweating at a rate that I couldn't
possibly keep up with.

1156
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,413
Just trying to rehydrate.
Normally you guys and the sober fucking 

1157
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,920
October man when crazy.
Right.

1158
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,030
What was it like being the wife of a 
person who was involved in this?

1159
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,180
I hate it so much.
I hate that you guys do this shit.

1160
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,980
You know what we're doing next year?
Uh,

1161
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,083
yeah.
And I heard you guys talking about it 

1162
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,420
because I caught that part of the show 
surfing.

1163
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,343
Yep.
We're gonna.

1164
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:00,930
We're gonna stay on a board longer,
like who stays on the board for the most

1165
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:01,914
amount of time in the month.
I love this challenge because I love 

1166
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:06,450
surfing.
I learned to do it in my twenties.

1167
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:07,284
I'm terrible at it,
but that's like that's why it's so 

1168
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:11,410
incredibly difficult.
Have you served?

1169
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:12,443
Not at all and I'm not going to.
I'm not even going to touch it until 

1170
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:16,980
October and this is.
None of us can practice.

1171
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:18,900
We can practice.
Yeah.

1172
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,390
We got to wait until October and then do
it.

1173
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,040
I will say the ocean is very in

1174
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,873
October.
That's the one you're going to get a 

1175
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:30,040
special suit.
I'm sure there are.

1176
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,010
Yeah.
I'm going to get one with fucking.

1177
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,470
It's gonna have Kevlar and it's the 
sharks can't eat me.

1178
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,070
Oh,
that's another thing though.

1179
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,033
Not getting aided by no big fish.
This is a tablet that does a tentative 

1180
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:49,240
challenge,
but I have to say this last one,

1181
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,673
your husband Tommy bonds is the one that
came up with the fitness challenge and 

1182
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:56,110
there was only like the last couple of 
days before October,

1183
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:57,850
like we hadn't really decided on what 
we're going to do.

1184
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:58,684
In fact,
we were even thinking about repeating 

1185
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,220
our 15 yoga class thing.
Like we'd kind of settled into that.

1186
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:03,731
I was like,
okay,

1187
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:04,564
I can do 15 yoga classes,
and we kind of had decided that that's 

1188
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:09,460
what we're going to do,
and then I know where your husband goes,

1189
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,440
Hey,
I've been doing this fitness thing,

1190
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,274
I wear this app.
Maybe we could just see who gets the 

1191
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:14,680
most points for a month.
I'm like,

1192
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:15,630
okay.

1193
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,810
I didn't think anything of it.
You weren't excited about that idea.

1194
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,790
I thought it would be fun,
like whatever.

1195
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:21,624
It'd be fine,
but I didn't think it would be a psycho 

1196
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,240
battle to the death when it became 
really quick.

1197
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,500
I'll tell you what's,
what was D as a spouse of the sober?

1198
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,030
Is the sobriety parts not too difficult 
for Tommy?

1199
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,200
Yeah,
it's the time away from the family.

1200
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:38,910
It's like he would go and be like,
bye.

1201
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,680
I'm going to go hike for six hours in 
and we live near hills and I'm like,

1202
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:44,514
there's fucking rattle snakes and 
cougars and you better be back before 

1203
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:48,190
sundown,
do you know?

1204
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,890
Um,
yeah.

1205
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:52,890
And then he got sick.
So he was doing it on antibiotics,

1206
00:57:52,891 --> 00:57:53,724
which was crazy.
I didn't want them to be doing that 

1207
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:57,810
shit.
Thirteen miles on antibiotics.

1208
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,750
Crazy has bananas.
No,

1209
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,980
that is so hard to do.
I know and.

1210
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,770
But we were like talking about it at 
breakfast and he was like,

1211
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:07,380
well Joe is gonna be first?
There's no question like.

1212
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,900
So it was more about who's going to be 
second and third.

1213
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,300
He was

1214
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,560
trying to take that first place spot now
what?

1215
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,403
He was doing all sorts of sneaky tricks.
He was trying to bank up as points and 

1216
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:20,110
try to pretend that I know that he 
wasn't a threat.

1217
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,910
He really was sneaky.
He was.

1218
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,130
Oh,
he's super sneaky.

1219
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,370
He came close.
He came close.

1220
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,820
He was the closest to me and he was.
He was the most sneaky.

1221
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,580
He's definitely the most sneaky.
What do you mean?

1222
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:36,970
Like what's his,
how has he sneaky like what we would say

1223
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,850
things to me like you should just work 
out normal and see if you beat us.

1224
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,780
I mean if you just try to beat us,
be too easy.

1225
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:47,750
Like one on one I do that are like,
yeah.

1226
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,320
I had decided early on that I was going 
to beat them,

1227
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,410
but I decided that I was.
At first I was like,

1228
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:54,244
this is so stupid.
Who gives a shit about this competition 

1229
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:59,140
really ruined my life for this thing.
I could not live with myself.

1230
00:58:59,141 --> 00:58:59,974
If burt one.
That was a big part of the problem with 

1231
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:04,120
that really have happened though.
Could have happened.

1232
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:07,750
I have all of you guys.
You never know if we fucked off.

1233
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,891
Yeah,
see,

1234
00:59:08,891 --> 00:59:10,690
no one fucked off.
Everybody went hard.

1235
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:11,524
Even burt burt's wife was probably used 
to him being gone 10 abandoning the 

1236
00:59:16,661 --> 00:59:18,500
family.
She's like,

1237
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,720
whatever.
It's just not here.

1238
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,960
I did lot of my workout

1239
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,560
at home,
you know,

1240
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,920
because I have a gym in my house.
Yeah.

1241
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:27,500
So it wasn't.
They knew where to find me.

1242
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,900
So your wife and your.
They would come in and make fun of me.

1243
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,420
Whoa.
Why are you still doing this?

1244
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,270
Like my eight year old,
especially if she thinks it's hilarious.

1245
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,340
She's like,
you better when you're better.

1246
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:41,150
When she'd walk away.
Like so fun.

1247
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,560
She's a little comedian.
She's a funny little fucker.

1248
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,020
Really is.
You got to raise them Sassy.

1249
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:51,200
Girls can't raise them.
That princess shits horrible.

1250
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,610
You're a princess.
Like,

1251
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:53,444
oh no,
don't raise girls to think they're 

1252
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:57,290
princesses because now always waiting to
be rescued for shit.

1253
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,690
Donnelly.
Not only that,

1254
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:02,930
like that means you're a part of a 
monarchy and you're oppressing all those

1255
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,960
peasants.
Like this whole,

1256
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,930
like I talked to a friend once who was 
like,

1257
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,500
this is back in the nineties,
and he was.

1258
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,570
He was very pro black,
black guy who's very pro and he said one

1259
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:19,910
of the most ridiculous things any 
person's ever said,

1260
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,160
he was talking about black people today 
goes,

1261
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:26,570
black people have got to understand back
in the day we will kings and I go,

1262
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,010
you will.
You couldn't be all kings.

1263
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,150
I go,
listen,

1264
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,560
listen.
Do you understand that king's work?

1265
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,394
There's one person and that person 
dominates all these other people with 

1266
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,530
power,
and the way they do it is through threat

1267
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,830
and military and kill people who oppress
them.

1268
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:42,440
Like you don't want to be a king man.
You don't.

1269
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:43,274
Yeah.
It's one of the most terrible things to 

1270
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:47,660
be is a king.
You don't even get elected into office,

1271
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,180
you just to king.
You have ultimate power.

1272
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:51,014
You abuse the shit out of you.
You weren't all kings like you can't be 

1273
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,420
all.
You can't say we were kings.

1274
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:57,090
No,
God.

1275
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:57,923
Damn.
That's a stupid thing to say because 

1276
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:00,530
God,
God ordains the king.

1277
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:05,260
Henry the.
I love those historical things aside.

1278
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,900
Netflix.
Do you ever watch vikings?

1279
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,510
I started to,
yeah.

1280
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,850
It's a good.
It's fucking good.

1281
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,760
Yeah,
it's surprisingly good.

1282
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,050
Give it four episodes because right 
around episode four it really kicks in.

1283
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:19,323
So one of our friends had told us,
so I've watched the first episode of 

1284
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:22,004
this show is kind of clunky and episode 
two comes around by episode four rolls 

1285
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:26,330
around.
You're like,

1286
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,380
oh shit.

1287
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,880
Oh,
it's good to just get executed back then

1288
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:35,723
the way he looked at him,
fuck him up and that would get people 

1289
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:42,830
scared and that's how you keep power.
That's what Putin's doing.

1290
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,660
Yeah.
That's what they do in North Korea,

1291
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,310
you know,
are,

1292
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,100
could just be like,
you're going to be my new hoe.

1293
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,293
Do you know about that?
Because Shogi guy that the journalists 

1294
01:01:52,301 --> 01:01:54,230
that got assassinated,
do you know about this?

1295
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,760
No,
I've been in a bubble.

1296
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,580
Journalists got assassinated by the 
Saudis.

1297
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,380
He went to the,
uh,

1298
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:01,363
the embassy in Istanbul because his wife
who went to the Turkish embassy because 

1299
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:10,250
his wife was Turkish and he was trying 
to get married to her and the Saudis had

1300
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:11,084
sent 15 hit men to meet him there.
They strangled him and dismembered him 

1301
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,280
with bone saws,
carry him out in suitcases.

1302
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,010
And they brought in a guy who was a 
forensics expert.

1303
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:23,844
He was one of the 15 people.
So they brought in someone who would 

1304
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:26,934
know how to manipulate the data.
And the Turkish apparently they said 

1305
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:32,544
that they have all,
they have video and audio evidence that 

1306
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,564
he was murdered there,
but they can't release it because then 

1307
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,050
it'll show the people how they spy on 
them.

1308
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Oh my God,
this is today in 2018.

1309
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,300
It killed a journalist.
They didn't like what he was saying.

1310
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,283
That smell is Saudi though.
I did a military gig in Saudi Arabia 

1311
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,000
right before I,
uh,

1312
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:57,893
2007.
And I actually had two passports when I 

1313
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,690
went to go do this military tour and I 
didn't know why,

1314
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:07,710
and we get to Riyadh and they go give 
them this passport,

1315
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:08,544
the second one that we gave you,
which was completely blank and just had 

1316
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:12,180
my personal information.
I know.

1317
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,190
And we go in there and they go,
oh,

1318
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,290
it's Thursday,
it's chop chop Thursday.

1319
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,770
It's a public execution day.
Do you guys want to go see it?

1320
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,120
And I was like,
I don't know.

1321
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:23,580
I don't know.
Like on the one hand kind of curious.

1322
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:24,414
On the one hand,
no,

1323
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,613
we couldn't do it because somebody,
some guy had put a bomb up as buttoned 

1324
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,920
blown up of a prince or something so we 
couldn't go.

1325
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:34,170
But yeah,
public executions,

1326
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:36,510
they want you to see the,
you know,

1327
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,300
to keep people in line.
And it's terrifying.

1328
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,450
Women can,
women can drive now

1329
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,233
guy.
They'll get stoned to death in front of 

1330
01:03:47,901 --> 01:03:49,010
her buddy.
Sure.

1331
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,270
Yeah,
sure.

1332
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,163
They behead people.
They do all kinds of crazy shit to 

1333
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:54,200
journalist.
Yeah.

1334
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,730
The only locked bloggers up for life.
People have disrespected the crown.

1335
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,530
Crazy shit.
Yeah.

1336
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,490
Yeah.
Women can't even,

1337
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,740
you can't go to the mall unless I'm a 
male.

1338
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:05,240
Family member accompanies you

1339
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,120
2018.
Yeah.

1340
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:10,460
Clock and try getting out of there.
You know,

1341
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,893
you weren't talking about this.
How crazy it is that it's so easy to 

1342
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:18,170
come here from some countries like Cuba.
All you have to do is get on a raft.

1343
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,460
You make it to Miami like you're in,
Bro.

1344
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,050
That's all you have to do to survive.
They don't send you back to Cuba ever.

1345
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,410
That's true,
Huh?

1346
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,230
We don't.
What about that alien?

1347
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,930
Gonzales and he gets sent back 
eventually.

1348
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,150
That was his parents wanted him back.
Right?

1349
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,150
It remember they had a gun.
They fucking machine guns.

1350
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:37,250
The kid was in the closet like what the 
fuck?

1351
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,630
Why did they send him home?
There was some circumstances to that.

1352
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,610
Dad was,
was it dad in the old country and mom in

1353
01:04:43,611 --> 01:04:48,611
this country and there was a them back.
Some some something like that.

1354
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:50,443
But for the most part they don't deport 
you when you make it from Miami or to 

1355
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:55,730
Miami rather from.

1356
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,350
From Cuba.
You're good bro.

1357
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,120
Thank God.
Crazy though,

1358
01:04:59,121 --> 01:05:00,290
right?
It is crazy.

1359
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:05,290
I have to do is get on a raft and 
survive 90 miles high.

1360
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,310
That's it.
That's it.

1361
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,200
How long would that take?
Could take a long ass time.

1362
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:14,950
If you're doing a mile an hour,
taking 90 minutes a mile,

1363
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:20,300
an hour,
take you 90 hours rather than ours.

1364
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,070
Okay.
That's still a red mile an hour,

1365
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,423
which is like how fast do you pedal?
You're paddling like how fast can you 

1366
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:30,340
pass fast as I can paddle a mile an 
hour.

1367
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,130
I have no idea.
What's a good question,

1368
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:33,890
right?
Yeah.

1369
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:37,260
Depends on whether or not you'd go in 
with the tide against the tide dude,

1370
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,400
and then the sun goes down.
It's cold as shit.

1371
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:44,401
I mean sharks.
You've seen Malana sharks.

1372
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,060
Sure.
Fresh water.

1373
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:48,280
What are you drinking?
Drinking and shit.

1374
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:49,840
You can.
You're going to try to keep it together.

1375
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:52,380
Drink as much as you can before and then
you got to drink your pis.

1376
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:52,881
Yeah,
yeah,

1377
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:53,471
yeah.
You can.

1378
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,610
Once it separates,
right?

1379
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:55,730
You let it sit,
drink it.

1380
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,090
Just drink it right out.
Fresh out.

1381
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,183
Yeah.
You will do as you lie on your back and 

1382
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:05,140
you bring your ass to years,
you grabbed your hands behind your ass,

1383
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,190
bring it to yourself in your mouth.

1384
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,910
Don't want to lose any of its precious 
moisture in and out,

1385
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,160
in and out.
Your wife's that TV show.

1386
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:22,840
Is it navy seals who can survive?
One guy goes to the beach,

1387
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:25,000
one guy has to go to the mountains or 
some shit.

1388
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,320
I've seen a lot of those shows.
Survivor.

1389
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:33,250
That was one of them.
I'd like to learn how to survive.

1390
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:35,680
I wouldn't be good at it.
Would you do naked and afraid?

1391
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:39,250
The stupidest one.
That's the stupidest fucking show.

1392
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,980
Why would you want to be naked?
You don't need to know in your butthole.

1393
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,040
Well,
there's something about that.

1394
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:45,874
This like,
okay,

1395
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:46,953
this is a.
they've taken it as far as you can take 

1396
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,360
it.
Like,

1397
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,150
okay,
we're going to have people survive.

1398
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:52,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1399
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:55,450
Like survivor man.
Hey a kid without people that do that,

1400
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:56,650
don't know what they're doing.
Hey,

1401
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:59,080
good idea and I'm fucking mad.

1402
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,630
Let's make them naked.
Like,

1403
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:02,320
okay,
Jesus.

1404
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:05,080
You don't care about people at all.
Why would you do that?

1405
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,880
Tanks now you get people and one of them
is hot and the other one's fat.

1406
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,280
Disgusting.
Then you have naked together.

1407
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,630
Well,
I like to watch.

1408
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:14,464
I used to like survivor when they put 
the fat people on the island and then 

1409
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,880
they get real skinny by the end of the 
show.

1410
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:20,800
That was Kinda cool.
Right?

1411
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,760
Weight loss show that is legit.
You get on a fucking island with nothing

1412
01:07:24,761 --> 01:07:25,900
to eat.
You will lose weight.

1413
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,510
If you're fat,
you actually have an advantage.

1414
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:29,903
Weight to lose.
That's you're really skinny and you 

1415
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:32,464
can't.
I remember one time someone killed 

1416
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:36,190
something like a rabbit or something and
everybody freaked out.

1417
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,050
People were so mad.
Meanwhile,

1418
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,060
they could be serving them chicken out 
of a bucket.

1419
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:42,760
No one said a word.
So stupid.

1420
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,100
Oh my God.
He killed a rabbit with a knife.

1421
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,700
Are you supposed to eat?
You don't want them to do that.

1422
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,640
What do you want that rabbit to live 
forever and become an angel?

1423
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,960
What the fuck is wrong with you have 
rabbits lived two years.

1424
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,780
My kids had a pet rabbit.
They live for like the worst.

1425
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,183
Gerbils.
Hamsters Hampshire's to live for two 

1426
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:03,890
years.
We had one that lived.

1427
01:08:03,891 --> 01:08:05,590
Two or three was a miracle.
Yeah,

1428
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,170
amazing.
The last 12 months were incredible.

1429
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,843
It was an extra year.
They didn't give a fuck about that 

1430
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:13,260
thing.
It's like they.

1431
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,920
They say they want a hamster.
I like,

1432
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:17,320
oh,
we want a hamster wheel.

1433
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,380
The hamster.
Okay,

1434
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,273
let's get a hamster.
We're going to play with it all the 

1435
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:21,164
time.
We promised.

1436
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,250
Okay.
Okay.

1437
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,890
They get it.
They pick it up a couple times.

1438
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,980
I'm like,
fuck this little rat rat bag.

1439
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,610
They have cats and dogs,
which are,

1440
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,400
which are real pants.
Everything else is bullshit.

1441
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,980
Pet a bullshit pet.
He can't really play with it.

1442
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:37,130
You can't snuggle with a hamster.
You can't teach it to do anything.

1443
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,020
The worst.
I think his birds.

1444
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,053
Oh,
did you have a fucking burst or little 

1445
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,040
cut?
Diaz done.

1446
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,330
Don't give a fuck about this shit all 
over your house if you let them out.

1447
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,090
One thing we did do is we raised a 
hummingbird.

1448
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:50,900
We,
uh,

1449
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,300
we brought it back to health and then 
released it.

1450
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,793
We found a hummingbird.
There was a baby humming bird that had 

1451
01:08:56,571 --> 01:09:01,571
fallen out of the nest and it was really
tiny and so we took it in and uh,

1452
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,130
we didn't know how long it was going to 
live.

1453
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,331
I was like,
man,

1454
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:07,040
this thing might die on us,
like what do we do?

1455
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:10,700
And then we had a google what they eat 
and basically the sugar water,

1456
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,193
so we basically put sugar and mix it in 
with water and put it in as his or her 

1457
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,770
little Balaji gender that,
yeah,

1458
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:23,420
I'm going to call it us or in a box in a
box.

1459
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:24,523
And we fed them and they,
they them pronouns and the Diet sugar 

1460
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:34,040
water.
Could you imagine?

1461
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:34,874
We kept it for a month and then 
eventually it got to a point where it 

1462
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:38,684
was kind of hopping around inside the 
box and it seemed to be healthy and 

1463
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:43,550
would let us hold it and everything.
It was really crazy,

1464
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,000
like totally attached to us.
And then we let it go and flew away.

1465
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,390
Like it was fucked up in the beginning.
He couldn't move his wings.

1466
01:09:50,391 --> 01:09:51,800
Right.
We didn't know what to do,

1467
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:52,634
whether it was wounded to the point 
we're going to have to take it and get 

1468
01:09:55,161 --> 01:09:59,480
it fixed somewhere and we didn't know.
Damn,

1469
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,380
but it lived.
Hey,

1470
01:10:00,381 --> 01:10:01,490
sorry.
How long did you have it?

1471
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,880
About a month or so.
Crazy.

1472
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:08,720
I have a theater outside the kitchen 
window and I love to watch them.

1473
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:13,721
I get so excited when they have strange 
bird makes my day so fast,

1474
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,410
so fast.

1475
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:18,380
Those little tiny wings to their wings 
are so small.

1476
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,550
That's what's odd.
Like every bird has like a wingspan,

1477
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,640
but their wingspan is like half the size
of a normal births.

1478
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:30,641
Wingspan and they just go a million 
miles an hour and they go left and right

1479
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:32,264
and up and down and they just.
So their ability to change direction is 

1480
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,314
so strange and hover.
I think it just hover perfectly in the 

1481
01:10:39,171 --> 01:10:42,290
air and then turn it off and then come 
back and hover.

1482
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,930
Yeah,
it's very unusual design.

1483
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,930
Yeah,
right.

1484
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,050
They're so tiny,
but I guess that's why they have to move

1485
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:48,884
so fast because the wings are so tiny.
You ever seen one get fucked up by 

1486
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,170
praying mantis?
No.

1487
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:54,004
That's the dark shit.
Praying mantis will hide underneath a 

1488
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:01,190
bird feeder and just sit there.
Just sit there like this and wait.

1489
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,173
And you're like,
how the praying Mantis can't fuck up 

1490
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:03,800
that bird.

1491
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,900
It's smaller than the bird.
Oh yes.

1492
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:10,670
They can never seen it.
We'll put it up.

1493
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,960
Yeah.
Praying mantises regularly kill.

1494
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,473
I did not climb up to the nest.
They climb up to the theater and they 

1495
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:20,730
just sit and wait and [inaudible] they 
look like sticks,

1496
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,863
you know,
and they blend in with the color of the 

1497
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,240
tree they're on,
you know,

1498
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,620
because they camouflage their color here
at.

1499
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,430
Watch this.
Look at this mother fucker.

1500
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,440
Look at him just hanging out there.
Totally frozen.

1501
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,050
And these birds when any idea what's 
going on,

1502
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,490
it seems like he's kind of.
He wrap son.

1503
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:41,763
They're crazy.
The hummingbird is so much faster than 

1504
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:45,120
him.
It doesn't matter.

1505
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,250
It doesn't.
It only has to be fast for a second.

1506
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,020
The only has to clamp down those jaws.
Persons saving it.

1507
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,720
Person saved it.
What?

1508
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:57,280
That person's an asshole.
He right order of things.

1509
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,653
We kind of gave away his punch.
He's really like telegraphing his moves 

1510
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,610
and they're supposed to get out of 
there.

1511
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:09,570
You see this shit happening.
Just had a stupid ass bird.

1512
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,393
We have an owl in our backyard and one 
of the coolest things is when the sun 

1513
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:15,594
goes down,
we sit in the backyard and we launched 

1514
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:19,680
that fucker come out of the big tree 
that it lives in.

1515
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:25,590
Ohio just swoops through the backyard 
and you're like,

1516
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,440
that's gonna do it.
He's out.

1517
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,150
He's going to catch some shit tonight.
Rabbits,

1518
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:35,151
you're going to put your dogs away.
They keep the rat population down to.

1519
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:37,110
We got lots of those because we have 
fruit trees,

1520
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,153
so the fucking rats.
Look at this praying mantises tracking 

1521
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,950
this hummingbird regularly eat 
hummingbirds,

1522
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,443
but the thing is if you look at the size
of the hummingbird and the size of the 

1523
01:12:47,941 --> 01:12:48,930
praying Mantis,
he would go,

1524
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,290
there's no way.
Where's it going to eat it?

1525
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:52,124
I can't even.
There's not even enough room and its 

1526
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:54,270
body.
That's a good point.

1527
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,680
And the beak,
it's so hard.

1528
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,370
They don't give a fuck praying.
Mantises just.

1529
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,030
We are so lucky.
They're little,

1530
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,150
if there are big German shepherds,
we will be fucked.

1531
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,873
They're just eat us.
We're lucky dogs are as adobe as they 

1532
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,391
are.
You know,

1533
01:13:08,391 --> 01:13:09,950
and your specialty.
Talk about how to dumb.

1534
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,670
They're afraid of your judgment,
your dogs big enough.

1535
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,820
He's a golden retriever.
He's not eating anybody,

1536
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,260
but if his brain were more.
Yeah,

1537
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,123
I wonder if like if he was a rat that 
big versus that big and he was a 

1538
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:31,320
ferocious rat and I was in the subway 
and I saw him.

1539
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,620
I wouldn't be so scared till we got 
rats.

1540
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,760
Do you have rats in your.
Oh,

1541
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:36,990
we definitely get rats.
Yeah.

1542
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,480
I hate them so much.
I have a guy that comes.

1543
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,400
My rag guy puts down all the fucking 
traps.

1544
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:42,234
We had one get into an AC unit in one of
our guest bedroom and it stunk like 

1545
01:13:47,521 --> 01:13:48,354
shit.
Yeah.

1546
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:53,380
We had went to a dyed in the wall and we
started having all these flies that,

1547
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,443
that came in through the room and we 
were trying to figure out how does this 

1548
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,310
fly getting in here.
We realize there's something dead in the

1549
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:03,930
wall because it was stinking and we had 
to just wait for it to rot away.

1550
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:04,831
Oh yeah.
Well,

1551
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:08,100
I guess what's the alternative you 
punched through the wall?

1552
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,510
Fuck that.
You don't want to do that.

1553
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,344
Yeah.
It was the only alternative rat on the 

1554
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:13,020
wall.
Sons.

1555
01:14:13,021 --> 01:14:15,580
So nasty.
They're caught one with the trap.

1556
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,510
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1557
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:17,670
I love it.
A lot of them.

1558
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,360
Yeah.
What kind of traveler you use?

1559
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:20,253
Kind of hurt.
Snappers the snapper to the best 

1560
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,124
actually fucked up story.
I was in encino and I was renting this 

1561
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:31,060
house for awhile and uh,
killed a rat and it was a big boy.

1562
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,980
Big,
big fat boy.

1563
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:34,360
And I was like,
Jesus.

1564
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,680
So the thing.
And I was like,

1565
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:38,010
Eh,
I'm going to go to bed in the morning of

1566
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,820
cleaned it up.
I went to bed.

1567
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:41,260
I came back in the morning.
He was eating.

1568
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,420
The only thing that was left is his 
tail.

1569
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,490
They ate the entire rat.

1570
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,460
That rats are full on.
Cannibals.

1571
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:51,130
I didn't know that the other rats will 
eat the dead guy 100 percent.

1572
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:55,740
Instantly.
They hate him down to the tail.

1573
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,620
No,
there was nothing left down to the tail.

1574
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,730
Even rats will need a rat's tail.
Right?

1575
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,990
This shit's nasty.
We should serve tails on fear factor.

1576
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,810
Even rats will need it to like,
Nah,

1577
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,720
Bro.
Stick with garbage and assholes.

1578
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,840
They ate everything.
That guts.

1579
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:14,703
They hate the head.
Everything is chewed through the rat 

1580
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:21,580
head.
There was almost nothing left.

1581
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:22,300
Yeah,
they were eating.

1582
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,970
We're eating bones.
Who was almost nothing left.

1583
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,140
It was so disturbing.
Yeah.

1584
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:28,974
There's a rat eating another wrap.
Cannibal rats filmed eating fellow 

1585
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:33,730
rodents.
Yeah.

1586
01:15:33,731 --> 01:15:36,790
They eat the shit out of each other.
They have no problem with that.

1587
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,070
And once they're in your house,
you're screwed.

1588
01:15:39,071 --> 01:15:42,130
Once you see those droppings,
now you're fucked.

1589
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,410
You got to find out how they're getting 
into the house.

1590
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,990
You gotTa caulk it up or whatever.
But that shit.

1591
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,600
That's the worst man.
Yeah.

1592
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,633
Well it was one of the reasons why it's 
good to have coyotes around is why it's 

1593
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:57,540
good to have owls.
All those things.

1594
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,350
Hawks,
all those things.

1595
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:00,184
Keep the rat population down.
So people run around killing hawks and 

1596
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:07,750
owls and.
And there was also a problem with people

1597
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:11,650
that leave out poison because he leave 
out poison for the rats and the rats eat

1598
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,484
the poison.
Then the owls eat the rats and they get 

1599
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:15,530
poisoned.
They die out here.

1600
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,383
Yeah,
that's an issue.

1601
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,640
That's no good.
We have coyotes too.

1602
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,570
They come out in broad daylight.
Yeah,

1603
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,610
you gotta be careful.
Those little fuckers running kids were.

1604
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,840
Yes.
And around small little dogs.

1605
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:27,730
Tillium little shitty dogs if you need 
to.

1606
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,890
Yup.
Oh yeah.

1607
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:30,600
Yeah.
They'll,

1608
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,080
they'll,
they'll bite your fucking kids.

1609
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,000
I mean,
if no one's around,

1610
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,100
you know,
if you leave a kid in the yard,

1611
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,143
three year old kid,
I'm just going to take a shit right 

1612
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,290
back,
back out.

1613
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:44,350
Come back onto the half eaten kid.
I take my kid with me to take a shit.

1614
01:16:44,351 --> 01:16:46,360
I put them on my lap when they shit.
You have to.

1615
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,700
Of course I'm not going to let my kid be
alone.

1616
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:53,020
Three year olds get into everything,
especially with fucking animals.

1617
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,380
Animals out there.
That's dark.

1618
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:59,770
That's the weird thing.
Like those coyotes are really.

1619
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:00,723
They're predators that are wandering.
We know we had a big issue with them 

1620
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:05,710
because we have chickens and they 
started killing our chickens,

1621
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:06,963
but then we realized we targeted like 
our yard is targeted by these little 

1622
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,040
tiny

1623
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,050
wolves.
It's very strange,

1624
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:15,330
sort of wild creatures that are sneaky.
Oh,

1625
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,243
smart.

1626
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,270
And they can jump over walls to forget 
it,

1627
01:17:19,271 --> 01:17:21,000
man.
Jump over walls like nothing.

1628
01:17:21,001 --> 01:17:23,790
Like six foot fence.
They bounced to the top of the fence.

1629
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,580
Then bounce over it like it's not even 
there.

1630
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,540
Don't give a fuck.
They're elegant.

1631
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,480
The way they move,
it's really kind of beautiful to watch.

1632
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:33,210
They look like just dogs.
Like I'll see them in the neighborhood.

1633
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,453
Oh Shit.
That's a coyote do like at first you're 

1634
01:17:35,641 --> 01:17:39,040
like excited someone's dog and then you 
just see them kind of skulking.

1635
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:40,300
They just.
Yeah.

1636
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,590
Like,
um,

1637
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,423
do you like looking at him?
But then I know what they're capable of 

1638
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:46,060
and you're like,
get the fuck out of here.

1639
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,110
They will eat your dog for sure.
Are a lot of dogs.

1640
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,750
I had a friend,
um,

1641
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:52,500
she had her dog and right in front of 
her shell,

1642
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,670
a little Maltese lived out in Westlake 
village in the broad daylight.

1643
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,503
She was just standing in the backyard 
with a little Maltese and a coyote just 

1644
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:02,880
came and snatched it up right in front 
of her and just bring it.

1645
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,560
Just went away with it.
And you're like,

1646
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,970
there's my,
there goes my dog.

1647
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,560
Broad daylight.
Wow.

1648
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:08,423
We've got two little shits.
I don't let them run around and the 

1649
01:18:09,721 --> 01:18:11,340
charge out.
Of course,

1650
01:18:11,341 --> 01:18:13,230
she was devastated.
She was traumatized.

1651
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:15,000
Love that dog.
You know,

1652
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,390
it's the Maltese is essentially a lap 
dog.

1653
01:18:18,391 --> 01:18:20,410
You're not training that thing to do my 
gel.

1654
01:18:20,411 --> 01:18:22,070
So other than sleep with you and love 
you.

1655
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:22,923
So.
So it's a member of the family and so 

1656
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,030
fucking coyote snatches it up.
It's crazy.

1657
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,290
It's hard out there for coyote though,
just to eat fat dogs slipping.

1658
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:37,560
Stupid County dog getting fed by these 
people.

1659
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,150
That's right.
But they won't fuck with Marshall.

1660
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:40,560
Right?
Like he's too big.

1661
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:41,893
He's too big.
Maybe two of them could try to take him 

1662
01:18:43,771 --> 01:18:44,604
now.
They might.

1663
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:45,653
Yeah.

1664
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,993
I mean,
if they felt like he wasn't going to do 

1665
01:18:48,261 --> 01:18:49,094
anything about it,
they felt like he was submissive or it 

1666
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:52,910
felt like they could just get a hold of 
him,

1667
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:53,983
know,
who knows.

1668
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,060
They have definitely killed dogs as big 
as him before

1669
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:59,110
or you know,
mount minds love them.

1670
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,510
They would love a dog that size for 
sure.

1671
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,120
It's a lot of food.
Yeah,

1672
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:08,580
we think I sense that submissiveness 
that I don't know.

1673
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,020
I think um,
you know,

1674
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:13,120
I used to have a much bigger dog,
but he died.

1675
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:14,460
He,
uh,

1676
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,260
he was a master.
He was 13 years old.

1677
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:17,123
We just,
we just put them asleep a few months 

1678
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,193
ago.
Sorry.

1679
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,033
It was bad at the end.
We probably should've done it earlier 

1680
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,273
because the end,
he literally couldn't walk into the 

1681
01:19:26,491 --> 01:19:29,490
house to eat,
like he was in the yard.

1682
01:19:29,491 --> 01:19:31,050
And when I tried to call them in for 
dinner,

1683
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,230
he,
he couldn't walk like it was awful.

1684
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,093
He would struggle to stand up and they 
would take like a half a step and pause 

1685
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:41,670
another half a step.
And paws and his legs were shaking.

1686
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,650
I mean he was,
is a beautiful dog,

1687
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,960
like,
like so sweet,

1688
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:49,823
like such a con,
like mastiffs are so kind that like so 

1689
01:19:51,931 --> 01:19:55,110
calm.
It was so hard watching him struggle,

1690
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:56,663
you know,
because he was like breathing heavy and 

1691
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,750
his mouth was open,
like hey,

1692
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,863
take a step.
And he'd be in agony and just he was 

1693
01:20:03,631 --> 01:20:08,100
just so old from massive.
13 is old.

1694
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:09,923
The bigger dogs,
they don't live as long as they live 

1695
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,720
like eight,
eight,

1696
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:14,700
nine years old.
For him to be 13,

1697
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:17,460
like the vet was pretty shocked.
Like wow,

1698
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:21,000
this dog is old from massive.
They're big.

1699
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,340
They're big.
Buy Burt's got one of those right?

1700
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,480
Yeah.
He's got one.

1701
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:28,290
Priscilla,
they guard vampires.

1702
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,680
Do that.
They protect you from vampires.

1703
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:35,220
Are they per guard for the vampires?
Rice books.

1704
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,400
They're always guarding family.
They guard the vampires while they sleep

1705
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,260
and then as.
That's right,

1706
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,910
those books were fucking good,
you know?

1707
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:44,900
And Rice went wacky and became a 
Christian at the end of the time.

1708
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,380
No,
I've heard this.

1709
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:47,214
I saw her on a flight once and then I 
googled her and she's writing a 

1710
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:55,100
Christian stuff and she also wrote a 
bunch of snm books under a pseudonym.

1711
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:56,683
Uh,
it's all about spanking a lot of 

1712
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:00,780
spanking.
It's very odd.

1713
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:01,290
Yes.

1714
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,500
Yes.
I had to read it.

1715
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:06,570
Let me ask you this.
What is it about women and Vampires?

1716
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:08,820
Oh sure.
What's that?

1717
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,320
I'll tell Ya.
It's the same.

1718
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:11,380
Uh,
well it's,

1719
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:15,240
it's controlling power and I think 
similar to 50 shades of gray,

1720
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:18,090
which I tried giving that to read too.
And I was like,

1721
01:21:18,091 --> 01:21:19,560
Nah,
that's kind of stupid.

1722
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,050
I'm too smart for that man.
I don't know.

1723
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,940
I,
I,

1724
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,360
I like dumb shit.
Believe me,

1725
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:27,510
you don't like shit that dumb though.
I tried,

1726
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:30,390
I really tried.
I tried to see what the deal is.

1727
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:33,030
I always try to see what,
why people are drawn to stuff.

1728
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,463
I think it's a power thing.
So the vampire comes and takes control 

1729
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:42,180
of you and you're totally submissive and
somewhere I think in the female,

1730
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:46,230
whatever DNA in our,
in our makeup,

1731
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:50,130
to have someone totally care for you and
give your power to them.

1732
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:50,963
I think is part of that I have freedom.
It's also a metaphor for sexual 

1733
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:54,684
liberation,
so maybe in a time when women couldn't 

1734
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:56,634
be sexually free,
the vampire is a metaphor for a loss of 

1735
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,560
control and sexual desire and stuff.
I don't know.

1736
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,880
That's my theory.
Same with the shades of gray.

1737
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:08,280
Mostly it was right,
like housewives,

1738
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:12,310
kind of a repressed,
repressed sexual thing because it wasn't

1739
01:22:12,311 --> 01:22:13,144
that risky.
I think it was like a billionaire guy 

1740
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:15,654
who liked to.
You'd like to spit in their mouth and 

1741
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:17,724
shit and I don't.
I just know she had a 500 orgasms the 

1742
01:22:23,011 --> 01:22:26,330
first time she ever had sex with.
Yeah,

1743
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,620
I know.
That is right.

1744
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,370
Go ahead.
Try it up,

1745
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,690
but I'll piss on me.
Be Me.

1746
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,010
Was that word,
the word that he said?

1747
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:37,760
Danielle man.
Yeah.

1748
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:42,300
Her Pen name wrote a book in 1985 called
exit to Eden.

1749
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:46,170
That was one of the sadomasochist books 
that was turned into a movie.

1750
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,050
Do you remember this movie starring Dan 
Akroyd?

1751
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,100
Dan Akroyd didn't do with Rosie 
O'donnell.

1752
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,070
That's right.
It was a comedy,

1753
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,500
right?
Was it supposed to be a comedy?

1754
01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,343
I mean,
it's,

1755
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:00,990
it's,
it was based off the story of,

1756
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:03,750
so I think Gary Marshal might've turned 
it into a comedy.

1757
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,070
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1758
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,423
That's hilarious.

1759
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,430
Bizarre.
She played a slow person.

1760
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,750
Yes.
Yes.

1761
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,200
Have you discussed this on?
No,

1762
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,034
I haven't,
but Sean Penn has also played a slow 

1763
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:22,360
person,
but no one has quite done at the way.

1764
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:23,194
Ben Stiller did.
Did you see the people were getting mad 

1765
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:25,924
because people.
Because some football player when a 

1766
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,650
simple Jack Shaun white snowboard.
That's right.

1767
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,700
Yeah,
but not just him.

1768
01:23:33,701 --> 01:23:34,534
There's a couple other people that went 
to simple jack for Halloween and they 

1769
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:39,670
were getting like,
you can't go a simple jacket anymore.

1770
01:23:39,671 --> 01:23:40,504
You can't be a simple person.
A simple character like dumb characters 

1771
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:47,920
are now out the window.
You can't be that anymore.

1772
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,980
What happened?
What's going on with us?

1773
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,140
Some weird new rules like popping up out
of nowhere.

1774
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:53,591
Like,
wait,

1775
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:54,424
what?
But it wasn't simple jack a parody of 

1776
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,260
the thing like it was.
It's a joke on a joke,

1777
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:01,660
Jack.
It's not that he's actually portraying a

1778
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:04,150
realistic portrayal of simple.

1779
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,070
Jack was a character.
Yeah.

1780
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,210
Yeah.
Even in the movie,

1781
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:10,900
Simple Jack was a character in a movie,
wasn't like an actual person,

1782
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,053
right?
Yeah.

1783
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:17,500
There it is.
Once upon a time there was a retard.

1784
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,860
Wow.
Is that what it says in the movie?

1785
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,390
Yeah.
It's a fake movie though,

1786
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:26,000
but wow.
I liked the scene.

1787
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,360
That's not that long ago,
and here's the thing.

1788
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,580
That movie also.
That's all from tropic thunder,

1789
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:34,480
that movies also the last time anyone's 
allowed to wear black face.

1790
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:36,400
That's it.
That's right.

1791
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,540
That's it.
It's over now.

1792
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,510
That's right.
Like Robert Downey Jr.

1793
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,090
Try to wear black face in tropic thunder
to imagine.

1794
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:48,030
JusT imagine back.
Oh boy.

1795
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,530
All the hurt feelings.
What happened?

1796
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:52,773
What happened?
They fused this enormous question of 

1797
01:24:56,201 --> 01:24:57,170
what happened.
Yeah.

1798
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,113
I'm hoping you have a fresh take on it.
I'll tell you want to know what I think 

1799
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:01,990
it is.
Really?

1800
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,823
Yes.

1801
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,300
I think since Donald Trump became the 
leader,

1802
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:12,220
and I think some people are so triggered
by daddy,

1803
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,473
daddy's a little narcissistic at times.
Daddy's not very socially conscious at 

1804
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:18,004
times and I think that's affected 
because if you say anything kind of 

1805
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:24,940
insensitive than it's in align with that
regime,

1806
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:26,020
maybe.
You know what I mean?

1807
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,410
Even though you're.
Maybe you don't.

1808
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:30,390
I don't identify with everything trump 
stands for.

1809
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:34,000
I like inappropriate humor.
It doesn't mean I aligned with him,

1810
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,893
but I think because he doesn't give any 
sensitivity to these groups that are 

1811
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,930
marginalized,
it makes the marginalized people upset.

1812
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,273
I also think that people realize that 
you can get people in trouble by 

1813
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:47,134
pointing out the factor insensitive and 
you can come down on them hard and when 

1814
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:53,320
you do,
they move.

1815
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:55,990
Things happen.
There's a reaction.

1816
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,150
Yeah,
this is happening.

1817
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,430
What's interesting is the impulse to 
destroy it started with shaming.

1818
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,980
Fire them,
take away their income.

1819
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:07,820
Take.
Yeah.

1820
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,560
Make them lose their house,
disappear.

1821
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,490
Louis ck banished away forever.
Right?

1822
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,520
I'm not ready for you to come back yet.
Redemption and how's.

1823
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,710
When is redemption allowed?
How soon has he repented enough?

1824
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:24,860
Do we feel like he's earned that?
There's all kinds of stuff.

1825
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:29,450
And then who was accused?
What are the grounds for accusation?

1826
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,300
What's enough?
What's enough evidence?

1827
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:34,460
Just somebody saying something good 
enough,

1828
01:26:34,461 --> 01:26:36,980
believe all women,
which I believe obviously.

1829
01:26:36,981 --> 01:26:37,670
I mean,
who the fuck,

1830
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,140
you know?
But then again,

1831
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:39,711
there are.
Yeah,

1832
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:43,410
there are people who are alive who do 
say for sure,

1833
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,340
but that believe all women thing.
Like what about casey?

1834
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:48,310
Anthony,
you know,

1835
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,660
what about tonya harding?
Believe her.

1836
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:51,680
NO.
Right.

1837
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,300
You saw the movie.
Did you see the movie funny?

1838
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:56,870
There's a lot of them you shouldn't 
believe.

1839
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

1840
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,660
other people.
yeah,

1841
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,240
exactly.

1842
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,540
Better liAr with a vagina.
That's outrageous.

1843
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:07,490
They have wires.
There's a whole separate breed.

1844
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:10,580
They're non gender specific.
That's right.

1845
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,570
Oh,
that's interesting.

1846
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:13,300
Binary.
They are not binary.

1847
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:15,830
The wires are just liars.
You know?

1848
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,000
It's like.
Yeah.

1849
01:27:17,001 --> 01:27:21,620
I mean it's not like murderers.
Murderers are predominantly male.

1850
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,860
This is true.
This is fucking true.

1851
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:28,210
What's up with that testosterone?
Yeah.

1852
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,393
A long history of killing people.
It's only been within the last couple 

1853
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:33,420
hundred years.
You get in trouble for it.

1854
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:35,750
Testosterone.
That's true actually.

1855
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,584
Yes,
that's true.

1856
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:38,540
He used to be not that big a deal.
We kill people.

1857
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,930
They killed each other.
People at duals.

1858
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,580
I mean,
there was a president of the dual,

1859
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:45,260
which one,
don't forget which one,

1860
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:47,600
jackson,
one of the presidents had a fucking dual

1861
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,580
while he was in the office.
That's pretty rad.

1862
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,753
Yeah,
but I think you guys killed because you 

1863
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,700
can physically you can.

1864
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,663
Like right now you could reach across 
the table and snapped my neck because 

1865
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:00,740
you're way bigger than me and way 
stronger than me.

1866
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,530
I could poison and kill each other too.
They killed each other.

1867
01:28:03,531 --> 01:28:04,364
When each other are the same size.
They kill people that are bigger than 

1868
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:09,490
them.
There's a lot of.

1869
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:14,180
It's a history of people killing people.
People getting in the way.

1870
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:17,070
There are problem throws there,
car starting,

1871
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:17,923
all sorts of shit.
They won't let you sleep and you're 

1872
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:20,481
like,
god it.

1873
01:28:20,481 --> 01:28:22,340
I want to just stab this motherfucker.
And that's.

1874
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:26,010
That's how men handle things or have 
handled associate paths,

1875
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:26,790
right?
Yes.

1876
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:29,810
This Was pathic ones.
Yes,

1877
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,410
but I think particularly when it's more 
common,

1878
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,473
like it becomes a cultural sort of 
artifact like murder and violence 

1879
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,183
becomes a part of life.
Like if you lived in ancient rome for 

1880
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:44,504
instance,
and you got to the colosseum and you 

1881
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:46,454
watch people get chopped up with swords 
and eaten by lions and most people were 

1882
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:51,163
a lot of murder taking place out in the 
streets and very few people got caught 

1883
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:55,184
for anything like what kind of meat you 
have to be like right there to catch 

1884
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:01,770
someone doing something to actually 
catch no fingerprints,

1885
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,010
no

1886
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,110
dna,
no understanding of anything.

1887
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:05,423
I mean,
who the fuck knows who killed 

1888
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:06,684
[inaudible] but.
And people were just getting away with 

1889
01:29:07,471 --> 01:29:08,800
it left and right.
I mean,

1890
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:11,760
well,
what does this.

1891
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:12,603
Was this Alexander Hamilton and aaron 
burr was the sitting vice president at 

1892
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,510
the time.
He fought the vice president.

1893
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,621
Aaron burr was.
Yeah.

1894
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:23,280
And Alexander Hamilton was the former 
secretary of the treasury,

1895
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:26,130
I believe at the time.
And there were political rivals.

1896
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,940
Well,
political rivals.

1897
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,500
They had a dual.
And who won one?

1898
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:33,380
Yeah.
And how did he win?

1899
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:35,530
MorTally wounded.
Shot him.

1900
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:36,393
Killed him.
yeah.

1901
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,730
Dad.
You like art artists,

1902
01:29:39,731 --> 01:29:43,930
renderings of whatever it looked like.
I don't know how crazy they would stand,

1903
01:29:43,931 --> 01:29:46,480
like 10 paces.
They would walk away from each other and

1904
01:29:46,481 --> 01:29:47,790
then shoot each other.
Yeah.

1905
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,260
That's betsy.
Does that seem like a fair thing?

1906
01:29:50,261 --> 01:29:51,910
It's just really who's quicker on the 
draw?

1907
01:29:51,911 --> 01:29:55,330
It's not really who's stronger or more 
like an elegant fighter.

1908
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:58,150
I don't know you,
you judge fights all the time.

1909
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,590
Well,
they wanted to kill each other.

1910
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:01,610
That's the thing.
It's like,

1911
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:03,590
so let's,
let's figure out a way where we can kill

1912
01:30:03,591 --> 01:30:07,460
each other or try to kill each other and
we make an agreement on how it works.

1913
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:10,490
It's really stupid.
Yeah,

1914
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:11,361
right.
Yeah.

1915
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:14,000
It's really stupid.
Like you shouldn't tell someone that you

1916
01:30:14,001 --> 01:30:16,040
want to kill.
The idea was to make it

1917
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:20,240
so that either guy had a fair chance.
It's fair killing.

1918
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:21,800
Right.

1919
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,470
Do you know that some states,
like particularly Washington state,

1920
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:28,940
I have a mutually agreed combat laws.
No.

1921
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,833
Yeah,
so like if you and jamie just decided 

1922
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,333
fuck each other up.
I think he might have to be grown girl 

1923
01:30:34,761 --> 01:30:37,970
or boy on boy.
But if jamie just said to me like,

1924
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,560
dude,
I'm tired of your bullshit.

1925
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,120
I want to fuck you up.
And I'm like,

1926
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:44,540
I don't want to fuck you up to.
And we just decided and agreed.

1927
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:48,080
Cops will stand by and let them beat the
shit out of each other.

1928
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,060
I kind of respect that.
Some,

1929
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,000
some old west type shit about that.

1930
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:52,873
Well,
I will say knowing what I know about 

1931
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:56,330
males,
it's kind of the way,

1932
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,110
at least growing up in the time I did.
That's how guys sorted shit out,

1933
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:01,040
right?
Yeah.

1934
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,163
Some guy was giving you some static.
You put him in his place and then the 

1935
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:05,600
beef is over,
right?

1936
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,520
Yeah.
But you don't want to have to do that.

1937
01:31:07,521 --> 01:31:08,354
The problem with that kind of shit is 
what if that guy can kick your ass and 

1938
01:31:10,311 --> 01:31:12,710
he's given you some static.
Like what are you going to let them beat

1939
01:31:12,711 --> 01:31:13,520
you up?
Now?

1940
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,900
It's true.
You know,

1941
01:31:14,901 --> 01:31:15,734
like you don't want to have to fight 
someone or even have to know how to 

1942
01:31:19,431 --> 01:31:20,264
fight or have to be in a position where 
you might get fucked up by a god just 

1943
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:28,520
because he likes to talk a lot like god 
damn shit.

1944
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,413
Talking me into some sort of a beef and 
he doesn't mind if he gets his brains 

1945
01:31:32,121 --> 01:31:35,630
punched in these already stupid stuff 
like that.

1946
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,990
Being a man's terrible.
What's better being a mentor being.

1947
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:40,503
Well,
I will say in terms of power being a 

1948
01:31:41,861 --> 01:31:42,730
dude.
Listen,

1949
01:31:42,731 --> 01:31:46,060
white guys rule everything.
It's going to be that way for a minute.

1950
01:31:46,061 --> 01:31:49,000
Longer until these fucking old supreme 
court guys kick it.

1951
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,863
You know what I mean?
Do you think that's gonna change 

1952
01:31:51,611 --> 01:31:52,690
everything.
Well,

1953
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,553
here's I think,
I think whoever controls the money and 

1954
01:31:57,071 --> 01:32:00,740
the power for government and then you 
get the power.

1955
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,650
Yes,
it's actually true,

1956
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:05,080
right?
That's real power.

1957
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,943
You know what I'm saying?
Who controls industry and who controls 

1958
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:11,170
the government.
So until that changes,

1959
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:12,383
do you think those supreme court guys 
and gals get together and go to one of 

1960
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:17,530
the eyes wide shut party?
Yes.

1961
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,390
Yes.
Yes.

1962
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,710
What is that?
The bohemian grove illuminati.

1963
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:25,410
The bilderberg group?
Yeah.

1964
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,370
I started to watch a documentary on the 
free masons on netflix.

1965
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:31,323
Most boring fucking thing I ever saw.
I had to tap out after five minutes 

1966
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,163
because it's like a legit organization 
where a bunch of nerds get together and 

1967
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,920
like,
yeah,

1968
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:39,754
it's not even exciting.
Freemason in houston was telling me all 

1969
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:44,390
about her fall asleep.
Yeah.

1970
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:50,690
We had a handshake and you're like,
secret pyramid inside of that parent was

1971
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,670
not.
I remember the eye of horus.

1972
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:58,120
Where's the witchcraft?
Let's get weird man.

1973
01:32:58,720 --> 01:32:59,553
But you know about that egg,
the public execution stuff you were 

1974
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:04,580
talking about earlier.
Uh,

1975
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,270
there's that book by fuko,
you know,

1976
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:08,104
that old french philosopher,
he talked about the scaffold scenes and 

1977
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:14,080
whether or not they worked as deterrent 
for people committing crimes.

1978
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:18,670
So now we don't have public execution,
but we do shit behind closed doors,

1979
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:20,020
right?
We don't hang somebody,

1980
01:33:20,021 --> 01:33:25,021
but we quietly give somebody a lethal 
injection and it's all very civilized.

1981
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:26,350
Right?
To kill somebody.

1982
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:30,250
But I wonder which worked better is the 
public deterrent thing of like,

1983
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,084
hey dude,
you steal some shit because look at 

1984
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:33,850
Saudi Arabia,
they,

1985
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:35,800
they'll cut your fucking hand off.
Right?

1986
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:37,420
If you,
uh,

1987
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,550
you know,
steel.

1988
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,460
Yeah.
I don't know.

1989
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,360
I wonder if the public versus the 
private punishment,

1990
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:48,361
if that ever really works on weirdos,
who would it stop men from murdering?

1991
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:52,123
I mean,
I think people that do it get caught up 

1992
01:33:55,451 --> 01:33:57,130
and when they would call crimes of 
passion.

1993
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,120
Right?
I don't like that.

1994
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,163
Like theY get caught up in this moment 
and they just can't help themselves and 

1995
01:34:02,741 --> 01:34:05,440
they want to kill someone more than they
want to be free.

1996
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:10,390
I just want to kill this motherfucker 
the deal without law shit later.

1997
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,690
Right now I've got a rock and that 
dude's got ahead.

1998
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:16,150
Need to connect this rock to that guy's 
fucking hood.

1999
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:20,380
What's this last public hanging and 
Kentucky in 1936.

2000
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:23,380
She's like,
how many people showed up?

2001
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,610
That's the.
See humans like that stuff.

2002
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,110
We love to see it.
They love it.

2003
01:34:29,111 --> 01:34:31,060
Look at those guys climbing up on trees 
and shit.

2004
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,930
We can see one too.
Is this is in France in 1939.

2005
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:40,253
It's a guillotine on this and you know 
what the guillotine that it wasn't a 

2006
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:48,940
clean cut the first time and they'd have
to do it a few times.

2007
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,863
Oh really?
Huh?

2008
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:53,230
Not always a good bad that you always 
hoped for.

2009
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:54,070
A sharp blade.

2010
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,220
Yeah.
That's the last

2011
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:01,170
public execution in France.
Yeah,

2012
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,660
that's what it says.
What year was that?

2013
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:04,570
Nineteen 39.
Whoa.

2014
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,950
Recent.
Thirty nine.

2015
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:07,903
Whoa.
Is there video of this as he was a 

2016
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,330
german criminal?
I don't say shit.

2017
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,760
Cut his hand off.
Wow,

2018
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:14,594
that's crazy.
Just have the box standing there to 

2019
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,260
people's ago.
Joe was.

2020
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:20,983
Yeah.
The United States was founded three 

2021
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,860
people's ago.
That's true.

2022
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:25,993
That's crazy.
That's what's hard to really understand 

2023
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:33,050
how much cultural evolution is taking 
place just during our lifetime.

2024
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:35,970
It's hard to imagine.
it's hard to imagine what.

2025
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,880
What year were you born?
70 sIx.

2026
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:39,913
Could you imagine if you had a time 
machine and you can go back to 1976 and 

2027
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,240
just wander around the streets and see 
what people were like,

2028
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:47,263
oh my god,
you guys are children who don't know 

2029
01:35:48,531 --> 01:35:49,790
shit.
You have no internet.

2030
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:51,470
You barely read.
I know.

2031
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,680
What do you do?
I'm sorry.

2032
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,180
What's that?
There's a video of the video,

2033
01:35:56,181 --> 01:36:00,110
but let's say it didn't.
All these people gather around,

2034
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:04,090
gather around fixing to drop the hammer.
Oh,

2035
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:06,080
here it is.
Oh,

2036
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:08,030
they get them in there.
Get in there,

2037
01:36:08,031 --> 01:36:08,864
bitch.

2038
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:14,530
The gentleman ready and.
oh,

2039
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,790
and one take a job.
We'll do that again.

2040
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:19,070
Show that again.
Right.

2041
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:27,430
Get him in there.
And that is a crazy way to kill someone.

2042
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,190
Yes.
Leave it to the french.

2043
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,300
Well,
it's efficient.

2044
01:36:31,301 --> 01:36:33,430
I think that's why teen.
Yeah.

2045
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,413
Yeah.
This is what we do to make you wanna do 

2046
01:36:37,451 --> 01:36:41,180
is with our hands with the machine.
Yeah.

2047
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:41,951
Wow.
Well,

2048
01:36:41,951 --> 01:36:43,570
back to your statement,
I,

2049
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:44,453
I often find myself because I'm 42 years
old and I do find myself being like the 

2050
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:49,684
world has changed completely sInce I was
a kid growing up in the eighties in the 

2051
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,940
nineties,
especially in the last decade.

2052
01:36:54,941 --> 01:36:55,774
Even just from the time I started doing 
standup and the audiences and how you 

2053
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:02,350
have to adjust kind of how you're doing 
comedy to how it's received.

2054
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:05,140
Yeah,
I mean just even

2055
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:07,250
this thing.
Phones.

2056
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:08,830
Because this has bananas.
Yeah.

2057
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:11,870
I have a computeR right here and I can 
watch movies.

2058
01:37:11,871 --> 01:37:15,500
I can google anything I want.
I can find my way home.

2059
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,080
I remember we had to like remember how 
to get home.

2060
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,840
How about when it tells you you're 20 
minutes from her?

2061
01:37:20,841 --> 01:37:21,411
I'm like,
bitch,

2062
01:37:21,411 --> 01:37:22,720
You don't know where I live.
Yeah.

2063
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:25,640
How do you know's going there?
Tells you where you stop every night.

2064
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,290
That aIn't my home.
That's my side piece.

2065
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:32,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2066
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:34,070
Like what if your husband looked through
it?

2067
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:34,904
Hey,
why does it say you're only 15 minutes 

2068
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:36,644
from home?
We live in half an hour from here 

2069
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:41,270
because that says siDe dick,
dick.

2070
01:37:41,271 --> 01:37:43,400
Fifteen minutes away.
I mean cheating.

2071
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:45,560
Now you've got to be.
You've got to have a burner,

2072
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:47,040
right?
I mean,

2073
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,440
because your wife could just fucking.

2074
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:51,570
I think if you're cheating today,
you're just.

2075
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:56,130
You're a reckless,
reckless individual phone.

2076
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,400
Yeah.
If you're using your phone and cheating.

2077
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,220
Reckless person.
Crazy talk.

2078
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:05,280
Reckless person.
Yeah.

2079
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:05,990
But if you've got it,

2080
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:07,220
burner phone.
People are like,

2081
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:09,310
what's up with that kmart phone.
Oh,

2082
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:13,430
your wife's going to find that as you 
get that fucking cvs flip phone you got.

2083
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:14,960
Oh,
and by the way,

2084
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:18,890
I heard you guys talking about me not 
being right or die with sigora.

2085
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,581
Yeah.
Well,

2086
01:38:19,581 --> 01:38:22,160
you're going to turn them in a 
tournament in a hot second.

2087
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,780
Crime of passion.
Yeah.

2088
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:25,081
No,
no,

2089
01:38:25,081 --> 01:38:25,940
no.
Here's my problem.

2090
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,310
I,
I would,

2091
01:38:27,311 --> 01:38:28,144
uh,
I'd be ride or die when it came to 

2092
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,780
premeditated under the condition of 
somebody's threatening my family,

2093
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:36,860
but let's say he goes to starbucks and 
the barista gets his order wrong,

2094
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:41,720
which is the scenario we discussed.
And then he snaps and kIlls the barista.

2095
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,060
That's the shit I'm talking about where 
I'm like,

2096
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,050
oh,
this person's crazy.

2097
01:38:45,051 --> 01:38:46,910
Like you've turned a corner mentally.

2098
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,150
Well,
how bad the guy fuck up the order.

2099
01:38:52,030 --> 01:38:52,863
Good point.
Yeah.

2100
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:53,621
I mean,
what have you said?

2101
01:38:53,621 --> 01:38:56,400
Sugar free and it clearly a sugar on it,
right?

2102
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,503
Right.
Or nonfat gives you a whole fat half 

2103
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,263
cap.
How much anxiety do you get when you go 

2104
01:39:02,641 --> 01:39:05,970
to starbucks and the barista makes 
someone else's ordered before yours,

2105
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:07,470
that ordered after.
You know what I mean?

2106
01:39:07,471 --> 01:39:10,260
Like they call that person's name.
I get so fucking angry.

2107
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:10,580
Drink

2108
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,110
coffee.
Yeah.

2109
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,260
Oh,
just drip.

2110
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,010
Yeah.
Give me a grand a coffee please.

2111
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,000
You know,
roast the dark one wherever.

2112
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,410
Just give me a fucking coffee.
That's all I get.

2113
01:39:21,411 --> 01:39:23,780
I get a cup of coffee,
I put some cream in it and I'm good.

2114
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:27,170
You don't do pumpkin spice fuck with.
Wow.

2115
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:29,950
Yeah.
but yeah,

2116
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,063
my wife Does drink vanilla lattes that 
are sugar free with heavy cream heavy 

2117
01:39:36,171 --> 01:39:38,360
cream instead of milk.
That's interesting.

2118
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:40,250
Pretty god damn good.
And there's sugar free.

2119
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:42,140
Oh,
that's your god damn good.

2120
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:44,330
Those are good,
but they're not coffee.

2121
01:39:44,331 --> 01:39:46,040
It's like a drink.
You're drinking a drink.

2122
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:47,350
It's like a milkshake.
Yes.

2123
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:50,030
Yeah,
a lot of calories.

2124
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,200
It's good.
Before you work out.

2125
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:53,660
We drank one of those.
I drank one of those this morning before

2126
01:39:53,661 --> 01:39:56,300
you at the hit the hills.
She on the same day at your.

2127
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:58,970
She's a,
she was on keto for awhile,

2128
01:39:59,050 --> 01:39:59,883
but now she's,
she got off of that but she might get 

2129
01:40:01,431 --> 01:40:02,264
back on it again.

2130
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,030
We uh,
we were here last night.

2131
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:07,070
I went running today and I was hobbling 
because,

2132
01:40:07,071 --> 01:40:07,904
uh,
we were drunk bench pressing last night 

2133
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:15,210
and while drunk benchpressing pulled a 
muscle in my leg of course was like,

2134
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:18,613
they had like,
how many times do you think you can 

2135
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,073
press to 25?
I'm like a lot to give me that you 

2136
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:26,600
pussies like we were so drunk,
so drunk and I,

2137
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,483
I bench pressed 225 pounds,
like 11 times and on the 11th time I've 

2138
01:40:31,081 --> 01:40:35,960
felt something on my leg,
but I ignored it seemed fine.

2139
01:40:35,961 --> 01:40:37,280
I was walking arounD,
everything is fine,

2140
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:40,850
but then running today was not fun.
As soon as I was running,

2141
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,010
as soon as I got on the hills and then I
was pushing it,

2142
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:43,971
I was like,
oh,

2143
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:44,804
I fucked something up in my leg.
Drunk benchpressing crazier back to 

2144
01:40:50,091 --> 01:40:51,470
exercising already.
Oh,

2145
01:40:51,471 --> 01:40:53,210
I was exercising two days afterwards.

2146
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,910
Yeah,
but not as much.

2147
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,140
I mean,
I ran the hills today.

2148
01:40:56,141 --> 01:40:57,880
That was kind of hard,
but now I'm fucked.

2149
01:40:57,910 --> 01:41:00,430
I really am limping.
I got to figure out what this is.

2150
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:02,040
Well,
plus on hills,

2151
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:04,440
it's uneven terrain and there's rocks 
and shit.

2152
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:05,274
Right.
That can't be good for your knees and 

2153
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:08,190
no,
that's not a problem

2154
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,390
for my needs were.
They were sore for.

2155
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:13,090
My knees were a little sore.
My feet were sore.

2156
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:16,180
My ankles are sore because it was a lot 
of pounding.

2157
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,950
A lot of running.
Yes,

2158
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:18,940
and uh,
that's,

2159
01:41:18,941 --> 01:41:20,410
I take my dog.
That's his,

2160
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,900
that's how he stays chill.
That's right.

2161
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,060
If he,
if he runs with me a couple miles a day,

2162
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:27,160
he's so chill.
He's just relaxed.

2163
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,300
If he doesn't,
he's like,

2164
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:28,610
what

2165
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:29,443
are we doing man?
We can't just sit around the fucking 

2166
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:31,903
house and go do something.
So cesar millan says you got to tire 

2167
01:41:34,591 --> 01:41:35,424
them out,
call them sub museum energies when they 

2168
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:38,690
order,
says calm,

2169
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:39,524
submissive energy.
And if they work out then they're chill 

2170
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:42,580
and you can tell them what to do.
Yeah,

2171
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:45,350
no,
that's definitely true for especially.

2172
01:41:45,351 --> 01:41:48,470
He's my dogs pretty young.
He's only a,

2173
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,940
he'll turn to next month.
So he's,

2174
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:54,230
he's basically a pup still super sweet.
Yeah,

2175
01:41:54,231 --> 01:41:56,360
he's a gorgeous dog.
He's a sweetie.

2176
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:59,990
He's the sweetest of sweeties is a 
really good dog.

2177
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:01,363
You know,
I was uh,

2178
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,650
I was listening to ari talk some shit on
the uh,

2179
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:07,250
your wrap up show whatever from sober 
october.

2180
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:11,030
So funny when he's like,
well these two are obese,

2181
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:14,460
like just eat normal,
which is so true.

2182
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,480
Needs what is fucking red z on the 
keyboard?

2183
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,420
No,
he's normal.

2184
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:20,610
He was fat at one point in time.
No.

2185
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,960
Yeah,
he had a sugar problem.

2186
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:23,063
He was eatIng candy like all the time 
and then he realized he had a candy 

2187
01:42:25,861 --> 01:42:27,600
problem.
Ours is very smart.

2188
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:28,643
He recognizes he has problems and fixes 
them and that's something that a fat 

2189
01:42:32,791 --> 01:42:33,624
burt doesn't do.

2190
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,140
That's why already better than all.
Right.

2191
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:39,930
He did change his life.
I mean,

2192
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,823
like I,
we kind of started at the same time in 

2193
01:42:42,241 --> 01:42:43,470
comedy.
I didn't really know him,

2194
01:42:43,471 --> 01:42:46,080
know him until much later.
But yeah,

2195
01:42:46,081 --> 01:42:46,914
I remember him being kind of a fuck up 
and then he like turned to shit around 

2196
01:42:49,351 --> 01:42:52,080
and it's amazing.
Well,

2197
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,510
he um,
um,

2198
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,520
he,
he did a lot of different things.

2199
01:42:55,530 --> 01:42:56,900
Sorry.
No disrespect,

2200
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:58,790
no successful now.
So he's,

2201
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:04,330
he's also doing it his way,
like lou really truly doing it his way.

2202
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:09,170
Like he doesn't,
he's got no one tells him what to do and

2203
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,033
then he's going to keep it that way.
He doesn't have any expensive taste at 

2204
01:43:12,621 --> 01:43:14,750
all.
You wear normal clothes.

2205
01:43:14,751 --> 01:43:17,360
He doesn't even own a fucking watch,
you know,

2206
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,351
you know,
he's like,

2207
01:43:18,351 --> 01:43:18,821
whoa,
whoa,

2208
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:20,600
whoa,
chill time.

2209
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:22,770
It's on my phone.
Sorry,

2210
01:43:22,990 --> 01:43:23,823
what was the last time you're somewhere 
where you couldn't find the time on his 

2211
01:43:25,851 --> 01:43:26,684
flip phone?
Yeah.

2212
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,030
Doesn't even have like a nice phone.
He doesn't want one because if you,

2213
01:43:30,031 --> 01:43:32,360
as you realized as he gets addicted to 
social media,

2214
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:36,410
it gets addicted to like googling things
and tweeting and all that shit.

2215
01:43:36,411 --> 01:43:37,880
Just,
you just can't do it.

2216
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,320
He can't handle it.
yeah.

2217
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:43,520
You said I get it,
but you just have to have discipline.

2218
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:44,420
I agree.
Yeah.

2219
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:45,650
For me,
I can,

2220
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,170
you know,
I don't have a problem not looking at my

2221
01:43:48,171 --> 01:43:51,830
phone for hours at a time.
I think you got to just that.

2222
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:52,040
That's

2223
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
how you live.
You don't just live checking your phone 

2224
01:43:55,221 --> 01:43:56,050
constantly

2225
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,883
because it's so.
You and I grew up in a time where we 

2226
01:43:58,241 --> 01:43:59,074
didn't compulsively check our phones and
now I've had to learn to give a shit 

2227
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,770
about it.
Like the email came in.

2228
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,290
Woo.
What?

2229
01:44:06,370 --> 01:44:08,880
Imagine our children who are.
This is just an.

2230
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:09,843
I was listening to you talk to elon musk
about how this is like an extension 

2231
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:16,720
technology will just grow into a human 
being.

2232
01:44:16,721 --> 01:44:17,190
Right?

2233
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,330
Well,
my daughter's friends,

2234
01:44:18,331 --> 01:44:19,164
my 10 year old daughter's friend,
are all of them have phones except for 

2235
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,780
two or three of them?
10.

2236
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:27,090
Yeah.
What are they doing at 10?

2237
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:29,090
Is it social media is one girl.
My mom,

2238
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,900
my wife always jokes.
She goes,

2239
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:32,820
when you see her,
she'll have a phone in her hand.

2240
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:36,090
She always has a phone in her hand.
She never puts that fucking phone down.

2241
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,290
She stares at that phone while she's 
talking to her friend.

2242
01:44:38,291 --> 01:44:39,150
She's playing with things.
She was,

2243
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:41,340
this is why I don't want our kids to 
have phones.

2244
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:44,010
And then we'd meet her at starbucks.
She's looking at her phone.

2245
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:44,640
Oh,
hi.

2246
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,230
It's like a scene in a movie.
She's like,

2247
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,490
hi,
how are you?

2248
01:44:47,491 --> 01:44:48,324
I was just looking at her phone,
checking things like the texting each 

2249
01:44:50,431 --> 01:44:52,450
other back and forth.
Constantly intent.

2250
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,503
They manipulate and each other like one 
of them will say something to get the 

2251
01:44:55,861 --> 01:44:57,930
other ones go and then she'll go radio 
silent on her

2252
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:01,440
all.
You can learn how to do that at 10.

2253
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:03,550
Oh girls,
they're fucking with each other at 10.

2254
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,190
That's normal though.
That girl,

2255
01:45:05,191 --> 01:45:07,500
evil shit.
You learned to you do that stuff early,

2256
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:08,334
but with this it's even more insidious.
You can have a group of three girls 

2257
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,860
because one's going to be out all the 
time.

2258
01:45:13,861 --> 01:45:15,050
It's just what girls do.
It's even.

2259
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,830
Why is that?
Why girls do that?

2260
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:22,010
Well,
what's the evolutionary biology solution

2261
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:24,300
like?
What is the cause?

2262
01:45:24,301 --> 01:45:27,540
The root right one is your ally.
One is Your enemy.

2263
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,490
Well,
no,

2264
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,393
you're going to fuck her husband because
you want that new dick and you want 

2265
01:45:32,491 --> 01:45:35,820
those for the eggs.
Fuck that other.

2266
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,520
My frIend's husband.
No,

2267
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:38,940
no,
I think it's a threat.

2268
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,440
The other bitches are a threat,
right?

2269
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:42,270
Yeah.
Other bitches are threat,

2270
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,000
but there are a threat because they want
to fuck your husband.

2271
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,013
Yeah,
yeah.

2272
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,033
Yeah.
So you got to like figure out a way to 

2273
01:45:47,551 --> 01:45:51,450
manipulate them.
Keep those hoes and check.

2274
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:54,000
That's right.
Make them make them fuck up.

2275
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:55,960
So you keep one click,
one hold close to you.

2276
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:59,020
Trust each other bitches out.
Right?

2277
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:01,830
I'm talking.
YEah,

2278
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,730
psychology is fascinating.
But with men too,

2279
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,530
you know,
there's guys that will fuck your wife.

2280
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:10,410
You know guys that will move on them.
Say yeah,

2281
01:46:10,411 --> 01:46:12,350
you know,
look,

2282
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,870
I don't want to be that guy,
but you deserve better than tom.

2283
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:19,620
Just bad god friends.
I've had friends in the past.

2284
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:21,210
Do that lady.
Yeah.

2285
01:46:21,211 --> 01:46:22,070
Yeah.
And then I,

2286
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:25,980
I did go straight to me and tell me,
go to the guy.

2287
01:46:25,981 --> 01:46:27,240
I go,
I guess we're not friends.

2288
01:46:27,241 --> 01:46:28,920
Huh?
I thought we were friends.

2289
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:32,520
You fucking weasel dude.
Listen,

2290
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,710
i'M friends with her too far.

2291
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,080
you.

2292
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:43,700
There's certain guys that are like that.
There's certain guys that just work.

2293
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:48,700
I had a friend when I was growing up who
always wanted to fuck the girlfriends of

2294
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,570
other,
and then if those guys broke up with the

2295
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:52,770
girl,
he would immediately fuck them.

2296
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,491
I'm like,
dude,

2297
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:54,720
he's your friend.
You know,

2298
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:56,820
she's fucking,
she's free.

2299
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,980
She's free.
No free market.

2300
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,420
What else?
Color those hyenas.

2301
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:04,530
Are they prey on the carcass?
What anImal preys on the carcass?

2302
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:06,720
Injures scavenger.
They're waiting.

2303
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:07,703
They're just waiting for that breakup.
That guy is always around and he's the 

2304
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:11,094
guy you're friends with for awhile,
for like a few years and he acts cool 

2305
01:47:14,581 --> 01:47:17,160
and then the minute you break up,
moves in.

2306
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:17,671
Yeah,
dude,

2307
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:18,504
he's the shoulder you cry on.
it took me a few years to learn that 

2308
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:21,110
guy.
Yeah.

2309
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:22,980
Oh shit.
You're not my friend.

2310
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:24,870
How about the ones that are supposed to 
be your friend?

2311
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:25,590
That's.
Yeah,

2312
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:27,240
and they're playing like they're your 
friend,

2313
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:30,060
but really they just wait for a moment 
to slip it in.

2314
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:30,631
Yeah,
yeah,

2315
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:31,464
yeah.
It's gonna be a time which is 

2316
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:32,993
vulnerable.
yeah.

2317
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:34,050
Yeah,
it's gonna be a.

2318
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:37,650
I always saw it shows if there's a guy 
and a girl together and I'm like,

2319
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,110
oh,
are you?

2320
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:39,090
Are you on a date?
No,

2321
01:47:39,091 --> 01:47:40,140
he's just my friend.
I'm like,

2322
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:40,490
oh

2323
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:43,000
bitch,
fuck you does.

2324
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:45,970
But some girls know it and they just 
keep that guy around because it'll drive

2325
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:49,690
them to the mall and he'll fucking take 
them to dinner and we just went out with

2326
01:47:49,691 --> 01:47:51,010
mike.
He's a sweetie.

2327
01:47:51,310 --> 01:47:52,143
Mom.
Mike has just beaten off his finger up 

2328
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:58,801
his ass thinking about you and for my.
Well thIs finger in his ass.

2329
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:01,540
Yeah.
I just fucking went in.

2330
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,800
Two of them are grabbing the ball,
like a bowling ball.

2331
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:10,270
One's neat.
He's angry when he's come.

2332
01:48:10,271 --> 01:48:15,271
Much shit.
Fuck men are so nasty.

2333
01:48:16,161 --> 01:48:20,030
Yellow is so damn nasty,
angry that's not working out and shit.

2334
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:23,430
And then she texts him after he comes,
just looking at it as like,

2335
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,590
no,
we're not friends,

2336
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:28,210
not friends.
It's terrible.

2337
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:30,170
I can't wait to shut it down though,
you know,

2338
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,920
shut it down.
I can't wait to hit menopause.

2339
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:33,763
Just show how much work it is.
Like especially when you hit your 

2340
01:48:36,981 --> 01:48:38,000
forties.
I do pull out.

2341
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:38,834
He's twice a week.
I got to eat the fucking prime on the 

2342
01:48:41,271 --> 01:48:43,400
primal type.
I don't need anything.

2343
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:45,850
I'm a blueprint diet.
Yeah.

2344
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:50,450
He's a sponsor of this show has been on 
the podcast for a couple of times.

2345
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,760
Yes.
I guy,

2346
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:52,963
I tried to,
I was trying to have like baby brands 

2347
01:48:55,011 --> 01:48:57,450
trying to listen to the vegan doctor 
versus the.

2348
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,810
That's a good one.
ThIs crusher.

2349
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:00,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

2350
01:49:00,831 --> 01:49:01,664
I just,
I had to listen in pieces because it's 

2351
01:49:02,391 --> 01:49:03,290
pretty intricate,
you know?

2352
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:04,970
It's very intense.
Yeah.

2353
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,180
Yeah.
But like my hand anyway,

2354
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,610
the point being I can't waIt to shut it 
the fuck down and just.

2355
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:12,980
Yeah.
And just were like,

2356
01:49:12,981 --> 01:49:15,080
cool.
Lots and birkenstocks.

2357
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:17,150
Are you going to wear crocs ever?
Fuck am.

2358
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:20,000
Want to wear crocs with socks or no 
socks?

2359
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,373
Socks,
because my feet get real sweaty now and 

2360
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:26,620
I'm going to get real short haircut 
should just above the ears.

2361
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,100
The nanette?
Yes.

2362
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:37,800
Ashley rose.

2363
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:38,701
Amber rose.
Oh,

2364
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:39,930
she's so pretty though.
Oh,

2365
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:41,820

Amber rose is the hot one.

2366
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:44,190
But then the other one.

2367
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,203
I don't know that one.
She's the one who played the hitman and 

2368
01:49:46,861 --> 01:49:50,460
the john wick movie.
John wick.

2369
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,130
Those movies alive,
man.

2370
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:54,520
I love john wayne movies.
No man's dog.

2371
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:57,880
Can't kill a man's dog.
It's going to kill everybody.

2372
01:49:57,881 --> 01:49:59,700
You know?
I respect you.

2373
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:02,200
A lIttle puppy.
Beat it to death.

2374
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:04,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2375
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:05,950
She's gorgeous.
Yeah,

2376
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,320
she.
She had the same acting teacher.

2377
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:09,653
I've seen her acting teacher.
I have a coach that I go to before I 

2378
01:50:12,461 --> 01:50:13,750
auditioned.
Oh,

2379
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:16,750
that's a good move.
I'm not great,

2380
01:50:16,780 --> 01:50:19,710
but at this point,
like with the terrible.

2381
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:23,710
What's he talking about?
I'm not good at acting here.

2382
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:24,910
Fantastic.
Hello.

2383
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:27,070
What have you ever seen me active news 
radio.

2384
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:28,420
That shit's easy.

2385
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,220
Sitcom.
Want to do,

2386
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,980
but that's all I want.
So very easy.

2387
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:34,360
Just tell me.
Give me the tutorial on sitcom acting.

2388
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:38,680
You just do it.
Just pretend you that person.

2389
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:41,470
The end.
Wait a minute.

2390
01:50:41,471 --> 01:50:42,304
There's no method.
You don't have to run in character for 

2391
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,580
memorize what you're supposed to say.
Pretend to be that person.

2392
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:50,403
Do it a bunch of times so you know how 
to do it the right way and then go in 

2393
01:50:53,051 --> 01:50:56,050
and don't be nervous.
That's the thing is not not choking.

2394
01:50:56,620 --> 01:50:57,453
That's a big part of it.
A big part of auditions is ready go and 

2395
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:03,490
you got to be normal.
You got to be normal in that.

2396
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:06,850
Especially if it's like a calm scene or 
weird scene or a love scene or something

2397
01:51:06,851 --> 01:51:07,684
like that.
So always these asshole staring at you 

2398
01:51:09,341 --> 01:51:10,174
with fucking notepads and stacks of 
other people's bios and head shots and 

2399
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:15,130
they don't know.

2400
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:17,050
The whole thing is bizarre.
The worst.

2401
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:17,973
It's so different than actual acting too
because it's like you're doing it in 

2402
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:23,710
this weird environment.
There's a conference table.

2403
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,753
The person is reading with you as 
probably like I did one and it was the 

2404
01:51:28,241 --> 01:51:29,074
person who read with me was so 
insultingly bad at it that I was really 

2405
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:35,800
frustrated.
I was like some a pa and he was like,

2406
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:41,040
I just don't know if this is what was 
supposed to happen with us.

2407
01:51:42,351 --> 01:51:43,240
And I was like,
c'mon man,

2408
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:46,810
if you're going to fucking just say the 
word so I can respond to this.

2409
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:48,730
I can't skate.
What the fuck is wrong?

2410
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:50,740
This is what I want to say.
If you were talking to me like that,

2411
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:52,270
I'd be like,
what is wrong with you?

2412
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,880
Why can't you talk?
Are you on drugs?

2413
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:56,453
You get hit in the head.
It's a coconut fall out of a tree and 

2414
01:51:58,931 --> 01:51:59,764
almost kill you.

2415
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,210
See,
this is why you're so successful.

2416
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:06,550
This is why.
Well,

2417
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:09,580
because in a world of bullshit,
you know what I mean?

2418
01:52:09,581 --> 01:52:12,430
You gotta keep it 100.
I don't think the world is.

2419
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:14,080
I don't think there's a world of 
bullshit.

2420
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:18,810
I think there's a lot of bullshit,
but I think there's more reality today I

2421
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:20,890
think we've ever experienced ever 
before,

2422
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,110
but what there is is a bunch of people 
that are scared.

2423
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:24,783
That's what it is.
They're scared of getting called out or 

2424
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:29,350
they're scared of getting fired.
Fired.

2425
01:52:29,351 --> 01:52:31,810
One's a big one.
They'll take away your income.

2426
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:32,653
Shit.
Now I got to find another job after I 

2427
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,520
talked about blackface.
Megan,

2428
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,910
megan over and she was loving it where 
she was at fox she worked at before.

2429
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,120
She could say all kinds of crazy shit.
They don't care about blackface

2430
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:47,230
at fox was like,
yeah,

2431
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:49,700
why can't you give her a raise for that 
one?

2432
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:50,853
You should be able to.
You should be able to have a bone in 

2433
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:53,204
your nose.

2434
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:59,210
And then she goes over to,
was it nbc?

2435
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:01,610
Why would you go there?
You know that's not for you,

2436
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:02,483
dude.
Apparently they did not like her from 

2437
01:53:03,581 --> 01:53:04,414
the jump.
The inside word is that she was not a 

2438
01:53:06,491 --> 01:53:09,100
nice person.
They did not like her to be around.

2439
01:53:09,101 --> 01:53:10,540
They were looking for reasons to get rid
of her.

2440
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,040
That's the word.
That's the inside word,

2441
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,093
but don't you hate that?
When you hear that someone's not nice 

2442
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,070
and they're making millions of dollars,

2443
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:19,350
that's true,
but who's saying she's not nice?

2444
01:53:19,351 --> 01:53:20,184
How about someone who's annoying to her?
Maybe she's not nice because you're 

2445
01:53:22,411 --> 01:53:24,630
annoying.
She's out there trying to educate people

2446
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:27,430
about blackface.
You motherfuckers try to share again,

2447
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:31,910
people,
black person.

2448
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:34,710
It's just color.
What's the big deal that.

2449
01:53:34,711 --> 01:53:37,130
Didn't she say that santa claus isn't 
black too?

2450
01:53:37,650 --> 01:53:38,483
Awesome.
Yeah.

2451
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:42,270
That was a part of the extended Megan 
Kelly bit that I edit down.

2452
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:44,423
Oh,
I had a guy in the office who was 

2453
01:53:45,511 --> 01:53:46,201
working with her.
I was like,

2454
01:53:46,201 --> 01:53:49,230
have you worked with kelly after about a
year?

2455
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,393
You're not doing any work all day long.
All you're thinking of is someone gets 

2456
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:55,380
the fucker.
Why can't it be me?

2457
01:53:55,710 --> 01:53:59,520
Like if you're in the cubicle right 
there and you run into your time,

2458
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,950
your time,
your trips to the coffee machine.

2459
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:03,240
When you see her walking.
Not yet.

2460
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,133
Not yet.
Go.

2461
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:06,900
Megan,
just want to let you know.

2462
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,850
Santa claus,
definitely white.

2463
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:10,503
Like you'd say,
things like you more kind of how 

2464
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,390
horrible this.
A lot of guys,

2465
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,220
a lot of guys working in offices,

2466
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:18,423
oh,
but you're not supposed to hit on your 

2467
01:54:19,591 --> 01:54:20,221
coworkers.
Now.

2468
01:54:20,221 --> 01:54:21,054
Isn't that considered a microaggression 
or toxic masculinity or some of those 

2469
01:54:24,781 --> 01:54:26,370
things,
but then what if you love her,

2470
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:30,240
what does she loves you?
Hang on so it works out.

2471
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:33,860
What if her husband is a jerk?
You'll take care of her kids.

2472
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:37,570
Oh my god.
No way.

2473
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:39,360
I can't even imagine.
I mean,

2474
01:54:39,361 --> 01:54:41,850
I've been with tommy for so long,
being with,

2475
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:43,650
oh my god,
this is what I think.

2476
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:44,633
I think when people work together,
if you work together for eight hours a 

2477
01:54:46,861 --> 01:54:49,680
day,
you're spending as much,

2478
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:53,010
if not more time with that person that 
you work with every day.

2479
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:54,920
Then you do with your spouse.
Absolutely,

2480
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,690
and you're only home like,
look,

2481
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,300
if you're home in the morning,
how much do you get to see your,

2482
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:03,970
your wife or your husband?
Fucking an hour,

2483
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:06,750
two hours in the morning and most you 
get up,

2484
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,280
you run into the shower,
excuse me,

2485
01:55:08,281 --> 01:55:10,490
brush teeth when eat breakfast and see 
progress.

2486
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:11,360
What you got going on today,
blah,

2487
01:55:11,361 --> 01:55:11,681
blah,
blah,

2488
01:55:11,681 --> 01:55:12,151
blah,
blah.

2489
01:55:12,151 --> 01:55:13,610
Then we're playing basketball with mike,
blah blah,

2490
01:55:13,611 --> 01:55:13,861
blah,
blah,

2491
01:55:13,861 --> 01:55:16,380
blah,
and then for eight hours,

2492
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:19,320
eight hours of the day,
you're with some other people.

2493
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:20,213
You don't spend eight hours flat with 
anybody other than the people that you 

2494
01:55:23,101 --> 01:55:24,690
work with.
You get home.

2495
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,550
It's what?
Seven 30,

2496
01:55:26,551 --> 01:55:28,530
8:00.
You watch tv,

2497
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:30,720
you have dinner.
By the time it's 10,

2498
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:33,480
you're asleep.
That's three hours.

2499
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,850
You got like three hours with that 
person there.

2500
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:38,130
Eight hours with this guy who was trying
to fuck them high.

2501
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:38,910
Now

2502
01:55:38,910 --> 01:55:39,810
you're right.
You're right.

2503
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,560
Because I worked at a company I had.
This guy was.

2504
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,580
He ended up marrying his assistant,
but he did that thing where like,

2505
01:55:47,581 --> 01:55:49,800
this is my work life.
That's what they start by doing.

2506
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:51,660
They break you down slowly and they're 
like,

2507
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:53,070
this is my work wife.
This is my work husband.

2508
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:54,030
Ha.
It's a joke.

2509
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:55,540
It's a joke.
It's a joke and then exploring.

2510
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:05,740
When is the fire happened after?
Oh,

2511
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,361
that was.
Oh,

2512
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:07,194
sorry.
Yeah,

2513
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:10,440
because tommy always like.
I held in a fart that whole time we were

2514
01:56:10,441 --> 01:56:11,640
doing it.
Are you proud of me?

2515
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:14,970
That's his latest cabin.
It's real romantic,

2516
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:17,940
but they're,
they're married now actually,

2517
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,720
but that's how he courted her and she 
was way out of his league.

2518
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:24,900
She was a hot 20 something gorgeous 
girl.

2519
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:26,070
Married.
Now they have,

2520
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:27,360
you know,
how many kids I don't remember,

2521
01:56:27,361 --> 01:56:28,050
but what happened?

2522
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:30,040
How did he do after he.
He broke her hip,

2523
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,750
so she was dating some guy that wouldn't
call her.

2524
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:34,710
It was kind of like dipping out on her 
and stuff.

2525
01:56:34,711 --> 01:56:36,330
So he'd be like,
I'm here for you.

2526
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:38,220
Let's go out after work.
Let's go get some drinks.

2527
01:56:38,221 --> 01:56:39,870
Right.
It's your friend.

2528
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:42,310
I'm the guy that's going to show up for 
you everyday.

2529
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,940
Dumped that guy.
I'm saying,

2530
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:45,863
even though he's just saying he's the 
work husband who's saying I can be a 

2531
01:56:48,241 --> 01:56:50,070
real husband.
Uh,

2532
01:56:50,071 --> 01:56:50,910
yeah,
yes.

2533
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,560
Yeah.
And,

2534
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,470
and to her,
yeah,

2535
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:56,070
that's what she wanted.
She wanted to be wiped up.

2536
01:56:56,370 --> 01:56:58,680
Why?
A lot of girls want to be wiped up.

2537
01:56:59,040 --> 01:56:59,873
Yeah.
That's great.

2538
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:02,250
What would you work?
That's the best.

2539
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,620
I'm an idiot.
I want to go on the road.

2540
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:08,070
We want to make a career has while your 
craft.

2541
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:13,390
Yeah.
Right.

2542
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:18,720
It's really sad when guys wife up,
I know a guy that's wifed up,

2543
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:19,511
you mean?
Oh,

2544
01:57:19,511 --> 01:57:23,440
when the woman takes care of the man,
got all the money beyond that,

2545
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:26,550
that's awesome.
Like to stay home and he looks miserable

2546
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:32,310
because he doesn't have any say.
He doesn't have any income and money.

2547
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:35,460
So who has the money?
Has the power in the relationship.

2548
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:38,730
She didn't even earn the money.
Came from the family.

2549
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:41,150
Fantastic.
And they're involved too.

2550
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:42,510
They're always around.
Oh no,

2551
01:57:42,511 --> 01:57:43,890
that's not good.
He's a weak,

2552
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:45,360
weak,
weak.

2553
01:57:45,361 --> 01:57:50,361
So that's a dark place for a man to be.
No sovereignty,

2554
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:52,763
no control of your existence,
no real financial decision making 

2555
01:57:57,601 --> 01:57:59,730
ability because you don't bring in any 
money.

2556
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,650
She's scaring me right now.
Feeling that they settle for that.

2557
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,833
Well,
you know,

2558
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:08,290
let's little egalitarianism.
Horrible.

2559
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:11,170
You know,
everything's great work.

2560
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:12,570
Why should I work?

2561
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:14,640
You know,
wilma makes all the money,

2562
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:15,713
her name,
that relationship can't ever work that 

2563
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:21,090
dynamic.
Does it make sense to you?

2564
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:22,500
Why would it work?
And it's like,

2565
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:23,463
yeah,
I mean maybe the alligator and the cat 

2566
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:29,901
can be friends course and shit ain't 
gonna work.

2567
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:31,553
It's just not going to work.
It will work if it's not a real man and 

2568
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:37,313
the woman likes that scenario and the 
guy's just like this spineless little 

2569
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:46,270
cheese head.
I think you're totally on pc and I think

2570
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:49,060
you're right because I think he's got to
be kind of a beta male.

2571
01:58:49,660 --> 01:58:52,660
He's the guy who likes his balls busted 
a little bit.

2572
01:58:52,661 --> 01:58:55,570
Maybe.
Maybe he likes his nuts squished.

2573
01:58:55,571 --> 01:58:57,700
He likes to be heard.
He's just scared.

2574
01:58:58,030 --> 01:58:58,390
Yeah.

2575
01:58:58,390 --> 01:59:00,150
You know,
look,

2576
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:01,023
it's if you're in a relationship with 
someone and that someone is a woman and 

2577
01:59:06,221 --> 01:59:07,054
she makes far more money than you and 
you just decided to let her pay all the 

2578
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:12,910
bills.
That is a squirrely proposition.

2579
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,670
It may work.
It's entirely possible.

2580
01:59:15,671 --> 01:59:19,600
You might find the perfect woman and the
perfect man were their personalities gel

2581
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:20,434
together.
Neither one of them gives a fuck about 

2582
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:24,820
money and yet the guy still a man and 
the woman is still a woman,

2583
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:27,160
is just that she makes all the money and
you know,

2584
01:59:27,161 --> 01:59:30,340
he kinda like does the dishes and takes 
it in the ass.

2585
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:34,420
She pegs him.
She puts out a strap on.

2586
01:59:34,421 --> 01:59:35,254
She,
she pisses his face and that's how he 

2587
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:40,780
gets money for food or beats or try it 
out.

2588
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:42,400
Try it out.
Equality.

2589
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:44,440
She does whatever she wants.
She smacks him.

2590
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:45,274
You can't leave.
It's like you think that's what's going 

2591
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:48,060
on?
Yeah,

2592
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,930
I think so.
They have no power.

2593
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:51,761
Well,
let's see.

2594
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:55,450
What about oprah and stedman,
but steadman makes a living too.

2595
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,000
Like he did what his steadman is like 
one of those

2596
01:59:58,190 --> 01:59:59,023
pirate beers that you glue on at a party
and everybody knows it's not a real 

2597
02:00:02,290 --> 02:00:03,123
beer.

2598
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,320
I didn't even know.
It never really occurred to me.

2599
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,730
I don't.
I don't know.

2600
02:00:11,731 --> 02:00:13,860
I just.
They've been together forever.

2601
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:15,630
But could you picture opiate and pushed 
me?

2602
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,340
Yes,
a thousand percent.

2603
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:22,110
But I think gail gail for her isn't so 
much a lover as a mom.

2604
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:24,090
I don't even know who gail is.
That's her best friend.

2605
02:00:24,091 --> 02:00:24,924
Guilt.
Come on.

2606
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:30,120
Come on now.
Come on now for her bff.

2607
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:30,983
That's the one they think.

2608
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:34,250
Just friends.
No,

2609
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:35,890
I don't know.
I don't know you.

2610
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:38,680
I mean I don't possible.
That's not the case.

2611
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,030
Yeah,
it's possible,

2612
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:41,950
but they know.
I don't want to assume.

2613
02:00:41,951 --> 02:00:42,761
Oh,
she looks good there.

2614
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:44,170
Oprah skinny.
I was skinny.

2615
02:00:44,171 --> 02:00:46,060
Oprah for all them stickers.

2616
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:47,163
That's one thing.
Steadman's just steady and then go 

2617
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:51,030
nowhere.
What does it.

2618
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,450
It doesn't even make a good living 
though.

2619
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:53,430
Doesn't he have a job

2620
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:55,560
thing?
I think steadman does have stuff going.

2621
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,600
Yeah.
I think he's like,

2622
02:00:56,601 --> 02:00:58,850
oh,
I want to say he's a lawyer or something

2623
02:00:58,851 --> 02:01:01,220
like that.
I googled them and said,

2624
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:03,080
american educator,
so I don't know.

2625
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,150
Well,
here's the thing or something.

2626
02:01:05,390 --> 02:01:09,380
Wouldn't you say that when someone 
regardless of male,

2627
02:01:09,381 --> 02:01:12,620
female has nothing else in life going.
You know what I'm saying?

2628
02:01:12,621 --> 02:01:14,870
They have no drive,
no focus,

2629
02:01:14,871 --> 02:01:17,330
no,
no goal.

2630
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:19,880
Yeah.
That in and of itself is a bad thing.

2631
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,910
It's a bad thing regardless of being the
man or gender.

2632
02:01:22,911 --> 02:01:23,670
Yeah,

2633
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:24,241
yeah,
yeah.

2634
02:01:24,241 --> 02:01:28,260
People with no hobbies like you don't.
You don't enjoy doing anything.

2635
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:31,090
Even if it's just like reading.
You don't.

2636
02:01:31,100 --> 02:01:34,140
You don't like doing it to do,
but you don't want you to do anything.

2637
02:01:34,410 --> 02:01:36,600
You don't want to do anything.
You don't do anything.

2638
02:01:36,601 --> 02:01:37,980
What do you do?
You watch tv and eat.

2639
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:42,910
Oh yeah.
Billy say,

2640
02:01:42,911 --> 02:01:44,570
tell jokes.
That's true.

2641
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,540
When they're not telling jokes,
they watch tv and eat.

2642
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:49,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

2643
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:52,790
I do that a lot.
Where are fucking weird group of people,

2644
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:53,663
you know?
I mean if you really stop and think 

2645
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:58,260
about how odd our group is,
I'll have a little of that.

2646
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:01,610
I don't want you to drink alone.
There you go.

2647
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:04,420
Plus are probably should have a little 
alcohol after all the alcohol I'd.

2648
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:04,980
Yes,
yes.

2649
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:08,590
Written 11 self help books.
Steadman bottom.

2650
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:13,160
How to marry rich hose cope when your 
wife is way more successful.

2651
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:15,070
How to get,
get some rich policy.

2652
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:16,303
I know you know as feminist as I am 
because I obviously I'm down for the 

2653
02:02:20,751 --> 02:02:22,490
cause.
What is the cause?

2654
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:27,440
Well,
a quality to the choice.

2655
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:28,940
To have choice.
To do what the fuck you want.

2656
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,250
Do you want to stay home?
Raise your kids to home,

2657
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,430
raise your kids.
You want to go have a job,

2658
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,260
a fucking job.
I agree with that as well.

2659
02:02:33,261 --> 02:02:34,670
Yeah.
Maybe I'm a feminist.

2660
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:37,410
I don't know it.
I think you are actually a weird.

2661
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:38,703
I think you are.
What'd you get the ice this whole 

2662
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:41,600
fucking time.
It's been right here.

2663
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:44,320
God damn it was a high class operation 
stuff.

2664
02:02:44,410 --> 02:02:45,980
I put my fingers in there,
get in there.

2665
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:47,000
Okay.
I trust you.

2666
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,770
Oh gosh.
But here's the deal.

2667
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:56,233
You know,
my mother was a european lady and as a 

2668
02:02:59,931 --> 02:03:02,570
female comic,
I'm an alpha in the streets,

2669
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:05,790
but I'm kind of a beta and the sheets,
you know what I'm saying?

2670
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:06,703
I like to take care of my husband and I 
think that's why tommy and I workout 

2671
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:12,770
because I like to bake fucking rice 
krispie treats.

2672
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:15,560
I have shit.
I food in the house.

2673
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:17,180
I'm kind of a traditional wife.

2674
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:18,103
Well you're powerful,
but you're also still a woman and 

2675
02:03:20,181 --> 02:03:23,810
there's nothing wrong with that if 
that's how you like to be.

2676
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:25,183
The idea that there's something wrong 
with that because you're supposed to be 

2677
02:03:27,081 --> 02:03:27,914
even with him.
So you supposed to be treating each 

2678
02:03:29,511 --> 02:03:30,344
other,
not like your traditional male versus 

2679
02:03:31,941 --> 02:03:33,830
female role,
even if that's what you like,

2680
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:34,993
that becomes a problem because it's like
a pressure problem that women will put 

2681
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:41,450
on other women to behave in a different 
way because they don't want to reinforce

2682
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:43,430
traditional gender roles.
Oh,

2683
02:03:43,431 --> 02:03:44,000
right.
Yeah,

2684
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,530
sure,
sure.

2685
02:03:44,530 --> 02:03:47,660
Given that role feels right to you need 
to do like it.

2686
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:49,370
I like it.
I like taking care of my kids.

2687
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:52,460
There's some dirty cops out there,
they'll tell you that's bad.

2688
02:03:58,570 --> 02:04:00,130
Angry bitches.
Yes,

2689
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:00,551
that's true.
No,

2690
02:04:00,551 --> 02:04:01,384
you're right.
I've had some people say stuff to me 

2691
02:04:02,921 --> 02:04:04,240
about it and I'm like,
well,

2692
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:05,463
it makes me happy and if that's all that
matters and it's my choice to do that 

2693
02:04:08,021 --> 02:04:09,790
stuff.
I'm not saying I do it every night.

2694
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:11,620
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2695
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:14,110
Whatever makes you happy.
As long as you're not hurting anybody.

2696
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:14,973
That's all that matters.
And the idea that there's something 

2697
02:04:16,211 --> 02:04:18,970
wrong with you doing that.
Like this is fucking stupid.

2698
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:21,130
It really is.
It's just stupid.

2699
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:26,020
It is silly already talking about you 
had a lot of that though.

2700
02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:27,203
What a lot of that stupid out there.
People telling people the way they 

2701
02:04:30,821 --> 02:04:32,320
shouldn't.
Shouldn't live.

2702
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,560
You know you,
you don't have much time.

2703
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:38,610
I mean,
you and I are halfway done.

2704
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,740
Basically almost dead when you think 
about it,

2705
02:04:40,741 --> 02:04:41,850
when you turned 40,
you were like,

2706
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:44,000
oh this is it dude.
Like yeah,

2707
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:44,913
how much time you got left?
Hopefully another 30 years of good 

2708
02:04:48,271 --> 02:04:49,104
living.
I'm saying before you really start to 

2709
02:04:50,011 --> 02:04:51,810
break down,
shit starts falling apart.

2710
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:53,400
Yeah,
we'll start coming off.

2711
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:53,960
Yes.

2712
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:54,793
Some people are worried about dumb shit,
like whether or not this woman works or 

2713
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:59,990
she should have a career.
She should do this.

2714
02:04:59,991 --> 02:05:01,220
She should.
She's happy.

2715
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:03,740
She likes eating cheese and getting her 
toes done.

2716
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:06,080
Leave her alone.
Yeah.

2717
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:07,280
Yeah.
That's funny.

2718
02:05:07,281 --> 02:05:09,350
I think that is a middle aged revelation
though.

2719
02:05:09,351 --> 02:05:10,011
You go like,
oh,

2720
02:05:10,011 --> 02:05:12,660
there's only so much time left.
I don't give a fuck about all this.

2721
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:15,590
Like I'm gonna do me bro.
The guy that I know that stuck,

2722
02:05:15,710 --> 02:05:19,220
that's the wife makes all the money.
You could see it in his face though.

2723
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:20,803
I could just see this quiet anxiety.
It's like a lion at the zoo where 

2724
02:05:27,201 --> 02:05:28,034
they're kind of broken and they're like,
you know that they're a hunter inside 

2725
02:05:31,761 --> 02:05:33,800
and out,
but you take that instinct away and they

2726
02:05:33,801 --> 02:05:35,560
get the meat thrown at them and they're 
just like,

2727
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:38,270
sadly,
kinda just eat the meat off the tray.

2728
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:40,220
It's like a vegan cat.
Right?

2729
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:45,263
Did you bother looking it up by looking 
up and they're all skinny and shit like 

2730
02:05:48,621 --> 02:05:51,020
just laying down?
A lot of them are fat as fuck.

2731
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:51,943
All they eat is carbs.
I know that's the problem and down 

2732
02:05:55,100 --> 02:06:00,100
fucking bloated kidney failure.
I know eyes are gray and dull.

2733
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:02,503
A model.
That can be the problem with the vegan 

2734
02:06:06,381 --> 02:06:06,891
diet,
right?

2735
02:06:06,891 --> 02:06:09,230
Is you're eating macaroni and cheese and
stuff.

2736
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,640
Oh yeah.
If you go wrong,

2737
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:11,683
that's why the healthy people call it 
plant based because they want it to be 

2738
02:06:15,261 --> 02:06:16,094
plant based.

2739
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,390
Is this pasta all the time?
Yes.

2740
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:20,240
Yes,
but you have to get a lot.

2741
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:22,520
From what I understand that that plant 
based protein,

2742
02:06:23,060 --> 02:06:24,430
a lot of it.
Yeah.

2743
02:06:24,460 --> 02:06:25,990
Well in,
in terms of protein,

2744
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:28,090
there's some foods that are pretty rich 
and protein.

2745
02:06:28,091 --> 02:06:28,924
The real problem is bio availability.
It's not just that there's protein in 

2746
02:06:31,331 --> 02:06:32,164
it.
It's like how much of that protein is 

2747
02:06:32,771 --> 02:06:36,850
absorbed in comparison to like a similar
amount of beef protein.

2748
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:40,030
It's not as easily absorbed.
You can definitely do it though.

2749
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:42,700
You could definitely live a vegan life 
and be healthy.

2750
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:46,120
You just have to really watch your p's 
and q's.

2751
02:06:46,121 --> 02:06:50,530
You gotta really mind what you eat.
You have to take be 12 supplements.

2752
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:51,813
You have to make sure that you're 
getting the correct amount of essential 

2753
02:06:53,261 --> 02:06:56,260
fatty acids and there's just,
but you can do it.

2754
02:06:56,261 --> 02:06:58,480
It can be done,
but it's not as effective.

2755
02:06:58,510 --> 02:06:59,950
It's not.
It's not as easy,

2756
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:02,830
I should say.
It's just meat and vegetables.

2757
02:07:02,831 --> 02:07:05,080
You eat meat and vegetables,
you got your bases covered,

2758
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:07,720
but if you just decided to just going to
be vegan,

2759
02:07:07,721 --> 02:07:08,440
like,
whew,

2760
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:09,131
boy,
you gotta,

2761
02:07:09,131 --> 02:07:12,930
make sure you have keen our hemp protein
or in.

2762
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:13,953
There's like certain plants that have 
some amount of protein but they don't 

2763
02:07:17,171 --> 02:07:20,080
have a complete amino acid profile.
It's tricky,

2764
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:21,163
you know,
but the people who want the people who 

2765
02:07:23,021 --> 02:07:24,520
live it,
they live that vegan life.

2766
02:07:24,521 --> 02:07:25,354
Boy,
they want you to think that that's the 

2767
02:07:25,721 --> 02:07:27,340
only way to go.
You don't.

2768
02:07:27,370 --> 02:07:29,770
You don't live that way.
You're going to be sick and you're going

2769
02:07:29,771 --> 02:07:30,604
to be unhealthy.
And my favorite thing is when one of 

2770
02:07:31,961 --> 02:07:36,220
those motherfuckers jumped ship living,
they've singing the praises

2771
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:39,940
of vegan this and that.
I had a friend who lasted six months,

2772
02:07:40,490 --> 02:07:42,730
lasted six months,
and during that time he was telling me,

2773
02:07:42,731 --> 02:07:44,170
well,
the ethical thing to do,

2774
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:45,143
you know,
I felt like I was a hypocrite if I 

2775
02:07:46,181 --> 02:07:49,780
didn't eat vegan and then he ate vegan.
He started getting sick as fuck.

2776
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:52,810
He got his blood lipids back,
body falling apart.

2777
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:53,441
I was like,
bitch,

2778
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:58,410
you need some meat.
I need some meat now.

2779
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,940
He eats meat like crazy.
It's hilarious.

2780
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:06,200
Six months later I ran into him at a 
steakhouse.

2781
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:12,080
Is he like,
fuck,

2782
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:16,750
listen that the diet is just a lot of 
work.

2783
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:17,613
you can do it,
you can do it if you decide it can be 

2784
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:22,910
done,
but I have a friend who was a.

2785
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:25,800
It was actually a doctor who was in a 
motorcycle accident,

2786
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:26,643
got really badly banged up and he was 
vegan at the time and his wife made him 

2787
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,290
eat a hamburger.

2788
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,000
She's like,
just do me a favor.

2789
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:36,970
I just want you to eat some meat.
Like it wasn't recovering because I kept

2790
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:39,220
really struggling to get over these 
injuries.

2791
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:42,100
He ate a cheeseburger and he said,
literally,

2792
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:46,540
I was so overwhelmed with energy.
I wanted to jump out of bed.

2793
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,580
He goes,
I never was vegan again.

2794
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:51,160
He goes after that one juicy 
cheeseburger,

2795
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:53,230
he goes to eight.
I felt so good.

2796
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:56,080
And the protein like my body was like 
crying out for it.

2797
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:58,730
Mcdonald's,
is that what you think is a good one?

2798
02:08:58,731 --> 02:09:00,820
I think it was a real cheeseburger with 
real.

2799
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:04,430
Mcdonald's is like prison style.
Cheeseburger,

2800
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,920
juicy fat boy.
So good,

2801
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:08,650
isn't it?
I know and I'm pregnant,

2802
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:10,413
but uh,
but what I found interesting when those 

2803
02:09:11,591 --> 02:09:14,620
guys were on talking about it is because
I like to eat salami.

2804
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:17,190
I do like the process shit.
And he is like,

2805
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:19,300
the processed meats are the no,
now that's what's going to give you.

2806
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:20,133
But cancer,
unless you get a ton of vegetables to 

2807
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:25,020
offset the damage right in your colon.
Nitrites.

2808
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:28,870
So I try to get the nitrite free 
wholefoods shit.

2809
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:30,190
Yeah.
Is that cool?

2810
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:30,881
Yeah,
you can.

2811
02:09:30,881 --> 02:09:31,714
I mean there's,
there's organically grow organically 

2812
02:09:35,441 --> 02:09:40,441
created chart shooter charcuterie 
learned this word chart chart,

2813
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:42,500
charcuterie,
charcuterie.

2814
02:09:42,501 --> 02:09:45,100
It's basically salami,
mortadella,

2815
02:09:45,101 --> 02:09:46,000
that kind of stuff.
But there's,

2816
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:47,860
there's companies that make it 
organically,

2817
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:50,860
it just doesn't last very long,
doesn't have any preservatives in it.

2818
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:52,990
Like that's really what you want.
But that's what gives you the.

2819
02:09:52,991 --> 02:09:53,824
But cancer is.
I'm sure that the real problem with all 

2820
02:09:56,231 --> 02:09:57,064
these,
these assumptions is that these are 

2821
02:09:58,691 --> 02:10:02,920
correlations based on mostly based on 
people filling out questionnaires.

2822
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,233
That was fascinating.
And how much do you recall what you ate 

2823
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,650
yesterday?
Accurately.

2824
02:10:08,680 --> 02:10:10,450
That's what's really interesting.
Good.

2825
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:11,693
That's part of the problem.
And people tend to make themselves look 

2826
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:14,764
like the better than they actually do 
the kind of lie because they feel bad 

2827
02:10:18,461 --> 02:10:19,294
about being a fucking gluttonous slobs.
I'll ask my trainer because that lady I 

2828
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:26,554
do pilates with,
she put me on this primal diet and 

2829
02:10:28,421 --> 02:10:30,730
that's my last baby.
Wait the first time I was like,

2830
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:33,740
how many of your clients just stay fat

2831
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,813
for years?
And then you ask them what they eat and 

2832
02:10:36,561 --> 02:10:37,610
they just lie to you.
If she's like,

2833
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:38,473
oh that's a lot of people.
Like they don't really have an 

2834
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:41,930
awareness.
You know what I mean?

2835
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:44,990
Like you think you're doing one thing,
but the reality is completely different.

2836
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:45,740
It's hard

2837
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:49,450
for women when they get real big.
You know what your body wants to keep on

2838
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:50,293
that.
Fucking wait is that your body is not 

2839
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:54,390
want to let that go.
It's easier for a man to lose weight.

2840
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,273
Definitely believe that more muscular 
your body has more caloric requirements 

2841
02:11:00,441 --> 02:11:02,390
because there's all this muscle burn up 
fat.

2842
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:04,730
And then if you do lift weights,
which,

2843
02:11:04,731 --> 02:11:06,590
uh,
everybody who wants to get lean,

2844
02:11:06,591 --> 02:11:09,530
I always recommend you got to lift some 
weights because if you lift weights,

2845
02:11:09,531 --> 02:11:10,364
your body is burning more fat because 
it's adding more muscle so it's burning 

2846
02:11:13,401 --> 02:11:14,234
more calories.
If you eat the same amount of food but 

2847
02:11:16,011 --> 02:11:16,844
you just lift weights,
you're going to lose body fat and the 

2848
02:11:18,891 --> 02:11:19,724
reason is because your body's going to 
build up muscle tissue and that muscle 

2849
02:11:22,131 --> 02:11:24,080
tissue is gonna have a caloric 
requirement.

2850
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:24,933
NoT that those calories,
if you eat the exact same amount of 

2851
02:11:26,661 --> 02:11:29,090
calories,
but now you're eating,

2852
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:32,360
you're eating all this food,
but lifting weights,

2853
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:35,480
your body is going to get leaner.
As long as you're consistent,

2854
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:38,270
you stay consistent.
And continue lifting weights.

2855
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,510
You can eat like a fat ass and still

2856
02:11:40,620 --> 02:11:42,160
say that,
but I'm saying if you,

2857
02:11:42,161 --> 02:11:44,890
if you are on a diet like a sustainable 
diet,

2858
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:47,710
like eat a normal amount of food,
but you lift weights,

2859
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,410
lifting weights is a great way to lose 
weight.

2860
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,303
It's a great way to lose body fat.
You won't necessarily lose weight 

2861
02:11:53,381 --> 02:11:57,640
because you'll put on muscle mass,
but your body will burn off more fat.

2862
02:11:57,670 --> 02:12:00,070
particularly if you're a guy,
because it's easier to put on weight,

2863
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:03,820
muscle weight.
No fuckin a man.

2864
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:07,690
This fucking does this thing that we did
this month.

2865
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:09,610
One thing that it did teach me is,
boy,

2866
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,530
you can do a lot more than you think you
can.

2867
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:14,890
I bet a lot more.
I bet tom loves it,

2868
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:19,120
that the challenge aspect of it,
he loves to push himself.

2869
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:22,300
The the.
Is it the sadist where you hurt yourself

2870
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:23,320
or the massive cast?

2871
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,600
Masochist.
You hurt yourself.

2872
02:12:24,601 --> 02:12:25,530
Say this,
you hurt other people.

2873
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:27,360
Oh,
so the masochist in him,

2874
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:28,500
the.
I don't know.

2875
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:29,483
He.
He loves to challenge himself and do 

2876
02:12:30,661 --> 02:12:33,380
these things with you guys.
I think it gives them a big charge.

2877
02:12:33,730 --> 02:12:34,370
He's a,

2878
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:35,870
um,
I was a sadist when I was trying to hurt

2879
02:12:35,871 --> 02:12:36,704
burt Australia,
trying to get bird to try to keep up 

2880
02:12:38,601 --> 02:12:41,900
with me so he would die.
Oh,

2881
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:43,810
birds.
Everybody wanted to make sure that burke

2882
02:12:43,811 --> 02:12:44,644
came in last.
That's what everybody was super 

2883
02:12:46,551 --> 02:12:48,640
concerned with.
Super conservative

2884
02:12:48,930 --> 02:12:49,601
going.
Well,

2885
02:12:49,601 --> 02:12:50,620
it didn't come in.
Last

2886
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:55,630
mission accomplished came in last Year 
when he was starting to pull where,

2887
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:58,650
where am I going to put the bill on my 
shelf?

2888
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,900
I was like,
you're never getting that belt.

2889
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:02,243
Oh,
bert will take you on a road through 

2890
02:13:04,741 --> 02:13:05,574
hell.
You're not getting that belt 

2891
02:13:06,511 --> 02:13:08,990
motherfucker.
So wait,

2892
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:11,310
how did he go wrong?
He just wasn't consistent.

2893
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:16,020
Um,
well there's a lot of things for sure.

2894
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:16,883
He is overweight,
which makes it far more difficult to 

2895
02:13:19,381 --> 02:13:22,620
keep up that amount of cardio because 
your joints are going to hurt and you're

2896
02:13:22,621 --> 02:13:24,060
running,
you know?

2897
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:25,020
I mean,
he's,

2898
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,420
he's real heavy.
You knoW what I mean?

2899
02:13:27,421 --> 02:13:30,390
I think he lost some weight during the 
program,

2900
02:13:30,391 --> 02:13:32,130
but he was two,
six,

2901
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,600
something like that.
When he,

2902
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:37,500
when he did it and he got down to 2:16
for the weight loss challenge,

2903
02:13:37,570 --> 02:13:41,700
right to 19 tommy,
two to 16,

2904
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:44,220
so that's a significant amount of 
weight.

2905
02:13:44,221 --> 02:13:48,840
We're talking about a good solid 20 plus
pounds,

2906
02:13:48,841 --> 02:13:52,600
30 pounds of weight that he put on,
you know,

2907
02:13:52,610 --> 02:13:54,930
that's a lot of weight.
It's fat.

2908
02:13:55,060 --> 02:14:00,060
It's just the stakes of fat.
When you look at what a pound of fat is,

2909
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:03,210
because I've had to lose weight from the
second pregnancy.

2910
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,850
I've gotten more efficient at it because
I learned how to do it,

2911
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:08,820
but I have another 20 to go to where I'm
comfortable,

2912
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:10,950
but god damn man,
that's a lot.

2913
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:13,740
One pound lift up one of your kettle 
bells.

2914
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:15,330
What is it?
Ten pounds.

2915
02:14:16,030 --> 02:14:18,630
Thirty five pounds.
the the little chimp ones.

2916
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:22,740
Those are 35 pounds.
That's what burt had to lose.

2917
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,710
His carrying that 35 pound kettle bell 
everywhere he goes.

2918
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:29,370
that's a tremendous strain on your knees
on.

2919
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,513
Also.
Body's just not used to exercise and he 

2920
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:34,494
has to take high blood pressure 
medication which are guaranteed makes 

2921
02:14:36,271 --> 02:14:38,310
you weak.
That's the fucks with you.

2922
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:40,920
I mean he's.
He's taken something that's lowering his

2923
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:43,950
blood pressure.
What else is it doing?

2924
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:48,390
It's not just low on your bread.
Boozy using angels to do that with using

2925
02:14:48,391 --> 02:14:49,224
pixie dust to make sure that you're 
super healthy and you don't have a 

2926
02:14:51,811 --> 02:14:52,644
stroke.
Who knows what the Fuck that stuff's 

2927
02:14:54,871 --> 02:14:55,704
doing to you and that's from like 
cholesterol and his blood causing fat 

2928
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:04,700
and lazy and drinking from drinking.
Look,

2929
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:09,060
I love her to death,
but he needs to hear this.

2930
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,330
Got to stop drinking every night.
You can't drink every night.

2931
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:15,210
You can't do that.
That's too much.

2932
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:16,980
You know,
you look at tom,

2933
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:21,480
tom lost all that weight and the weight 
loss challenge and kept it off.

2934
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,690
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2935
02:15:22,691 --> 02:15:24,180
I kept it off.
Oh yes.

2936
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:25,860
Burton and keep it off.
well,

2937
02:15:25,990 --> 02:15:27,630
what's the difference?
Well,

2938
02:15:27,631 --> 02:15:29,360
burt ran a marathon.
Well,

2939
02:15:29,361 --> 02:15:32,430
burt burt does those tough mudder races.
Burt runs all the time.

2940
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:33,443
How come birders and skinny because 
birds drinking a fucking case of vodka 

2941
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:40,290
every night.
Well,

2942
02:15:41,290 --> 02:15:42,510
well,
how much is a glass?

2943
02:15:42,511 --> 02:15:43,080
I mean,
okay,

2944
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,610
a glass of vodka,
glass of wine.

2945
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:46,230
What is it?
300 calories,

2946
02:15:46,231 --> 02:15:48,660
let's say glass of wine.
Is it on there?

2947
02:15:48,730 --> 02:15:50,610
So you drink,
let's say you drink.

2948
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:54,390
Those are two glasses a night or a 
bottle of wine a night.

2949
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:57,210
Jesus christ burt drank a whole box of 
wine.

2950
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:59,880
What do you mean when of those wine 
boxes?

2951
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:03,300
Like a whole box of one when he was self
here at night.

2952
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:05,670
Oh no,
he was Talking to us about it.

2953
02:16:05,671 --> 02:16:06,810
Remember we talked,
we talked about.

2954
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:07,980
Oh,
You drank a box.

2955
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:08,930
It's a lot.
Well,

2956
02:16:08,931 --> 02:16:09,764
how many glasses are in that?
There's got to be like 20 glasses in 

2957
02:16:12,661 --> 02:16:13,740
that.
So what is that?

2958
02:16:13,741 --> 02:16:15,090
Like a Milkshake and,
and,

2959
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:17,670
and a cheeseburger.
Double cheeseburger.

2960
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:19,120
Five liters.
Five liters.

2961
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:21,840
Drank five liters to one.
Could have a small one I guess.

2962
02:16:21,841 --> 02:16:22,950
But fuck,
he did.

2963
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:24,630
Why would you have a small one?
We could have a big one.

2964
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:29,010
Five.
And it's like shit.

2965
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:34,080
Shit.
Hawaiian sugary boxed one.

2966
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:39,570
Not even the good shit.
Yeah.

2967
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:42,090
Well I'm hoping that through this.
Um,

2968
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:43,263
everybody kind of keeps up a certain 
amount of fitness because it seems like 

2969
02:16:46,181 --> 02:16:46,840
we,
uh,

2970
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:51,040
we kinda boxed wine so much class.
So few calories.

2971
02:16:51,041 --> 02:16:54,160
I don't doubt that jesus was this one.
A few cows.

2972
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:55,120
It.
Is it a spurt?

2973
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:57,550
They're talking about that specific type
of wine.

2974
02:16:57,570 --> 02:16:59,830
Friends.
Ia is at a low calorie one.

2975
02:17:00,380 --> 02:17:01,660
WeLl,
there's that skinny,

2976
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:03,920
skinny,
skinny one.

2977
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:05,260
Yeah,
that one of the housewives.

2978
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:09,230
Worst one.
I'm 10.

2979
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:12,430
White wine.
Ryan has 110 calories.

2980
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:16,360
Five grams of sugar.
Shiraz read 110 calories.

2981
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:19,450
Ten grams of sugar just for a five ounce
serving.

2982
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:22,750
So that's a small glass of wine or a 
regular sized glass of wine,

2983
02:17:22,751 --> 02:17:24,190
right?
That's not that bad.

2984
02:17:24,191 --> 02:17:27,220
One hundred 10 calories.
So if you can keep yourself to one glass

2985
02:17:27,221 --> 02:17:28,600
of wine,
bad,

2986
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,550
that's a big no,
no,

2987
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:32,170
but you're doing the whole bottle.
Yeah,

2988
02:17:32,171 --> 02:17:34,360
that's not good.
If you were drinking a case of it,

2989
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:37,180
if they're backing up one of those oil 
trucks to your house,

2990
02:17:37,850 --> 02:17:40,780
just sucking on that dick of death,
all that.

2991
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:45,540
All that wind dick jews coming down your
fat phase.

2992
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:50,020
Especially if I do pilates,
that's where like 300 calories,

2993
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:53,950
that's all for an hour.
Jesus,

2994
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:57,670
you can drink that shit up and you know 
what I mean?

2995
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,390
One of the workouts that we did,
you know,

2996
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:02,800
because I did,
I decided about,

2997
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:04,173
I don't know,
I guess close to two weeks out that I 

2998
02:18:06,011 --> 02:18:06,844
was going to start really pressure in 
these guys and just doing workouts to 

2999
02:18:10,031 --> 02:18:13,000
like five hour workout,
like doing shit.

3000
02:18:13,001 --> 02:18:14,140
That's just insane.
I was like,

3001
02:18:14,141 --> 02:18:16,360
let's see wheRe we're going.
Let's see how far we go.

3002
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:19,660
One workout I did,
I burned 4,700

3003
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:21,190
calories.
That's bananas.

3004
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,700
It was crazy.
I was eating boxes of graham crackers or

3005
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:28,720
animal crackers.
Ate a whole box of animal crackers.

3006
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:32,710
Apples.
I drank a a cream soda,

3007
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,940
sugar.
I just want sugar.

3008
02:18:33,941 --> 02:18:34,960
While I was doing it,
I was like,

3009
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:37,470
I'm so taxed out,
but I'm gonna.

3010
02:18:37,490 --> 02:18:38,261
Keep going.
I'm like,

3011
02:18:38,261 --> 02:18:39,094
I need some sugar.
So I just ate these animal crackers and 

3012
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:44,050
drank soda.
Got right back on.

3013
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:48,140
Yeah,

3014
02:18:48,140 --> 02:18:48,973
puppet master.
I just kept thinking about getting 

3015
02:18:50,841 --> 02:18:54,470
tired.
How's he going to serve man?

3016
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:55,750
So waIt,
where are you guys going?

3017
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:56,953
Where are you guys going to do this?
I guess we would have to do it in like 

3018
02:19:01,221 --> 02:19:05,240
malibu or santa monica or wherever you 
could serve.

3019
02:19:05,710 --> 02:19:06,543
You know?
And we would have to figure out a way 

3020
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:11,240
that the app registers how much time 
you're standing on the board.

3021
02:19:11,900 --> 02:19:16,900
So like you would have to be how much 
time you're actually surfing,

3022
02:19:17,030 --> 02:19:20,410
not just go.
Just get on with believe.

3023
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:22,200
No,
no,

3024
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,930
no.
It has to be standing.

3025
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:26,390
Standing on the surf board.
We have to figure out a way.

3026
02:19:26,570 --> 02:19:27,950
did you say was some sort of an app?

3027
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:29,153
There's something that I passed.
I was trying to figure out what it's 

3028
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:33,140
tracking.
It's tracking like the board's movement.

3029
02:19:33,141 --> 02:19:36,080
I think so.
If you're doing side decide stuff,

3030
02:19:36,081 --> 02:19:39,500
it knows that you're probably up and is,
is it?

3031
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:41,060
No.
If you're lying on your stomach,

3032
02:19:41,061 --> 02:19:43,340
just paddling.
I feel like a slob.

3033
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:47,030
I don't think it would tell you that.
Tell you how hard that shit is though.

3034
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:48,320
It's hard.
And tell you what the hardest,

3035
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:50,960
at least from when I learned how to surf
a decade ago,

3036
02:19:50,961 --> 02:19:54,500
the hardest part is paddling out on that
fucking bored.

3037
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:55,221
you're,
I mean,

3038
02:19:55,221 --> 02:19:57,590
you're going against the current,
right against the waves,

3039
02:19:57,980 --> 02:19:58,641
bang,
bang,

3040
02:19:58,641 --> 02:20:00,200
bang.
TuRned that board around.

3041
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:02,720
You finally see the wave coming and then
you got to paddle,

3042
02:20:02,721 --> 02:20:03,291
paddle,
paddle,

3043
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:05,000
and then the pop up.
So right,

3044
02:20:05,001 --> 02:20:09,020
you're on your belly and you got a pop 
up from your belly to standing like this

3045
02:20:09,021 --> 02:20:10,460
dude.
Like you got to go fast.

3046
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:11,473
I don't know.
For me that was an and the board's 

3047
02:20:12,621 --> 02:20:13,454
heavy.
At least if you're learning on a banana 

3048
02:20:14,451 --> 02:20:15,680
board,
like When it was big ones,

3049
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:16,933
you're probably not going to start on 
like the one that fucking what's his 

3050
02:20:19,851 --> 02:20:22,560
name was shane dorian.
Yeah.

3051
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:25,620
Kelly's like,
you're not doing those boards right now.

3052
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:27,950
You're going to learn on a big clunky 
banana board.

3053
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,773
Probably heavy as fuck.
And then if that thing hits you on the 

3054
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:33,700
head because you're.
Yeah,

3055
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:35,170
settlements,
kill anybody.

3056
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:36,153
That's the thing.
I was,

3057
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:38,800
I was legit worried this year.
Like when my,

3058
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:42,880
uh,
at the end of the thing when I was doing

3059
02:20:42,881 --> 02:20:46,240
like several,
a $5,000

3060
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:50,050
or 500 point days I was doing,
I do like three or four in a row,

3061
02:20:50,051 --> 02:20:50,884
500 days,
which is like three and a half hours of 

3062
02:20:53,021 --> 02:20:54,280
exercise.
There's a lot of work.

3063
02:20:54,310 --> 02:20:55,840
So much.
It was crazy,

3064
02:20:55,841 --> 02:20:56,800
but I was like,
ooh,

3065
02:20:56,830 --> 02:20:59,110
there comes a point where your body 
starts failing.

3066
02:20:59,140 --> 02:21:02,850
Like I don't want anybody to die like 
legit die.

3067
02:21:03,010 --> 02:21:05,500
Like this is a real issue.
Like you can,

3068
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,393
you can have organ failure.
Have you just decided to push too hard 

3069
02:21:08,691 --> 02:21:09,524
or.
We were getting really psycho about it 

3070
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:13,893
because I was so sad.
See somebody posting like big numbers 

3071
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:18,683
when you get real anxiety.
Even when you're ahead you'd see like 

3072
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:22,983
tom,
tom ran 13 miles when he was on the 

3073
02:21:24,101 --> 02:21:26,500
antibiotics and everybody freaked out 
and I was like,

3074
02:21:26,501 --> 02:21:30,400
what the fuck tom,
like angry at him because he posted like

3075
02:21:30,401 --> 02:21:33,700
600 points in one workout.
What the fuck?

3076
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:38,930
Well I was concerned witH burt at the 
11th hour pulling some crazy shit.

3077
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,090
Not october 30.
First was halloween.

3078
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:42,890
So tom was like,
oh,

3079
02:21:42,891 --> 02:21:43,724
he's with his kids.
He's trick or treating like he's not 

3080
02:21:44,811 --> 02:21:46,970
going to go do some crazy.
What could he do though?

3081
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:51,170
He was so far behind.
How far behind was he the last day?

3082
02:21:51,171 --> 02:21:52,004
I don't know the number.

3083
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:57,610
He was pretty far behind tom,
like I think 700 points behind tom.

3084
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:58,513
Oh,
he was like more than a thousand behind 

3085
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:03,550
ari.
Oh,

3086
02:22:03,551 --> 02:22:06,310
way more than a thousand.
Which you can.

3087
02:22:06,311 --> 02:22:08,890
I got an a day once you can get a 
thousand dollars a day,

3088
02:22:09,130 --> 02:22:09,963
but you have to almost kill yourself.
You gotta you gotta knock on heaven's 

3089
02:22:13,571 --> 02:22:16,630
door so far will you guys.
It's the worst.

3090
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:18,700
And watching my spouse go through it.
I'm like,

3091
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:19,810
ugh,
stop.

3092
02:22:20,140 --> 02:22:21,130
Well,
here's the thing.

3093
02:22:21,131 --> 02:22:23,620
When we started doing it,
no one thought we were going to do this.

3094
02:22:24,010 --> 02:22:26,010
No one thought we were going to try to 
kill each other like this.

3095
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:28,073
We're just joking around about it and I 
always thought like my first couple of 

3096
02:22:30,661 --> 02:22:32,340
workouts,
like an hour,

3097
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,010
hour and a half,
200 points.

3098
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:36,983
But then our,
he figured out that you could watch a 

3099
02:22:39,091 --> 02:22:39,924
movie and be on the elliptical machine 
and he got 479 points one day and 

3100
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:46,320
wrecked his body.
Could barely walk the next day.

3101
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:48,690
But the fact that he did that and I 
went,

3102
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:51,660
oh,
and then I realized like we talked about

3103
02:22:51,661 --> 02:22:51,981
this,
you,

3104
02:22:51,981 --> 02:22:53,940
you,
you get the same amount of points for 80

3105
02:22:53,941 --> 02:22:56,550
percent of your max heart rate as you do
for 90.

3106
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:00,240
So I kept trying to go as hard as I can,
thinking that you would get more points,

3107
02:23:00,390 --> 02:23:02,720
but you don't get more points for that.
There's no path.

3108
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:05,820
Yeah.
Slow and steady wins the race,

3109
02:23:05,821 --> 02:23:06,800
right?
Yeah.

3110
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:09,630
Which that's not how I work out.
So I was like,

3111
02:23:09,631 --> 02:23:11,100
shit,
what am I going to Do?

3112
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:16,490
So time on the board time standing on 
the board over a month.

3113
02:23:18,470 --> 02:23:20,340
It's fucking hard.
Fucking hard.

3114
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:22,620
It's so hard.
That should be hard and no,

3115
02:23:22,621 --> 02:23:27,621
none of us know how to surf at all.
How are you going to have like do like a

3116
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:28,920
class,
like a quarter.

3117
02:23:29,230 --> 02:23:31,960
So we'll go and bird was like,
whoa.

3118
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:37,890
Hey kelly's busy and you don't need a 
world champion teaching you.

3119
02:23:37,891 --> 02:23:38,724
You fuck.
You need to like a regular surf 

3120
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:41,430
instructor.
What do you like?

3121
02:23:41,431 --> 02:23:44,010
Some prodigy that needs to be coached by
the best.

3122
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,383
The fuck outta here.
Kelly slater is just dying to tutor 

3123
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:52,140
kelly's my friend you piece of shit.
First of all,

3124
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:54,450
I think that's really talented.
Dude.

3125
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:55,583
I'm closer to shane.
I'm pretty close with shane when shane 

3126
02:23:57,630 --> 02:23:59,640
and I've been on a bunch of hunting 
trips together now,

3127
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:01,920
but uh,
I wouldn't go to him.

3128
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:02,910
He's busy.

3129
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:04,530
Super busy.
It's like if you said,

3130
02:24:04,531 --> 02:24:05,364
I want to learn how to kickbox and we 
don't have the time to teach you how to 

3131
02:24:07,441 --> 02:24:09,810
fight,
like I'm not doing that man.

3132
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:13,680
Go find a coach because that's what they
do for a living.

3133
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:14,803
Yeah.
There's a bunch of schools you can go 

3134
02:24:15,451 --> 02:24:16,770
to.
Yeah.

3135
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:18,013
I actually wanted to rent a house by the
beach next summer and just devoted to 

3136
02:24:21,541 --> 02:24:23,820
learning how to surf again,
like really good at it.

3137
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:26,510
I love the ocean.
I love rent a house by the beat,

3138
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:31,110
like you super dedicated just to wake up
and go do it and then wow,

3139
02:24:31,230 --> 02:24:32,280
that'd be rad.
Right?

3140
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:32,870
I wanT it.
That's,

3141
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:35,670
that's a bucket list thing before I get 
too fucking old to do.

3142
02:24:35,950 --> 02:24:36,783
Well,
it is something that you can do no 

3143
02:24:37,771 --> 02:24:39,800
matter how old you are.
Yeah.

3144
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,870
You can just ride waves.
One of the things that shane was talking

3145
02:24:42,871 --> 02:24:44,640
about that was really kinda interesting,
he's like,

3146
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:45,683
everybody has the same amount of fun if 
you suck at surfing or if you're really 

3147
02:24:49,891 --> 02:24:51,570
good at it,
it's still fun.

3148
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:53,310
I was like,
oh,

3149
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:57,250
you know what else told me about kooks?
Do you know what a kook is?

3150
02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:02,340
Hooks lambs on instagram.
douchebags that wipe out cooks or people

3151
02:25:02,701 --> 02:25:04,550
who don't know what they're doing.
Yeah.

3152
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:07,260
It's an instagram account called slams.
Oh,

3153
02:25:07,261 --> 02:25:11,730
it's surfing like people suck at it.
It's just what burt,

3154
02:25:11,731 --> 02:25:16,731
tom and ra are all going to be on.
Kooks slams was next year.

3155
02:25:16,771 --> 02:25:19,540
We're all going to be on that because 
we're going to fuck up with.

3156
02:25:19,570 --> 02:25:22,560
The thing is like finding a spot where 
you're allowed to serve,

3157
02:25:22,830 --> 02:25:23,663
where you can get in there where you 
don't know what you're doing and you 

3158
02:25:25,121 --> 02:25:25,954
don't get in anybody's way.
I don't wAnt to fuck up and his buddies 

3159
02:25:28,331 --> 02:25:31,780
experience because according to all the 
surf movies and stuff,

3160
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,270
they got turfs,
bro.

3161
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:36,130
You can't just roll up on the dudes that
are in malibu.

3162
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:37,540
I don't want anybody to get mad at me.

3163
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:40,240
You got to find because you know,
like I see them,

3164
02:25:40,241 --> 02:25:41,500
I go to watch them,
you know,

3165
02:25:41,501 --> 02:25:42,334
or that mastro's is and in malibu they,
there's a little thing where all the 

3166
02:25:46,991 --> 02:25:50,680
surfers go and that's like one area and 
then there's redondo.

3167
02:25:50,681 --> 02:25:51,514
You go down there and there's that area.
We'd have to learn surf etiquette for 

3168
02:25:55,001 --> 02:25:58,960
sure,
but if they listened to the gre,

3169
02:25:58,961 --> 02:26:00,880
maybe there'll be cool,
maybe.

3170
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:02,140
Yeah.
But maybe they'll be like,

3171
02:26:02,141 --> 02:26:03,730
hey dickhead,
you're going to get more people out here

3172
02:26:03,731 --> 02:26:06,100
surfing.
Fuck this up for us.

3173
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:07,293
You know,
people have said that to me about 

3174
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:09,220
bowhunting.
Really.

3175
02:26:09,890 --> 02:26:11,500
You're getting more people out into the 
woods,

3176
02:26:11,501 --> 02:26:12,730
you know,
that's annoying.

3177
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,650
They were joking around about it.
I go,

3178
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:15,550
are you serious?
He goes,

3179
02:26:15,551 --> 02:26:16,384
Well,
it's good because then we'll have more 

3180
02:26:17,561 --> 02:26:20,410
people hunting,
but it's bad because I honestly see more

3181
02:26:20,411 --> 02:26:21,244
people hunting and I really think it's 
because of you and because of cameron 

3182
02:26:24,581 --> 02:26:25,414
hanes and steve rinella and John Dudley 
and all these hunters that are 

3183
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:29,104
interesting,
cool people that more people are trying 

3184
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:31,000
it.

3185
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,130
I believe that.
I believe it.

3186
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:35,380
I think so too.
It's like I'm going to do.

3187
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:36,303
It's like when taco bell chihuahua for 
ellie's fucking douche bags are buying 

3188
02:26:41,741 --> 02:26:42,574
chihuahuas for their kids for christmas 
and then they'd throw them into the 

3189
02:26:46,181 --> 02:26:47,970
pounds or whatever because they couldn't
take care of them.

3190
02:26:47,971 --> 02:26:48,804
They didn't know.
That happens every time there's a 

3191
02:26:50,021 --> 02:26:51,580
talking dog moving.
Yes,

3192
02:26:51,581 --> 02:26:54,390
I do know that.
And then that popular breed [inaudible].

3193
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:59,850
Everyone gets it and they don't like the
breed and then stopped talking to him.

3194
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:05,250
Wow.
Why aren't you.

3195
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:10,260
When she talks about chalupas,
meanwhile a chihuahua for the most part,

3196
02:27:10,871 --> 02:27:12,580
from the ones I've known,
the temperament,

3197
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:15,790
they're very nervous.
High strung,

3198
02:27:15,791 --> 02:27:18,880
high energy dogs,
very skittish.

3199
02:27:19,390 --> 02:27:24,390
Not not the ideal family pet.
If your bones were made a toothpicks and

3200
02:27:24,581 --> 02:27:28,980
you're around a bunch of fucking clumsy 
kids like kids are always stepping on,

3201
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:29,953
wasn't breaking their leg,
happens all the time to cast a little 

3202
02:27:34,391 --> 02:27:35,224
fat kid eating this candy,
not looking stomps on his poor dog's 

3203
02:27:39,161 --> 02:27:39,610
leg.

3204
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:42,030
Snapped it like a twig.
Fuck.

3205
02:27:42,070 --> 02:27:44,260
Imagine ogres around you.
Giant.

3206
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,700
Huge,
enormous,

3207
02:27:45,701 --> 02:27:50,701
ogres eating candy.
Terrifying or dalmatians like every time

3208
02:27:53,981 --> 02:27:55,630
100,
one dalmatians comes out,

3209
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:56,973
every fuckface beizer kidded dalmatian 
for christmas and then aren't they 

3210
02:27:59,861 --> 02:28:00,694
stupid?
Don't their brains to groW bigger than 

3211
02:28:03,410 --> 02:28:04,243
their brains grow bigger than the skull 
or something was out of the head of 

3212
02:28:13,950 --> 02:28:14,783
school,
but the brain's otherwise they go too 

3213
02:28:16,301 --> 02:28:18,830
much brains.
They had headaches.

3214
02:28:18,831 --> 02:28:21,830
You've got to kill him.
Was the brains out?

3215
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:23,620
Weren't they like fire people?
Dogs?

3216
02:28:23,790 --> 02:28:24,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

3217
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,230
Why is it.
Why is it dalmatian wide?

3218
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,360
Wherever they connected to firetrucks 
and shit.

3219
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:30,990
No fucking idea.
Yeah.

3220
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:35,150
You think you'd have like a smart dog?
Like a german shepherd?

3221
02:28:35,530 --> 02:28:37,460
I don't know.
I don't know.

3222
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:38,294
The dalmatians are dying or they're dumb
or a dare damaged while his german 

3223
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:45,200
shepherds are super smart.
I know that's a highly trainable dog.

3224
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:47,630
They're also like,
they're sizing you up.

3225
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,370
Like when a german shepherd looks at 
you,

3226
02:28:49,371 --> 02:28:50,181
he's like freaking out.
Like,

3227
02:28:50,181 --> 02:28:53,180
what's going on here?
What do you about you pussy.

3228
02:28:54,390 --> 02:28:56,380
How about if I show my teeth,
what are you going to do?

3229
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:59,400
Scared of me.
Oh look,

3230
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:04,420
you smell like fear.
Faggot it like a comedy audience.

3231
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:08,990
Dude,
have a german shepherd could talk.

3232
02:29:09,020 --> 02:29:11,990
They would say some creepy shit to you.
They would.

3233
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:15,510
It would be like,
what would happen if I bit you?

3234
02:29:17,780 --> 02:29:21,530
What would you do?
Wind fire departments have dalmatians.

3235
02:29:21,531 --> 02:29:23,600
Dalmatians and horses are very 
compatible.

3236
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:24,493
Oh.
So the dogs were easily trained to run 

3237
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:26,954
in front of the engines to help clear a 
path and guide the horses in the 

3238
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:32,570
firefighters to fire as quickly.
There's still chosen by mary,

3239
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:36,410
many firefighters as pets in honor of 
their heroism in the past.

3240
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:39,350
Oh,
so fucking heroic dogs.

3241
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:44,540
You asshole calling them stupid.
The worst human being ever.

3242
02:29:44,541 --> 02:29:46,160
I'm always the person like,
oh,

3243
02:29:46,161 --> 02:29:47,060
they're crippled.
Okay,

3244
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,140
great.
Yeah,

3245
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:53,200
they're fucking stupid brain come out of
that is they're all dumb shit.

3246
02:29:53,690 --> 02:29:56,140
Worst person,
um,

3247
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,073
their deaf.
Why are genetic predisposition for 

3248
02:29:59,511 --> 02:30:02,030
deafness?
It's a serious problem for dalmatians.

3249
02:30:02,031 --> 02:30:04,370
Only about 70 percent of them have 
normal hearing.

3250
02:30:05,360 --> 02:30:07,910
Depthness was not recognized by early 
breeder.

3251
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:10,160
So the breed was thought to be 
unintelligent.

3252
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:14,540
Oh,
that's interesting.

3253
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:18,170
They're cute as shit though.
Crazy thoughts and shit.

3254
02:30:18,300 --> 02:30:19,133
Yeah.
I feel like if you're going to have a 

3255
02:30:20,331 --> 02:30:21,440
dog,
a german shepherd,

3256
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:22,303
you,
but you got to be around that fucking 

3257
02:30:23,211 --> 02:30:27,100
dog all the time.
That work.

3258
02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:29,880
The dogs.
Yeah,

3259
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:31,790
they're working dogs because if you 
don't.

3260
02:30:31,791 --> 02:30:32,624
My dad got one from the past when I was 
a kid and he didn't put in the time and 

3261
02:30:35,601 --> 02:30:39,710
that dog tore everything apart and was 
Just bored out of its mind.

3262
02:30:39,711 --> 02:30:42,520
You can't take a smart fucking dog and 
just throw it in the backyard.

3263
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:46,460
That's when they get in.
They jump out and they escape.

3264
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:47,810
Escape.
yes.

3265
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:50,780
Escape that.
A mother fucking.

3266
02:30:50,781 --> 02:30:51,614
No,
I can't hold me in with your bullshit 

3267
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:55,370
ass boats.
That's right.

3268
02:30:55,790 --> 02:30:57,770
For the rottweiler too.
That's a good one.

3269
02:30:57,771 --> 02:30:58,604
That's a smart dog to her mean dogs too.
They're good at being mean or that rock 

3270
02:31:05,121 --> 02:31:07,590
wilder cup.
A rock.

3271
02:31:12,050 --> 02:31:15,440
The rock wild.
My rock wild.

3272
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:17,473
I remember one time when I.
I adopted our first dog and there was a 

3273
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:20,190
guy next

3274
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:21,023
to me and he was getting a rottweiler 
and I remember the lady behind the 

3275
02:31:23,581 --> 02:31:24,690
counter saying,
well sir,

3276
02:31:24,691 --> 02:31:25,040
you're,
you're.

3277
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,873
You know that these dogs are highly 
intelligent and they require hours and 

3278
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:30,360
hours of training.
You're going to do that.

3279
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:30,930
Right?
And he was like,

3280
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:31,920
oh yeah,
sure,

3281
02:31:31,921 --> 02:31:32,430
sure.
It's like,

3282
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:33,840
you know,
he's not going to plug in.

3283
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:35,003
This guy's not going to.
He's gonna paraded around the 

3284
02:31:36,721 --> 02:31:39,660
neighborhood with a fucking dumb chain 
around its neck and.

3285
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:41,310
And that's it.
That's it for that though.

3286
02:31:42,070 --> 02:31:44,520
Yeah.
Dog's going to go nuts.

3287
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:48,540
They go nuts.
Dogs need fucking exercise.

3288
02:31:48,541 --> 02:31:50,310
They need.
They need stuff to do.

3289
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:53,580
like my dog becomes a different person 
or different thing.

3290
02:31:53,581 --> 02:31:55,610
Rather,
when I take him running for purse,

3291
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:58,140
he gets so excited when he runs,
he's like,

3292
02:31:58,230 --> 02:31:59,280
he runs,
he just,

3293
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:03,240
he's got a big giant smile on his face.
He runs around.

3294
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:04,140
He's like,
he's like,

3295
02:32:04,141 --> 02:32:06,240
yes.
He runs the hills.

3296
02:32:06,250 --> 02:32:07,410
He comes back,
everything cool.

3297
02:32:07,411 --> 02:32:09,750
Okay.
I'll say it takes off again,

3298
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:11,940
but then when the end of the day comes,
you know,

3299
02:32:11,941 --> 02:32:13,790
an hour and a half later when we're done
running,

3300
02:32:13,810 --> 02:32:14,643
he's like,
ah,

3301
02:32:15,390 --> 02:32:18,900
he's just chIll the fuck out.
Fairly jumped in the truck.

3302
02:32:19,240 --> 02:32:21,390
He puts his paws up.
What's going to help them?

3303
02:32:21,391 --> 02:32:26,391
Some dogs,
if we do a mile,

3304
02:32:26,521 --> 02:32:28,290
he jumps in easy.
We do two miles.

3305
02:32:28,291 --> 02:32:30,810
It gets a little sketchy.
Two miles in the hills.

3306
02:32:31,610 --> 02:32:36,610
Hills make two miles a long way.
It's a hard time to get back in.

3307
02:32:36,691 --> 02:32:37,830
That truck is like,
come on dude.

3308
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:41,760
You know you can pick me up.
I'll put my paws up here.

3309
02:32:41,761 --> 02:32:45,210
You know what?
Do you sleep with them?

3310
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:46,400
No,
no,

3311
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:47,870
no.
He's crate trained or what?

3312
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,713
He didn't know.
He just sleeps outside the door of the 

3313
02:32:50,641 --> 02:32:51,120
house.

3314
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:52,800
I mean not outside,
outside,

3315
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:56,040
outside the door.
The bedroom in the hallway.

3316
02:32:56,190 --> 02:32:57,290
Just,
he's,

3317
02:32:57,360 --> 02:32:59,190
he doesn't like beds.
He's weird.

3318
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:00,353
I got him a bunch of dog beds.
It just throws his toys in that and 

3319
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:03,290
sleeps on the ground.
Well,

3320
02:33:03,300 --> 02:33:07,110
I actually had a dog trainer tell me 
that the dogs don't need the beds.

3321
02:33:07,470 --> 02:33:10,020
That's a convenient thing to us.
He goes,

3322
02:33:10,021 --> 02:33:10,890
yeah,
but look at dogs.

3323
02:33:10,891 --> 02:33:12,960
They'll lay on the floor.
They don't.

3324
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:15,080
They don't give a fuck about the bed.
That's you.

3325
02:33:15,081 --> 02:33:18,660
And you're definitely true with my dog.
He just doesn't use them.

3326
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:19,733
I had beds like in three different spots
in the house and he would never choose 

3327
02:33:24,841 --> 02:33:25,560
him.
I was like,

3328
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:26,610
come on buddy,
lie down,

3329
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:27,623
and I'm like,
what are we doing?

3330
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:29,160
I don't want to come on buddy,
here's your bed,

3331
02:33:29,161 --> 02:33:30,660
here's your bed,
and he'd step on the bed.

3332
02:33:30,660 --> 02:33:31,860
He's lIke,
what is this stupid thing?

3333
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:33,750
Or they would climb off the bed and lie 
down,

3334
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:36,030
lie down on the wood floor.
I was like,

3335
02:33:36,031 --> 02:33:36,864
okay.
It's like that documentary about that 

3336
02:33:37,891 --> 02:33:42,210
guy that got out of North Korea and the 
camp and then they gave him an apartment

3337
02:33:42,211 --> 02:33:44,140
and they gave him a bed and he was like,
no thanks.

3338
02:33:44,141 --> 02:33:46,170
And he would just sleep on the floor.
Really?

3339
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:47,910
Yeah.
There was some documentary I forget,

3340
02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:50,850
but he was in a camp in North Korea and 
they finally,

3341
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:53,910
they got them to soul and they're like,
here's your iphone,

3342
02:33:53,911 --> 02:33:56,670
here's the subway,
here's your apartment with all this cool

3343
02:33:56,671 --> 02:33:57,930
shit.
And he was like,

3344
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:58,913
I'm good.
And he would lay on the floor and sleep 

3345
02:34:00,571 --> 02:34:03,450
because he was so used to being in 
prison essentially,

3346
02:34:04,170 --> 02:34:06,210
which is interesting how the human mind,
right?

3347
02:34:06,211 --> 02:34:09,120
When you're traumatized in that way of 
thinking,

3348
02:34:09,150 --> 02:34:13,140
you don't even see what you have.
The human mind is so adaptaBle.

3349
02:34:13,141 --> 02:34:18,141
Right?
There's so many different ways to be

3350
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,470
person.
So many different ways to live.

3351
02:34:21,170 --> 02:34:23,730
No.
um,

3352
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:27,050
I was listening to a thing about trauma 
and,

3353
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:28,640
uh,
you know,

3354
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:33,700
Vietnam war vets and how all that shit 
works when you've gone through trauma,

3355
02:34:33,711 --> 02:34:35,060
it,
the rest of your life,

3356
02:34:35,061 --> 02:34:37,730
you're living in the past.
That's what that is.

3357
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:40,530
To get locked in that one thing.
Yeah.

3358
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:44,190
Just locked into the horrific memories 
that,

3359
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:47,070
that's not just the case for people that
have gone through war.

3360
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:48,443
It's also the case for people that have 
gone the grown up in really bad 

3361
02:34:51,091 --> 02:34:52,060
neighborhoods.
Yeah.

3362
02:34:52,250 --> 02:34:54,340
Ptsd from the hood.
Sure.

3363
02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:58,200
Ptsd from violence that made it.
They saw at home domestic violence.

3364
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:00,100
Yep.
Yeah.

3365
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:02,073
Yeah.
And then I was listening to a podcast 

3366
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,610
about,
um,

3367
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:11,340
about microaggressions,
social justice warrior podcast.

3368
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:15,310
Well,
initially I didn't know.

3369
02:35:15,311 --> 02:35:16,144
It was like I stumbled and no on 
apparently because I just was 

3370
02:35:18,441 --> 02:35:19,121
interested.
I'm like,

3371
02:35:19,121 --> 02:35:20,710
what the fuck is,
what is a micro?

3372
02:35:20,711 --> 02:35:21,580
Like,
what is this?

3373
02:35:21,581 --> 02:35:22,540
You know what I'm going to learn about 
it.

3374
02:35:22,990 --> 02:35:24,220
And uh,
and she was like,

3375
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:25,083
I'm,
I'm a therapist and I treat people with 

3376
02:35:26,831 --> 02:35:28,330
microaggressions,
you know,

3377
02:35:28,331 --> 02:35:30,890
there's like a million little paper cuts
over time.

3378
02:35:32,050 --> 02:35:32,801
And I was like,
okay,

3379
02:35:32,801 --> 02:35:33,670
well what's that?
And she's like,

3380
02:35:33,671 --> 02:35:36,100
you know,
if you're like an asian woman and people

3381
02:35:36,101 --> 02:35:36,934
are like,
they fetishize you and they're like the 

3382
02:35:39,221 --> 02:35:41,320
hit on you,
let's say because you're an asian woman,

3383
02:35:41,321 --> 02:35:43,480
that's a microaggression.
So a year,

3384
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:47,380
a lifetime of those little things you 
need is trauma.

3385
02:35:47,580 --> 02:35:52,510
The trauma counseling,
they hit on you because you're asian,

3386
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:52,991
like,
you know,

3387
02:35:52,991 --> 02:35:55,680
there's dudes out there that are just 
strictly into asian girls or whatever.

3388
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:56,523
Let's say for instance,
and you're an asian woman and a guy 

3389
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:01,180
comes onto you and it's traumatic 
because you're like,

3390
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:03,180
oh,
it's fucking pervert is,

3391
02:36:03,340 --> 02:36:06,190
you know,
just washed his feet and shit.

3392
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:07,360
Right?
Or let's say a woman,

3393
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:08,530
okay,
right,

3394
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:13,620
I'm in a meeting just me and a guy 
interrupts me and I want to talk.

3395
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:18,330
That's a microaggression.
And I've suffered the trauma of that and

3396
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:21,490
I need to be in.
What if the guy interrupted guy?

3397
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:24,190
So that's still a microaggression.
Thank you.

3398
02:36:24,290 --> 02:36:25,360
I didn't get that far,
man.

3399
02:36:25,361 --> 02:36:26,880
I don't know.
Yeah,

3400
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:30,220
it could be like a microaggression,
right?

3401
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,160
Maybe.
Maybe,

3402
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:37,480
maybe,
but that's,

3403
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:38,433
that's a form of.

3404
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:39,900
No,
there's a bunch of them,

3405
02:36:40,050 --> 02:36:41,220
you know,
compliments,

3406
02:36:41,221 --> 02:36:43,970
holding doors open for someone could be 
a microaggression.

3407
02:36:44,660 --> 02:36:45,493
[inaudible] you're,
you're saying that the woman can't open 

3408
02:36:47,341 --> 02:36:48,174
the door by herself.
Even just simple politeness becomes 

3409
02:36:51,831 --> 02:36:54,510
chivalry isn't microaggression.
Right?

3410
02:36:54,720 --> 02:36:55,710
Right.
And again,

3411
02:36:55,711 --> 02:36:58,890
that's a form of trauma that needs 
counseling.

3412
02:36:59,010 --> 02:37:01,380
well,
there's just a bunch of weak bitches out

3413
02:37:01,381 --> 02:37:05,220
there that can handle regular life.
So they want everything on nerfed up.

3414
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:10,790
They went all language language,
nerfed up all behavior nerved up.

3415
02:37:12,480 --> 02:37:13,313
And then we're also encouraging people 
that just can't let things off their 

3416
02:37:15,441 --> 02:37:16,040
back,
which

3417
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,540
is very dangerous.
Like the more people don't get offended,

3418
02:37:20,541 --> 02:37:21,830
the better off we are.
You know,

3419
02:37:21,831 --> 02:37:24,240
who fucking handled something absolutely
spectacularly.

3420
02:37:25,130 --> 02:37:29,570
That navy seaL,
who is a politician who.

3421
02:37:29,571 --> 02:37:32,810
I'm the guy from sarah live,
pete.

3422
02:37:33,050 --> 02:37:37,040
Uh,
ariana grande's was pete davidson.

3423
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:39,470
They broke up after they got several 
tattoos.

3424
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:41,953
Pete was talking about him on saturday 
night live and he said he looked like a 

3425
02:37:45,471 --> 02:37:48,520
villain and a porno film and then he 
joked around.

3426
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:49,071
He goes,
yeah,

3427
02:37:49,071 --> 02:37:49,904
you mean,
I guess you shouldn't joke around about 

3428
02:37:51,711 --> 02:37:54,180
it beCause he lost his eye and war or 
whatever.

3429
02:37:54,390 --> 02:37:56,390
He's like laughing the whole time.
It's was like,

3430
02:37:56,391 --> 02:37:57,224
wow.
Like is one thing about joking around 

3431
02:37:59,631 --> 02:38:01,510
about the guy looking like a villain and
a porno film,

3432
02:38:01,511 --> 02:38:04,790
but the joking around saying he lost his
eye and war,

3433
02:38:04,970 --> 02:38:05,810
like whatever.
I'm like,

3434
02:38:05,811 --> 02:38:06,644
man,
that is surprising that snl let that go 

3435
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:11,030
and they did it because the guys right 
wing,

3436
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:12,890
which is really fascinating.

3437
02:38:13,300 --> 02:38:17,780
Their bias towards the left and against 
the right is so.

3438
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:20,240
It's so obvious.
It's so crazy.

3439
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:21,783
I mean that they didn't think that it 
would be a problem to make fun of a war 

3440
02:38:25,311 --> 02:38:26,144
veteran who lost his eye in combat 
because the man in front of them was 

3441
02:38:29,991 --> 02:38:34,991
blown up by an ied torres face apart and
ruined one of his eyes and he handled it

3442
02:38:37,790 --> 02:38:40,640
so well.
He said that he.

3443
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:41,713
He said something about he works hard 
not to offend an even harder to not be 

3444
02:38:45,561 --> 02:38:47,920
offended.
It's cool.

3445
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:48,933
Yeah.
But he also said that he really didn't 

3446
02:38:50,481 --> 02:38:55,290
think it was a good idea to make jokes 
about someone who said something.

3447
02:38:55,460 --> 02:38:57,410
I'm paraphrasing someone who,
uh,

3448
02:38:57,560 --> 02:39:00,260
who was disfigured in,
in combat.

3449
02:39:00,550 --> 02:39:01,383
Right.
Which that seems to be a pretty fair 

3450
02:39:02,901 --> 02:39:03,910
line.
Yeah.

3451
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:06,590
I don't think that's unreasonable.
No,

3452
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:07,443
it's not unreasonable and I think he 
handled it as good as you can handle it 

3453
02:39:10,641 --> 02:39:13,190
when you're on television,
national television,

3454
02:39:13,191 --> 02:39:15,350
they're laughing and joking about you 
having one.

3455
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:16,183
I mean,
while you lost your eye in the service 

3456
02:39:18,621 --> 02:39:22,540
of the country and an incredibly 
dangerous thing that only the people who

3457
02:39:22,541 --> 02:39:23,374
have done it really truly understand.
And here's this young kid was bleached 

3458
02:39:27,111 --> 02:39:27,944
hair laughing with you only having one 
eye and he's doing it on a national 

3459
02:39:32,391 --> 02:39:33,224
comedy show and people are laughing 
along with them because you're a 

3460
02:39:35,951 --> 02:39:37,580
republican.
Right.

3461
02:39:37,581 --> 02:39:39,860
And that's the interesting point is 
because he is a republican,

3462
02:39:39,861 --> 02:39:42,740
it's kind of okay.
It's okay.

3463
02:39:42,741 --> 02:39:45,260
It's fucking weird.
That's weird.

3464
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:47,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

3465
02:39:48,350 --> 02:39:49,183
But the guy handled it well and they 
probably actually probably won them the 

3466
02:39:51,561 --> 02:39:53,780
election.
That's probably how that shit goes.

3467
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:55,820
Right?
People going to find out About it.

3468
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:56,913
You know,
you make fun of the guy because you 

3469
02:39:57,831 --> 02:40:00,330
think it's funny and then you're giving 
them all this press.

3470
02:40:00,390 --> 02:40:02,390
He handles it well,
and then people are like,

3471
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:03,650
oh,
that guy's a navy seal.

3472
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:04,640
oh,
well,

3473
02:40:04,641 --> 02:40:06,430
I like what he says.
Listen to him talk.

3474
02:40:06,450 --> 02:40:08,120
Seems like a good guy.
Next thing you know,

3475
02:40:08,121 --> 02:40:10,020
he wins now.
So valiant.

3476
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:12,820
I kind of wished mccain had a better,
better rap.

3477
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:16,490
Really fucked up that sarah palin,
she was a ding dong.

3478
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,960
That was preposterous.
Hey man and I,

3479
02:40:19,961 --> 02:40:23,040
I would love to see a woman in the white
house that was not.

3480
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,450
Yeah,
no,

3481
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:26,260
not that one.
She was real.

3482
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:31,230
I'd take 10 hillary clinton for take one
and I don't want hillary clinton to win.

3483
02:40:31,231 --> 02:40:32,064
I think she's ridiculously awful too.
I think a lot of people really disliked 

3484
02:40:35,731 --> 02:40:37,800
hillary.
Really disliked her.

3485
02:40:37,950 --> 02:40:39,170
They should,
yeah.

3486
02:40:39,330 --> 02:40:42,660
She got a shitload of money from banks.
She's completely full of shit.

3487
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:46,260
She didn'T like gay marriage until 2013.
She wouldn't.

3488
02:40:46,261 --> 02:40:49,500
She didn't agree with gay marriage until
2013.

3489
02:40:49,950 --> 02:40:51,630
Like,
what are you a dinosaur?

3490
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:53,250
Like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

3491
02:40:53,250 --> 02:40:56,640
Why would you even care?
Because it's she's not real.

3492
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:58,530
She doesn't.
She didn't care.

3493
02:40:58,710 --> 02:41:02,940
She just was doing what she thought was 
support her position politically.

3494
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:04,073
She was leaning right when obama was 
leaning more left and she was trying to 

3495
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:08,544
center herself as a or position herself 
as a a wiser choice for people who were 

3496
02:41:14,470 --> 02:41:15,303
unhappy with the choices on the right 
but really unhappy with obama and then 

3497
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:21,990
she was.
She was a better option.

3498
02:41:21,991 --> 02:41:22,824
She's more sensible.
She's a little more hawkish with a more 

3499
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:25,734
prone to go to war,
a little more pro military or at least 

3500
02:41:28,021 --> 02:41:33,021
military action,
but meanwhile just a puppet of banks and

3501
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:34,523
just those people make shit piles of 
money from speeches and his major 

3502
02:41:39,661 --> 02:41:43,170
problems with the clinton foundation.
It's not even around anymore.

3503
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:46,140
Shut it down.
It's dark,

3504
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:47,880
dark,
dark legion.

3505
02:41:49,050 --> 02:41:50,730
I mean,
while she's doing all this meat to talk,

3506
02:41:50,731 --> 02:41:52,800
her husband's had goddamn predator.

3507
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:56,700
He's beeN a predator forever that I 
think for women,

3508
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:58,110
at least for me,
I was like,

3509
02:41:58,960 --> 02:42:01,740
stay with this bro.
Like come on nicole lewinsky thing.

3510
02:42:01,741 --> 02:42:02,574
She said that monica lewinsky was a 
gRown woman and it wasn't an abusive 

3511
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:07,100
power.
get the fuck out of here.

3512
02:42:07,860 --> 02:42:09,690
She was twentY.
He was the president.

3513
02:42:09,730 --> 02:42:11,970
20.
Is there a kid?

3514
02:42:12,210 --> 02:42:13,043
He was the president.
There is no more powerful person on 

3515
02:42:16,530 --> 02:42:18,150
earth.
That's not an abusive power.

3516
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:21,360
What is an abusive power?
You're banging someone who works for you

3517
02:42:21,361 --> 02:42:25,590
and you run the world.
Did I know and I get it.

3518
02:42:25,591 --> 02:42:29,480
If I were 20,
do this sucked.

3519
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:30,323
That sucked us all operating.
What's still operating the clinton 

3520
02:42:36,091 --> 02:42:37,920
foundation?
What didn't they shut down?

3521
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:40,170
Part of it?
Something shut down.

3522
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:41,183
Um,
clinton foundation shuts down or cease 

3523
02:42:43,561 --> 02:42:44,394
operations.
Look that up because there was some 

3524
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:49,800
article that I read about it.
I think for me,

3525
02:42:50,010 --> 02:42:53,220
just the whole stand by her man thing no
matter what,

3526
02:42:53,221 --> 02:42:55,860
it's just so antiquated.
Just going back to this,

3527
02:42:55,861 --> 02:42:56,694
tommy been stuff.
Read a tournament for killing satirical 

3528
02:42:59,491 --> 02:43:00,280
site.
Oh,

3529
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:01,570
did you?
Well,

3530
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:04,770
so it didn't shut down at all.
Nothing.

3531
02:43:05,180 --> 02:43:08,790
Mama loser me according to fact 
check.work.

3532
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:12,190
Google a story

3533
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:13,810
though.
See if there's a google,

3534
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:14,693
a clinton foundation that these baseless
claims are made up by a self-describe 

3535
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:19,460
satirical website.
Oh,

3536
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:21,880
so then I didn't reduce operations or 
anything.

3537
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:25,600
There's another thing that says from 
2017,

3538
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:28,240
they shut down the clinton global 
initiative,

3539
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:29,710
but would.
That was the thing.

3540
02:43:29,711 --> 02:43:32,260
It was right after the election,
which is two thousanD 16.

3541
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:37,840
That's what I read that after the 
election,

3542
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:42,090
after it was all over.
I don't know either way.

3543
02:43:42,091 --> 02:43:43,070
I mean the,
the,

3544
02:43:43,150 --> 02:43:45,440
the clinton foundation,
super sketch,

3545
02:43:45,810 --> 02:43:48,380
one of the reasons that super sketches,
a lot of people that donate,

3546
02:43:48,410 --> 02:43:49,243
there's just a lot of weird shit going 
on with donators and then them doing 

3547
02:43:53,661 --> 02:43:54,494
speeches for these huge organizations 
like banks getting paid hundreds of 

3548
02:43:58,401 --> 02:44:00,650
thousands of dollars,
some boring ass speech,

3549
02:44:00,830 --> 02:44:01,663
which is essentially

3550
02:44:01,710 --> 02:44:03,160
bribe.
Right?

3551
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:04,600
Right.
It's all it is.

3552
02:44:04,660 --> 02:44:06,850
Those people aren't pumped to see her 
talk.

3553
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:09,220
I don't think any of these people are 
legit.

3554
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,113
I mean,
no,

3555
02:44:11,250 --> 02:44:13,890
a lot of it too.
He's done a lot of those paid speeches,

3556
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:16,380
but they get hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to talk,

3557
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:17,490
but I guess,
I mean,

3558
02:44:17,491 --> 02:44:18,930
look,
I don't want to fucking get into it,

3559
02:44:18,931 --> 02:44:19,764
but isn't that why people love trump 
because he's outside of the whole 

3560
02:44:22,410 --> 02:44:23,670
system?
Theoretically,

3561
02:44:25,070 --> 02:44:25,903
that's probably the part.

3562
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:27,250
Oh,
here it goes.

3563
02:44:27,350 --> 02:44:30,530
Let's say end of an era.
The clinton global initiative shut

3564
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:35,330
just part of the error.
End of an error,

3565
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:39,920
not an error.
E r,

3566
02:44:39,921 --> 02:44:40,880
r o r,

3567
02:44:42,310 --> 02:44:44,530
when they asked him,
there was a.

3568
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:47,170
There was an interview where they asked 
him about monica lewinsky like,

3569
02:44:47,171 --> 02:44:48,400
do you owe her an apology?
IT's like,

3570
02:44:48,401 --> 02:44:49,234
well,
anybody who thinks so I got out of that 

3571
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:52,690
clean is crazy.
No,

3572
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:55,690
the I call it cost me millions of 
dollars.

3573
02:44:55,691 --> 02:44:59,050
I left the white house in debt and all 
of a sudden that's not when anybody asks

3574
02:44:59,051 --> 02:45:00,640
you,
you fucking sociopath.

3575
02:45:01,700 --> 02:45:02,533
He has.
She thinks she deserves an apology 

3576
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:05,170
because he never spoke

3577
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:06,003
to of course,
and meanwhile she was one of the first 

3578
02:45:08,681 --> 02:45:12,370
people to be publicly shamed for 
something of this nature.

3579
02:45:12,371 --> 02:45:13,204
This was a huge scandal and this is back
before the 24 hour news cycle really 

3580
02:45:18,920 --> 02:45:19,753
stuck forever.
Forever for this poor woman's life was 

3581
02:45:23,410 --> 02:45:24,520
over.
Done.

3582
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:27,580
Just done.
Monica lewinsky synonymous with dick.

3583
02:45:27,581 --> 02:45:28,414
Sucker.
That's it.

3584
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:30,880
Isn't that fucked up cloud.
You said it,

3585
02:45:30,881 --> 02:45:32,650
not me.
Oh shit.

3586
02:45:32,651 --> 02:45:34,610
Here we go.
Now I'm going to dare you.

3587
02:45:34,611 --> 02:45:36,540
I dare you.
I'm empathize.

3588
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:37,503
I have sympathy for this poor girl.
Makes one mistake as a 20 year olds and 

3589
02:45:42,071 --> 02:45:45,040
now her whole life is this scandal.
If you remember,

3590
02:45:45,041 --> 02:45:45,874
there was a town

3591
02:45:45,930 --> 02:45:46,763
hall thing that did on hbo many years 
later where she was talking to a group 

3592
02:45:51,891 --> 02:45:52,724
of people about the president about the 
whole situation and in the middle of 

3593
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:58,170
like,
you know,

3594
02:45:58,170 --> 02:46:00,890
people would ask questions and talk to 
her and one guy goes,

3595
02:46:00,891 --> 02:46:01,724
you know,
it just seems to me like you just 

3596
02:46:02,271 --> 02:46:05,360
milking this for attention.
Like why even still talking about this?

3597
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:07,640
But.
And she was like,

3598
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:10,010
uh.
And he was like,

3599
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,470
whY are you still talking about this?
If this is so horrific?

3600
02:46:12,471 --> 02:46:14,150
Like why?
Why do you keep bringing this up?

3601
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:16,280
What,
what does she want to do?

3602
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,600
Ha,
yeah,

3603
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:23,570
what is she supposed to do?
But imagine being that person who was 20

3604
02:46:23,571 --> 02:46:24,404
years old.
So essentiallY you're a kid and the 

3605
02:46:26,031 --> 02:46:28,250
whole world knows you suck the 
president's dick.

3606
02:46:28,430 --> 02:46:29,960
SO everywhere you go people are like,
oh,

3607
02:46:29,961 --> 02:46:34,961
you presidents didn't like she's.
She said that it sticks like tar.

3608
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:36,193
That's,
that was her description that the shame 

3609
02:46:37,430 --> 02:46:38,900
sticks to you.
Like tar.

3610
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:40,940
I believe it.
And what about Marilyn Monroe?

3611
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:45,620
Was she second kennedy?
Everybody's dead kennedys.

3612
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:48,350
Robert and bobby.
Bobby and jack.

3613
02:46:48,920 --> 02:46:51,140
But there is no evidence.
I guess there was no dress.

3614
02:46:51,141 --> 02:46:53,330
There was no.
Why was that?

3615
02:46:54,260 --> 02:46:57,380
The world was a different place,
but I didn't even have dna.

3616
02:46:57,940 --> 02:46:59,030
Right.
And then she,

3617
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:01,190
she air quotes died.

3618
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:04,820
TheY killed up itch.
Rude percent.

3619
02:47:05,330 --> 02:47:07,880
Hundred percent.
apparently she was all yap,

3620
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:08,763
yap,
yap.

3621
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:12,190
And she was getting older and nobody 
wanted to bang her anymore.

3622
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:17,200
Like I'm to do it the right thing.
You want to tell everybody?

3623
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:21,420
Well,
jack,

3624
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:23,290
I met with,
she was bobbing,

3625
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:24,380
but she.
Yeah,

3626
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:28,100
well at least from what I've heard read,
maybe bipolar.

3627
02:47:28,710 --> 02:47:30,830
Um,
she came from a lot of trauma,

3628
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:31,693
severely abused as a child.
We got the orphanage really making shit 

3629
02:47:38,301 --> 02:47:39,134
up.
No,

3630
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:40,340
no,
she was.

3631
02:47:40,340 --> 02:47:45,020
She was pretty bad childhood man.
From what I know.

3632
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:46,220
Makes sense.
Actress.

3633
02:47:46,530 --> 02:47:49,820
Yeah.
Exorbitant need for attention.

3634
02:47:49,850 --> 02:47:50,683
I'm converting it.
Comedians at least write their own 

3635
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:56,550
stuff,
right?

3636
02:47:56,890 --> 02:47:57,723
The actors,
like comedians with no punchlines but 

3637
02:48:00,171 --> 02:48:01,004
here's but crazier because they always 
have to get audition for stuff on a 

3638
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:05,420
nightmare.
However,

3639
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:06,343
here's what I do admire aBout actors.
I feel like they're more in touch with 

3640
02:48:10,161 --> 02:48:11,540
their feelings than we are.

3641
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:14,900
Like that's accessing feeling like I'm 
talking a real actors and shit.

3642
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:16,860
Yeah.
wow.

3643
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:18,140
I.
At least me,

3644
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:19,473
I don't like.
I don't like feeling things too much 

3645
02:48:21,471 --> 02:48:23,120
healing.
Did you know what I'm saying?

3646
02:48:23,121 --> 02:48:23,954
I get very last hole.
It gets very itchy and when talking 

3647
02:48:27,801 --> 02:48:31,610
about feeling like I don't do that.
RighT.

3648
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:32,993
I admire that you can access feelings 
and in and show people feelings and 

3649
02:48:37,671 --> 02:48:38,450
stuff,
I guess.

3650
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:39,440
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3651
02:48:39,441 --> 02:48:40,850
Yeah,
I guess,

3652
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:41,953
but I think the fake feelings,
I think this is the feelings they think 

3653
02:48:43,941 --> 02:48:45,860
they should have,
so they just start crying.

3654
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:47,600
I shouldn't be sad here.

3655
02:48:49,940 --> 02:48:51,740
I think they're sociopaths for the most 
part.

3656
02:48:52,310 --> 02:48:53,143
The vast majority of actors,
what do you think about the actors when 

3657
02:48:56,961 --> 02:49:00,350
they're making a movie and they have to 
stay in character the whole time?

3658
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:01,900
Oh,
those are the big associate sociopaths,

3659
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:04,380
but the best actors to,
you know,

3660
02:49:04,390 --> 02:49:07,470
like the,
the best.

3661
02:49:07,471 --> 02:49:09,030
Yeah.
I saw The documentary,

3662
02:49:09,031 --> 02:49:11,900
the man on the moon about jim carrey 
doing a,

3663
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,280
what's the guy's fucking name,
you know,

3664
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:17,130
andy kaufman,
andy kaufman,

3665
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:20,490
calvin,
and apparently,

3666
02:49:20,491 --> 02:49:21,324
you know,
he stayed in character the whole time 

3667
02:49:22,381 --> 02:49:23,214
and he.
And so he would annoy the shit out of 

3668
02:49:24,181 --> 02:49:27,240
people the whole time and,
and throw tantrums and stuff.

3669
02:49:27,241 --> 02:49:28,050
And I was like,
well,

3670
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:29,340
That sounds fucking terrible.

3671
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:33,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

3672
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,950
Just how about just act,
bro?

3673
02:49:37,470 --> 02:49:41,010
Other actors have broken that down and 
made fun of people who do that.

3674
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:43,200
I'm like,
I love jim carey.

3675
02:49:43,201 --> 02:49:47,280
I think he's so talented and so funny,
but I'd be really annoyed.

3676
02:49:47,490 --> 02:49:48,323
That would be annoying if you had to 
work with them for six months and you 

3677
02:49:49,681 --> 02:49:51,080
just.
Calvin.

3678
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:53,050
Yeah.
Only annoying asshole.

3679
02:49:53,090 --> 02:49:56,060
And then do things like hold up 
production and,

3680
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:58,010
and you know what I mean?
Those are union people.

3681
02:49:58,011 --> 02:49:58,844
These are dudes that are up at like four
in the morning putting sets up and 

3682
02:50:02,451 --> 02:50:03,284
lighting and that guy and that guy has 
got to wait for you because you're on 

3683
02:50:05,541 --> 02:50:07,880
your trailer pretending to be somebody 
else.

3684
02:50:09,290 --> 02:50:11,440
You know whaT I'm saying?
Like she would hold up produce that.

3685
02:50:11,450 --> 02:50:12,430
That to me is district.

3686
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:15,460
What he really did.
That's what this documentary is about.

3687
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:16,443
Trying to remember.
I don't know if he officially set it in 

3688
02:50:18,661 --> 02:50:19,494
it,
but I think he wanted that whole part 

3689
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:24,010
because they were filming it to be part 
of the movie too.

3690
02:50:24,011 --> 02:50:26,530
And at some point they decided to not do
that and make the movie.

3691
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:27,790
Oh,
okay.

3692
02:50:27,820 --> 02:50:30,520
So you wanted it included in there.
But he also has an to say he,

3693
02:50:30,521 --> 02:50:31,354
uh,
jerry lawler was really mad at him 

3694
02:50:32,650 --> 02:50:35,860
because the rest of it was not the 
relationship that according to him,

3695
02:50:35,861 --> 02:50:37,710
that was not the relationship they had.
They're like,

3696
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:38,830
it was,
it was all a ruse.

3697
02:50:38,831 --> 02:50:41,290
It was like a wrestling type deal.
Did worked it all out.

3698
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:42,183
Yeah.
But that's not how jim carrey was 

3699
02:50:42,911 --> 02:50:43,744
acting.
He was just being addicted to them over 

3700
02:50:44,771 --> 02:50:46,750
and over and over again,
pissing them off.

3701
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:48,290
Oh,
that's unfortunate.

3702
02:50:48,390 --> 02:50:50,950
Well,
even not specific to this one person.

3703
02:50:51,440 --> 02:50:52,273
I jusT.
That seems absurd to me to pretend to 

3704
02:50:53,711 --> 02:50:54,544
be,
but if you do it and it works and that 

3705
02:50:56,351 --> 02:50:58,390
makes an awesome movie.
I don't know.

3706
02:50:59,470 --> 02:51:01,810
I mean like one of them Daniel Day lewis
characters.

3707
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:04,710
He does that shit and he's the best.
Yeah.

3708
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:07,650
His movies are all pretty good,
you know,

3709
02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:08,503
I mean just a few that I haven't seen,
but most of them that I've seen it 

3710
02:51:11,381 --> 02:51:13,450
pretty goddamn killer.
That's pretty rad.

3711
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:16,570
Is crazy thOugh mean you got to leave 
him alone.

3712
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:21,510
Let him do that stupid thing where he 
pretends to be lincoln shit.

3713
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:24,580
Did you try to watch that one?
We talked about it yesterday.

3714
02:51:24,610 --> 02:51:25,690
I was like,
jesus,

3715
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:26,700
terrible.
Oh,

3716
02:51:26,700 --> 02:51:27,533
I couldn't do it.
Everything that white people like and 

3717
02:51:29,881 --> 02:51:32,430
they give fucking awards to like these 
white bomber movies.

3718
02:51:32,431 --> 02:51:34,350
I can't do it.
I can't watch the movie about.

3719
02:51:34,351 --> 02:51:36,870
The guy was fucking aids.
I can't watch the movie about lincoln.

3720
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:38,760
I can't.
What about musicals?

3721
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:42,390
Get the fuck.
Fuck your mother.

3722
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:48,300
Fuck your life with a musical.
Can I tell you that the one I don't want

3723
02:51:48,301 --> 02:51:50,400
to see the most and I'm in a lot of hate
over.

3724
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:51,380
Yes.
Yes,

3725
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:53,400
because I found out it was wrapped.
Did you know that?

3726
02:51:53,401 --> 02:51:54,960
It's fucking rap.
What do you mean?

3727
02:51:54,961 --> 02:51:58,710
It's the music of hamilton.
It's rap music,

3728
02:51:58,711 --> 02:52:01,110
so it's not even traditional.
Listen to jim.

3729
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:03,570
Wait a minute.
Doing rap music.

3730
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:05,980
I can't do this.

3731
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,760
No,
I refused to see that shit.

3732
02:52:08,761 --> 02:52:09,594
I was in manhattan last weekend and we 
were passing By broadway and all these 

3733
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:16,810
old dead white people are stumbling out 
of this theater.

3734
02:52:16,811 --> 02:52:18,910
Pretending they just enjoyed what 
nonsense.

3735
02:52:18,911 --> 02:52:23,440
They just saw.
Pretty woman.

3736
02:52:23,441 --> 02:52:27,910
The musical fucking rubes are staring so
good.

3737
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:31,690
the way she saying about sucking his 
dick when she was a prostitute,

3738
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:34,030
he was a rich guy.
HamilTon.

3739
02:52:34,300 --> 02:52:36,180
The story of tonight,
just a song playing.

3740
02:52:36,380 --> 02:52:39,470
I play to play me some of it.
Give me some song.

3741
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:47,010
Is this white people or black people?
Both.

3742
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:49,210
Cultural appropriation.
That's what I think.

3743
02:52:49,280 --> 02:52:53,230
Microaggression.
Is this supposed to be good?

3744
02:52:59,460 --> 02:53:00,430
Okay.
Kill it.

3745
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:04,943
See just that hurt me.
I think they are a murderous assault 

3746
02:53:09,681 --> 02:53:11,740
near your attention span.
That's what I think.

3747
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:16,760
I've been to two musicals,
which now I've been to more.

3748
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:19,060
I've been to more because I went to 
where the book of mormon,

3749
02:53:19,061 --> 02:53:21,970
which is I guess technically a musical,
but awesome.

3750
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:24,060
Like this book of mormon.
It's hilarious.

3751
02:53:24,180 --> 02:53:28,240
The south park guYs,
it's really,

3752
02:53:28,241 --> 02:53:29,320
really,
really funny,

3753
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:31,090
but that doesn't count.
Doesn't count.

3754
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:32,890
Yeah.
Yeah,

3755
02:53:33,010 --> 02:53:34,720
it's really good.
But uh,

3756
02:53:34,721 --> 02:53:38,260
I also went to see a chicago because a 
friend of mine was in it.

3757
02:53:38,350 --> 02:53:41,380
It was death,
it was death,

3758
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:43,840
it was death.
We all got together in the.

3759
02:53:43,841 --> 02:53:45,790
I'm in the fucking,
like,

3760
02:53:45,791 --> 02:53:47,340
there was the,
you know,

3761
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:49,990
the,
the intermission and we all got to drink

3762
02:53:49,991 --> 02:53:52,500
during the intermission and I got three 
drinks during the intermission.

3763
02:53:52,501 --> 02:53:54,670
I was just throwing them down and I was 
like,

3764
02:53:54,671 --> 02:53:57,130
I can't believe I have to sit through 
more of this shit.

3765
02:53:57,390 --> 02:53:58,223
And I'm like,
I can't believe you guys are sitting 

3766
02:53:59,351 --> 02:54:00,820
here pretending that you like it.
I go,

3767
02:54:00,821 --> 02:54:03,400
fuck all of you.
And then they started laughing and break

3768
02:54:03,401 --> 02:54:04,810
it down because it was our friend.
I go,

3769
02:54:04,811 --> 02:54:06,130
she's great.
She's so talented.

3770
02:54:06,131 --> 02:54:08,230
I go,
this is death is death.

3771
02:54:08,231 --> 02:54:10,150
This is just a slow chip away.

3772
02:54:13,770 --> 02:54:18,070
The fucking worse dude.
I get people like it.

3773
02:54:18,071 --> 02:54:19,750
I get,
don't get mad at me if he like something

3774
02:54:19,751 --> 02:54:21,040
that I don't like.
Don't get mad.

3775
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:22,773
Don't get mad.
You allowed to like whatever you like 

3776
02:54:25,031 --> 02:54:29,020
and you're talking to a person who 
watches professional pool.

3777
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:31,660
I watch it on youtube.
I watch it.

3778
02:54:31,750 --> 02:54:33,910
I'll watch it live.
I'll go to see a match live.

3779
02:54:34,300 --> 02:54:35,140
I will.
Uh,

3780
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:35,770
I,
I,

3781
02:54:35,770 --> 02:54:37,660
you know,
I'm a fucking dummy.

3782
02:54:37,880 --> 02:54:38,713
Alright.
Don't,

3783
02:54:38,980 --> 02:54:41,200
don't listen to me.
I like dumber shit.

3784
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:45,040
But if you have a world championship 
pool matches right next to a musical.

3785
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:48,140
Yeah,
I did musicals.

3786
02:54:48,970 --> 02:54:51,910
Let's talk the worst musicals.
I don't know the worst.

3787
02:54:51,911 --> 02:54:53,420
I've only seen three.
I saw cats.

3788
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:55,793
Anything.
Andrew lloyd weber school that's cats 

3789
02:54:58,400 --> 02:54:58,991
did.
Oh,

3790
02:54:58,991 --> 02:55:00,340
what did he,
how did he do that?

3791
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:01,203
How dId he sneak that in?
An entertaining piece of shit through 

3792
02:55:03,320 --> 02:55:04,280
peoples faces

3793
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:07,370
for years,
for years and years and years.

3794
02:55:07,371 --> 02:55:12,371
People have for years,
for years.

3795
02:55:14,410 --> 02:55:16,190
I know.
I saw it in the eighties as a kid.

3796
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:19,550
I saw it when I was 19 years old.
A girl that I was dating.

3797
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:22,700
Yes.
She took me to see it like we were going

3798
02:55:22,701 --> 02:55:23,534
to pretend we were both 19.
We're going to pretend we're grownups 

3799
02:55:26,210 --> 02:55:29,240
who went to see a musical and then what?
When it was halfway over,

3800
02:55:29,440 --> 02:55:31,640
I couldn't believe that it was only 
halfway over.

3801
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:33,950
I was like,
you mean this is halfway done?

3802
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:35,470
This is the intermission.
Just like,

3803
02:55:35,480 --> 02:55:36,261
Yes,
the intermission.

3804
02:55:36,261 --> 02:55:37,850
I go,
do you want to get the fuck out of here?

3805
02:55:37,851 --> 02:55:38,301
She goes,
yeah,

3806
02:55:38,301 --> 02:55:39,710
I guess we can.
I was like,

3807
02:55:39,790 --> 02:55:40,640
you like this?
She goes,

3808
02:55:40,641 --> 02:55:42,110
no.
I was hoping it was going to get better.

3809
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:43,580
I go,
how can we get better though?

3810
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,800
How could it get better?
Like what are they going to do?

3811
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,180
Is it all of a sudden going to be a 
movie?

3812
02:55:48,290 --> 02:55:49,123
We're going to see aliens and fucking 
laser beams and you got to stay tuned 

3813
02:55:52,131 --> 02:55:56,210
because then they go into this spaceship
and they go to the grand cat in the sky,

3814
02:55:56,211 --> 02:55:59,780
the grand wizard of the cats,
but they don't talk,

3815
02:55:59,781 --> 02:56:00,850
right?
Yeah.

3816
02:56:00,860 --> 02:56:03,020
No,
the grand wizard comes down and talks.

3817
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:05,660
oh,
I forget what the good part.

3818
02:56:06,590 --> 02:56:07,820
I think he talks.
He's like,

3819
02:56:07,821 --> 02:56:08,654
ma'am ma'am,
I don't even remember if they sing in 

3820
02:56:15,471 --> 02:56:17,330
words,
but I remember them crawling around.

3821
02:56:17,331 --> 02:56:20,000
I was like,
what in the fuck is this?

3822
02:56:20,990 --> 02:56:25,990
Oh,
that's the thing I can access as a,

3823
02:56:26,511 --> 02:56:30,480
as an entertainer that like dorky 
theatery the feet.

3824
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:31,570
Like,
yes,

3825
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:36,580
the theater thing would really be into 
that.

3826
02:56:37,650 --> 02:56:39,260
Great.
He's so sMart.

3827
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:40,940
He's very smart.
God dammit.

3828
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:41,930
Okay.
What other.

3829
02:56:41,930 --> 02:56:43,400
Okay.
There's more Andrew Lloyd webber's.

3830
02:56:43,401 --> 02:56:47,180
There's like the roller skating one.
Jesus christ superstar.

3831
02:56:47,620 --> 02:56:52,620
That one's not terrible.
Is that jesus christ superstar where you

3832
02:56:56,001 --> 02:56:59,210
are up here,
but I don't know tv last year too.

3833
02:56:59,211 --> 02:57:04,211
And john legend one for.
Wow,

3834
02:57:04,890 --> 02:57:06,000
you got.
Okay.

3835
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:10,730
There's a thing that's gross awards for 
art.

3836
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:12,740
I agree.
Yeah,

3837
02:57:12,770 --> 02:57:13,603
it's a trick.
It's just a dirty trick to pump up 

3838
02:57:16,161 --> 02:57:18,680
whatever fucking thing it is.
Whatever movie,

3839
02:57:18,681 --> 02:57:20,360
whatever television show.

3840
02:57:20,520 --> 02:57:21,353
Yes.
And I don't understand why people want 

3841
02:57:22,801 --> 02:57:23,634
to watch these things.
I think it will be a nightmare to go to 

3842
02:57:26,101 --> 02:57:27,410
one.
Um,

3843
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:28,170
it,
you know,

3844
02:57:28,170 --> 02:57:29,003
god,
I hope my husband winds one if he ever 

3845
02:57:30,151 --> 02:57:33,690
wants to for acting or whatever and it 
gives a fuck.

3846
02:57:33,900 --> 02:57:34,940
Yeah.
I don't think he's here,

3847
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:38,070
but uh,
I would hate to have to sit through that

3848
02:57:38,071 --> 02:57:38,904
horse shit for six,
seven hours in a gown and clapping for 

3849
02:57:42,811 --> 02:57:43,680
nonsense.

3850
02:57:44,390 --> 02:57:46,390
Gone to the emmy's.
I went to the emmy's.

3851
02:57:46,391 --> 02:57:47,620
Uh,
right after,

3852
02:57:47,670 --> 02:57:48,503
uh,
phil hartman died because he was up for 

3853
02:57:50,231 --> 02:57:52,680
an emmy.
So we all wenT and he,

3854
02:57:52,681 --> 02:57:53,514
he didn't win and when he didn't win,
the guy from frasier one and we didn't 

3855
02:57:56,801 --> 02:57:58,750
win.
Dave foley turns to me and goes,

3856
02:57:58,940 --> 02:58:00,310
the flux you have to do to win,

3857
02:58:00,570 --> 02:58:05,190
right?
Was the last shot.

3858
02:58:05,191 --> 02:58:08,720
He's dead still didn't give it to him.
Well,

3859
02:58:08,730 --> 02:58:13,270
because what group of cons decides who 
wins the condo board.

3860
02:58:13,730 --> 02:58:18,730
We were looking for a gay guy in The 
outrage olympics.

3861
02:58:19,210 --> 02:58:22,920
That's like,
you got serious fucking score.

3862
02:58:23,230 --> 02:58:28,050
You got like a built in score.
Yeah.

3863
02:58:29,070 --> 02:58:32,430
If a guy plays a gay guy that's,
you have built in score like milk.

3864
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,110
Yeah.
I liked that movie.

3865
02:58:34,710 --> 02:58:36,450
I liked it.
Could Win an oscar.

3866
02:58:36,510 --> 02:58:37,260
Did it?
Went in Russia?

3867
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:38,940
I don't fucking know should win an 
oscar.

3868
02:58:38,941 --> 02:58:40,230
He is playing a gay guy,
you know,

3869
02:58:41,080 --> 02:58:43,890
you know when you never went in Austria,
play a slow guy.

3870
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:50,970
He can't even do it anymore.
I get mad that you didn't hire an actual

3871
02:58:50,971 --> 02:58:53,630
slow guy,
right?

3872
02:58:54,930 --> 02:58:58,980
Don't you think?
Thousand percent.

3873
02:58:59,460 --> 02:59:00,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

3874
02:59:00,810 --> 02:59:01,643
well there was the problem with jeffrey 
tambor when he was on that training 

3875
02:59:04,330 --> 02:59:05,163
show,
the problem was he wasn't an actual 

3876
02:59:07,381 --> 02:59:12,381
transgender person and they got mad at 
him right towards what the fuck is this?

3877
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:19,000
That's what they were making fun of.
And simple.

3878
02:59:19,170 --> 02:59:23,930
Oh,
I thought it was a type of award award.

3879
02:59:25,290 --> 02:59:27,510
He got a nominee for the best actor.
Then I'm like,

3880
02:59:27,511 --> 02:59:28,410
no,
bro.

3881
02:59:29,090 --> 02:59:32,010
When I thought he didn't know his 
nominee.

3882
02:59:32,011 --> 02:59:36,260
I know,
but I thought maybe you could in 2000,

3883
02:59:36,290 --> 02:59:38,220
2002,
you could.

3884
02:59:38,310 --> 02:59:40,740
You could play someone who the fuck he 
want back then.

3885
02:59:41,010 --> 02:59:41,843
Yeah.
Well you were saying that they got mad 

3886
02:59:43,081 --> 02:59:45,280
at the rock because he played an amputee
in a movie.

3887
02:59:45,281 --> 02:59:47,550
It's not really an api to scraper.

3888
02:59:47,550 --> 02:59:48,460
Yeah.
Stop.

3889
02:59:48,970 --> 02:59:50,460
Stop.
He just,

3890
02:59:50,890 --> 02:59:53,550
they love being outraged,
but they do.

3891
02:59:53,551 --> 02:59:54,630
Yes.
Love it.

3892
02:59:54,810 --> 02:59:55,643
Yes,
they do because they're given a voice 

3893
02:59:57,211 --> 03:00:00,660
now platform on social media and people 
pay attention to it.

3894
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:01,673
That's the biggest problem.
That's actually the problem to paying 

3895
03:00:04,681 --> 03:00:08,880
attention to it operations and what has 
helped pay attention.

3896
03:00:09,330 --> 03:00:10,163
Yes.
Which is why podcasts are so great 

3897
03:00:13,190 --> 03:00:16,230
because you could do whatever the fuck 
you want and you don't have a boss.

3898
03:00:16,370 --> 03:00:19,260
He'll everybody telling me you to.
You can never have the try it out.

3899
03:00:19,261 --> 03:00:21,200
Guy.
There he is trying.

3900
03:00:21,310 --> 03:00:23,430
Guy would never fly guy.
You could never.

3901
03:00:23,431 --> 03:00:25,290
If you had a radio show and he tried to 
play that,

3902
03:00:25,291 --> 03:00:26,550
they'd pull you aside and go,
tom,

3903
03:00:26,850 --> 03:00:29,670
christina,
this is not what we do here at wk.

3904
03:00:29,671 --> 03:00:34,671
Rip and yeah,
I love that.

3905
03:00:36,230 --> 03:00:37,530
Yeah,
that was good.

3906
03:00:37,531 --> 03:00:38,364
Show.
Tell me what your time on a sitcom 

3907
03:00:40,201 --> 03:00:41,910
please.
Um,

3908
03:00:42,150 --> 03:00:42,931
it was,
uh,

3909
03:00:42,931 --> 03:00:46,080
it was good because it was,
it was a job,

3910
03:00:46,110 --> 03:00:50,040
it was money and I never worked before 
and never acted before.

3911
03:00:50,130 --> 03:00:52,650
It was fascinating.
Did you ever take a class or anything?

3912
03:00:52,830 --> 03:00:55,980
I took a couple of classes when I got a 
development deal,

3913
03:00:56,050 --> 03:00:56,883
I had to take some acting classes and I 
had a mean acting ladY that was trying 

3914
03:00:59,951 --> 03:01:00,010
to

3915
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,843
be my mom.
If I ever got a mom and she was like 

3916
03:01:02,890 --> 03:01:06,340
telling me that I was going to have her 
cast as my mom if there was.

3917
03:01:06,341 --> 03:01:06,901
I wAs like,
yeah,

3918
03:01:06,901 --> 03:01:07,734
yeah,
yeah,

3919
03:01:07,810 --> 03:01:11,200
the fuck she.
She one thing she said to me once,

3920
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:13,180
she's like trying to mind,
fuck me.

3921
03:01:13,181 --> 03:01:14,890
It was really weird.
She was like,

3922
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:16,490
I'm worried.
I'm worried.

3923
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:17,920
You going to go out there and you're 
going to fail.

3924
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:19,900
I go,
why are you worried about that?

3925
03:01:20,470 --> 03:01:21,010
Like,
what do you,

3926
03:01:21,010 --> 03:01:22,720
what are you talking about?
She's like,

3927
03:01:22,721 --> 03:01:25,750
because you don't seem invested in this 
material.

3928
03:01:25,751 --> 03:01:26,850
I go,
this,

3929
03:01:26,851 --> 03:01:27,684
this,
this sitcom that never went because it 

3930
03:01:29,681 --> 03:01:33,190
fucking sucks that we're reading now and
it's not that I'm not invested.

3931
03:01:33,191 --> 03:01:34,024
It's just terrible.
If you want me to pretend that it's 

3932
03:01:35,921 --> 03:01:38,050
good,
you want me to act it up like it's good.

3933
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:38,530
I like what?

3934
03:01:38,530 --> 03:01:40,120
What kind of conversation we have in 
here,

3935
03:01:40,690 --> 03:01:41,231
and she was like,
well,

3936
03:01:41,231 --> 03:01:42,730
you might get a script like this.
I go,

3937
03:01:42,731 --> 03:01:43,511
well,
let's hope.

3938
03:01:43,511 --> 03:01:46,120
I don't know either way.
I'm a fucking comedian.

3939
03:01:46,121 --> 03:01:47,350
Okay,
I'm doing this for money.

3940
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:49,180
They they.
They offered me some money.

3941
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:52,720
I to tell him that drives him crazy when
they find out that you're a comedian,

3942
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:54,910
you don't even give a shit about acting.
I'm like,

3943
03:01:54,911 --> 03:01:55,744
yeah,
they're going to give me some acting 

3944
03:01:56,111 --> 03:01:57,400
gigs.
I'll take it.

3945
03:01:58,240 --> 03:01:59,110
And she's like,
when she would.

3946
03:01:59,560 --> 03:02:02,170
it was real weird man.
Like really weird.

3947
03:02:02,230 --> 03:02:04,720
The acting world,
the coaching world is so weird,

3948
03:02:04,721 --> 03:02:07,600
but it's weird because the people that 
are acting coaches,

3949
03:02:07,690 --> 03:02:11,650
almost all of them are failed actors.
They just didn't make it.

3950
03:02:11,740 --> 03:02:12,640
Otherwise.
If they made it,

3951
03:02:12,641 --> 03:02:14,710
they wouldn't be teaching.
They'd be out there doing it.

3952
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:16,750
They don't want to teach it for the most
part.

3953
03:02:16,751 --> 03:02:21,490
Some of them do,
but so I did a few liberal was gross.

3954
03:02:21,550 --> 03:02:22,960
As soon as I didn't have to do it 
anymore,

3955
03:02:22,961 --> 03:02:23,794
I stopped doing it.

3956
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:26,653
Oh yeah.
The classes are terrible and I did a 

3957
03:02:27,380 --> 03:02:31,540
terrible sitcom for six episodes called 
hardball on fox.

3958
03:02:31,541 --> 03:02:32,374
It was a baseball sitcom that got 
canceled and then I got a development 

3959
03:02:35,501 --> 03:02:38,530
deal and then I got cast on news radio.
Next thing you know,

3960
03:02:39,460 --> 03:02:42,100
it's so crazy.
I had gone on to auditions ever.

3961
03:02:42,580 --> 03:02:43,413
One was for the hardball show,
one or news radio was the only two 

3962
03:02:45,911 --> 03:02:48,440
auditions had ever been on for sitcoms.
Yeah,

3963
03:02:49,440 --> 03:02:50,960
it was bizarre.
Yeah.

3964
03:02:52,290 --> 03:02:54,430
I mean you're working with what andy 
deck was on that show.

3965
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,050
Yeah.
Candy,

3966
03:02:56,051 --> 03:02:58,000
alexander.
Stephen root,

3967
03:02:58,030 --> 03:02:59,670
dave foley.
More tiernan.

3968
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:01,900
Phil hartman.
Yeah.

3969
03:03:01,930 --> 03:03:02,763
No,
it was awesome.

3970
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:07,860
The cast was amazing.
That was like in terms of sitcoms,

3971
03:03:08,891 --> 03:03:12,190
it was like a best case scenario for a 
sitcom.

3972
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,870
Like in terms of like the,
the,

3973
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:18,040
the writing in terms of like the 
situation where you're.

3974
03:03:18,410 --> 03:03:20,350
I mean it was on there with phil 
hartman,

3975
03:03:20,380 --> 03:03:21,213
you know,
I was like 26 years old and I'm 27 

3976
03:03:23,561 --> 03:03:24,394
maybe,
and I'm working with phil hartman and 

3977
03:03:25,451 --> 03:03:27,070
I'm like,
I can't believe I'm next to this guy.

3978
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:28,433
Like I'm seeing you on tv and movies and
all the sudden we're in the same room 

3979
03:03:30,611 --> 03:03:34,060
and we're doing a scene together so this
is so and then become his friend.

3980
03:03:34,061 --> 03:03:37,600
It was so strange.
That is surreal.

3981
03:03:37,690 --> 03:03:42,280
It was so surreal for someone with zero 
intent on ever acting.

3982
03:03:42,610 --> 03:03:45,500
Then all of a sudden I'm acting,
you know,

3983
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:46,960
and I'm like,
okay.

3984
03:03:47,170 --> 03:03:50,740
I guess some acting like that was.
That was part of it though,

3985
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:51,903
was one of the reasons why I was 
successful at auditions and stuff like 

3986
03:03:54,011 --> 03:03:56,560
that because I'd never planned on being 
an actor.

3987
03:03:56,990 --> 03:03:58,160
Didn't care

3988
03:03:58,250 --> 03:04:01,070
as much.
My world doesn't everything.

3989
03:04:01,071 --> 03:04:02,960
To me it was like,
well this would be cool.

3990
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,310
Similar,
make some money here.

3991
03:04:04,700 --> 03:04:06,020
You know,
that was the whole thing.

3992
03:04:06,021 --> 03:04:07,550
It's like I didn't want to worry about 
bills.

3993
03:04:07,551 --> 03:04:09,140
Like what made more money doing it,
how much,

3994
03:04:09,230 --> 03:04:12,020
how much can I make?
And I would literally ask like,

3995
03:04:12,021 --> 03:04:14,210
whenever something would come up,
how much does this pay?

3996
03:04:14,690 --> 03:04:15,523
How much?
How much can I get if I do this thing 

3997
03:04:16,910 --> 03:04:20,060
that's always thinking.
Meanwhile was stand up,

3998
03:04:20,061 --> 03:04:21,650
I'm sure you were doing what,
you know,

3999
03:04:21,740 --> 03:04:26,300
$300 a weeks for how many years just to 
just to do it just to,

4000
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:27,193
well yeah,
but you get worried about money coming 

4001
03:04:30,651 --> 03:04:31,041
in,
right?

4002
03:04:31,041 --> 03:04:31,874
Because if you don't get booked for a 
couple of weeks you don't have any 

4003
03:04:33,321 --> 03:04:35,390
money.
So I didn'T save any money.

4004
03:04:35,391 --> 03:04:37,580
I had like a thousand dollars in the 
bank or something and I'm like,

4005
03:04:37,581 --> 03:04:38,570
gosh,
you know,

4006
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:40,850
so if anything went wrong I was fucked.

4007
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:41,863
So coming ouT here and doing sitcoms.
But the thing about sitcoms is it's 

4008
03:04:46,401 --> 03:04:47,234
really hard in the beginning,
like the early days of news radio were 

4009
03:04:50,601 --> 03:04:53,190
hard long as ours we,
we,

4010
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:56,480
it was hard trying to figure out the 
direction of the show.

4011
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:59,330
There was a lot of rewrites.
There was a lot of work.

4012
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:02,090
It was a lot,
a lot of long days on the set.

4013
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:05,390
But then once it got going like season 
three,

4014
03:05:05,391 --> 03:05:06,370
four,
five,

4015
03:05:06,420 --> 03:05:07,520
boy,
it was easy.

4016
03:05:07,760 --> 03:05:09,890
Really easy.
Like You'd come in,

4017
03:05:10,300 --> 03:05:12,530
we rehearsed for a couple of hours,
go home.

4018
03:05:12,710 --> 03:05:14,720
We were down two,
sometimes three days a week,

4019
03:05:15,890 --> 03:05:19,490
one day a week.
Have a table read one day blocking,

4020
03:05:19,491 --> 03:05:21,320
one day shooting.
Bam.

4021
03:05:21,380 --> 03:05:22,700
Yeah,
we did that a few times.

4022
03:05:22,970 --> 03:05:24,070
Fantastic.
Yeah.

4023
03:05:24,080 --> 03:05:25,220
Three,
four days.

4024
03:05:25,250 --> 03:05:29,510
Four days was common.
Very rarely will we do five whole days.

4025
03:05:29,660 --> 03:05:31,670
That's fucking great.
Fear factor.

4026
03:05:31,671 --> 03:05:33,320
What was the work schedule like for 
that?

4027
03:05:33,321 --> 03:05:34,820
One?
Three days a week,

4028
03:05:34,821 --> 03:05:39,500
but constant.
We did one year,

4029
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:42,950
tHirty four episodes I think.
Maybe 36.

4030
03:05:43,550 --> 03:05:45,320
Oh,
we just shitted out.

4031
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:48,770
Well,
America was eating.

4032
03:05:48,771 --> 03:05:52,850
We're shitting shitting on that plate,
which they should though,

4033
03:05:52,851 --> 03:05:57,770
because that show was so clean.
She set up the game.

4034
03:05:57,860 --> 03:06:02,090
It was very lazy.
It was very easy to do initially,

4035
03:06:02,210 --> 03:06:03,043
but then the second version of it,
when it came back in 2011 or something 

4036
03:06:06,561 --> 03:06:07,394
like that,
that burden was a real problem because 

4037
03:06:09,861 --> 03:06:11,910
that version that we're ramping it up 
there.

4038
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:14,930
The stents were way more difficult.
Way more dangerous.

4039
03:06:14,931 --> 03:06:17,060
It was.
I was freaking out,

4040
03:06:17,210 --> 03:06:19,640
but a couple of them I was like,
this is getting rough.

4041
03:06:19,970 --> 03:06:23,750
Like bungee jumps off a fucking 
helicopters in the middle of a canyon.

4042
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:27,170
You launching people on these bungee 
jumps.

4043
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:31,350
It Was some crazy shit.
You know,

4044
03:06:31,730 --> 03:06:35,840
eating stuff always got to me know 
people eating the bugs.

4045
03:06:35,930 --> 03:06:39,140
I was always like,
how much money did you win on that show?

4046
03:06:39,141 --> 03:06:40,940
I can't remember.
You could win.

4047
03:06:40,970 --> 03:06:44,060
Well there was a couple of shows where 
people want a million dollars,

4048
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:47,810
but even when you win a million dollars,
you don't really want a million dollars.

4049
03:06:47,900 --> 03:06:50,710
You win a million dollars for The 
government comes in,

4050
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:52,260
steals everything,
right?

4051
03:06:52,480 --> 03:06:53,400
Yeah.
Plus it.

4052
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:55,890
Is there something for winning and on a 
game show,

4053
03:06:56,430 --> 03:06:59,520
like do you have some more taken out 
because it's a winning or something.

4054
03:06:59,610 --> 03:07:04,140
I don't know.
It's a lot like if someone won $50,000,

4055
03:07:04,141 --> 03:07:07,080
which was a normal week,
that would really take home 34.

4056
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:08,963
The government doesn't eat any animal.
Dick's jump off any buildings and they 

4057
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:17,610
just steal 16 grand for you animal.
I remember the animal decks now.

4058
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:19,550
That was my favorite.
The we,

4059
03:07:19,640 --> 03:07:23,490
we did that in griffith Park.
Camped out.

4060
03:07:24,090 --> 03:07:28,380
Served up animal dicks.
Fucking crazy.

4061
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:29,323
What a crazy show.
Thinking back the liability on that 

4062
03:07:31,321 --> 03:07:32,154
fucking thing.
What's really crazy is it all happened 

4063
03:07:33,931 --> 03:07:36,120
post september 11,
like right afterwards.

4064
03:07:36,450 --> 03:07:41,450
That's when it aired and um,
it was a preposterous show like from the

4065
03:07:41,701 --> 03:07:42,534
jump and I always thought it was going 
to be canceled and it was a giant hit 

4066
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:49,860
was a giant hit and be able to like 
immediately it was a hit.

4067
03:07:50,220 --> 03:07:51,600
I was like,
this is so stupid.

4068
03:07:51,601 --> 03:07:56,601
The show is so stupid and the reason why
it's awesome I got the gig was because I

4069
03:07:58,411 --> 03:07:59,244
made fun of it.
Like everybody else was trying to like 

4070
03:08:00,851 --> 03:08:02,700
be spooky.
Like they're like,

4071
03:08:02,701 --> 03:08:05,340
you know,
the fear is fear a factor for you.

4072
03:08:05,590 --> 03:08:08,040
And I came into this meeting,
I was high as fuck.

4073
03:08:08,550 --> 03:08:11,880
I came into this meeting and they were 
telling me what they wanted to do.

4074
03:08:11,910 --> 03:08:16,380
One of the casting directors got jeff 
from nbc hooked up the meeting.

4075
03:08:16,660 --> 03:08:18,900
He thought it would be a good,
good fit for it because it was,

4076
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:19,893
you know,
I've just been on nbc for news radio 

4077
03:08:21,570 --> 03:08:22,890
that I came into this meeting.
I was like,

4078
03:08:22,891 --> 03:08:24,510
what are you going to do?
I'm like,

4079
03:08:24,511 --> 03:08:26,640
you're going to sic dogs on people.
I'm like,

4080
03:08:26,641 --> 03:08:28,430
this is like,
I'm like,

4081
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:30,740
this is like a bit in an act.

4082
03:08:30,750 --> 03:08:31,583
And he's like,
like a bit of like where it goes 

4083
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:34,553
terribly wrong.
You going to make people eat animal 

4084
03:08:36,151 --> 03:08:40,050
dick's just sick dogs on people and get 
to throw people off buildings.

4085
03:08:40,230 --> 03:08:41,063
I'm like,
this is.

4086
03:08:41,250 --> 03:08:46,180
This is like the running man.
It was before here.

4087
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:48,210
Idiocracy was even a movie.
I was like,

4088
03:08:48,211 --> 03:08:49,044
this is.
This is the most insane idea for 

4089
03:08:51,781 --> 03:08:52,614
television show I've ever heard.
This is going to be cancelled 

4090
03:08:54,331 --> 03:08:56,800
immediately and I'm going to have all 
this material about.

4091
03:08:56,801 --> 03:08:58,200
Remember when I used to host fear 
factor,

4092
03:08:58,550 --> 03:09:01,620
meanwhile a hundred and 60 fucking 
episodes later,

4093
03:09:01,800 --> 03:09:06,030
we did 148 episodes and then we did 
another.

4094
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:08,483
I think we did six or seven but only six
aired because one of them was the one 

4095
03:09:13,171 --> 03:09:16,660
when they had a drink come.
Yeah,

4096
03:09:17,320 --> 03:09:21,210
a jug of come.
Who made it a donkey?

4097
03:09:21,890 --> 03:09:22,530
Donkey.
Yeah.

4098
03:09:22,530 --> 03:09:26,700
My mom took me a year to fill up 
everyone's stein.

4099
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:27,753
Are you fucking kidding me?
Donkey come cattle prod up a donkey's 

4100
03:09:32,231 --> 03:09:36,480
ass hole.
And they would come like they'd zap,

4101
03:09:36,990 --> 03:09:39,810
zap them in the old testes and they just
shoot buckets.

4102
03:09:40,530 --> 03:09:42,240
Yeah.
And they played horseshoes.

4103
03:09:42,540 --> 03:09:43,373
So they played horseshoes and you could 
never win like even if you made like a 

4104
03:09:45,931 --> 03:09:49,410
ringer and you like made the,
you would have to drink one ounce,

4105
03:09:50,670 --> 03:09:53,950
but if you fucked up and we were 
drinking like 11,

4106
03:09:53,951 --> 03:09:54,370
12

4107
03:09:54,370 --> 03:09:57,300
ounces.
he was a jugs jugs.

4108
03:09:58,360 --> 03:10:00,280
Yeah.
So what happened was,

4109
03:10:00,400 --> 03:10:01,530
I remember,
yeah,

4110
03:10:01,560 --> 03:10:03,860
I remember this.
What happened was um,

4111
03:10:04,440 --> 03:10:07,710
the uh,
tmz folks got ahold of the fucking.

4112
03:10:08,010 --> 03:10:08,843
They got ahold of the pictures of these 
people drink and come early and then it 

4113
03:10:12,661 --> 03:10:16,260
became this giant fear that like,
people like what?

4114
03:10:16,410 --> 03:10:18,330
Like there's no way.
This is real.

4115
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:19,650
Like this is a Joke,
right?

4116
03:10:19,700 --> 03:10:21,590
No.
It turns out they really can't make them

4117
03:10:21,591 --> 03:10:22,424
drink.
Come,

4118
03:10:24,330 --> 03:10:26,620
chug down.
Yeah.

4119
03:10:26,700 --> 03:10:27,533
I encouraged this girls.
one of them had a drink piss and the 

4120
03:10:30,051 --> 03:10:32,990
other one had a drink come.
This is crap.

4121
03:10:34,150 --> 03:10:34,983
It was in st louis.
These guys are drinking coffee or 

4122
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:38,930
drinking a jug.
Oh come.

4123
03:10:40,830 --> 03:10:41,663
And he just choked it down.
His brother is right next to his twin 

4124
03:10:43,431 --> 03:10:47,210
brother helping him choke down,
come how much money and not enough.

4125
03:10:47,211 --> 03:10:48,980
Thirty four grand,
whatever they want.

4126
03:10:49,640 --> 03:10:50,473
Even if they want a billion dollars,
if warren buffett's sucks and then look 

4127
03:10:53,670 --> 03:10:56,340
immediately you get to throw up and 
these poor girls would jump in.

4128
03:10:56,750 --> 03:11:00,320
Here's this interesting girls chose to 
come over the urine.

4129
03:11:00,850 --> 03:11:01,490
I mean,
yeah,

4130
03:11:01,490 --> 03:11:05,540
we're come drinkers.
You learn to do the shit when you're 15.

4131
03:11:05,541 --> 03:11:06,374
Man,
she's been training her whole life for 

4132
03:11:07,371 --> 03:11:11,000
this moment.
It's so hard,

4133
03:11:11,540 --> 03:11:13,580
so hard to imagine that.
That was real show.

4134
03:11:14,210 --> 03:11:18,170
I know looking back now,
but at the time everybody watched this.

4135
03:11:18,171 --> 03:11:19,310
Every.
It was normal.

4136
03:11:19,850 --> 03:11:21,750
Well,
this was the one that killed it.

4137
03:11:22,170 --> 03:11:25,110
That episode killed it and now ludicrous
took it over.

4138
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:27,070
Alluded.
Damn.

4139
03:11:27,390 --> 03:11:29,930
But ludicrous is doing like a like,
whoa,

4140
03:11:29,990 --> 03:11:30,823
woo.
Is it fear factor if you leave your 

4141
03:11:32,031 --> 03:11:34,370
house without your phone like.
Right?

4142
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:35,930
Like what are the.
What do they do?

4143
03:11:36,110 --> 03:11:37,910
They don't do anything.
Nothing scary.

4144
03:11:37,930 --> 03:11:41,870
Is it still on there doing season two 
now?

4145
03:11:42,290 --> 03:11:43,123
There's definitely no.
I figured something would be updated 

4146
03:11:45,490 --> 03:11:46,610
recently.
Maybe it was a hit.

4147
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:47,473
Maybe.
I don't know.

4148
03:11:48,420 --> 03:11:53,420
Lulu they came to me though before this.
I'm like,

4149
03:11:56,021 --> 03:11:57,730
bitch,
there's not enough money.

4150
03:11:57,820 --> 03:12:00,460
You don't have enough money to go.
You wouldn't ever a hosted again.

4151
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:03,190
It's over.
It's over.

4152
03:12:03,191 --> 03:12:07,300
I did it.
I'm so not interested,

4153
03:12:08,350 --> 03:12:10,060
but I'm glad I did do it.
It was,

4154
03:12:10,120 --> 03:12:10,953
it was great for the time.
I mean that was a good memory thing and 

4155
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:16,420
it's good.
It was good because it was money.

4156
03:12:16,630 --> 03:12:17,463
That's what it was good.
It was good because I didn't have to 

4157
03:12:18,701 --> 03:12:19,534
worry about money.
And then when you have to worry about 

4158
03:12:20,921 --> 03:12:21,754
money,
like you don't worry about your choices 

4159
03:12:23,260 --> 03:12:25,470
comedically,
like I didn't worry like,

4160
03:12:25,540 --> 03:12:27,130
oh,
if I say something then they're going to

4161
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:31,000
cancel me or fire me from the show and 
then I can't do it anymore.

4162
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:33,310
IT didn't.
That wasn't,

4163
03:12:33,910 --> 03:12:36,430
that wasn't my concern at all.
My concern was like,

4164
03:12:36,431 --> 03:12:37,264
okay,
now I have enough money so I don't have 

4165
03:12:38,831 --> 03:12:41,620
to worry about not having money and I 
already make money doing standup.

4166
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:44,480
So now I put some money away.
So now you're free.

4167
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:48,130
Now I can do whatever you can create 
whatever the fuck you want,

4168
03:12:48,310 --> 03:12:49,143
just just fRee to do standup and free do
it however I want and no worries about 

4169
03:12:53,991 --> 03:12:54,824
tonight.
Show sets or anY of that fucking 

4170
03:12:56,181 --> 03:12:58,340
nonsense.
So wait,

4171
03:12:58,341 --> 03:13:00,350
so that when you were doing,
excuse me,

4172
03:13:00,351 --> 03:13:01,184
fear factor,
was there a thing where you couldn't 

4173
03:13:02,361 --> 03:13:07,361
kind of deer stand up the way you wanted
to say before that?

4174
03:13:07,820 --> 03:13:08,653
Yeah,
and there was some concern with that to 

4175
03:13:10,740 --> 03:13:12,810
go there.
Talk to me once about drugs.

4176
03:13:12,820 --> 03:13:15,500
They talk too much about drugs.
LIke,

4177
03:13:15,530 --> 03:13:17,570
like one of the producers pulled me 
aside and it's like,

4178
03:13:17,571 --> 03:13:18,740
you know,
you're doing these interviews.

4179
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:19,940
We're talking about like,
these,

4180
03:13:19,970 --> 03:13:21,440
these are illegal drugs.
I go,

4181
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:22,850
yeah,
you should do them.

4182
03:13:23,440 --> 03:13:25,010
Should do dmt.
It's good for you.

4183
03:13:25,410 --> 03:13:26,243
A lot of people do.
They're also sacraments that have 

4184
03:13:29,091 --> 03:13:29,924
existed throughout history that people 
have been using religious ceremonies to 

4185
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:35,450
become one with the creator because you 
want to fire me,

4186
03:13:35,720 --> 03:13:36,740
fire me,
go,

4187
03:13:36,910 --> 03:13:38,420
go call mario lopez.
He's ready.

4188
03:13:39,830 --> 03:13:42,600
What a career.
That guy's hat on that stuff go.

4189
03:13:42,890 --> 03:13:43,970
Yeah,
he's great at it though.

4190
03:13:44,030 --> 03:13:44,863
How about adam corolla?
He could to take an over fear factor 

4191
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:50,690
problems like that.
But now look at your.

4192
03:13:50,750 --> 03:13:52,880
Your to,
to quote adam,

4193
03:13:52,881 --> 03:13:55,230
curl your pirate ship,
right?

4194
03:13:55,930 --> 03:13:58,940
Adam carolla calls it a pirate ship.
That podcasting,

4195
03:13:59,180 --> 03:14:00,920
is that what he calls it?
His podcast,

4196
03:14:00,921 --> 03:14:02,090
a pirate ship.
Pirate ship.

4197
03:14:02,091 --> 03:14:02,924
He's,
you're out in the middle of nowhere and 

4198
03:14:03,730 --> 03:14:05,180
doing your thing.
You got your signal.

4199
03:14:05,420 --> 03:14:07,370
Oh no one's regulating this shit.

4200
03:14:07,390 --> 03:14:08,930
Oh,
because it's like pirate radio?

4201
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:09,813
yeah.
Well he was one of the first ones to do 

4202
03:14:10,761 --> 03:14:11,594
it.
I mean I remember doing his show 

4203
03:14:12,561 --> 03:14:13,341
thinking,
wow,

4204
03:14:13,341 --> 03:14:14,174
this guy's got a setup because he had 
this place and he had like a booth and 

4205
03:14:17,931 --> 03:14:20,060
there was guys working behind the booth 
and you know,

4206
03:14:20,061 --> 03:14:23,860
you had a real ad copy and a desk.
I was like,

4207
03:14:23,870 --> 03:14:24,703
this looks so professional.
And he would do like ad reads just like 

4208
03:14:28,131 --> 03:14:30,830
a radio show.
Wow.

4209
03:14:30,950 --> 03:14:33,830
But then that's how tom and I would look
at you and be like,

4210
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:35,330
fuck,
you see joe set up.

4211
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:39,860
This guy's got like cameras and he's got
like a producer we had.

4212
03:14:39,870 --> 03:14:41,960
If I can do all that.
He does have that now.

4213
03:14:42,500 --> 03:14:45,160
Chairs and shit.
you got to get some ergonomic chairs.

4214
03:14:45,940 --> 03:14:46,773
Got those.

4215
03:14:49,030 --> 03:14:51,590
yeah.
Was a company fully that send it to us?

4216
03:14:51,591 --> 03:14:52,424
I think it's called fully.
These are the best ergonomic chairs by 

4217
03:14:54,921 --> 03:14:56,420
far.
I've tried every one of them.

4218
03:14:56,421 --> 03:14:58,820
This cup pisco,
these things are the shit.

4219
03:14:58,880 --> 03:15:00,590
They're so good.
They just,

4220
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:02,690
they never hurt your back.
When you sit in them.

4221
03:15:03,170 --> 03:15:04,003
There's something about the way they 
designed it where your posture is just 

4222
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:07,870
posture's good.
Good.

4223
03:15:07,900 --> 03:15:10,540
It's better when you're on camera 
because you're not hunched over,

4224
03:15:10,710 --> 03:15:13,910
Like slumped can't.
You can't slump in these things.

4225
03:15:15,290 --> 03:15:17,360
They figured it out.
I did do.

4226
03:15:17,570 --> 03:15:20,270
Fucking nailed it right jamie bro.
nailed it.

4227
03:15:20,480 --> 03:15:22,670
So your netflix special.
Yes sir.

4228
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:25,660
Probably talk about that before this.
That's what we're here for.

4229
03:15:25,661 --> 03:15:28,130
you.
You got your second netflix special.

4230
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:31,520
I did a half hour cause I was um,
I was building my,

4231
03:15:31,850 --> 03:15:34,190
my first hour is mother inferior.
It's on the service now.

4232
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,153
You can see it on netflix and I was 
building my second hour and I was 

4233
03:15:37,131 --> 03:15:42,131
talking about me to all the time and I 
found myself just obsessed with telling,

4234
03:15:42,620 --> 03:15:45,800
talking shit about all these 
motherfuckers who are getting,

4235
03:15:45,860 --> 03:15:48,470
you know,
whenever pulled left and right for me to

4236
03:15:48,770 --> 03:15:50,280
sound like by the time my next hour

4237
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:52,200
comes out it's all going to be 
irrelevant.

4238
03:15:52,201 --> 03:15:53,034
I just want to put it out there now,
so they offered me a half hour and it 

4239
03:15:55,251 --> 03:15:57,000
was five months pregnant or something 
like that.

4240
03:15:57,001 --> 03:16:00,780
So you only have a couple months to 
throw something together and that's it,

4241
03:16:00,781 --> 03:16:01,920
man.
I went to vegas.

4242
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:05,850
Pregnant is fuck.
It was like a hundred and 20 degrees.

4243
03:16:05,851 --> 03:16:10,851
Joey diaz in me in the desert with these
crazy fucks in fremont.

4244
03:16:12,030 --> 03:16:14,010
A lot of women are doing specials 
pregnant.

4245
03:16:14,730 --> 03:16:17,050
So it's a stupid question,
allie.

4246
03:16:17,080 --> 03:16:17,913
Yeah,
yeah,

4247
03:16:18,330 --> 03:16:19,200
yeah,
yeah.

4248
03:16:19,201 --> 03:16:20,034
I know.
I throw out a joke to allie in the 

4249
03:16:23,610 --> 03:16:25,120
beginning of the oge of all that she is 
pregnant.

4250
03:16:25,150 --> 03:16:25,983
She is.
do we really appreciate is the pregnant 

4251
03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:29,413
standup?
Because if you think about it before 

4252
03:16:30,091 --> 03:16:30,924
that nobody ever did a special where 
they were pregnant and now a bunch of 

4253
03:16:33,391 --> 03:16:34,800
chicks are doing it.
Well.

4254
03:16:34,801 --> 03:16:37,140
Yeah.
And I think what happened was we are all

4255
03:16:37,141 --> 03:16:37,974
of the age where we're more established 
in our careers and it's a time where 

4256
03:16:40,651 --> 03:16:41,484
you,
it's last call for all of us older 

4257
03:16:42,601 --> 03:16:44,250
bitches to have babies,
you know what I mean?

4258
03:16:44,250 --> 03:16:46,890
Like now's the time.
So yeah,

4259
03:16:46,891 --> 03:16:47,724
it all kind of the timing of it,
but it's also like there's something 

4260
03:16:49,951 --> 03:16:53,250
cool about filming it while you're 
actually pregnant.

4261
03:16:53,270 --> 03:16:54,110
Yeah,
yeah.

4262
03:16:54,660 --> 03:16:56,310
It's a.
Well,

4263
03:16:56,311 --> 03:16:57,144
right,
because the assumption is you should be 

4264
03:16:57,661 --> 03:17:00,160
laying at home eating bon bons and you 
know,

4265
03:17:00,300 --> 03:17:04,860
my second pregnancy I did polities up 
until about two weeks before I delivered

4266
03:17:04,861 --> 03:17:05,694
and I was eating well and really doing 
it right the second time because I 

4267
03:17:07,981 --> 03:17:10,830
fucked up my first pregnancy.
I was eating carl's jr twice a week,

4268
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:12,233
getting those extra onion rings,
eating in the parking lot and shit 

4269
03:17:15,750 --> 03:17:16,440
again.
Like,

4270
03:17:16,440 --> 03:17:18,960
oh my god,
I gained like 60 pounds 60.

4271
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:21,960
Yasmin.
I was real fucked up after that one.

4272
03:17:21,961 --> 03:17:23,790
So how long does it take you to lose 
that weight?

4273
03:17:24,180 --> 03:17:26,190
A year.
Took me a year because I didn't know how

4274
03:17:26,191 --> 03:17:27,024
to lose weight and I didn't know how to 
exercise until I found this woman I'm 

4275
03:17:29,911 --> 03:17:33,780
with now.
My trainer put me on the primal diet.

4276
03:17:34,090 --> 03:17:34,891
Uh,
but anyway.

4277
03:17:34,891 --> 03:17:35,724
Yeah.
So I talk a lot of shit about the me 

4278
03:17:36,241 --> 03:17:37,074
too.
I wanted to just get it out there and 

4279
03:17:39,201 --> 03:17:40,290
uh,
it's on netflix now.

4280
03:17:40,291 --> 03:17:42,370
I'm number six after Mr.
Diaz.

4281
03:17:45,140 --> 03:17:46,860
I'm just.
Yeah,

4282
03:17:46,870 --> 03:17:47,703
number six.
So it's cool though that you've got to 

4283
03:17:49,021 --> 03:17:50,850
out right now too.
So fun.

4284
03:17:51,480 --> 03:17:53,040
It's so special.
It's such a.

4285
03:17:53,610 --> 03:17:54,443
It's such a good time for standing up.
It's such a golden age and where I'm so 

4286
03:17:57,241 --> 03:17:59,570
excited to be where I am in my career 
to,

4287
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:00,433
to ride this wave,
to be at the comedy store now amongst 

4288
03:18:02,581 --> 03:18:05,640
legends amongst you and bert and you 
know,

4289
03:18:05,641 --> 03:18:06,474
my husband and all these great people.
It's very rare that a comedy couple has 

4290
03:18:11,940 --> 03:18:14,010
two people that are really good.
RIght?

4291
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:18,210
You guys are one of the very few things.
It's usually one that stands out.

4292
03:18:18,211 --> 03:18:19,044
One that's like,
what is she going to do when he 

4293
03:18:20,101 --> 03:18:25,101
divorced,
when we talk about that tom second wife,

4294
03:18:26,430 --> 03:18:27,263
but she going to be like,
what is she going to be going to be a 

4295
03:18:28,911 --> 03:18:32,760
dalmatian white sweeney fucking 20 years
old.

4296
03:18:32,780 --> 03:18:34,320
Not,
not a lot of ideas.

4297
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:36,450
Not very mouthy.
Not like me.

4298
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:37,920
Keep it shut.
Yeah,

4299
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:39,830
just carries water.
Yeah,

4300
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:41,070
dude,
she's fit.

4301
03:18:41,130 --> 03:18:44,490
It looks good to the gym.
She's gonna be a trainer.

4302
03:18:44,630 --> 03:18:47,370
Course can be trained or body.
Right,

4303
03:18:47,660 --> 03:18:48,493
right.

4304
03:18:52,180 --> 03:18:54,340
no bullshit.
You are one of my favorite comedians.

4305
03:18:54,760 --> 03:18:55,593
Stop it.
You're not saying that because I know 

4306
03:18:57,941 --> 03:18:58,774
you really are.
You're,

4307
03:18:58,830 --> 03:19:00,070
you're,
you're really good.

4308
03:19:00,850 --> 03:19:02,110
You're really good.
And it's,

4309
03:19:02,111 --> 03:19:03,040
it's,
it's,

4310
03:19:03,041 --> 03:19:03,874
uh,
it's very odd that two really good 

4311
03:19:05,231 --> 03:19:06,290
people,
uh,

4312
03:19:06,350 --> 03:19:10,450
are not just married but actually get 
along together and are both really funny

4313
03:19:10,451 --> 03:19:12,880
and work together on a hilarious 
podcast.

4314
03:19:12,881 --> 03:19:13,714
I mean,
you guys have a very unusual 

4315
03:19:14,381 --> 03:19:18,460
relaTionship because the thought was 
never dated a comedian.

4316
03:19:18,670 --> 03:19:20,080
Like that's what every comedian always 
said.

4317
03:19:20,081 --> 03:19:23,650
Don't ever date a comedian just doesn't 
ever work out.

4318
03:19:24,220 --> 03:19:25,870
And uh,
I know,

4319
03:19:25,930 --> 03:19:28,360
but you guys are.
We're like motion natasha.

4320
03:19:28,361 --> 03:19:29,410
That seems to work too.

4321
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:30,510
Yes.
Yeah,

4322
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:32,610
I think,
but I can't speak for them.

4323
03:19:32,611 --> 03:19:33,630
I don't know.
Probably just motions.

4324
03:19:33,690 --> 03:19:36,150
A little bitch.
And then tasha just runs right.

4325
03:19:36,810 --> 03:19:39,990
If you had to guess.
Just kidding.

4326
03:19:39,991 --> 03:19:43,200
I love both of them.
Both of them.

4327
03:19:43,920 --> 03:19:45,090
I can't say.
I don't know,

4328
03:19:45,091 --> 03:19:46,620
but there seems sweet.
They're great.

4329
03:19:46,650 --> 03:19:48,180
I'm just kidding.
I'll tell you what,

4330
03:19:48,181 --> 03:19:51,270
the motion's a smart motherfucker.
They both are brilliant.

4331
03:19:51,480 --> 03:19:52,313
They're brilliant.
I think my husband is one of the 

4332
03:19:55,051 --> 03:19:55,884
funniest human beings on the planet and 
Was always supportive and we started at 

4333
03:20:00,151 --> 03:20:03,450
the same time and there was something in
being an open miker.

4334
03:20:03,480 --> 03:20:07,950
We were in the trenches together from 
day one and we never did that shit where

4335
03:20:07,951 --> 03:20:09,810
I opened for my husband because

4336
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:10,833
it's also a trap for women for female 
comics because then you're just your 

4337
03:20:12,941 --> 03:20:13,774
husband's opener.
You never establish her own thing can 

4338
03:20:15,771 --> 03:20:16,541
happen.
Yeah.

4339
03:20:16,541 --> 03:20:17,374
That's happened for people that we know,
but the people that we know when it 

4340
03:20:19,421 --> 03:20:21,640
happens for the opening acts always 
terrible.

4341
03:20:21,940 --> 03:20:23,580
The wife that always opens for the.
See,

4342
03:20:23,620 --> 03:20:24,770
that's the difference between.
Well,

4343
03:20:24,830 --> 03:20:27,190
it's you guys,
it works.

4344
03:20:27,370 --> 03:20:29,410
Like I said,
moshe and natasha,

4345
03:20:29,411 --> 03:20:31,690
those two are very funny.
They're both really smart.

4346
03:20:31,720 --> 03:20:32,870
That works.
Yeah.

4347
03:20:32,890 --> 03:20:36,430
I'm rich vos and bonding with pharrell 
and those two are really funny.

4348
03:20:36,610 --> 03:20:37,820
That works.
Yes.

4349
03:20:38,170 --> 03:20:39,003
And then who else?

4350
03:20:40,280 --> 03:20:41,120
I don't.
I don't.

4351
03:20:41,400 --> 03:20:42,890
That's it.
I think that's it.

4352
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:44,510
That's it.
Very rare.

4353
03:20:44,511 --> 03:20:45,920
Yeah.
But I think we,

4354
03:20:45,921 --> 03:20:48,370
uh,
he's very supportive of me and,

4355
03:20:49,460 --> 03:20:51,410
and this is not politically correct 
either,

4356
03:20:51,440 --> 03:20:56,440
but I think that there's a hierarchy.
He's way more famous than me and,

4357
03:20:58,170 --> 03:21:01,040
and that's fine and that's good.
Do you know?

4358
03:21:01,070 --> 03:21:02,780
It doesn't,
that doesn't fuck with you at all.

4359
03:21:03,280 --> 03:21:04,820
Do you ever think about channeling them 
in to sleep?

4360
03:21:06,480 --> 03:21:11,480
Put the pillow over his funny jokes,
but I think that can be a problem if the

4361
03:21:12,411 --> 03:21:15,640
other person has an issue with the mr.
Um,

4362
03:21:15,641 --> 03:21:18,440
mr harwood that horseshit.
Yeah.

4363
03:21:20,840 --> 03:21:22,400
Right,
right.

4364
03:21:22,401 --> 03:21:23,430
And I,
I,

4365
03:21:23,840 --> 03:21:24,673
uh,
I've seen other couples where one is 

4366
03:21:26,661 --> 03:21:28,670
more famous and the other one doesn't 
accept it in.

4367
03:21:28,671 --> 03:21:31,180
That fucks with them for.
Yeah,

4368
03:21:31,220 --> 03:21:32,630
I'm happy where I'm at,
put it that way.

4369
03:21:32,870 --> 03:21:36,390
All I ever wanted was to sell enough 
tickets to tell jokes to people who knew

4370
03:21:36,391 --> 03:21:37,224
who I was when I showed up and I'm there
and that's all I've ever wanted is just 

4371
03:21:40,071 --> 03:21:41,600
not to be doing like the dinner.

4372
03:21:41,770 --> 03:21:45,070
Quite honestly.
That is all anything ever.

4373
03:21:45,110 --> 03:21:45,943
That's all it ever is.
It just gets bigger in terms of the 

4374
03:21:48,381 --> 03:21:50,240
numbers,
but that's all it ever is.

4375
03:21:50,570 --> 03:21:52,580
That when you get to that,
that's the best.

4376
03:21:52,640 --> 03:21:53,473
Like if you get to that at a comedy club
or you get to that where you're doing a 

4377
03:21:55,521 --> 03:21:58,610
giant ass arena,
it kinda feels the same.

4378
03:21:59,390 --> 03:22:00,223
Yeah.
Yeah.

4379
03:22:01,120 --> 03:22:04,240
Because you're at,
you're at fucking arena,

4380
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:06,640
which is crazy to have watched you go 
through.

4381
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:08,620
I mean,
I don'T know.

4382
03:22:08,670 --> 03:22:09,940
It's weird.
Don't get diarrhea.

4383
03:22:10,440 --> 03:22:11,350
No,
no,

4384
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:11,700
no,
no.

4385
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:13,950
The last arena that I did was the 
biggest one,

4386
03:22:13,960 --> 03:22:14,470
the,
the,

4387
03:22:14,470 --> 03:22:17,790
the um,
we used to be the air Canada center,

4388
03:22:17,791 --> 03:22:18,624
now it's called the scotia bank arena.
And in Canada that fuck that the ufc is 

4389
03:22:21,751 --> 03:22:23,720
there next month.
That's places giant.

4390
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:25,860
And when I did that one,
it was bananas.

4391
03:22:25,861 --> 03:22:26,694
Like I'm standing out there looking at 
all these people make this is fucking 

4392
03:22:28,201 --> 03:22:30,410
insane.
But once the show started rolling,

4393
03:22:30,450 --> 03:22:31,700
it was like a regular show.
Right.

4394
03:22:31,860 --> 03:22:33,450
you don't look at all of that.

4395
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:35,400
it was just fun.
It was just fun.

4396
03:22:35,550 --> 03:22:37,500
But it was fun.
And so as a club,

4397
03:22:38,320 --> 03:22:40,200
like if you go to the funny bone,
you know,

4398
03:22:40,250 --> 03:22:41,083
that's just as you go to columbus 
funnybone just as fun punchline in 

4399
03:22:45,381 --> 03:22:46,214
sacramento.

4400
03:22:47,240 --> 03:22:48,021
Yes,
I agree.

4401
03:22:48,021 --> 03:22:49,220
And there's something.
I love clubs,

4402
03:22:49,221 --> 03:22:51,620
I love small rooms.
I also think too about my husband,

4403
03:22:51,621 --> 03:22:54,650
which is amazing,
is that it never gets to him.

4404
03:22:54,710 --> 03:22:57,880
Like he never sweats himself.
Right?

4405
03:22:57,910 --> 03:23:02,360
Like he sold out the fucking we'll turn.
This is a year ago and I got to open for

4406
03:23:02,361 --> 03:23:04,400
him,
which I sold them to you and I was like,

4407
03:23:04,401 --> 03:23:05,234
tommy and I grew up in la,
so selling out the wiltern to me is 

4408
03:23:08,361 --> 03:23:10,280
like,
you just ban your.

4409
03:23:10,290 --> 03:23:12,680
Yeah dude.
Like I grew up going to shows there.

4410
03:23:13,220 --> 03:23:13,821
I'm like,
tommy,

4411
03:23:13,821 --> 03:23:16,160
you sold out the fucking wheel turn.
and he literally was like,

4412
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:17,043
yeah,
it's cool.

4413
03:23:17,150 --> 03:23:18,050
Anyways.
What's for dinner?

4414
03:23:18,051 --> 03:23:21,060
Like it doesn't even phase him.
Now he,

4415
03:23:21,061 --> 03:23:21,680
he understood

4416
03:23:21,680 --> 03:23:26,120
stands traps and he doesn't allow his 
brain to go on any mental traps.

4417
03:23:26,280 --> 03:23:28,080
Hell no.
Whereas like burke crash,

4418
03:23:28,081 --> 03:23:28,914
we'll be making

4419
03:23:33,740 --> 03:23:37,740
the wiltern.

4420
03:23:39,950 --> 03:23:41,140
What's the trap there,
joe?

4421
03:23:41,480 --> 03:23:44,700
I'm the ego just to eat.
You got to the,

4422
03:23:44,720 --> 03:23:46,580
the,
the most important thing is being in the

4423
03:23:46,581 --> 03:23:47,414
state of mind that you could be in to do
great comedy and that that is not a 

4424
03:23:50,930 --> 03:23:54,050
congratulatory state of mind.
That is the opposite.

4425
03:23:54,080 --> 03:23:55,810
No,
that's so interesting.

4426
03:23:55,811 --> 03:23:57,650
Yeah,
because I,

4427
03:23:57,780 --> 03:24:00,760
I sold out carbs like a,
like a while,

4428
03:24:00,790 --> 03:24:02,080
right?
And I was like,

4429
03:24:02,110 --> 03:24:03,300
oh my god,
like I can't,

4430
03:24:03,370 --> 03:24:04,960
I can't believe these people are here to
see me now.

4431
03:24:04,961 --> 03:24:06,820
like,
oh the pressure because I'm finally,

4432
03:24:07,030 --> 03:24:08,770
you know,
moving the tickets and this and that.

4433
03:24:08,771 --> 03:24:10,210
And,
and then I was like,

4434
03:24:10,230 --> 03:24:11,610
I don't,
don't even think like that.

4435
03:24:11,620 --> 03:24:14,860
Like get into your self-loathing cause 
that's where you're funnier,

4436
03:24:15,360 --> 03:24:17,840
right?
Don't think about,

4437
03:24:18,220 --> 03:24:19,053
yeah,
get into whatever state of mind that it 

4438
03:24:20,051 --> 03:24:23,170
takes for you to do your best.
That's what you're doIng.

4439
03:24:23,220 --> 03:24:25,180
You want to go out there and rock that 
crowd.

4440
03:24:25,181 --> 03:24:26,710
That's exactly.
That's all it is.

4441
03:24:27,010 --> 03:24:30,120
And whatever you need to do to do that.
But you definitely don't need to be self

4442
03:24:30,121 --> 03:24:32,130
congratulatory.
Let's say that's the worst

4443
03:24:32,510 --> 03:24:33,450
instinct.
No,

4444
03:24:33,470 --> 03:24:37,760
because I've done stand up for people 
who didn't give a shit for years and who

4445
03:24:37,820 --> 03:24:38,653
would sit in the front row with their 
arms crossed and who the fuck is this 

4446
03:24:40,221 --> 03:24:41,570
bitch?
Fuck you.

4447
03:24:42,830 --> 03:24:43,800
That's,
you do it.

4448
03:24:43,830 --> 03:24:44,250
Right.

4449
03:24:44,250 --> 03:24:47,280
And also those moments are fucking 
critical.

4450
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:48,253
You know,
that's why I feel bad for people that 

4451
03:24:49,291 --> 03:24:52,980
are famous that try stand up as a famous
person like jesus.

4452
03:24:52,981 --> 03:24:54,670
That's a hard thing to do.
Oh yeah.

4453
03:24:54,990 --> 03:24:58,380
Like I've watched people do it that like
charlie murphy,

4454
03:24:58,560 --> 03:25:01,110
he that guy.
I mean I love that guy to death,

4455
03:25:01,410 --> 03:25:02,243
but one of the things I resPected about 
him more than anything was that he 

4456
03:25:04,501 --> 03:25:07,380
literally was an open miker.
While he was famous,

4457
03:25:07,840 --> 03:25:08,673
mean he was just starting out doing 
standup while he was on the chappelle 

4458
03:25:11,101 --> 03:25:12,810
show.
He'd been an actor all these years.

4459
03:25:13,320 --> 03:25:15,300
So for him,
like he realized,

4460
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:16,230
hey,
this is.

4461
03:25:16,230 --> 03:25:17,063
I'll host a show and bring up these 
comedians and I'll tell a story or two 

4462
03:25:21,270 --> 03:25:23,280
because this is a good way to make some 
money.

4463
03:25:23,400 --> 03:25:24,510
And then he realized like,
wow,

4464
03:25:24,511 --> 03:25:27,860
there's a lot of money on for me,
I need to just do some standup.

4465
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:29,220
JusT started writing,
stand up.

4466
03:25:29,221 --> 03:25:33,660
And he and I went on the road when he 
had been doing standup for two years and

4467
03:25:33,661 --> 03:25:36,910
we co headline together was bananas two 
years.

4468
03:25:36,911 --> 03:25:39,690
It's two years and already famous as 
fuck,

4469
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:40,913
you know,
and famous for being one of the most 

4470
03:25:42,091 --> 03:25:44,280
famous comedian of all times,
brother,

4471
03:25:44,700 --> 03:25:46,670
which is a huge deficit.
Yeah.

4472
03:25:46,980 --> 03:25:48,300
Yes.
Giant.

4473
03:25:48,570 --> 03:25:50,430
And he had a joke about it and he's 
like,

4474
03:25:50,431 --> 03:25:51,810
does it bother you?
You know,

4475
03:25:51,811 --> 03:25:52,800
that uh,
you know,

4476
03:25:52,890 --> 03:25:54,340
the people know you from,
uh,

4477
03:25:54,430 --> 03:25:55,050
the,
you know,

4478
03:25:55,050 --> 03:25:56,640
dave chappelle's show.
They're always saying that.

4479
03:25:56,850 --> 03:25:57,840
He goes,
he goes,

4480
03:25:57,841 --> 03:25:59,340
no motherfucker.
He goes,

4481
03:25:59,341 --> 03:26:00,480
for years.
He goes,

4482
03:26:00,481 --> 03:26:01,314
well,
it does bother you.

4483
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:03,840
People yell at me.
He goes,

4484
03:26:03,841 --> 03:26:04,674
no motherfuckers.
For years I was just eddie murphy's 

4485
03:26:06,061 --> 03:26:09,870
brother joke around about it onstage,
you know,

4486
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:12,780
that's very self aware.
He was great.

4487
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:14,460
He was such a good dude.

4488
03:26:16,260 --> 03:26:18,510
Imagine the courage to start standing 
up.

4489
03:26:18,730 --> 03:26:19,563
Fuck that.
So much harder and to go on the road 

4490
03:26:21,871 --> 03:26:25,590
like immediately he was on the road like
immediately.

4491
03:26:25,990 --> 03:26:28,680
Even like brendan schaub,
who I love so much,

4492
03:26:29,100 --> 03:26:33,270
the courage to start standing up and to 
get out and do it the right way.

4493
03:26:33,271 --> 03:26:33,871
You're like,
damn,

4494
03:26:33,871 --> 03:26:34,704
that's so good.
But at least brendan came through 

4495
03:26:36,451 --> 03:26:38,700
podcasting,
which is a lot of shit.

4496
03:26:38,701 --> 03:26:41,940
Talking like ad libbing and getting 
laughs,

4497
03:26:41,980 --> 03:26:44,070
you know,
you're getting laughs with comedians and

4498
03:26:44,071 --> 03:26:46,320
he had a lot of comedians telling him 
that he was funny,

4499
03:26:46,550 --> 03:26:49,080
you know,
and then he tried it just dipped his toe

4500
03:26:49,081 --> 03:26:51,480
in there and they just ran with it.
Yeah.

4501
03:26:51,481 --> 03:26:53,460
IT's amazing.
he's about to do a showtime special.

4502
03:26:53,461 --> 03:26:55,110
He's filming the showtime special in 
january.

4503
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:56,300
Brandon?
Yeah.

4504
03:26:56,410 --> 03:26:57,180
Okay.
Mr.

4505
03:26:57,180 --> 03:27:02,180
Shot two years in sometimes he kills.
He fucking kills people.

4506
03:27:02,250 --> 03:27:03,060
Like how good is he?

4507
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:05,100
I am telling you that mother fucker 
works hard.

4508
03:27:05,130 --> 03:27:07,170
He's funny.
He's naturally funny.

4509
03:27:07,171 --> 03:27:10,250
He's a great guy and he kills.
He really does.

4510
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:12,780
Yes he does.
It's ridiculous.

4511
03:27:13,050 --> 03:27:15,270
It is ridiculous.
But I tell a lot of comedians,

4512
03:27:15,271 --> 03:27:16,104
I go see that's what happens when you've
got an athlete's mindset like an 

4513
03:27:19,021 --> 03:27:23,010
athlete's determination and discipline 
and apply it to an art form.

4514
03:27:23,280 --> 03:27:24,750
I keep,
makes himself work.

4515
03:27:24,950 --> 03:27:28,290
Either you fuckers,
he just like get high and go to carnies.

4516
03:27:28,770 --> 03:27:31,990
Get fucking chili dogs because I think 
that's the assumption.

4517
03:27:32,140 --> 03:27:34,140
Assumptionist as a stand up comedian,
people are like,

4518
03:27:34,141 --> 03:27:36,270
you just lay around and jack your deck 
all day and do work.

4519
03:27:36,271 --> 03:27:37,110
You're like,
well,

4520
03:27:37,290 --> 03:27:40,440
those of us that actually want to 
produce ours that are worth a shit.

4521
03:27:40,920 --> 03:27:42,220
We this as a job,

4522
03:27:42,220 --> 03:27:42,540
dude.

4523
03:27:42,540 --> 03:27:43,373
Yeah.
Have to.

4524
03:27:43,410 --> 03:27:46,250
Especially once you start poundinG out 
stuff like tommy does what?

4525
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:47,093
He's doing one,
then he does another one two years 

4526
03:27:48,241 --> 03:27:48,991
later.
Does another one,

4527
03:27:48,991 --> 03:27:50,970
two years later.
Bar does that.

4528
03:27:51,030 --> 03:27:54,180
I do it that way now.
the way to do it,

4529
03:27:54,210 --> 03:27:55,043
the only way to do,
and you have to be writing all the 

4530
03:27:56,431 --> 03:27:59,130
fucking time.
It'd be performing all the fucking time.

4531
03:27:59,131 --> 03:27:59,964
There's no other way.

4532
03:28:00,610 --> 03:28:03,400
I know I loved watching you work out the
megan.

4533
03:28:03,550 --> 03:28:04,840
Megan kelly.
That's her name.

4534
03:28:04,841 --> 03:28:05,730
Sorry.
Megan.

4535
03:28:05,810 --> 03:28:07,240
Megan,
it sounds weird,

4536
03:28:07,241 --> 03:28:08,074
right?
Again,

4537
03:28:08,170 --> 03:28:12,070
you see like a word where it is.
Yes.

4538
03:28:12,140 --> 03:28:14,120
Can I,
can I just tell you what,

4539
03:28:15,050 --> 03:28:17,440
you know,
el torito my whole life I was,

4540
03:28:17,450 --> 03:28:19,570
I was going to el cerrito and then um,
one day you're like,

4541
03:28:19,780 --> 03:28:21,610
oh fuck,
that's like the little bowl dude.

4542
03:28:21,790 --> 03:28:25,840
that means the little bull,
el torito stupid fucking dumb.

4543
03:28:26,440 --> 03:28:27,273
Uh,
but watching you work that stuff out is 

4544
03:28:29,801 --> 03:28:32,830
so exciting.
I love your last special because you say

4545
03:28:32,831 --> 03:28:35,320
so many risky things,
which 10 years ago,

4546
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:39,220
not that risky in terms of the climate 
and now like I was like,

4547
03:28:39,221 --> 03:28:39,660
where's he going

4548
03:28:39,660 --> 03:28:40,493
do with this shit.
Just going to navigate the waters just 

4549
03:28:44,191 --> 03:28:45,024
more effectively and more carefully and 
then just set things up better and your 

4550
03:28:49,441 --> 03:28:52,290
writing has to be better.
I think for me,

4551
03:28:52,440 --> 03:28:53,880
especially with the subjects that I 
cover,

4552
03:28:53,881 --> 03:28:56,440
but I also felt like this was my most

4553
03:28:56,750 --> 03:28:58,730
virtual special.
Absolutely.

4554
03:28:58,731 --> 03:29:00,230
Well,
the title strange times.

4555
03:29:00,231 --> 03:29:01,064
Great.
Yeah.

4556
03:29:01,550 --> 03:29:05,170
I felt it was the most controversial 
because I felt like I needed to be.

4557
03:29:06,070 --> 03:29:08,920
I needed to touch on the things that 
seemed to be dangerous to touch on.

4558
03:29:08,921 --> 03:29:10,600
Like he said it best.
He's like,

4559
03:29:10,601 --> 03:29:12,800
standup is dangerous again,
like this is.

4560
03:29:12,870 --> 03:29:15,730
This is a fun time for standup because 
it's actually dangerous.

4561
03:29:15,960 --> 03:29:16,793
I agree.
This is why I wanted that meet my me to 

4562
03:29:18,021 --> 03:29:19,980
shit to get out there first time I'm 
going to do this.

4563
03:29:19,981 --> 03:29:21,340
I'm not.
I'm not here.

4564
03:29:21,370 --> 03:29:22,203
I'm not.
Not said the other female comics aren't 

4565
