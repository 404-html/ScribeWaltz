1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,230
Lady gentleman.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,180
Black helicopters have been spotted.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,990
This is the hundredth
episode 200 episodes ago,

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:07,350
by the way,

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:07,800
focusing,

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,730
and this is our 300th episode.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,631
All right folks,

8
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:15,860
this is the 401 to the big
ones should goddamn loud.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Even though I love Lucy
and got 400 fucking,

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,220
this is episode 500 could
you imagine of life was 3-d.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,920
The stars have aligned.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,600
The prophecy has come true.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,870
Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo together
on episode nine one one youth.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,830
It was preposterous.

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,730
I don't have that much to say.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,930
People say you repeat shit.

17
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm like,

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,250
what the fuck do you think,

19
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:44,880
man?

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,710
Come on dude,

21
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,560
it's questions.

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,771
Let's see this dash.

23
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,604
How dare you.

24
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,200
Now that you've ruined it,

25
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:52,831
Michael Shermer,

26
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,664
how dare you?

27
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,750
That's pretty preposterous.

28
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,220
What do you always have to talk about?

29
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,240
It's fucking annoying.

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,541
Oh,

31
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,220
you guys ever fucking talk about his week?

32
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,301
You were getting all that,

33
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,380
that stone or we'd,

34
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,430
you weren't getting into space.

35
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,930
We'd on a.com oh,

36
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,340
and it entering the code name,

37
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:05,701
Rogan,

38
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,160
and you will get 10% off all your orders.

39
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,810
O.

40
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:09,810
N.

41
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:09,810
N.

42
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,800
It used a codeword Rogan and save 10%
off any and all supplements going to come

43
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,340
to a point in time where there is not
going to be any secrets and that's a good

44
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:17,790
thing.

45
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,530
There's going to be full information
disclosed from you to me and,

46
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,670
and what it is is the
convergence of all human beings.

47
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,800
It's pretty fucking crazy
and that's where it's going.

48
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,690
How come I can bank online?

49
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,630
How come you can deal with the entire
world's economy through computers and the

50
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:30,871
Internet,

51
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,710
but you can't vote.

52
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,370
Really when it should be
is it should be no Mexico.

53
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,570
There should be no United States.

54
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,510
There should be no Canada.

55
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,800
They should be the planet earth.

56
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,450
That's really what it should be.

57
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,670
These ideas are fucking stupid,

58
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,850
but the DMT experiencing
itself is unbelievably intense,

59
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,330
but there is such a radical
difference between eating a steak.

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,860
He bought a store and eating the back
strap of an axis deer that you had to

61
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:56,940
sneak up on.

62
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,590
We all love to sleep,

63
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,910
but everyone's afraid to die.

64
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,830
This is a guy named Fritz harbor.

65
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,581
Yeah,

66
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,450
Fritz Harbor.

67
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,300
You know the horrible
tragedy of Fritz Harbor.

68
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,360
Dan Carlin's hardcore
history Dan Carlin podcast,

69
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,780
where he talked about the
Mongols and Dan Carlin thing on,

70
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,614
um,

71
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,940
on the history of the Mongols.

72
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,380
This was when they had the operation
Northwoods thing that had been passed.

73
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,940
And if you haven't seen that document,

74
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:21,840
that's crazy.

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,630
That is a direct result of
my obsession with quake.

76
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,700
This is all from my quake playing days.

77
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,480
I got addicted to video games because
of news radio because the writers,

78
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,520
the writers room where
they had a land party.

79
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,080
So that was the next quick too.

80
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,860
I was so obsessed with this that I,

81
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:40,240
I put a t one line in my house
so I had a t one line install a,

82
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,490
you must have been rich.

83
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,353
I was rich,

84
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,150
the sensory deprivation chamber.

85
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:47,070
It's been the most important
tool that I've ever used for,

86
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:47,904
for mine,

87
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,950
for in my mind.

88
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,790
How much do you fuck
with the isolation tag?

89
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,380
I lived in Colorado in the marriage,

90
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,120
lived eight miles down a dirt road.

91
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,620
My dog had eaten by a mountain lion.

92
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:55,940
I mean,

93
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,550
I lived in,

94
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,750
I talked about this yesterday.

95
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,370
I lived in the mountains of
Colorado for four months,

96
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:00,650
did he?

97
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,600
That's where I wanted to live,

98
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,780
and just last year till my dog had
eaten by a mountain lion and my wife got

99
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,740
pregnant or to eating some
nice plump dogs along the way,

100
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,020
they do downing months on the,

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,790
yeah.

102
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,240
Yeah.

103
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,701
It was like,

104
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,490
man,

105
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm sorry man.

106
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,940
Let's change up the topic.

107
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,200
A lot of outlines up there too.

108
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,401
Yeah.

109
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,234
They eat dogs,

110
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,163
dogs and cats.

111
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,460
Let's buy a house in the mountains.

112
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,240
So it was a on the top of a mountain
and my dog got eaten by mountain line.

113
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,990
Whoa.

114
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,620
Yeah.

115
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,030
That became a bit in my act.

116
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,470
And if you play in the podcast,

117
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:34,471
drinking game drink I've seen too in my
life and they were both maybe like 60

118
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,920
the first one was probably like 60
pounds in the Senate and get your dog or

119
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:39,131
something.

120
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,760
Yeah.

121
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,840
That was about 60 pounds.

122
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,873
Okay.

123
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600
[inaudible].
