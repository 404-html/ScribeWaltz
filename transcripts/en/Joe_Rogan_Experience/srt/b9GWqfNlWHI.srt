1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,510
What's clear?
Our throats stuff is good.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,370
We're live.
Let's it fuckers sit.

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm pushing the fucking computer away.
I got throat coat tea.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,900
That's right.
You're ready to go.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,920
Billy Burger.
Hey,

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,800
that's like special out today out now.
That's right.

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,680
Walk your way out.
The ryman theater in Nashville.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,710
Tanush safe.
That's where they used to do Grand Ole 

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,710
opry is a beautiful place.
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,220
And I had done it in 2014.
Uh,

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,510
Vince Vaughn,
wild west,

12
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,760
he has a comedy festival there.
I don't know if you've done it yet,

13
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,761
but that's where I did it.
But did the ryman there for the same 

14
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:34,761
reason?
Yeah.

15
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:34,761
So I went out there and I was like,
you know,

16
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:34,800
everyone was like,
I don't know,

17
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,590
it's the first place they did the Grand 
Ole opry.

18
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:37,320
I was,
you know,

19
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,400
Hank Williams,
whatever.

20
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:38,940
And you're like,
ah,

21
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,330
yeah,
yeah,

22
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,740
yeah.
Now the theater and you walk in,

23
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,700
you're like,
oh wait a minute.

24
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,700
This had just had that magic in it and I
was went out and I had this great set 

25
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,150
and that's just,
you know,

26
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,850
you just stick it in the card catalog 
going.

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,260
All right,
next time I have A.

28
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,620
I was like,
I just burned all this material so I got

29
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,140
to write a whole new hour and come back 
here.

30
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,370
And so next time,
um,

31
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,110
you know,
I go to shoot something.

32
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,350
I think there was about a month before I
did the Tabernacle for my one previous 

33
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,081
to that,
so I already knew which was cool before 

34
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,081
I wrote my next hour where I was going 
to shoot it.

35
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,570
So are you on a two year schedule?
You think that that's the way to do it?

36
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,050
Roughly two years.
But I have like a,

37
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,140
like a vibe of when like this one was 
overcooked and just because I got real 

38
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,780
busy with F is for family.

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,420
I would have liked to have taped it like
about six months earlier,

40
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,490
but it made it a,
I think it,

41
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:28,500
it made it better or whatever,
but I would have just as far as,

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,160
you know what I mean,
it's,

43
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,580
it's kind of like in this business,
there's that thing,

44
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,581
you don't want to be overexposed,
but then you don't want to wait too 

45
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:37,870
long,
so you got to try to.

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,040
And then that's also not like a Oh so 
and so successful and he waits x amount 

47
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:45,780
of time.
So I'm going to do the exact thing.

48
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,040
It's really,
um,

49
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,100
it's really like whatever you're trying 
to do.

50
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,870
So it's Kinda different for different 
people.

51
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:56,871
Like those youtube stars,
like their thing is all about just 

52
00:01:56,871 --> 00:02:00,021
constantly putting out stuff where I 
think the road that I'm on is,

53
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:05,961
you know,
like right now I'm out there promoting 

54
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,710
this shit and then once it comes out and
everybody's seeing it and they're liking

55
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:12,711
it and then I'm done promoting it,
then I just sort of disappeared until F 

56
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:12,711
is for family comes out.

57
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,730
Um,
I'm kind of a big believer in that.

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,420
Have you know,
be out there when you got something 

59
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,580
that's going on.
Don't just do shit to do shit.

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,280
I call that like extra TV.
Hey,

61
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,460
he's just here to be here and now he's 
over there.

62
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:27,680
There's that guy again.
Then I,

63
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,110
because I find myself,
people that I'm fans of starting to hate

64
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:36,111
people going like,
you fucking get away from this fucking 

65
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:36,111
guy.
Then I'm thinking like,

66
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,830
do I actually hate this person or I 
don't know what it is,

67
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:39,790
but there's definitely a tipping point.
You know?

68
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,700
It was real smart about that.
Daniel Tosh,

69
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,880
he doesn't do shit.
He doesn't do a fucking thing.

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,490
He sells out everywhere he goes.
He's got millions of dollars,

71
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,060
so he's like,
I don't,

72
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,340
I don't need to do shit.
I'm overexposed as it is.

73
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,320
My shows on constantly.
I'm not doing nothing.

74
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,200
He won't do interviews.
Doesn't do podcasts.

75
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,570
Yeah.
Adam Sandler's.

76
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,470
Another guy.
Yeah.

77
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,530
Adam Sandler doesn't do.
I don't.

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm trying to think.
The last time I saw him promote a movie 

79
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,860
and yet I see all of his movies and then
I just hear through the Grapevine,

80
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,450
oh,
he signed some big thing with Netflix.

81
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,920
All his movies are going to be over 
there.

82
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,400
I was like,
all right.

83
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,580
I guess I'm watching them over there and
I've always just sort of like.

84
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,700
And it wasn't until um,
I talked to somebody like,

85
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,710
yeah,
he doesn't do any press good for his 

86
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,710
sick.
Basically.

87
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,700
I might be wrong,
but from what I heard for he does very 

88
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:23,700
little if he does any.
Yeah,

89
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,330
no,
he's smart and he's got his core 

90
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,330
audience,
you know?

91
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,330
Uh,
I watched,

92
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,661
uh,
Jack and Jill with my kids with my six 

93
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:30,661
year old and my eight year old.

94
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:34,540
It is fucking hilarious when you watch,
when you watch a really silly movie with

95
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:40,141
a six year old and an eight year old and
they're literally fallen off the couch 

96
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:40,141
laughing.
That's awesome.

97
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,400
And you realize like,
oh,

98
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,680
he's making movies for little kids.
Like people who get mad at it,

99
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,800
you know,
like all those movies are stupid dude.

100
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,590
Not if you're six,
you're six.

101
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:51,130
They're fucking awesome.
What if you just getting a stupid move?

102
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,500
That's what I like.
I don't want to fucking think every time

103
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,910
I go see him,
but sometimes they just want somebody to

104
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,320
make me laugh.
I liked,

105
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,150
uh,
the XO had one.

106
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,580
I loved that movie.
Yeah.

107
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:04,581
When was coming up with hilarious dude.
I remember when I was living with Bobby 

108
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,220
Kelly,
we watched waterboy by Bobby Boucher.

109
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,470
We watched that thing like fucking 900 
times.

110
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,940
Like it was kind of like a Goto,
you know,

111
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,670
if we didn't have spots,
you try to kill a day.

112
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,680
Just we had the little vhs thing.
We,

113
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,270
I probably saw that movie at least 30,
40 times.

114
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,740
Yeah.
And Happy Gilmore.

115
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,950
I saw happy Gilmore at least 10 times.
That's a fucking great.

116
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,220
I forget the name of the last one when 
he did with spade.

117
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,260
When he was a.
He worked at the bank and the 

118
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,260
supermarket.
Did you watch that one?

119
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,860
That was his first Netflix one that came
out like last year.

120
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,670
None.
Didn't see it.

121
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,260
My short term memory's shot,
but that was,

122
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,450
that was a funny one to know.
His movies are,

123
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,700
they're always consistently that way,
you know,

124
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,650
that Kinda that kind of movie.
No,

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
and I liked it there.
Unapologetically silly.

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,800
No,
because uh,

127
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,030
you know,
he's a guy that gets a lot of shit and 

128
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,030
he just doesn't give a shit.
Like,

129
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,001
all right.
You didn't like this one is another one 

130
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:54,001
that made a zillion dollars.

131
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:54,001
Yeah.
Avoid the press.

132
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,510
Find your core audience to what you got 
to do.

133
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,980
Yeah.
I like that.

134
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,050
What you're doing.
Like they're like,

135
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,060
that's sort of schedule.
I feel like that's kind of the same 

136
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,540
amount of time that I do around a year 
and a half.

137
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,580
I started thinking this thing's about 
don,

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,970
you know,
and uh,

139
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,330
a year.
And I feel like wow,

140
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
I could kind of pull it off,
but not really.

141
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,500
You're not smarter than you take it out 
of the oven too soon.

142
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,810
Then there's just like that,
you know,

143
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,040
was still a little mushy.
That's just like,

144
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,980
you know,
I,

145
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,570
yeah,
you go out there and you kick the shit 

146
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:27,570
out of him every couple of years.
Hopefully.

147
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,550
Hopefully they like it and then they'll 
come see you again on your next tour.

148
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,360
Yeah.
And,

149
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,630
and that's all you owe them and that's 
all they owe you.

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,280
It's just like,
I saw you last one.

151
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,070
You're still in my wheelhouse of people.
I'm going to go see,

152
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,190
but the second you fuck up,
I'm not going to go see you when you 

153
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,431
can't ask.
You can't ask fans to do any more than 

154
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:47,431
that.
No.

155
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,460
What about the other stuff I did that 
didn't suck.

156
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:49,640
It's like,
yeah,

157
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,410
but your last thing sucked in this two 
minute.

158
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,100
Too much unbelievable stuff being put 
out.

159
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,510
So you've got to kind of try and keep 
up.

160
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,230
Yeah.
Artist should fear had a real good point

161
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,010
about that too.

162
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,720
He said that at one point in time 
comedians used to have a.

163
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:05,660
They used to do a special and it was 
like the best special,

164
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,990
like an hbo special and then they would 
slide off.

165
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,180
They would all slide off every one of 
them,

166
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,100
like kinnisons the worst,
like Kennison.

167
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,440
You watched kinisons first special and 
then you watch it,

168
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,680
like listen to louder than hell that 
that cassette.

169
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,560
And watch this first HBO special fucking
genius,

170
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:26,561
just balls out and if you don't get it,
I understand because it's not 1986 

171
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:29,240
anymore,
but if you were in 1986 and you saw that

172
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,730
you would have been blown away,
you would have been like in the presence

173
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,430
of greatness.
Like,

174
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,710
oh,
he's on my mount rushmore.

175
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,180
That got me too.
Me Too.

176
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,820
But then the stuff after that was dog 
shit.

177
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,150
It got worse and worse and worse as far 
as I could just.

178
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,470
I mean,
I never met the guy,

179
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,480
but just as far as watching him as a 
fan,

180
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,220
he kind of seemed like he stepped in 
every single pitfall of being,

181
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,070
uh,
of getting some fame.

182
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,230
Yup.
Everything like not trying as hard coke 

183
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,420
girls showing up late to shit,
hanging out with Bon Jovi.

184
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,220
Getting a bad reputation.
A Motley crew.

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,160
It wasn't Bon Jovi to you?
Yeah.

186
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,170
It was one of his early specials,
like Bon Jovi was on the beginning of 

187
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,420
his special.
I just remember he drove motley crew to 

188
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,970
the whiskey for the kickstart.
My heart video.

189
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,410
Oh,
that's right.

190
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,040
The eighties though.
That's a great video.

191
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,290
That fucking kickstart my heart still to
this day.

192
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,180
When that comes out at the gym,
I get fired up.

193
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh,
it's a great song to crave fucking 

194
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,300
dialogue in the beginning is brutal 
though.

195
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,490
It goes,
here we are.

196
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,550
It gets something like this is where it 
all began and and the guy goes and then 

197
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,190
some of the cargoes.
Yeah.

198
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,110
Then he goes home,
sweet home,

199
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,270
and then they all go,
yeah.

200
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh God.
Pull that up.

201
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,770
Give you some volume to it in the 
eighties.

202
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,170
Those.

203
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah,
but Tommy Lee's drums in this.

204
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,370
A fucking amazing.
Wow.

205
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,050
Forget how long these guys have been 
around.

206
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,460
How long

207
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,560
Tommy Lee's been around?
How has it?

208
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,780
How were his arms not fallen off?
Give her.

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,210
Give me a little volume on that.
Jamie.

210
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:08,870
I want to hear this.

211
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Fuck yeah.
This is the best treadmill song of all 

212
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,920
time.
If you're on the treadmill,

213
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,730
it's a fucking great song for working 
out,

214
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:32,540
man.
I think this is the best song ever.

215
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,890
Did you really?
Oh Wow.

216
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,500
You were explaining to me something 
before the podcast started.

217
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:51,501
I wanted you to talk about it on the 
podcast because you were talking about 

218
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,800
drum technique and you had like a slow 
motion video of how you do it and you're

219
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:56,250
kind of letting the stick do lot of the 
work.

220
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah.
I got this great teacher,

221
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:02,160
a Davy lottery played with everybody 
from a Mars Volta to like Miley Cyrus.

222
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,440
So whatever your Gig is like total 
progressive,

223
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,850
crazy.
I can't even.

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Some of the music he's played.
I got to know where one is and then he 

225
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,240
can also just do the straight pop tour 
or whatever.

226
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,620
But um,
his technique is incredible.

227
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,170
It's the first time I saw him play.
He's got this drum camp.

228
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,160
I should,
I should show it to you.

229
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,820
It literally,
I'm looking at it and you know,

230
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,940
laymen's eyes.
I was like,

231
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,690
how is this guy's arms not falling off?
But his technique,

232
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,950
you know,
as I've gone and taken lessons for well 

233
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,301
over a year with them,
now I can watch it on a different level 

234
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,791
as far as like,
his technique is sick so he's not 

235
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,640
fucking his arms up and everything.
He's moving his arms,

236
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,410
given people a show,
but like it's,

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,910
it's,
it's hard to explain like,

238
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,110
um,
first of all,

239
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:45,111
I'm not a professional drummer,
but it's also hard to explain like over 

240
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:45,111
a podcast,
but like,

241
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:45,111
he's like,
yeah,

242
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:45,111
it's,
it's,

243
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:48,840
it's letting the stick do the work and 
he kind of equated it to like,

244
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:50,640
if you'd like dribbling a ball or 
something like that,

245
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,440
or maybe it was somebody else.

246
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,610
If you dribble a basketball to every 
time it comes up to your hand,

247
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:58,611
once you get it going,
you're not slamming it back down to the 

248
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:58,611
floor.
You just controlling the rebound.

249
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,630
It's something sorted to do.
There it is.

250
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,900
This is the one that if you play a,
you could turn up the volume.

251
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,410
I'm just,
this is just going to bore the shit out 

252
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,410
of people with.
No,

253
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:11,410
no it's not.
You see it as hands.

254
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,410
How loose his hands are seen when he 
just opens his hand like that.

255
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,650
He's getting,
you know,

256
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,550
this guy's a fucking animal,
man.

257
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,950
You Love Drumming,
Huh?

258
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You're,
you're fucking really deep into this 

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,080
shit.
It's literally a tried therapy.

260
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,900
I tried talking to people in Shit and 
it's just like,

261
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,220
yeah,
I only get so far,

262
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:36,221
but like that stuff like just totally 
clears my head and I like it because 

263
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:39,410
it's like comedy where there's somewhere
to go with it and it's endless.

264
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,980
There's really no end to how good you 
can come as a comic if you keep pushing 

265
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,420
yourself with this little skill sets 
that you're,

266
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:51,421
you know,
they're kind of weak and you can just 

267
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:51,421
keep making,
you know,

268
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:54,040
working on drawings the same way.
So it's that going for the next thing 

269
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,770
that has me just present trying to work 
it out and I just forget about 

270
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,620
everything else.
And um,

271
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,600
you know,
I even got a kid now.

272
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,390
My wife's still lets me go play for an 
hour day because she knows it's good for

273
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,770
us.
So that's like,

274
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,860
it's like a meditation on top of a 
little bit of a workout too because 

275
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:11,870
you're throwing your arms around.
Oh yeah.

276
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,620
Threaded.
It's like you do look at guys like 

277
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:17,620
Travis Barker and Tommy Lee,
those guys have Jack Veins.

278
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,590
They're all shredded.
Yeah.

279
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Well yeah.
Well that part of that I think is also 

280
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,350
like if you just sort of struggle,
there's also something too,

281
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:29,351
and that's,
I'm not talking about anybody you just 

282
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:29,351
mentioned,
but there is something,

283
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:29,351
something about if you do heroin in your
twenties,

284
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:33,080
you're kinda like shredded for life.
I don't know what it is.

285
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,000
Iggy pop.
I don't know if he did.

286
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,260
He did hard drugs.
He definitely does.

287
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,550
Guys are like these guys.
It just shredded.

288
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:42,680
It's very rare that after you come out 
of that,

289
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,970
you know,
Keith Richards,

290
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,310
all of those guys that just Keith 
Richards is like,

291
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:48,700
you could pick that guy up with two 
fucking fingers and he's.

292
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,410
Yeah,
he's all like,

293
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,830
yeah.
It's like he did pull out.

294
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,070
He's not just shot heroin for like

295
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,470
three years.
He still shredded his skin.

296
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,370
Skin is giving up,
losing the elasticity,

297
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,700
but he's still,
he's still a shredded.

298
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,250
Yeah,
he's.

299
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,290
His body is very odd.
I saw him,

300
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,770
I saw him.
In a way.

301
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,170
You're looking at him now and he's like 
70.

302
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:17,160
I saw him with Queens of the stone age 
backing them up.

303
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,680
I saw my downtown La how long ago?
Like fuck it,

304
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:23,530
about a year ago,
this is what I loved about the guy.

305
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:28,531
He went out there and in and like one 
song and he had his fucking shirt off,

306
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,660
just didn't give a shit.
He's the crusher of music.

307
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,920
Yeah.
And that's why.

308
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,230
That's why I like,
you know,

309
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:37,900
when they give Madonna's shit for torque
and it 58,

310
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:39,160
it's like,
who gives a fuck?

311
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,860
I mean there is something,
you know,

312
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,110
there is like,
there is something to be said about a,

313
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,000
it's all how you do it.
He did it.

314
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:51,001
I felt like he didn't give a fuck.
But if it kind of doing is this 

315
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:51,250
desperate thing still trying to be like 
good luck and then it gets a little,

316
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,470
uh,
I guess it gets a little cheesy.

317
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,630
The Madonna thing,
it's not working.

318
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,840
It's the shit that she says with the 
torquing,

319
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,070
you know,
like,

320
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,940
uh,
I'll,

321
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,790
I'll suck everyone's dick who doesn't 
vote for trump.

322
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,470
Like that kind of stuff.
Like really well,

323
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,320
she's been able to hang around for 
fucking 40 years doing it.

324
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,310
I didn't know,
but it's just like,

325
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,740
don't do that anymore.
What if a tooth falls out?

326
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
What if you're blowing somebody and it 
just goes wrong?

327
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,470
She just,
he's 70 years old or so.

328
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,280
She doesn't.
She's 85 years old.

329
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,580
She's 128,
58.

330
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,760
He's 10 years older than me.
She's in better shape than I'll ever be 

331
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,470
in.
She seems a lot older than that.

332
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,540
I mean when we were kids,
she was already a grown woman.

333
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,730
What she broke,
she was like 25.

334
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:40,400
I think she made a quick.
I remember when I was in high school,

335
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:43,250
I've told this story before,
but when I was like 16 and I was in love

336
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,640
with her and I found out she was 27 and 
I was like,

337
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,650
that pitches old Jesus Christ.
I thought 27 and then curb at 16.

338
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,400
I didn't even hit him.
I know it just was a retarded.

339
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,880
I was 16.
I didn't know anybody,

340
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,990
but I just remembered hearing she was in
her late twenties to over look at her 

341
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,820
house when she was kind of Chubby to do 
a.

342
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,980
I did think 27 though when I was a kid,
like when I would see a 27 year old guy.

343
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,680
I think that's a man.
He's got it figured out.

344
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,900
He's on his own,
you know,

345
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,590
none of this bullshit I'm going through 
is all sorted out his fucking head.

346
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,770
I used to think that I had a little bit 
about that 48 and I'm just going to be 

347
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,750
49 this year and I'm just like still 
figuring shit out.

348
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,050
I had a whole bit about.
Remember when you were a kid and you 

349
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,050
thought they were real grownups like 
you.

350
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,500
You didn't know you were confused.
He get yelled at,

351
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,550
he gets sent to your room.
You're like,

352
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:39,920
one day I'm going to be a grown up and 
everything's gonna make sense?

353
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,530
And then one day you're in line at the 
supermarket and someone goes,

354
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,510
paper or plastic,
Sir sir,

355
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,150
sir,
my grownup.

356
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,580
Fuck this is it.
Then you realize there's no grownups 

357
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:51,580
too.
It's just a bunch of babies you got

358
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,070
and they're all pretending and they look
like they're grown up to you because 

359
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,070
you're on the outside.
But once you become one of them,

360
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,640
you realize there is no up.

361
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,370
Oops,
this,

362
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,270
there's some out there.
This,

363
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,260
uh,
men and women out there.

364
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm not one of them.
Have you met one?

365
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,260
Yeah,
like who named one?

366
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Uh,
I've met a few as far as like in this 

367
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,640
business as far as like,
people just like a,

368
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,810
I would say anybody who was,
they have like this super successful in 

369
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,910
this business,
but then they just go home.

370
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,160
You know what I mean?
You just go home.

371
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,410
Like that's an adult,
right?

372
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,860
You know,
they fucking blushing,

373
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,960
you know,
if there is an after party,

374
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:31,961
they make their appearance,
they have a little seltzer water and 

375
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,170
they're gone and they get eight hours 
sleep that cock.

376
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,940
They're talking to their wife and their 
kids like,

377
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,080
to me those,
those are adults to do what I do is,

378
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,110
you know,
to still go out and fucking have a 

379
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,170
couple of whiskeys and wake up a little 
hung over going,

380
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,190
Oh God,
what did I do that for the 9000000th 

381
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,190
time in my life?
Like I.

382
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,190
Yeah,
I'm not an adult.

383
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,830
Yeah.
But I don't feel.

384
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,430
I don't think there's anyone like that.
That's a comic.

385
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,120
I don't know anybody that's really funny
that has it all totally together.

386
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,180
I've never met one ever name one.
They don't exist.

387
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:02,840
Funny.

388
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,510
Yeah,
they don't exist.

389
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,440
They're all fucked up a little bit.
Just a little.

390
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,640
I mean keeping it together,
like paying your taxes,

391
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,190
showing up on time,
all that good stuff,

392
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,170
right.
Adult like,

393
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,390
but all,
every,

394
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,100
every one of us is one.
No,

395
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,360
it's not bad,
but every one of us has one shitty 

396
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,390
decision from a disaster.
Every one of us at any point in time

397
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,700
when I watched people,
uh,

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,230
I dunno when they watched him fuck up 
their lives.

399
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:34,231
Like there's always a.
The first feeling I have is panic.

400
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,100
When I see it.
I'm like,

401
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:37,960
Oh God.
Imagine what they're thinking.

402
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,670
Right.
You imagine yourself in their position.

403
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,800
What if I did that?
Yeah.

404
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,940
Yeah.
Like when you see someone pulled over 

405
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:46,940
for drunk driving,
like,

406
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:46,940
fuck.
Oh No.

407
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,940
Oh No.
The whole fucking thing.

408
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,280
Giving you money to the wrong people.
They mismanagement.

409
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,600
Oh,
broke.

410
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,680
Becoming a fucking Aleke.
I just read something about banging the.

411
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,470
Made all the bag in the major good.
One maid or the nanny.

412
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,720
You can't have a maid or a nanny

413
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,280
in your life.
Well,

414
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:05,320
if you do,
they have to be disgusting.

415
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,140
That's like the unathletic bang.
His nanny.

416
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,090
He did.
Right.

417
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,170
That was never confirmed.
That was never confessed.

418
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,820
She confirmed it.
Yeah,

419
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,410
but what does that mean?
She needs a book deal.

420
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:15,640
She got fired.
Who knows?

421
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,670
Unless he came out and said,
I never fucked her and he never did 

422
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:20,670
this.
Dude.

423
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,990
You're going to do that to them.
I'm not a big fan of his.

424
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,860
You know how you didn't like the town?
No,

425
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:31,861
I didn't like him.
He went on the Bill Maher show cutting 

426
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,970
this ridiculous argument with Sam Harris
and I realized what what he's all about.

427
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:34,540
I was like,
Oh,

428
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,620
you're one of those guys who's like 
Colin?

429
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,740
Sam Harris,
racist,

430
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,810
because he was talking about the problem
with ideologies and religions and the 

431
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,030
tenants of Islam and he started yelling 
at him,

432
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:45,490
calling him a racist and didn't really 
understand that.

433
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,820
Sam Harris is actually a scholar,
knows a lot about religion.

434
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,030
Just way over his head and looked really
stupid.

435
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,090
So the only difference between me and 
him as he did that on TV and I do it 

436
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,670
over the phone with friends.
The only difference is you're funny,

437
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,510
you're funny if you did it,
you have self deprecating humor.

438
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:01,600
You would have,
you know,

439
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,970
like the fuck am I talking about?

440
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,020
Talk to the guy at the gas station.
And I just stopped at right before I got

441
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,520
here.
When I found out they didn't take credit

442
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:09,720
cards.
What happened?

443
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,140
It just didn't take,
you know,

444
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,470
I was mad at him.
Uh,

445
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,180
I,
I was a content.

446
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,380
Really?
Yeah.

447
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Because what it was was I was getting up
against being here by 11 and I got to 

448
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:28,461
get home to take my wife out of the 
house because she's going nuts staying 

449
00:18:28,461 --> 00:18:32,211
in the house with the kids.
So I got that thing and I got assigned 

450
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:32,211
this other fucking,
you know,

451
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:32,211
life insurance,
you know,

452
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:36,780
I got to do all this adult shit and I'm 
thinking I got this little window to get

453
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:39,870
gas and I show up in this fucking 
industrial park.

454
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,400
There's no gas station.
I finally going all the way down and the

455
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,610
whole time it was like,
it's thrifty and I'm thinking like,

456
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,080
isn't that a fucking car rental place?

457
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,290
So I pull in and I stick to credit 
rights.

458
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:54,291
I stuck in and I'm going,
this is too easy because I know I have 

459
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:54,291
the exact amount of time to get her 
right on time.

460
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,160
And of course it's just like,
is this debit?

461
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,730
I'm like,
ah,

462
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:57,630
you can't.
I'm like,

463
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,320
no.
And they go,

464
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,670
go in and see the,
uh,

465
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,220
the guy behind the register.
I'm like,

466
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,780
yeah,
I tried to use my credit card.

467
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,640
And he goes,
oh,

468
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,280
we don't,
we don't,

469
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,260
we don't take credit cards here.
And I go,

470
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:08,610
why?
He goes,

471
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:13,611
I'll just take debit card.
I just kept saying why two year old and 

472
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,700
he finally just goes cheaper.
And I was like,

473
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,300
ah,
that's a good,

474
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,990
that's a good excuse.
And it gave him like 60 bucks and only 

475
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,170
ended up being like 30 nights that I had
to go back and get my change and he's 

476
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,170
looking at me like,
say a fucking idiot.

477
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,540
It would have cost you like 15 more.
So I do that all the time.

478
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,080
Yeah.
I'm not a big fan of those fucking debit

479
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:30,940
card.
Only ones.

480
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,790
That's stupid.

481
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,630
Lynette,
you never use your debit card,

482
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,450
your credit card anyway.
What happened?

483
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Because that's your money.
So if somebody takes that and then 

484
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:40,500
cleans you out,
that's your shit.

485
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,780
If somebody swipes your credit card 
number,

486
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,990
that's their money.
So then they call you up and they just 

487
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:47,990
go,
hey joe,

488
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,610
did you buy a ham hock and fucking 
Vancouver had a strip club?

489
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,910
Uh,
well I know I didn't go.

490
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,380
Good luck with that.
You've given me every piece of the 

491
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,200
fucking elk except that

492
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,890
I've got some ham hock for you.
Some,

493
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,950
some bone he can chop up and make 
marijuana.

494
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,130
So I got to,
I got a buddy of mine who's a lawyer who

495
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,570
prosecutes identity theft,
which a lot of lawyers don't want to do 

496
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:15,330
because it's unbelievably tedious.
And they,

497
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:20,331
when they call up,
a lot of times they call her up the 

498
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:20,331
credit card companies to,
uh,

499
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:22,680
to fight for their case.
They still have to go through that maze.

500
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,780
If you'd like to do this,
press one if you'd like to do that,

501
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,790
press two,
you know,

502
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,480
and they're trying to help them out.
So.

503
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,690
But that was one thing that I remembered
at all things he told me not to do it 

504
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,131
because don't ever use your debit card 
because if they get that and they clean 

505
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:35,131
you out,
that's your fucking mind,

506
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,790
you know,
and then all of a sudden you get a 

507
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:40,790
mortgage coming up and then you're late 
and you're like,

508
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,370
no,
but somebody took my money and blah blah

509
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:42,540
blah blah blah.
It's your credit card.

510
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,200
They have to deal with it.
I had it

511
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,220
attempt recently and uh,
I'm,

512
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:46,940
I'm,
I'm thinking,

513
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,990
I'm wondering whether or not it's 
because I switched over to windows 

514
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:51,990
because,
you know,

515
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,110
I had this windows computer now,
like I get pissed off at Mac.

516
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,520
People got mad at us clearing her throat
and I just cleared my throat again.

517
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,190
Um,
I switched over to this windows computer

518
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,840
because I get mad.
These MACs,

519
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,940
they,
they switched over all the ports and now

520
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:08,941
you have this Usb c and you have to get 
an adapter if you want to use all your 

521
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:12,841
other shit to it.
And it's like you've got Rosetta Stone 

522
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:12,841
French,
right?

523
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,030
I can't,
there's no place to stick the fucking.

524
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,540
Yeah,
you have to get an adapter.

525
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,430
You saw.
I was like,

526
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:20,431
what the fuck?
How about the iphone seven with the 

527
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:20,431
little fucking biblical code lightning 
thing?

528
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:20,431
Yeah,
yeah.

529
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:22,150
Well you can get a splitter.
Would that,

530
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,940
where it goes with a,
you can use a regular headphone Jack,

531
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
but it's all extra money,
extra money and then you fucking lose 

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,000
them.

533
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,750
I think the idea is that eventually 
there's going to be some peripherals 

534
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,510
that are more powerful and they don't 
work on the existing ports,

535
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,270
but you know,
like I got this,

536
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,280
uh,
this Lenovo thinkpad and I love it and 

537
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,130
this is the second one that I got 
because it's got everything.

538
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:44,240
It's got an Ethernet port,
it's got htmi,

539
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,850
it's got all this shit.
It's tiny.

540
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:49,360
The battery life is fucking forever.
It's got this fat battery in the bottom.

541
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:54,361
But for the first time in a long time,
somebody tried to steal my identity and 

542
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:54,361
I'm like,
Geez,

543
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:57,130
I wonder if it's has to do with that.
I wonder if it's a windows thing.

544
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,040
Does that make sense?
Not really.

545
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,470
Could be.
Could be something else.

546
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,030
I don't know.
But uh,

547
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,380
it sneaky.
But at least when I have a business 

548
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,380
management company,
they contact me.

549
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,970
They put a stop to it right away.

550
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,870
Oh,
that's cool.

551
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,020
But it's a,
it's disconcerting that your shit's out 

552
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020
there,
you know,

553
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,940
that someone's trying to find your 
social security number and attached to 

554
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,281
your credit card and buy something.
I've had an happening at the gas 

555
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,060
stations where they put that fake 
scanner on.

556
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,520
They put a fake scanner over the 
scanner.

557
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,770
So as you scan through and you're even 
allowed,

558
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,620
you even are using it like you're using 
your credit card,

559
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:37,621
you're buying gas,
but you gave them your credit card 

560
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:37,621
information.
Yeah,

561
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,740
I,
two times credit cards that's happening 

562
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,050
at gas station restaurants are another 
big double swipe thing.

563
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,540
Restaurants.
Well that's people that work there.

564
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,130
Scumbags.
You gotta go,

565
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,760
you gotta go cash as much as you can.
I know,

566
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,490
right?
Isn't that crazy?

567
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,300
This never happened.
You don't know me.

568
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,520
I know a guy.
He's dead now,

569
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:57,250
but he was one of the first credit card 
thieves.

570
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,610
His name was international sale.
That's what we used to call them because

571
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,170
uh,
when he got arrested,

572
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,690
that's what the,
that was what his nickname was,

573
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:09,691
was international south because this 
isn't like the seventies and the 

574
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:09,691
eighties.
When credit cards first came out,

575
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,980
he would get those,
uh,

576
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,020
those carbon slips from restaurants and 
they would make up new credit cards and 

577
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:20,800
then sell them to criminals and he would
just get bags and bags of cash from it.

578
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,130
And this guy was gambling who go to the 
pool hall that I went to and just,

579
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,050
he was like the most perpetual loser 
you've ever seen in your life.

580
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Like he could not win.
It was a psychological and an Oscar 

581
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,080
winning movie.
Yeah.

582
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,900
This guy's life.
Well,

583
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,150
in a way it probably should be.
I mean,

584
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,060
he was a,
he was a trip.

585
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,890
So how did he,
how did he end up dying cancer bad,

586
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,160
but colon cancer,

587
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,390
it was a real,
it was real bad.

588
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,120
And a buddy of mine's Hollywood would 
switch up the script just to calm and go

589
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:57,560
off a bridge like Thelma and Louise.
He,

590
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,630
um,
that's what happened to me the other 

591
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,451
night when I was onstage and I was 
joking about men going to the moon and 

592
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:05,450
somebody yelled out,
go see hidden figures.

593
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,200
And I was like,
yeah,

594
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:09,080
because that's a history book.
Like I just saw how people.

595
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,030
I'm not saying those obviously is women 
existed,

596
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:16,031
but like did.
Then now they're going to do the 

597
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:16,980
overcorrection where it was like these 
three women are there.

598
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,930
It's just like every time that you see a
picture of like NASA,

599
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:23,720
you'll see like a thousand,
like 100 worker bees.

600
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,200
Nobody knows their fucking names.
It's like we got there because of all of

601
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:32,201
those people.
But it's just like a second when a team 

602
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:32,201
wins a championship.

603
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:32,930
Like if they weren't at the Patriots 
win,

604
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,260
it's going to be all about Tom Brady.
You know,

605
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,690
no one's gonna know the fucking 
offensive line's name and if,

606
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:39,370
and if,
if,

607
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,550
uh,
if the Falcons win,

608
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:41,610
it's going to be about,
you know,

609
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,570
I don't know.
Julio Jones are Matt Ryan.

610
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,430
You know,
these guys would know this.

611
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,210
Tom Brady's got some wacky diet.
There was some article about Tom Brady's

612
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,940
diet being bullshit.
Do you know about Tom Brady's diet?

613
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,040
It's got some crazy diet.
No,

614
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,870
I don't get into people's personal 
lives.

615
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,390
I watched the game now,
but I don't,

616
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:02,390
I wouldn't if they only pay like Tom 
Brady talks about is what,

617
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,450
you know,
beans and fucking rice.

618
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,410
No,
fuck no,

619
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,300
I just want to watch the game.
I don't watch pre pregame,

620
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,780
postgame.
I don't need you to break it down for 

621
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,210
me.
I watched it,

622
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,900
you know,
I,

623
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:18,620
I like there's certain people that if 
they were to break it down,

624
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,990
it's the same thing with like what you 
do.

625
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,060
There's certain things like the reason 
why I like you're commentating was I 

626
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,470
learned about like the leg kicks and was
like,

627
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,480
you always hammer that home.
How much set just chops the other guy 

628
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,330
down,
aside from the fact is,

629
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,980
you know,
I've been kicked in the Shin,

630
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,270
everybody has an getting a Charlie horse
and I just don't understand like,

631
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,630
like that one that I'm conor mcgregor 
had against.

632
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:42,230
Uh,
uh,

633
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,340
what's his face there?
Uh,

634
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,460
or tease.
Now notice I'm the worst with the names.

635
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,770
It's farther than the second time.
The Gas Diaz Diaz when just watching him

636
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:57,341
repeatedly kick him in the leg.
And then in the end he mcgregor leaves 

637
00:25:57,341 --> 00:25:59,930
on crutches.
It's just like a foot.

638
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,510
Yeah.
Like how much is your adrenaline going,

639
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,340
going like crazy.
Then you feel a thing?

640
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,370
Yeah.
That you can just keep kicking somebody 

641
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,010
in their leg,
hitting the bone with the top bone of 

642
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,290
your or whatever he was in your parcels.

643
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,730
Whatever the hell it is.
And um,

644
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,290
and just keep it.
I could just picture myself kicking.

645
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,610
The guy wants going.
Ah,

646
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,140
just grabbing it and hopping up and 
down.

647
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,940
Like the guy on family guy here most of 
the time.

648
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
Feel it while it's happening.
I'm broken.

649
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,170
I broke my Shin,
I broke my foot,

650
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,080
broke both feet,
kick elbows,

651
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,220
elbows are a way that a lot of times 
guys break it because guys will cover up

652
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,890
and your foot like your instep of 
slamming to the elbow.

653
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,640
Your instep always loses,
always shins out.

654
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,520
Now when she gets wears off and you 
realize broken your instep,

655
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,460
kicking someone as hard as you can in 
their elbow.

656
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,660
What?
What is that pain like?

657
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,610
Agony.
Just throbbing.

658
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,580
Your foot swells up to like the size of 
your thigh.

659
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,150
It just gets,
becomes as big balloon of black and blue

660
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,980
and that's disgusting.

661
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,580
You know?
It's funny,

662
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:01,920
after watching my wife go through labor 
and everything,

663
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,130
I said the only men that could actually 
relate would be people who do that for a

664
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:06,780
fucking living.
Like people will fight.

665
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,910
They couldn't even relate it.
It's worse than that.

666
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,130
That's genitals,
genitals.

667
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,390
It's coming out of your vagina.
It's crazy.

668
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:19,430
No,
I got a whole new level of respect for 

669
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,430
my wife.
I was just like,

670
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,140
oh.
She told me the funniest fucking thing 

671
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,920
when she went into like pre labor,
you know,

672
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,120
and I was just going.
I was,

673
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,250
you know,
telling her to breathe and I was running

674
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:29,940
to get the stuff,
you know,

675
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,970
I was pretty prepared and there was some
code or something like that as I was 

676
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:34,970
like,
you know,

677
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,160
neo,
where did you leave the blah,

678
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:35,430
blah,
blah,

679
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:35,790
blah,
blah.

680
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,590
She goes,
when you said that to me,

681
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,350
she goes,
I was almost ready to black out with the

682
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,310
pain.
And she goes,

683
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:41,870
I,
I,

684
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,070
I had this thought if he asked me one 
more time with that code is I'm going to

685
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:49,280
push this baby out and fucking throw it 
out.

686
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,860
My wife is hilarious.
Um,

687
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,730
she's funny on your podcast to very 
funny.

688
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,490
He's funnier than a lot of comedians.
I know.

689
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:02,590
She's fucking hilarious.
And uh,

690
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,510
but she has this.
What I love about it,

691
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,700
she's got this spirit man.
She's just really like,

692
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,680
when I met her man,
like I had never met anybody,

693
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:11,920
like very few people I've met in my life
to have like an energy.

694
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:12,940
We just like,
wow.

695
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,220
I'm like,
I want to be around that.

696
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:17,040
Like she just had this amazing,
uh,

697
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,260
like really,
like she just throws herself into shit.

698
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:21,850
And I was really kind of,
uh,

699
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,640
you know,
I was more like garden and all of that,

700
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,750
so it was sort of the perfect kind of 
balance.

701
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:29,200
But every time I've,
I think I've seen the end of,

702
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,110
of that energy,
like she does something else.

703
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,850
So yeah,
it was pretty,

704
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,350
pretty amazing.
So that's good.

705
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,530
Great relationship then you're both 
growing,

706
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,910
you know,
she's growing in your.

707
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,140
Oh yeah,
no dude,

708
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,150
she's hit me with some fucking classic 
lines and one time she was calling her 

709
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,710
out on some shit she was doing and I 
just took it like a little too far.

710
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:50,740
I should've stopped like probably five 
minutes early and I was still going,

711
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:52,030
I go,
you fucking blah blah blah,

712
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,290
blah blah.
And you do this.

713
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,060
And I was in the car and right as I 
stuff.

714
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:55,690
She goes,
yeah,

715
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,770
well,
you know,

716
00:28:56,771 --> 00:29:01,771
pony righty.
That my friend and we both just burst 

717
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,400
out laughing and that was just like the 
end of the fight.

718
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,930
So she has that ability.
Um,

719
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,080
we're in the past,
you know,

720
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,260
you know,
I would date people either they were too

721
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,320
nice,
so they couldn't handle how fucked up I 

722
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,291
was or the worst,
they would just as fucked up as I was 

723
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:21,291
in.
It was totally toxic.

724
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,830
So she's just sorta like grounded.

725
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,820
Yeah,
that's,

726
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:29,210
that's so important when you're dating 
somebody or married somebody or 

727
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:29,970
whatever,
they have to compliment you and you have

728
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:33,450
to compliment them some sort of a way.
You can't be the exactly the same.

729
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,380
And who you are is different when you're
with different people,

730
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,560
you know,
if you're with a person like that who 

731
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,560
can crack a joke in the middle of the 
heat of everything,

732
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,130
you'd be become a different person.
They become a different person.

733
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:50,131
Yeah.
But if she's with somebody who doesn't 

734
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:50,131
appreciate that,
you know,

735
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:52,180
it's just like you become,
like you're not just an individual,

736
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:57,300
you're an individual who relates to 
other people and you become someone 

737
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,060
different when you relate to those 
people.

738
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,250
Yeah.
Uh,

739
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,710
it took me forever to realize that 
process.

740
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,730
It was,
how can I can't break up with this 

741
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,030
person?
That's how I figured out I was in love.

742
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,740
Well,
that's a good one too though.

743
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,190
Yeah,
no.

744
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,990
Every time I pictured breaking up with 
her,

745
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:16,360
I kept picturing her walking away and 
then me going like,

746
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:16,650
no,
no,

747
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:16,870
no,
no,

748
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:20,770
no.
Then after denying that,

749
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:22,780
that was love for a good fucking eight 
years.

750
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:23,620
I was just like,
yeah,

751
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:28,621
I guess.
I guess I have found the one doesn't 

752
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:30,810
abused word love is way too many people 
throwing that word around like a beach 

753
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,350
ball at a concert.
It's just to abused all of that shit and

754
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,530
then like all of that stuff that people 
say that when you first see a kid,

755
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,620
like they fill your head up on what the 
fuck you supposed to feel?

756
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,230
I was talking about this on a thick on 
kimball,

757
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,680
like w what I saw my kid for the first 
time.

758
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,760
I was like,
afraid.

759
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,010
Like I was like,
I didn't have that.

760
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,180
Just start crying.
I was just like,

761
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,520
hey.
And I sorta just put my finger down,

762
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:56,521
let it hold.
And when they left me alone with the 

763
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,550
first time,
like the magnitude of it was,

764
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,830
was,
was definitely huge.

765
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:02,050
But I didn't feel that whole.
Like,

766
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,750
you know,
the second I saw my kid,

767
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,990
I knew my life had changed,
but I didn't feel that for like 12 

768
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:09,990
hours.
It wasn't until the next.

769
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,640
But I think it was my head was so filled
up on what I was supposed.

770
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,760
I was like having an outer body 
experience and it wasn't until,

771
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,770
you know,
the next morning my wife was playing 

772
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:20,770
like stevie wonder,
you know,

773
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:20,770
what I mean,
some chill music and stuff.

774
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,940
And I was just sitting with her and it 
just sort of,

775
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:22,720
you know,
and you know,

776
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,650
baby baby sneezes or something like that
and he just.

777
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,030
And it just fucking hits Ya.
Yeah.

778
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,160
Um,
but even then I never had like that 

779
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,160
blubbering moment.

780
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,310
To me it was kind of scary too and kind 
of psychedelic because when,

781
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,530
uh,
when my daughter was born,

782
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:41,620
my eight year old was born.
There was a moment what I was thinking,

783
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,621
how many babies are being born 
simultaneously right now all over the 

784
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,890
world.
And if you could look at it on a screen,

785
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,810
it would be a swarm of humanity,
just just heads popping out of pussies.

786
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:57,811
It's just,
if you could see every baby coming out 

787
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:59,920
right now and then,
and then our thought at the same time,

788
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,370
I thought about this baby becoming an 
old lady and dying.

789
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,640
And I thought like how many old people 
are dying simultaneously at the same 

790
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,640
time right now?

791
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Yeah.
See,

792
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,050
I think it's actually this way that 
because every,

793
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,110
the,
the hacky thing is you're supposed to 

794
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,931
say the second I saw my kid I burst out 
crying and blah blah blah blah blah.

795
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:19,700
And then so then it becomes like,
if you don't do that,

796
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,100
you're not going to be a good dad.
You don't care.

797
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:27,101
And all of that type of stuff.
But I just think that that kind of 

798
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:27,101
became like the Hacky,
um,

799
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,450
default thing.
And then I also,

800
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,540
this is all just theories of course,
and I'm not going to research any of 

801
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,181
this,
but I think parents try to outdo each 

802
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:37,850
other with their stories about what the 
fuck they felt.

803
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,080
And it's just because like,
they're really,

804
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,210
they're really like,
they're not saying people,

805
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,960
most parents know and I've learned to 
kind of already be like,

806
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,400
they'll just sit down next to you,
like your forrest gump and they'll just 

807
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:51,890
sit down and just start talking to you.
So you just said,

808
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:53,660
you kid all right.
When the switch got to watch out for,

809
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,250
you know,
and I remember my kid and blah blah blah

810
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,840
blah.
It's like airplane.

811
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,640
You know what I mean?
With a fucking person.

812
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,590
He talks to them when you want to kill 
yourself,

813
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,450
just wait until you start going to 
school.

814
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Then you gotTa,
you gotTa hang out with these parents 

815
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,521
all the time because your kids become 
friends with their kids and then you 

816
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,550
become friends with these people that 
you would never be fucking friends with.

817
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,430
This is what I do is I just looked 
straight ahead and I don't look at him,

818
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,440
I don't respond to what they're saying.
And then they just solely talk quieter 

819
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:19,440
and they gradually leave.

820
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,660
You're going to have to go to dinner 
with them.

821
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,440
Your wife's going to be friends with 
some lady.

822
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,880
You're going to go on a double date.
Okay,

823
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:24,990
fine.
You're going to go.

824
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,740
This is one guy now he he talks and he 
doesn't look at you.

825
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,040
He tells me these fucking stupid stories
about his kid and the basketball team 

826
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,710
and he looks at you for a second.
So,

827
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,350
so Adam is in his basketball team and 
they start looking down.

828
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,430
He's like,
did the coach won't put them in the 

829
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,731
game?
What I'm saying like if he gets a good 

830
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:43,731
player could play.
I come in,

831
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,730
I can put them in the game and he's 
fucking rambling.

832
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:49,020
Rambling with no regard whatsoever for 
your attention span.

833
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:50,760
The entertainment value of what he's 
saying.

834
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,060
He's just the underlying insecurity of 
not being able to look at you.

835
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,880
Oh,
he's so in self-involved.

836
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,910
He's self involved is doing some weird 
thing with his hands were just like 

837
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,680
click talking with his hands and I'm 
going Jesus Christ.

838
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:04,670
Like literally like someone's fantasize 
about doing tool,

839
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,420
not just running,
just running away.

840
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,040
I don't want to hurt him.
The guy's hurt by life.

841
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,500
He's so damaged by live.
I don't want to do anything to him.

842
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:11,670
I just wanna get the fuck away.

843
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,750
I always picture those people and I have
a giant roll of duct tape.

844
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,930
I just put it on.
It's like a cartoon level speed.

845
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,700
No,
it's cartoon level.

846
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:26,701
I just put it on their mouth and I go 
and the last one it comes up and over 

847
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:31,741
their head and then it hangs down.
The whole rest of the tape is hanging 

848
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:35,131
down over there awkwardly and then I 
just go back to eating or whatever and 

849
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,190
they just sit there and slowly have to 
take it off.

850
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,270
It is some brutal fucking people.
It's,

851
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:49,330
you know,
there's a bunch of weird people that 

852
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:49,330
you,
you know,

853
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,870
you get closer to them and closer to 
them and you find out about their life.

854
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,310
Yeah.
But you know what?

855
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,480
All those people,
I want to do that too.

856
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm sure they're talking about me,
so for sure.

857
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

858
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:59,600
I'm sure they talked about me too.
That's just how it seemed like he was in

859
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:01,250
a bad mood now all the time.

860
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:01,880
Yeah.

861
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,150
Yeah.
This is friend of Ron White,

862
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,820
who's a friend of mine who uh,
the first time we met him he was like,

863
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:08,460
ah,
I don't know.

864
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:09,350
And Ron's like,
I'm telling you,

865
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:11,780
he's a good guy.
Like he's a dad too,

866
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:13,850
and we're all buddies together now,
but he's like,

867
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:14,600
I don't know,
I just,

868
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:19,850
I'm guarded.
I've been beaten down by some of these 

869
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,481
fucking basketball stories.
It's these assholes will tell you I had 

870
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:22,760
my kid,
he's a good player player.

871
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,761
Did you want to put them in the game?
Just you think of things that you would 

872
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,950
torture somebody talking about and you 
like,

873
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,630
I would never do this to you.
Why are you doing this to me?

874
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,490
You're not even thinking about verbal 
water

875
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,100
like in your own

876
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,360
little Guantanamo.
That's a great way to describe me.

877
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:45,540
Like when is the desert trade coming?
So I could say I don't need dessert.

878
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,120
That's part of the problem with hanging 
around with comedians too.

879
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,140
So when they say something like,
for a good percentage of it,

880
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:57,141
it's funny.
It doesn't have to be funny all the 

881
00:35:57,141 --> 00:35:58,521
time,
but a good percentage when you talking 

882
00:35:58,521 --> 00:35:58,521
to people that aren't funny at all and 
it never comes.

883
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:00,270
He likes surely there's something funny 
coming.

884
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,160
Eventually nothing,
never,

885
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,350
never something compelling.
Nothing,

886
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,440
not a goddamn thing.
Just coach and that's when I start 

887
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,260
thinking like those duct tape fantasies 
and then I start making myself laugh and

888
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:18,261
I have to pretend like I'm drinking and 
then they get all weirded out because 

889
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:21,441
they see some weird look on my face and 
it just fucking.

890
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,040
It just goes south.

891
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,810
Yeah,
I'd usually breathe.

892
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:29,811
I take these breathing exercises.
I do the Wim Hoff method where I took 

893
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:31,310
all my breath in and I let like 15,
20 percent.

894
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:31,460
Now.

895
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,930
There's no way you do that across from a
personal.

896
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,690
I guess if he's not looking at you,
he doesn't see it.

897
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,320
Yeah,
I do.

898
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:44,321
I do like to watch ready.
Any noise just got shot and you're 

899
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:46,090
waiting for the ambulance when you're 
doing good.

900
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Just trying to stay.
Stay consciously put together,

901
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,760
try to stay present.

902
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,790
I try to meditate in the face of 
overwhelming retarded conversation.

903
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,750
Just trying to detach myself from 
whatever they're saying,

904
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,400
find a,
find a happy place,

905
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,890
find a peaceful spot.
Do you ever get raw?

906
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,190
You know what Rolfing is?
It's a form of like deep,

907
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:10,620
deep tissue massage,
brutally painful shit.

908
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,830
Brutally painful.
Uh,

909
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,560
I get robbed and I,
this guy,

910
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,490
uh,
that does it.

911
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:17,250
He's fucking rough and he knows how to 
do it.

912
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,920
Hey,
this guy's rough target.

913
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,400
He,
uh,

914
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,470
he has a metal bar.
I mean,

915
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,090
it really,
it seems like a torture device.

916
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:27,390
It looks like a chisel,
like a fat wide Chisel and it has like a

917
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:32,391
thin layer of like rubber over it.
And he takes this metal bar that has 

918
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:32,391
like a,
a handle,

919
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:32,760
like a sword.

920
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,870
He's wearing a mask at this point.
I'm naked unfortunately.

921
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,760
And uh,
he's

922
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,960
digging this fucking thing into my back.
I mean digging it in like all of his 

923
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,190
weight and he's like pop popping over 
the scar tissue.

924
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,840
And uh,
I,

925
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,530
I have to go deep into my mind when he's
doing it.

926
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,570
I just go,
just go deeper and deep.

927
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,580
My eyes are closed,
my faces in that thing.

928
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,110
And then when you get a massage and that
stuff,

929
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,250
you could see my face and bill.
I like pushed and smushed into the 

930
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,340
little massage chair thing or massage 
table thing

931
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,880
they're going to do.
When that red bull jumped,

932
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,500
buddy is a world champion at that shit.
He's.

933
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,860
He's traveled more in that flying 
squirrel suit.

934
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,840
He's traveled to further distances than 
anything.

935
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,280
Do that red bull jumped that fucking guy
was.

936
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:22,281
I think it was like he was just fall.
He was just falling like a stone from 

937
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:23,940
space over here.
How about the guy that fell into a net?

938
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,340
Did you see that one?
I just did the comment.

939
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,110
I totally derailed.
You know,

940
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:28,780
it's okay.
I,

941
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,810
I find my happy space while this guy's 
doing this and I have to do that.

942
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,010
I literally,
I think I'm going,

943
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:41,011
I go deeper and deeper in my mind to 
ignore the pain because the pain is so 

944
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,840
intense.
Talk Basketball Guy is.

945
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:48,841
If I already told my wife that he did it
and it annoyed me and then what I would 

946
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,640
do is I would just be egging him on 
going like,

947
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:56,641
so why?
Why doesn't he play him and just and 

948
00:38:56,641 --> 00:38:59,580
just keep going and then she would start
kicking me under the table because she 

949
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,571
would start laughing and then I would 
have to turn what he was doing into a 

950
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:03,571
show.

951
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,910
That's the only way to do it or else I'm
just going to say.

952
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,030
I would probably,
if I actually dealt with the emotion of 

953
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,030
those kinds of moments,
I would probably start crying.

954
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,700
I would probably just break down and be 
like,

955
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
fucking doing this.
Well,

956
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:20,921
I would.
I just feel like I have to talk to the 

957
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:20,921
guy.
I feel like I wish I could die.

958
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,420
Get them high on ecstasy and talk to 
them.

959
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Just get them to completely remove all 
of his insecurities and fears and it'd 

960
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:27,480
be like,
man,

961
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,221
when you talk to people,
you got to be thinking that they're 

962
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:32,221
listening to you.
I can great suggestion for.

963
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:33,340
If you have to keep going out with a 
couple like that,

964
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:38,341
you gotta get the corner booth so then 
you're not directly across from each 

965
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:38,950
other,
so you don't have to look at him.

966
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,370
You can just.

967
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,600
You can just sit there in your 
meditation nodding and he's not going to

968
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:46,300
be looking at USC and it's peripheral as
if you're actively listening and you can

969
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,220
be looking.
It doesn't matter what this guy,

970
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,520
he clarion we'll get you.
I think he's a little on the spectrum or

971
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,590
something going on there.
There's,

972
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,760
if it bleeds,
we can kill.

973
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:59,470
It is a detachment detachment to way he 
communicates where it just,

974
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:04,471
it's uh,
seems like socially he's not present is 

975
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:06,040
very odd.
Very odd method of communication.

976
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,860
Yup.
I hear Ya.

977
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,870
I know somebody like that.
You can't talk to the guy and like you'd

978
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:12,130
want,
I'd want to like tell them like,

979
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:12,830
you know,
again,

980
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,940
you know,
you have this thing but you gotta it's 

981
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,741
gotTa be fun for the other person here.
Like there's got to be something there 

982
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:20,530
and you know,
we've all done something like that.

983
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,920
We've all said something someone didn't 
want to listen to for sure.

984
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,280
Not Me.
Oh No.

985
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,690
I walk in wearing a scarf scarf and 
those snoopy aviator goggles.

986
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,650
That's right.
Everybody wants to hear my bullshit.

987
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,320
So there was that guy that jumped,
right?

988
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:40,600
He jumped somewhere and he fell into a 
net.

989
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,500
He didn't even have a parachute.
They have like a gigantic net somewhere,

990
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,030
right?
Wasn't that what it was?

991
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,760
How far did he fall?
Twenty 5,000

992
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:50,470
feet.
Jesus Christ.

993
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,640
Look at this guy.
So he skydiving 25,000

994
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:58,390
feet and he doesn't have a parachute and
he's doing tricks.

995
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,890
What the fuck kind of impact must have 
been like,

996
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,060
oh Jesus,
look it up.

997
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,520
And at the very last minute he has to 
turn around.

998
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,550
So he's steering himself and at the very
last minute,

999
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,230
Jesus,
what kind of fear?

1000
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,150
The very last minute he has to turn.
Look at that.

1001
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,090
Holy Shit.
That's insane.

1002
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,060
I mean,
how fast is he going at that point?

1003
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,420
So now he's not moving.
Now he's crying because he can't believe

1004
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:26,670
he got away with it and he doesn't know 
why the fuck he did it.

1005
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,090
I know why he did is he,
you know what I want to hear?

1006
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:32,640
I want to hear his opening line to a 
woman in a bar.

1007
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,050
I bet it's the worst thing,
like literally to compensate rather than

1008
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:36,460
just,
you know,

1009
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,210
getting a book.
Hey baby,

1010
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:43,211
but she signed,
he's got to do this shit and then talk 

1011
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:43,211
about it loudly in the vicinity of 
women.

1012
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,260
Luke aikens is his name.
Jesus Christ.

1013
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,640
My,
my buddy Andy stumped,

1014
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:52,180
heals the world record for the longest 
in one of those flying body suits.

1015
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,700
The longest distance.
What are you traveling?

1016
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,780
Thirty miles or something?
Fucking nuts.

1017
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,210
What did he jump off of?
It jumps off everything.

1018
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,260
Planes,
whatever.

1019
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:02,120
He'll jump off a rocket if you let him.
He's crazy.

1020
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:04,760
He's a navy seal.
He's out of his fucking mind.

1021
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,060
Out of his mind.
The squirrel suits look funny.

1022
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,530
Shit.
The.

1023
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,980
Oh yeah,
I would never do it,

1024
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:14,981
but that looks fun as hell.
They get real close to the ground and 

1025
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:14,981
then they hit the ground occasionally 
and then.

1026
00:42:14,981 --> 00:42:16,110
Well,
he's humble.

1027
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,700
Real sports.
He's like his fucking toes.

1028
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,290
Oh,
that's right.

1029
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,650
Clip something with his toes.
Just came back to Frank Gallo.

1030
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,970
Brad Gum was like a guy.
Yeah.

1031
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,950
Has a bit of a death wish.
And the other report is like,

1032
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:28,430
yeah,
yeah,

1033
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:29,360
he does.
He does.

1034
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,320
He was just laying on the ground like 
moaning in this agony.

1035
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,530
The worst agony I've ever heard that was
that,

1036
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,570
don't please don't.
I'm not gonna tell you what it is 

1037
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:40,570
because it ain't gonna play like haunted
me,

1038
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,330
but I get this guy on one of these 
youtube videos,

1039
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:46,331
the guy who was climbing up the tree to 
chop it down or something and he just 

1040
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,670
fell and he went straight down and 
shattered both of his legs and dude,

1041
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,290
don't pull that up.
These,

1042
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,230
I've never walked.
I've always look away the sound.

1043
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,500
He was just in the woods because he had 
filmed himself doing.

1044
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:58,310
He was just the,
what'd you say?

1045
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,130
Like fucking over and over again.
Just like his soul.

1046
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,480
I mean like if you get,
if he had a fucking loaded nine 

1047
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:12,480
millimeter within reach,
he would have blew his brains out.

1048
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,530
Like that was the level of pain.
Jesus Christ.

1049
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,460
Yeah.
That happens.

1050
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:16,330
A lot of guys,
when they,

1051
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,770
uh,
make tree stands,

1052
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,470
they setup tree stands and some guys are
tough guys.

1053
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:23,200
They don't want to wear a harness.
Like they have these harnesses that most

1054
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,210
people where they strap around your 
waist,

1055
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:30,211
they strap around your legs and then it 
hooks to the tree so you can't fall off 

1056
00:43:30,211 --> 00:43:34,171
the tree,
but there's a lot of guys that want to 

1057
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:35,881
be tough guys,
so they climb up these tree stands and 

1058
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:38,521
they don't have a harness on and they 
fall off the tree stand and you know 

1059
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:38,950
you're falling 30 feet,
whatever it is,

1060
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:39,460
and you're just.

1061
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,700
You just fucked up.
Then you got to cry out of the woods or 

1062
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,001
not,
or someone finds you days later and you 

1063
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,580
started death.
Is anybody fallen out of the tree stand 

1064
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,160
and then getting eaten by what they were
just kind of.

1065
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,540
I'm sure.
I'm sure that's happened for bears 

1066
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:57,540
because people go bear hunting and they 
did.

1067
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,500
They'd go bear hunting and tree stands a
guarantee.

1068
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:01,540
If someone's been eating that way,
hundred percent,

1069
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,430
100,000
percent,

1070
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,640
no,
no chance.

1071
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:09,641
That hasn't.
To have enough confidence in my ability 

1072
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:13,380
to secure a tree stand correctly past a 
certain height and knowing that a bear 

1073
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:16,810
was going to become a tooth.
That's just to those two factors of,

1074
00:44:16,811 --> 00:44:19,360
of falling that length and then also,
yeah,

1075
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:24,570
it may be right in front of a bear.
What's more fucked up is how fast the 

1076
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,080
bear can get up.
A tree bears.

1077
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,570
I've seen that one.
They run up a fucking tree,

1078
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:30,520
like they're running on the ground.
It's insane.

1079
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,710
The only up to a certain size.
That's what's,

1080
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,420
what's weird.
Like when they get to be like 400 pounds

1081
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,250
plus they really can't make it up trees 
anymore.

1082
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:43,251
They're too heavy.
They're nails can't support their 

1083
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:43,251
bodyweight on Tuesdays are for 
grizzlies.

1084
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,960
They've begun to wade into the water to 
get this salmon.

1085
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:49,900
Oh,
want to do it?

1086
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,210
It's really more and more black bears 
then grizzlies or run up trees.

1087
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:55,190
But they,
uh,

1088
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,460
they run up those fucking trees.
They just brought it up and the up like,

1089
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,570
you can't.
Yeah.

1090
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,490
There's a youtube video of a guy like,
he's,

1091
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,030
he's like,
one of those stands in the fucking 

1092
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,551
thing,
looks up and just runs up the tree next 

1093
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:10,551
to him and now it's above him.
Yeah,

1094
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:11,520
in seconds.
In seconds.

1095
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,740
That's like when you get in fighting in 
a football stadium,

1096
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,300
you want to be in the row behind the 
guy,

1097
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:17,160
so you're punching down.
Oh for sure.

1098
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:22,161
Bear went from being on the field too,
like two rows behind this guy and the 

1099
00:45:22,161 --> 00:45:23,100
guy sitting there with his fucking.
I don't know what he had.

1100
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,900
Bow and Arrow or something.

1101
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

1102
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
It's bone now.
The bear doesn't know what a bow and 

1103
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,531
Arrow is.
You can kind of just slowly turned and 

1104
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:33,531
looked at him,
shoot him right in the nose.

1105
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:34,380
Can you?
Uh,

1106
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,440
you might be able to,
but it's not going to kill them 

1107
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,750
instantly.
The problem with that is they're going 

1108
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,761
to get a hold of you,
like have a bear was right there in 

1109
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:43,761
front of you and you shot it with a bow 
and arrow.

1110
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:45,030
There's two things that can happen.
One,

1111
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:47,010
it could run away or to.
It can attack you.

1112
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,000
And if it decides to attack you by the 
time it expires,

1113
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,520
it's going to take like 30 seconds for 
it to die.

1114
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,120
And by the time it expires it's kind of 
fucking mall.

1115
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:57,990
You.
Yeah know.

1116
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:02,991
But Leonardo,
he got attacked for like a minute and a 

1117
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:03,180
half.
Do it if you seen hidden figures.

1118
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,840
I found out that Leonardo story was 
supposedly based on a true story.

1119
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:14,841
We had Steve Rinella in here was a 
historian on the ancient wild west Shit 

1120
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:15,960
and he told me it was all bullshit and 
he's like,

1121
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,940
first of all,
the guy did get mauled by a bear.

1122
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,970
Yes.
But he got away and he crawled back to 

1123
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,220
camp and that's it.
Like he didn't have a son.

1124
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:28,310
His son never got killed.
Like there was no sudden like they made 

1125
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,310
all that shit up.
Yeah.

1126
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,420
Nobody fell off the cliff.
But if,

1127
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,440
if you actually made movies,
how shit really happens.

1128
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:36,441
It would be.
It'd be like you'd have to watch that 

1129
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:36,441
guy in the fucking restaurant with you 
not looking at people.

1130
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,970
That's how they would be.
That's why people go to movies because 

1131
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:42,410
you gotta have like a.
well my mom,

1132
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:47,411
my wife was watching that women's march 
after awhile he couldn't watch it 

1133
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:47,411
anymore because it wasn't going 
anywhere.

1134
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:51,410
It was 100,000
people standing outside of grain with 

1135
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:51,410
each other.
They will all in the same page.

1136
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:55,730
They would.
There was nothing like it didn't go 

1137
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:55,980
anywhere.
No arrests all over the country.

1138
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,110
Millions of people marched.
No arrests.

1139
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,850
That's pretty amazing.
That's because they're women.

1140
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:00,390
You can't hit them.

1141
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,700
That's what it was.
If those were guys,

1142
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:10,701
eventually the cops would be sick of 
them and then they'd send a plain 

1143
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:10,701
clothes guy to go down and light a car 
on fire.

1144
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:15,440
Well,
cops were there taking pictures with 

1145
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:15,440
them.
Cops were wearing those pussy hats.

1146
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,290
It was cops.
There's photos of cops with a pink hats 

1147
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:19,840
with the with ears,
like kitty cat hats.

1148
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,460
No casinos,
no.

1149
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,550
He did amazing.
Like one comment the guy makes on a bus 

1150
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,460
with billy Bush with grabbing them by 
the pussy and that literally spawns

1151
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,460
a march.
I'll tell you what's even more amazing 

1152
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,190
is that those hats are all going to be 
thrown out and end up at the bottom of 

1153
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,760
the ocean in a fucking octopus is going 
to suffocate at.

1154
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,310
Wonderful.
Look at these cops with the pussy.

1155
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,730
Hats off stupid.
Those are our protectors.

1156
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,590
They're serving and protecting right 
there with pussy.

1157
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:48,040
Hats on.

1158
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,110
I,
I,

1159
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,980
I'm anti ribbon bands,
all of that,

1160
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,540
all of that shit.
I just fucking like,

1161
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:59,541
can't you just say what the agenda is?
Do we all have to dress in the same 

1162
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,840
fucking silly hat like this as a.
If Ya'll at mit.

1163
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,340
People love that though.
I know that loves the 20 comedians.

1164
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,020
No,
you,

1165
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,480
I'm with you.
I don't like it either.

1166
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,830
I think it's a,
it's group.

1167
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:12,831
Think.
How dare those people do what they like 

1168
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:12,831
to do.
Joe,

1169
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:14,520
Donald think they liked to do it.
They just like to just get together.

1170
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,800
It's just a big just refusal of 
admitting that this guy won some crazy 

1171
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,440
popularity contests that we put on every
couple of years.

1172
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,920
They should just get together with each 
other and they should create shit that 

1173
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:27,920
makes money.
That's what they should do.

1174
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,200
Make money,
make money,

1175
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:31,870
and then they have to come to you.
It's like podcasts,

1176
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:36,871
right?
No one gave a fuck what we would do and 

1177
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:36,871
then all of a sudden we started making 
money.

1178
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:36,871
They'll say,
hey,

1179
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:37,890
you want to read for Legal Zoom?

1180
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,650
That's how you do it.
Well,

1181
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:44,210
they can definitely generate some money 
that way.

1182
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,010
Right.
I mean,

1183
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:48,680
it's a lot of fucking people marching.
You think about there was 970,000

1184
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:49,430
people.
It's a Whitney.

1185
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:52,130
Cummings told me in La alone,
they thought 80,000

1186
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:53,630
people were coming.
It was almost a million.

1187
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,510
It was a million.
Where were they?

1188
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,770
Downtown?
Oh,

1189
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:02,771
thank God.
Because it was a swarm of humanity.

1190
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,890
Oh,
that's great.

1191
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,120
That's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

1192
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,190
go downtown.
Thank God they didn't come to my fucking

1193
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:09,560
neighborhood.

1194
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:13,990
What was the last time we saw a protest 
against the president like that though?

1195
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,880
Especially a new president.
It's never.

1196
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:19,120
It's a new time.
Like with the Internet now they can.

1197
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,300
They can organize these things quickly 
and get together.

1198
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,840
Yeah.
I mean I don't.

1199
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:25,810
I don't know what to belief.

1200
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Like that whole picture of of trump's 
inauguration versus Obama's 

1201
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
inauguration.
They put the photos side by side and I'm

1202
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:35,530
just supposed to automatically without 
any checks and balances,

1203
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,100
be like,
okay,

1204
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:41,101
that's what those photos are of.
I'm supposed to believe that Bill 

1205
00:49:41,101 --> 00:49:44,610
Clinton was checking out donald trump's 
wife without seeing what he's looking 

1206
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,910
at,
and then hillary vaguely looking back in

1207
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:49,540
his direction vaguely,
and people are here through his soul.

1208
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,640
How could you tell she was turned 
around?

1209
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:56,850
Oh,
we'll show you because we've watched it 

1210
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:56,850
a thousand times,
but he's looking at.

1211
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:56,850
He says it.
He says,

1212
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,020
well,
he says it.

1213
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,030
He literally says it.
He moves his mouth.

1214
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:01,970
He goes,
Ivanka,

1215
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,500
once he had,
come on,

1216
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,530
we want to watch it together.
Watch this.

1217
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:05,990
Look,
look,

1218
00:50:05,991 --> 00:50:06,310
look,
look,

1219
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:06,910
go,
fullscreen.

1220
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,740
Jamey.
Watch Ivanka.

1221
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,550
Go back,
go back.

1222
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:10,330
Come back.
He says it.

1223
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,350
Replace it a couple times here,
right here.

1224
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,420
Watch this.
Look at her.

1225
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,150
Looking at him.
She ain't vaguely looking back.

1226
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:22,460
She's peering through his soul as he 
stares at her and look at that shit.

1227
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:22,880
Gonna.
Look,

1228
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,270
look,
he is or she turns away.

1229
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:28,100
Immediately watch it.
He's looking at

1230
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,890
you don't know what's going on.
He's looking right at Ivanka.

1231
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,350
He says it.
Go back to it.

1232
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,450
Go back to go back to the beginning,
the very beginning,

1233
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:37,100
the very beginning,
the very beginning.

1234
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,980
You're sending them.
Know Jamie,

1235
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,760
you missed it.
Go all the way to the very beginning,

1236
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,490
the very beginning of the video.
Now we already missed it.

1237
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,570
You missed it because he says it.
Beginning Scott.

1238
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,650
This.
Okay.

1239
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,260
Okay,
here we go.

1240
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,480
Ivanka said,
I see the car.

1241
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,640
Oh,
I see it.

1242
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,320
I don't see it here,
mom.

1243
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:55,660
Well,
what's let's.

1244
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,260
Let's make up something for the Air 
Force Guy.

1245
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,940
Let's see what to see.
What the fuck he's doing.

1246
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,460
Ivanka and the sunglasses right there.
Jerking off.

1247
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,040
That's why it's head isn't moving 
slowly.

1248
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,970
Masturbating on your.
You denying that.

1249
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:08,900
Look,
she's given him.

1250
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:10,180
Look at that fucking looks.
She's getting them.

1251
00:51:10,181 --> 00:51:15,181
She's stare and look at the Shah when he
shoots over at her and she takes a big 

1252
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:15,181
deep breath.

1253
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:19,100
Just him look at it and he stared her 
down and she looked at what's right.

1254
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,390
He's the fucking man of the 
relationship.

1255
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,530
Watch.
You can watch it again.

1256
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,030
Come on,
come on.

1257
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:28,230
And she,
she has her mouth open and she turns 

1258
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,230
away like,
oh Jesus.

1259
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,020
Hi everyone.
I'm Ivanka trump steaks.

1260
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,880
I tracy,
Lord sister in the eighties.

1261
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,710
He's got good looking kids.
He does.

1262
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,860
He does.
Amazing.

1263
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,650
She's good looking too.
She's amazing.

1264
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:37,940
Good for him,
good for him,

1265
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:45,490
and if Bill Clinton wants to vaguely 
look in the direction of a beautiful 

1266
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,361
woman off camera that none of us want to
know when you want to convict him on 

1267
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:49,750
what he might've said.
Ivy,

1268
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,820
he might've been like fucking like 
lightheaded.

1269
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,890
I think he was.
I think it was growing like inside

1270
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,300
with his mouth shut.
You could not convict anybody who's 

1271
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,490
convicted in a court of law.
You are legal or illegal.

1272
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:09,250
You are judging podcast humanity.
I am judging them.

1273
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,780
You just send them to the chair.
But the podcast court is a lot like 

1274
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:14,780
civil court.
You know,

1275
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,430
criminal,
criminal court,

1276
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:18,520
you need a lot more evidence.
That's why I got off in criminal court.

1277
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:22,030
I never understood that.
He gets off when you need more evidence,

1278
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,250
less evidence.
He has to give away all his shit.

1279
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,960
I'm not saying that.
That doesn't make any sense.

1280
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:26,710
No,
it doesn't.

1281
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,740
It doesn't.
Why do you need more evidence that he 

1282
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:31,740
did it or he didn't?
You shouldn't be like acquitted.

1283
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:31,900
You didn't do it.
Oh,

1284
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,240
now you got to give me your,
your trophies in your house.

1285
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,080
Yeah.
What is that?

1286
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:37,480
And you fucking tie tacks.
How the fuck does that work?

1287
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:42,540
How can they have a civil court where 
you have less evidence and that's where 

1288
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,030
all your money goes.
Like your freedom is worth more.

1289
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,810
It works out because um,
or sort of worked out.

1290
00:52:49,811 --> 00:52:51,310
I think he moved to Florida to get 
around it.

1291
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,750
I don't know what the fuck happened but 
like,

1292
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,600
because I think he did it,
but what am I basing that on?

1293
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,760
You know,
Shit.

1294
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:02,761
I mean he's in jail for a very innocuous
crime trying to get his own shit back 

1295
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:05,590
with a guy in the room that had a gun.
The guy didn't even brandished the gun.

1296
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:08,350
He tried to get his shit back.
He is stolen.

1297
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,030
Memorable thing on that.
And,

1298
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,320
and they,
they made,

1299
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:16,410
they fucked up by a,
they made some threat that then it made 

1300
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:17,870
it kidnapping.
And they did,

1301
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:20,770
they did all these little fucking things
and he killed,

1302
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:22,480
you know,
he killed two white people.

1303
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:26,190
So that's the big.
The white court's got him years later.

1304
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,120
That's the big one.
That's really what mean it's complete 

1305
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,251
bullshit because the reality is if he 
didn't kill those fucking two people at 

1306
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:34,320
least where people didn't think that he 
killed those fucking two people.

1307
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,820
If he did that,
I mean they,

1308
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,920
they,
he was Oj they and he was still on 

1309
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,211
fucking nfl today or whatever.
Like he probably would have been in and 

1310
00:53:44,211 --> 00:53:44,640
out and that would have been it.

1311
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,750
He might not even done any time.
They might've like sided with him 

1312
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,150
because these people were stealing his 
stuff.

1313
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:55,180
He would have agreed to do was couple of
signings at fucking Caesar's sides of 

1314
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,490
football helmets and it would have been 
over seas.

1315
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,600
It would have been over.
There.

1316
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,400
Would have been.
It would have gone to the Venetian where

1317
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:00,950
they have a boat rides and.
Oh yeah.

1318
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,450
Oh yeah.
Oh Jay.

1319
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:09,250
That's a weird one though.
Everybody's asking about anything.

1320
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,880
He's just taking pictures and doing boat
rides.

1321
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,650
No signing folks know.
Signing.

1322
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:15,380
Still take pictures though.
Can't use your camera.

1323
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,180
It'll be up online.
Caesar's dot com.

1324
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,920
Yeah.
That'll be it.

1325
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,900
Yeah.
Don't touch them.

1326
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:23,150
Just stand next to him.
That's a weird case,

1327
00:54:23,151 --> 00:54:24,950
right,
because that's a case where we know that

1328
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:26,840
that's not why he's in jail,
but we're all happy.

1329
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,280
Um,
well,

1330
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:30,650
I mean,
I,

1331
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,030
I don't,

1332
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,350
I don't know how I feel about all that 
fucking shit.

1333
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,050
I mean,
I think he got,

1334
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,120
did it.
He did it.

1335
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,370
He did.
He wrote a book about it.

1336
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,640
Remember that if I did it,
I want to tell you or something.

1337
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,690
I think it was called the.
If I did it was that this is how I would

1338
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,410
do it now.

1339
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,310
Yeah.

1340
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,340
Whatever happened to that book.
That book never got published,

1341
00:54:52,341 --> 00:54:53,990
right?
Like no publisher wanted to.

1342
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:58,060
They originally had a publishing deal,
but then is

1343
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,640
difference about all.
This is why I.

1344
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:04,910
That rubs me the wrong way that he's in 
jail is because all those fucking white 

1345
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:05,680
dudes that did all that shit like blown 
up churches with black people in it.

1346
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:10,681
Like back in the sixties,
they would literally be sitting there 

1347
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:12,421
laughing during the trial and they would
get totally acquitted and then black 

1348
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:14,230
people weren't allowed to come along and
take that fucking four wheelers in their

1349
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,280
hillbillies.
Shit.

1350
00:55:15,281 --> 00:55:17,500
This stills afterwards in like a civil 
court,

1351
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,990
they just completely got away with.
That's why it,

1352
00:55:19,991 --> 00:55:22,600
it still seems kind of fucked up.
It's for sale,

1353
00:55:22,601 --> 00:55:24,420
but they changed the uh,
the uh,

1354
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,830
judge awarded the golden family,
the rights to the book.

1355
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:28,420
So they get the publishing.
Oh,

1356
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:29,610
so you can buy it.
Yeah.

1357
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,060
So it says it's by Fred and Kim Goldman,
but oh my God,

1358
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,500
they didn't write it all and what they 
did.

1359
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,200
Oh,
they took away if.

1360
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:37,780
No,
they,

1361
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,130
they put the.
If,

1362
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,350
uh,
I forget how I did it because I just saw

1363
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:44,620
a thing on the F is written in red 
letters inside the eye.

1364
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,490
Oh Wow.
There it is.

1365
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,370
That right there.
That's crazy.

1366
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,750
And it's written blood red.
Wow.

1367
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,540
Well,
what,

1368
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,060
what,
what cases are you talking about?

1369
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,080
A guy's blowing up.
I mean,

1370
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:03,110
obviously there were some horrendous 
civil rights violations that took place 

1371
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,020
in the sixties and the fifties as well.
And well,

1372
00:56:04,021 --> 00:56:06,810
you know,
all from slavery on from the 18,

1373
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:07,790
60 [inaudible] just saying,

1374
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,920
yeah.
And then the table gets turned and this 

1375
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,590
guy does it,
but he has the money to get off.

1376
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,810
But then he still pays for it in a way,
so that's why it just,

1377
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,210
it doesn't,
it still doesn't seem,

1378
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:20,430
you know,
it's good because,

1379
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,660
you know,
he killed two people,

1380
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:23,010
so he's,
he's not out there,

1381
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,140
but it's,
it's,

1382
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,630
I don't know,
different crime though.

1383
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:30,160
I mean what he did was a crime of 
passion against an ex wife who happen to

1384
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:35,161
be with some other guy.
Those other crimes are in a lot of ways 

1385
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:36,910
more heinous because they're completely 
race related.

1386
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:40,430
If you go back to some of the lynchings 
and some of those horrific guys,

1387
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,170
you know,
they got.

1388
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,970
They fucking took pictures.
Yeah.

1389
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,730
You ever see those photos are the 
scariest photos.

1390
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,520
Scalia's vote.
Yeah.

1391
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Kids smiling and they have evil and they
have like evil and like the kids have 

1392
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,660
like,
I remember,

1393
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,680
uh,
Patrice would show me those photos and 

1394
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:57,680
would point it.
The kid's going,

1395
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,200
look at that girl bill.
She's like,

1396
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:01,930
probably 48 right now.
Where the fuck is she?

1397
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,780
What does she do for a living?
And I was just like,

1398
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,100
wow.
It's true.

1399
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,810
It's true.
They're out there.

1400
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,260
Yup.

1401
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:09,940
Yeah.
Well,

1402
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:13,060
when you think about how many people 
have actually gotten arrested for murder

1403
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:16,480
versus how many murders get just never 
solved is,

1404
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,500
and it's a crazy number when everybody 
looks at those fucking TV shows about 

1405
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,720
cops and most crimes get solved.
But the reality of murders,

1406
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:28,150
I think it's like something like 70 
percent go on,

1407
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,910
solved something really nutty like that.
Yeah.

1408
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:33,160
I talked to a cop about that one time 
and I won't say it over the year.

1409
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,220
It's fucking brutal.
We won't say it over the air because 

1410
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:38,220
it's that bad.
Well,

1411
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,660
I just don't want to fucking murder.
Yeah.

1412
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,620
Give people the green light.
Yeah.

1413
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,680
Oh yeah.
Because we tried to come up with the 

1414
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:46,680
perfect murder,
right?

1415
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,320
Me and this other guy to Rosa on this 
podcast.

1416
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:50,770
And then we had this cop listened to 
listen to our,

1417
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,090
uh,
our plants.

1418
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,890
Mine was the funniest guys go.

1419
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,210
All right.
So me and a buddy and he goes,

1420
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:56,020
it's over.
He goes,

1421
00:57:56,021 --> 00:58:00,160
you already cut what you involve.
Somebody else.

1422
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:05,430
It goes,
somebody's going to get scared and 

1423
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,430
they're gonna.
They're gonna.

1424
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
Cut a deal.
He goes,

1425
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,760
it was fucking hilarious,
dude.

1426
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:11,760
I got like literally and I had worked 
this whole thing out in New Jersey.

1427
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,630
We're trying to top each other to see 
which one was better and I got like,

1428
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,580
it's like when you watch American Ninja 
Warrior and the person stumbles on those

1429
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:20,080
first thing and it goes right into the 
water.

1430
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:23,340
That's what happened.
So he told us basically how to get out.

1431
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:23,960
I guess,
you know,

1432
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,980
the audio does exist.
So he basically said if you have no 

1433
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,790
priors and nobody fucking knows,
you know,

1434
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,960
you've never done anything and if you,

1435
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:39,510
if you were to do it,
somebody just completely not even 

1436
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,510
connected to.
Yeah.

1437
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:40,390
That's a buddy of mine has said the same
thing.

1438
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:45,391
Nobody saw it.
Like there's nothing like there's no 

1439
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:45,391
way.
There's no.

1440
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,750
Because there's no rational connection 
to it.

1441
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,840
There's no trail to follow.
Have you heard of this stuff that 

1442
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,931
they're,
they're developing that's essentially 

1443
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,510
micro cameras with gps units that are 
the size smaller than a grain of rice,

1444
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:02,790
like literally like sand.
And the idea is that eventually they're 

1445
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,991
going to spread this shit everywhere and
there will be cameras that record 

1446
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:09,820
everything everywhere you go.
And it's just a matter of time,

1447
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,060
like now there's more cameras now today 
than they've ever been before.

1448
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:18,061
Right.
Phones and surveillance cameras and 

1449
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:18,061
security cameras.
That one right now,

1450
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:22,690
right there.
There's more cameras now than ever been 

1451
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,931
before.
But it's nothing compared to what they 

1452
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:26,621
have potentially lined up for the future
that they're going to have like grains 

1453
00:59:26,621 --> 00:59:27,290
of sand cameras everywhere.

1454
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,650
You just vacuum your house to scoop them
up.

1455
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm talking about out there in the 
street.

1456
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,930
They don't give a shit and it's fucking 
show me jerking off.

1457
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,150
You don't to.
Can I at least have that target?

1458
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,580
Will there ever be a time where there's 
no privacy?

1459
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,970
That's the question.
Will there be a time with the zero 

1460
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:48,970
privacy?
Well,

1461
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:48,970
it doesn't exist.
This is the thing.

1462
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:53,081
The reason why they're going to get away
with it is because people have such 

1463
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:54,170
fucking voyeurs.
Like the more private it is,

1464
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:56,420
the less I want to see it because I 
always think like,

1465
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:58,040
I wouldn't want someone to do that to 
me.

1466
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,770
Right.
So anytime there's like a,

1467
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,690
Oh God,
I can't even think of an example.

1468
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:07,691
But there's just,
there's just been some micro celebrity 

1469
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:07,691
photos that got leaked where they got 
into their icloud.

1470
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:08,450
They like naked photos of.

1471
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,880
I never look at those fucking things.
It really.

1472
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,870
If somebody,
you know,

1473
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:13,880
intercepts,
like a cell phone call,

1474
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,890
I don't listen to those things.
I just,

1475
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,060
I just think,
uh,

1476
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,670
your moral.
If it feels gross.

1477
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah.
Good.

1478
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:20,720
Well,
good for you.

1479
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,130
You're moral,
you're more a person.

1480
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,090
That's good.
Yeah.

1481
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:23,910
And it may not.
I don't know.

1482
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:24,420
I,
I'm,

1483
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,450
I wouldn't say I'm a moral person,
but had just in that,

1484
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:27,830
in that instant,
maybe I am.

1485
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:32,390
You're definitely moral moral.
Don't put me on that pedestal.

1486
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,200
You are.
I mean,

1487
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:34,700
you're not,
you're not ridiculous.

1488
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,230
I mean you're just a guy,
but do you have morals?

1489
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,320
You gotta get slightly annoyed and a gas
station and for the rest of the day you 

1490
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,290
have a lot of work.
I've got a lot of work,

1491
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,850
lot of work ahead of me.
You should get a punching bag.

1492
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,870
I have a speed bag.

1493
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:57,100
That's not good enough.
I guess it is now because speed bags 

1494
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,980
just,
it's not rich is no real system exists.

1495
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,790
And I hit it and I enjoy it.
I blew a bet you do.

1496
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,380
And it's good.
I do enjoy it.

1497
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,350
And then I go and I play some drums and 
I enjoy that.

1498
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,240
I'm,
I'm not degrading it,

1499
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,540
but I'm saying it's not good enough.
I thought you were very judgmental.

1500
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,580
I am.
I told you certain things.

1501
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:21,581
I jumped in that I can hold in these 
beautiful hands of mine told me it 

1502
01:01:21,581 --> 01:01:24,740
wasn't real because people are fucking 
weird.

1503
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:27,830
It's a weird position to hold your hand.
Seen hidden figures.

1504
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,360
The habit I heard.
It's good.

1505
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:34,390
The women got us on the real break.
Speed bags versus heavy bags down in a 

1506
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,840
way that you've never.
You've never heard.

1507
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,850
Oh beautiful.
That's beautiful.

1508
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:45,830
No heavy bag.
Won't even sit there and fuck up my 

1509
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,951
hands and fuck up your hands for this 
because my technique will be fucked up 

1510
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:51,101
because I don't have the time Joe,
to go to the Dojo like you have for 30 

1511
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:55,061
fucking years and get it down and I'm 
going to go in there and I'm going to 

1512
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:56,090
fuck up my wrist and I'll hit it with 
the wrong.

1513
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:56,480
Well,
yeah,

1514
01:01:56,481 --> 01:02:01,481
once you get a water bottle,
your hands get a water bag.

1515
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,650
Water bags are like literally like 
you're punching into water.

1516
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:07,850
It's heavy.
We live in a desert,

1517
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:09,250
but it just goes,
gosh,

1518
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,870
same water will be there forever.
It's raining now.

1519
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,180
Kept plenty,
right?

1520
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:15,500
They said the drought is over.
Like it's like,

1521
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:17,240
no,
we have enough water right now.

1522
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,660
This now has to last us.
Who?

1523
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,040
Who the knows when it's going

1524
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,350
to rain again,
somebody like the mayor is some shit.

1525
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,960
Said that out here,
but drive is now officially over now.

1526
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,180
Reduce bag out.
There's taken an extra long shower,

1527
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,370
will listen to ears.
Never stopped modern.

1528
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,780
Those fucking golf courses.
The golf course.

1529
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,420
This is a huge problem,
but they they.

1530
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:34,200
You know what?
They stay.

1531
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:39,180
Stop watering the median strip on sunset
and beverly hills.

1532
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,770
That was unsettling.
I was like,

1533
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:42,460
wow.
They let enrich people's grass.

1534
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:44,010
Go fucking Brown.
This is scary.

1535
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,230
This is getting real.
Well,

1536
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:47,220
they had rules,
right?

1537
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:52,221
Like you were only supposed to water 
your thing at night and you can only 

1538
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:52,221
water at a certain amount of times a 
day.

1539
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:57,110
Like when it comes to your lawn,
but they didn't have those rules with 

1540
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,110
golf courses.
Do they golf courses?

1541
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,730
Like especially private ones,
they spend millions and millions of 

1542
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,670
gallons of water every year just in La.
Yeah.

1543
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,250
I don't know.
Do you golf?

1544
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:06,540
No.
Good for you.

1545
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,510
I don't.
It's so fucking mind.

1546
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:14,511
Numbingly boring.
I can't get into a sport where there's 

1547
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:16,590
nobody trying to stop me.
If you need to get yourself,

1548
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,210
I'm going to forgive myself.
You'll get them the next toll.

1549
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,740
Like I don't give a shit.
It's so fucking um,

1550
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,930
I respect it.
It's,

1551
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:27,510
it's.
I don't,

1552
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,350
I don't think it's a sport,
but I think the,

1553
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,830
the people that are the best at it are 
athletic,

1554
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,160
but I have seen it.
The people that I've seen do that,

1555
01:03:35,161 --> 01:03:37,290
I'm telling you if you throw a ball at 
them,

1556
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,590
they would tense up.
They just don't have any athletic 

1557
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,200
ability.
They will get on a golf course and they 

1558
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,200
can keep it on the course and they can 
shoot,

1559
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,340
you know,
they can break 100.

1560
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:47,970
You know,
I,

1561
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,750
I just,
uh,

1562
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,030
oh.

1563
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:51,660
In the,
in the fucking pageantry of it,

1564
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:56,661
all,
the fucking clothes and the bags that 

1565
01:03:56,661 --> 01:04:00,440
either is that don't think there's ever 
been a fucking sport because there's so 

1566
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,610
many fat fuck non non athletic people 
playing it.

1567
01:04:02,611 --> 01:04:04,740
There has never been a sport that is 
adjusted.

1568
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,420
The equipment,
the ball,

1569
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,660
the fucking,
the clubs that you use to give you more 

1570
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,991
distance to help you hit it straighter.
It's like literally the only thing 

1571
01:04:14,991 --> 01:04:15,120
missing on a fucking driver now is 
training wheels.

1572
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,590
It's fucking Bro.
They should just have it,

1573
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,010
guide you back and then come,
come right through us.

1574
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:22,080
Truly baseball never went to aluminum 
bats.

1575
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,120
If they did it,
they looked at the college level.

1576
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,800
But at the pro level they just like,
no man,

1577
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,750
you can't,
you can't do this.

1578
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,920
Um,
they but they.

1579
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,440
But baseball when they,
when they were going through,

1580
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:36,470
you know,
no one was watching it and it wasn't 

1581
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,470
exciting,
you know,

1582
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,470
they,
you know,

1583
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,250
they made the stadium smaller that 
juiced up the ball.

1584
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,590
People on Roids,
they look the other way like,

1585
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:42,210
well Huh,
I didn't know that.

1586
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:48,410
And they just had these King Kong guys 
going up there and just smashing them 

1587
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,460
over the fence and I'm.
But I'm just saying like,

1588
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:55,490
like I dunno,
I like when guys got busted for Cork in 

1589
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,951
the bat.
I thought that was the most ridiculous 

1590
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:58,380
thing to get in trouble for.
Put a cork inside the bat.

1591
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:02,910
Bats would break what's in Japan.
But that was always.

1592
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:03,510
That was.
Oh,

1593
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:04,860
that's another one too.
I couldn't watch.

1594
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:09,861
That's just so embarrassing to try to 
pick it up and just cover up the cork.

1595
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,040
Well this is what you should do.
Like if you're going to do that like the

1596
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:17,620
entire time you're a pro,
you should.

1597
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,870
The bad boys should never have to deal 
with your shit.

1598
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,740
You always get.
It's okay.

1599
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:21,700
Sunny.
I got into like,

1600
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:22,030
look at me.

1601
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:27,030
So down to earth.
So then when you finally get bust with 

1602
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,030
you,
corked bat,

1603
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,030
when you go to pick it up,
no one's going to look at you weird.

1604
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,910
But the thing is these,
you know,

1605
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:29,980
these,
these majorly baseball guys,

1606
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:34,981
they just fucking dropped the bat and 
some little eight year old scurries out 

1607
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:36,520
and picks it up.
So the second that you give a fuck about

1608
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:37,450
that little eight year old,
like,

1609
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:39,130
I think you've run enough there,
sonny boy,

1610
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,810
like I think they realized that,
uh,

1611
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,050
that's on the outcomes over.
You could see the cork,

1612
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:48,560
right when it snaps out.
I mean the,

1613
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:50,790
the,
the average sports fan,

1614
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,670
we be to lie.
No,

1615
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,460
I said that a month ago.
I can't think of the fucking bat breaks.

1616
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:59,461
I have no idea.
It's not until they pick it up and they 

1617
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:01,381
start looking at it.
And then the announcer literally tells 

1618
01:06:01,381 --> 01:06:01,381
me,
Oh,

1619
01:06:01,381 --> 01:06:03,520
they're inspecting his bad.
This could possibly be a court situation

1620
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:04,300
then.
Then I know.

1621
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,720
How much of a difference does it make to
have cork in the bat?

1622
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,710
It's just,
it's just a competitive edge.

1623
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,330
I mean,
you still have to have the barrel of the

1624
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:15,430
bat meet the ball,
which is so fucking hard.

1625
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:20,431
You still have to do that.
But it could be the difference between 

1626
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:20,431
going and getting to the warning track

1627
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:26,370
and going over and just hitting the wall
and getting into a double or something.

1628
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:27,850
That's the only.
That's it.

1629
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:32,851
Just that little amount.
It's just gives it just a little little 

1630
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:33,940
little push.
No Shit.

1631
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,060
Sammy socials.
Downfall began 13 years ago.

1632
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,550
Today.
That's Sammy Sosa got busted with Cork.

1633
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:45,270
So what do they do?
They drill a hole in the bat and then 

1634
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,540
just hollow it out somehow or another.
What the fuck's going on in that one?

1635
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:48,840
That picture you just showed.
What's that?

1636
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,840
That might've been the one.
They picked it up off the ground.

1637
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,380
They're cutting grass or some show.
So I didn't know.

1638
01:06:55,381 --> 01:06:56,420
I thought there was like a,
they,

1639
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:59,130
they drilled a hole.
I was trying to follow this down.

1640
01:06:59,131 --> 01:06:59,700
It says,
uh,

1641
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:02,430
if a court has been courted transfers 
less energy to the ball,

1642
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:06,480
which makes sense to me.
But transfer is less energy to the ball.

1643
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,680
Huh?
I don't know.

1644
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:11,360
Well that doesn't make any sense.
Yeah,

1645
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,340
that doesn't make sense to me.
Although I have no physics.

1646
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,410
Well why don't you?
Uh,

1647
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,640
well it seems to me that it makes more 
sense that if a bat was solid,

1648
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,040
that does make sense.
You give them that with solid,

1649
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:27,050
more massive a transformer,
but if you would be able to swing it 

1650
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:29,981
faster if it was lighter.
So you thought it was because it was 

1651
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:30,160
more of a spongy thing.
Yeah,

1652
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:31,340
that's what I thought too.
You know what?

1653
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:33,500
And that's right because I think they 
drove from the top.

1654
01:07:33,501 --> 01:07:38,501
Thank God you said that because it was 
probably a bunch of people screaming 

1655
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,020
right now.
Fucking you fucking moron.

1656
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,220
It's lighter.
You Cut.

1657
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:41,810
Oh,
that's what it is.

1658
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,750
We start like they had it like up 
against the,

1659
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:46,880
uh,
like flush with it.

1660
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,380
Dude,
that doesn't make any sense.

1661
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,970
That doesn't not like,
think about that.

1662
01:07:49,971 --> 01:07:52,520
That's like having a nerf bad up there.
The fucking bat would break.

1663
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,750
I thought it was,
which I guess it does bounce more boring

1664
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:02,370
for your listeners.
For the record I said I had no physics 

1665
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:02,370
background,
so definitely don't know.

1666
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:02,810
I don't.
Yeah,

1667
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:04,850
I would think that it would,
it would hit harder.

1668
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:09,851
Right.
It's just so it's just a matter of it 

1669
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:10,130
being faster,
speed coming through.

1670
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,340
Interesting.
Which is why they switched it.

1671
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,390
When they're warming up,
they swing all those other bats.

1672
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,190
They swing two right

1673
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:21,540
now.
One would they put a weight on the bat 

1674
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:21,540
and I swing that.
Yep.

1675
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:21,650
Yeah.
Which actually helps.

1676
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:23,780
Some people say it helps.
Some people say it doesn't help.

1677
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:28,781
Why don't you guys do that and yet you 
guys like run with like weighted vests 

1678
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:28,800
on through the mountains.
Yeah,

1679
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:34,090
it's bad for your joints,
but some guys do it the best way to do 

1680
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:34,310
it as hiking,
hiking with weighted vest is okay,

1681
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:37,010
but running really not such a good idea.
Especially.

1682
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,580
There's a lot of guys that do it though.
They'll put a weighted vest on.

1683
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,490
They run on concrete hard assets and 
that Tito Ortiz fight.

1684
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:44,990
I saw Tito won.
He Won.

1685
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,300
He choked him out.
It was quick fight.

1686
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,450
He got caught in a good team early in 
the fight,

1687
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,730
but child lost the guillotine and Tito 
gun on top.

1688
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:57,200
Tito took us back and he got like.
It was like sort of a rear naked choke,

1689
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:58,610
but more of like a face crush.

1690
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,140
He just Tito's,
just a gorilla.

1691
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,150
Just kinda get.
A lot of people thought it was a work.

1692
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:07,151
They thought it was fake,
that it was a fake fight because he did 

1693
01:09:07,151 --> 01:09:07,151
it so easily.
Well,

1694
01:09:07,151 --> 01:09:09,020
it looked fake because the choke wasn't 
in right,

1695
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:10,810
but it wasn't fake.
He just kinda he.

1696
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,190
He did what we call Gundam.
You goons,

1697
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:18,191
somebody like there's some times like 
you could just get someone's head and 

1698
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:20,120
just crush it and you're goon them.
Whereas the right technique to do that,

1699
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:22,820
to make the right technique is you go 
under the chin,

1700
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:28,030
you wrap your head around the back of 
the neck and that way that he can just 

1701
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:28,910
get maximum leverage and it's perfect 
technique,

1702
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,850
but he just seemed lower jaw to the back
of his head.

1703
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:35,420
If someone's eye socket.
So like right there and I get their head

1704
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,600
and I'm fresh early in the fight because
you're not even tired and you get 

1705
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:40,670
fucking crush their head.

1706
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:45,670
You can goon somebody.
There's a lot of guys have been gooned 

1707
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:45,670
you know that word dude?
Yeah.

1708
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:50,590
Gooning Jujitsu word like this.
There are certain techniques you do 

1709
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:50,590
like,
you know,

1710
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:54,290
it's funny is it just totally defines 
what the second one says.

1711
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:59,310
I know what that is.
He just had no respect for my style 

1712
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:02,441
walkthrough.
All my pussy kicks and hits and just 

1713
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:02,441
fucking,
you know,

1714
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:02,500
grabbed my nostril right.
It right it.

1715
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:02,950
Right.
You know,

1716
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,280
what do you watch?
Game of thrones?

1717
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:05,990
Um,
I stopped.

1718
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:08,690
My wife would just would refuse to get 
into it.

1719
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:10,520
So,
uh,

1720
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,320
you know,
do you remember the mountain?

1721
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,380
I just,
I didn't want them out and grab that 

1722
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:17,380
guy's head and he crushed it.
He gunned him,

1723
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:20,210
grabbed his head and he just smashed his
head with his hands.

1724
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,210
The only one I saw was when that little 
shit king,

1725
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,970
you know,
didn't like the song this guy saying and

1726
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,840
he fucking goes,
all right,

1727
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,830
rip his tongue out.

1728
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,240
Yeah.
And I was just like,

1729
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:29,660
what?
Like,

1730
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:32,330
who the fuck would listen to this little
shit to this guy?

1731
01:10:32,331 --> 01:10:34,130
So he slips,
the guy,

1732
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:35,600
gets on top of him,
grabs him,

1733
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:41,590
and he just fucking goons him.
He grabs his head and he fucking goons 

1734
01:10:42,381 --> 01:10:47,381
them.
Boom man,

1735
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,320
what the fuck?
That guy is fucking gigantic too.

1736
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,640
Like she's upset.
Meanwhile the other guy was killed on 

1737
01:10:59,640 --> 01:10:59,900
it.
I love is watching a fight to the death,

1738
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:01,760
but they've never seen it done like 
that.

1739
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,190
So there's always that level of gross 
out.

1740
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,560
It's like working your way through porn.
Yeah.

1741
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:09,320
Will you just start off with the basic 
sit and all of a sudden you just go into

1742
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:14,321
darker and darker rooms?
That's the same thing when it watch 

1743
01:11:14,321 --> 01:11:15,120
watching people's fucking get hurt.
Yeah.

1744
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,140
Right.
Like torture.

1745
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:19,380
And some of the death is more terrifying
to people than just shooting them from a

1746
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:21,330
distance as a sniper.
Yeah.

1747
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:23,010
You could watch the.
Yeah,

1748
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:28,060
fucking like the fact that human beings 
understand pain and then they inflict it

1749
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:32,400
like slowly and other people is,
is the most fucking like animalistic.

1750
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:36,870
Like every time I hear that shit that 
people get that little literally torture

1751
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:39,410
another human being like how you go home
at the end of the day

1752
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:41,620
they think and you did something good is
just fucking out.

1753
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,480
I just got to get information out of 
people,

1754
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:44,120
Bill Burr,
the.

1755
01:11:44,121 --> 01:11:49,121
Some people out there that know things.
You've got to find out what they know 

1756
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:52,171
in.
The best way to do it is to cut their 

1757
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:52,171
fingers off.
Well,

1758
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:52,171
haven't they proved that when you start 
to cut,

1759
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:53,470
just to tell someone to cut your finger 
off,

1760
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,360
they will tell you whatever the fuck you
want.

1761
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:56,470
I would,
yeah,

1762
01:11:56,471 --> 01:12:01,471
but sometimes sometimes they won't.
Sometimes they'll tell you some fake 

1763
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:03,970
shit and like how many do you think 
you're getting the real stuff?

1764
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,230
Probably nine.
Probably nine.

1765
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,970
And they think about that last thing 
that they need to open up their iphone.

1766
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:15,030
Like alright,
we're just open to the refrigerator 

1767
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,531
drawer finger.
I want to still be able to finger 

1768
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:20,110
somebody.
What can you do?

1769
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:20,670
Yeah,
I,

1770
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:21,820
I just,
I don't know.

1771
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,630
I mean it's a look.
W W,

1772
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,800
w what are war crimes?
How about that?

1773
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:27,760
How about,
you know,

1774
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:30,100
you're not allowed to do certain things,
not a lot of gas people,

1775
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,810
but you're allowed to drop a nuclear 
bomb on them.

1776
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,120
You're allowed to do that.
It's,

1777
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,280
it shouldn't be an issue like war at 
this point.

1778
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:38,770
It shouldn't be legal.
War should be illegal.

1779
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,540
So what do you do when someone attacks?
Just take them?

1780
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:42,060
They've shown.
No,

1781
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:47,070
no,
I'm just saying that we should be 

1782
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:47,680
progressed in that we should be.
Yeah,

1783
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,750
I'm surprised as the rest of the world.
I'm in people,

1784
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,530
common people,

1785
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,090
right?
I'll do it.

1786
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,440
We're not exactly civilized.
Um,

1787
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,810
I don't think anybody's going to war.
It's not a civil fucking thought.

1788
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:04,790
It would be great if everybody,
because you need regular people to do 

1789
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,790
it.
So if everybody was just like,

1790
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,460
yeah,
we're not doing it.

1791
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,470
Yeah,
if you guys want to go to war,

1792
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,730
you guys go fight each other to death,
but we'll fucking watch it on page.

1793
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:15,770
That would be the ultimate but note.
But there's a complete lack of trust 

1794
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:15,770
with,
with,

1795
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,700
you know,
different countries,

1796
01:13:17,701 --> 01:13:19,530
different cultures,
different races and all that.

1797
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,070
But if you could somehow get everybody 
on the same page to be just like,

1798
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:23,660
yeah,
you know,

1799
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,050
we're,
we're not doing that anymore.

1800
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:30,030
So you guys find out a different way to 
fucking take over the world is something

1801
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:30,810
that,
you know,

1802
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,830
but you know,
that,

1803
01:13:31,831 --> 01:13:33,140
that could never happen.
You get ketamine,

1804
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:33,800
Jesus,
he couldn't,

1805
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,040
couldn't have watched the apprentice and
you watched him to try to get a,

1806
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,060
you know,
uh,

1807
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:41,790
Vince Neil and uh,
the culture club guy,

1808
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:46,791
they can't even get on the same 
celebrity apprentice and they want you 

1809
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,000
to think they can't get on the same 
fucking page to write a song.

1810
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,800
So there's no way you're ever going to 
end war right there.

1811
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:54,810
They asked me to do that show celebrity 
apprentice back when fear factor came 

1812
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,780
back years ago and I was thinking about 
doing it.

1813
01:13:55,781 --> 01:14:00,781
And I'm so glad I didn't do it now 
because would have like me and trump 

1814
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:01,690
didn't get along.
What have you thought it was a cunt.

1815
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,520
And now I became president.
I was like,

1816
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:09,010
fucking enemies with the president.
Imagine that.

1817
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:11,980
Like Rosie O'donnell right now,
she probably barely

1818
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,980
leaves her house.
She's probably just sitting at home 

1819
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:16,980
going,
Oh fuck,

1820
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:16,980
fuck,
fuck,

1821
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:21,790
you get audited or something.
She used to shit on them constantly and 

1822
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,300
then he started shitting on her.
They would go to war with each other.

1823
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,750
She was on the view and she would shit 
on him and make fun of his hair and make

1824
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:30,130
fun of him and make fun of his life and 
his family and right.

1825
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:35,340
And then he became fucking president and
then in the debates he was mocking her 

1826
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:38,740
and the debates like she was,
because Clinton said something about the

1827
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:43,741
things that he says about women,
which I always have a real fucking 

1828
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:43,741
problem with,
you know,

1829
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:43,741
because she was like,
you know,

1830
01:14:43,741 --> 01:14:46,090
you've called women this and you've 
called women that like,

1831
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:51,450
okay,
he's called people that and some of 

1832
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,151
those people happen to be women.
He's also called men that and they know 

1833
01:14:54,151 --> 01:14:54,151
that's one.

1834
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,040
One of the things that he said when he 
said she's a nasty woman,

1835
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,390
why?
They latched on,

1836
01:14:58,391 --> 01:15:03,391
like he was attacking him.
She is a woman and he's saying that 

1837
01:15:03,391 --> 01:15:06,001
she's nasty.
He's a nasty man or he's not a good man 

1838
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:06,520
or whatever.
Exactly,

1839
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,150
exactly.

1840
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:09,880
It's.
We became this thing where women like,

1841
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:13,100
you're not supposed to have mock women 
make fun of women.

1842
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:16,490
Like are we equal or are we not?
Because if we're equal,

1843
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,340
I should be able to shit on you the way 
I should on everybody.

1844
01:15:19,341 --> 01:15:19,810
If I don't like

1845
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,570
your character,
you know,

1846
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:25,580
it was a bad move.
Was that that t shirt that was the 

1847
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,040
future is feminine.
What's that?

1848
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,860
It was just this thing that these women 
were wearing it.

1849
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:34,861
When I went down to go vote and it's 
just like you are so fucking you making 

1850
01:15:34,861 --> 01:15:37,960
people not want to vote for Clinton 
because it should be.

1851
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:41,050
The future is like some sort of unity 
and what you're doing is like,

1852
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,760
oh,
the future is we're going to fucking now

1853
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:47,761
do to you what we've been complaining 
about work it's going to be so then 

1854
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:51,240
right.
Then you lose any sort of feeling of 

1855
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:51,250
like,
oh,

1856
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:55,300
this person's a victim or like,
this person's a good person.

1857
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:55,690
I said,
oh,

1858
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:58,000
what you are is a complete fucking 
psycho.

1859
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,310
Who just hasn't got to sit at the 
controls yet?

1860
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,370
Now you want to be that and then you're 
gonna.

1861
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:06,820
Now you're gonna Ram it down everybody's
throat and it's just like,

1862
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,450
there needs to be a.
it's why I can't watch CNN or Fox 

1863
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,240
because this,
I can't just sit there and listen.

1864
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,560
I mean,
as much as I rant and rave,

1865
01:16:14,561 --> 01:16:19,561
which is fucking pretty ironic.
I can't sit there and listen to people 

1866
01:16:19,561 --> 01:16:21,190
screaming and yelling at each other 
because they don't want to.

1867
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:24,070
They don't want to come together.
They don't want to find what's right.

1868
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:25,930
They just want to.
When they have a side.

1869
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:30,990
Yeah.
And it just have a side and then don't 

1870
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:30,990
look at the other side.
Yeah.

1871
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,340
I wear a red tie.
So I argue the red tie.

1872
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:32,500
Shit,
you got a blue ties.

1873
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,770
He argued that it's fucking childish.
Hashtag [inaudible]

1874
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:35,900
with her,
you know,

1875
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:40,901
the um,
with her thing was driving me fucking 

1876
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:40,901
crazy to like,
are you.

1877
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:41,320
What do you mean you're with her?
Like is just her.

1878
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:46,330
Is it about a woman or is it about who's
the right person to run the fucking 

1879
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:46,580
country?
It's because it's not her

1880
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,390
that see you voted democratic.
I thought those fucking,

1881
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:51,260
you know,
CNN,

1882
01:16:51,261 --> 01:16:52,130
you know,
you see that they,

1883
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:57,131
you know,
they kind of fucking boxed out Bernie 

1884
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:59,530
Sanders and they might have.
It was almost like a fight and he 

1885
01:16:59,530 --> 01:16:59,530
might've been a better match up.
Who knows?

1886
01:16:59,530 --> 01:16:59,640
He was away way better

1887
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,390
match up.
He was,

1888
01:17:00,391 --> 01:17:05,391
he wasn't compromised.
Like if you want to talk about someone 

1889
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:05,391
who's financially compromised,
he wasn't compromised.

1890
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:09,831
He was like maybe the only guy ever 
running for president that wasn't 

1891
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,070
completely tied the financial system.

1892
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,690
They can always find shit on you be 
like,

1893
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,110
well,
you know,

1894
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:13,940
he was absent this.
He didn't vote for that love.

1895
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:18,941
And they try to get them on.
They didn't vote for this and they 

1896
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:18,941
didn't vote for that.
And it's just like,

1897
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:18,941
well,
what was fucking attached to it?

1898
01:17:18,941 --> 01:17:20,900
And I don't get why that's legal where 
it's like,

1899
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:25,901
Hey,
you want clean drinking water for 

1900
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:25,901
children?
And it's like he voted no against that.

1901
01:17:25,901 --> 01:17:28,600
And then you see like what is,
what is attached to it is like,

1902
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,640
oh yeah,
they're going to start fracking next to 

1903
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,321
a fucking,
you know exactly hospital or whatever 

1904
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:35,321
that I don't know.

1905
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:38,970
The CNN Fox divide the left and the 
right device never been greater in this 

1906
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:40,510
country than right now there is no one 
objective.

1907
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:45,511
News source does not one source.
It just tells you what's going on and 

1908
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:45,511
doesn't do it.

1909
01:17:45,511 --> 01:17:46,810
Biased perspective.
But I like to write.

1910
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,960
But I think that divide only exists 
between the people that watched that 

1911
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,340
shit.
It's Kinda like people like do you watch

1912
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:54,960
the UFC?
Do you not watch UFC?

1913
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:56,880
If you watch UFC you're fucking into the
shit.

1914
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And I think there's just news junkies 
out there that just mainline that shit 

1915
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,220
and they're the ones that where that 
divide is like that.

1916
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,670
But someone like myself,
like I,

1917
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:09,990
I can,
I can listen to somebody.

1918
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,140
I try to anyways,
like whatever your point of view is,

1919
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,160
I try to listen to it because I try to 
keep that shit out of my head because a,

1920
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:21,100
it gives me anxiety.
I can't fucking watch it.

1921
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,330
I can't watch it.
My mother was,

1922
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,780
uh,
uh,

1923
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,640
was watching last time I went home,
my mother was watching this.

1924
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,700
This kid's thinks we get like little 
nephews and nieces and I literally 

1925
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:34,401
couldn't even get through the fucking 
kids movie because towards the end they 

1926
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:35,310
just kept putting these obstacles in the
fucking anxiety.

1927
01:18:35,311 --> 01:18:36,990
It just built on me.
I'm not built like that.

1928
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:42,050
I can't handle it.
Just literally watching a kids movie 

1929
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,630
watching this thing going like,
can you just get them to the end where 

1930
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,240
he gets the fucking thing and you roll 
the credits and it's fine.

1931
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,370
It is having like,
you know,

1932
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,190
and then the little robot almost falls 
into the trash bin.

1933
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,560
I know he's not going to,
but I just,

1934
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,490
I can't even handle that.
Xcel is no fucking way.

1935
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:58,140
I'm going to sit there and watch a news.
I hope

1936
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,610
that people like you are the future.
I hope that this.

1937
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,730
We realized that this fucking left 
versus right things stupid.

1938
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,640
But people love to be on a team.
They love it.

1939
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:11,540
They love to be on our side is winning 
and your site can go fuck themselves.

1940
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,880
And they love to win.
We won.

1941
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,440
How many people you just see on twitter 
that was like,

1942
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:16,730
we won.
Get over it.

1943
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:18,770
We want.
I saw a lot of that.

1944
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:23,210
A lot of we won and can handle it.
We won

1945
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:26,410
Magda.
What is magazine?

1946
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,610
Make America great again.
Oh,

1947
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:33,030
Hashtag Mag A.
Hey.

1948
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,050
You know people have a right to tweet.
What are you going to go?

1949
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,080
Oh yeah,
they definitely do.

1950
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,640
It's interesting.
We're working it out.

1951
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,680
I think we're working it out as a 
civilization.

1952
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,790
That's what I like.
Had a little bit of faith.

1953
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:44,090
You came in with the cameras and the 
grains of sand.

1954
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:45,790
That's the future.
It's gonna.

1955
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:47,500
Take some time.
That's gonna.

1956
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,210
Take about 50 years.
I'm going to buy a fucking leaf blower.

1957
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,440
Just walking around.
Just fucking walking down the street

1958
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,370
blowing.
But meanwhile they'll have video footage

1959
01:19:57,371 --> 01:19:59,650
of you because you won't be able to get 
all the grains.

1960
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,920
That'd be everywhere.
The literally be covering the surface of

1961
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,270
this,
of this planet,

1962
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,650
like dirt.
Little,

1963
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,070
little tiny cameras.
Got To be a thing that

1964
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,850
I always thought like,
I don't know if I.

1965
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:11,910
I read about this because I'm always 
late night,

1966
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:16,911
I fucking go on the Internet and as I 
fall asleep so I can't remember if this 

1967
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:17,340
is my idea.
Somebody came up with it would be really

1968
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:22,341
cool for like say if you're like at some
level of celebrity where everybody's 

1969
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:27,710
always taken a picture of you.
If you could wear his suit that 

1970
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:31,641
anticipated the camera flash and as 
their cameras flashed you would flash 

1971
01:20:31,641 --> 01:20:35,331
back at them and then they couldn't get 
anything and then he could just sit 

1972
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,510
there eating your soup is everybody's 
taken pictures of you and they would all

1973
01:20:36,511 --> 01:20:38,700
go back to the developing Rome or 
whatever the fuck they do.

1974
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:41,010
Look into their cameras and not 
understand what was going on.

1975
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:43,080
Would just be like a Ufo landed in front
of them.

1976
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,370
Yeah.
There has to be a way like I like.

1977
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:49,530
I feel like future money is encountering
all that.

1978
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:54,770
There it is antipop Razzi close.
It's a blazer and I knew that I was too 

1979
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,940
stupid to come up with that.
How does he not captured?

1980
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:02,310
How does three m reflection stuff that's
on like a lot of shoes and some other 

1981
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,670
claw.
They never turn the flash off though.

1982
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,770
Then it's dark and you can't see the 
people,

1983
01:21:04,771 --> 01:21:06,570
which is the opposite reason I've taken 
the fuck.

1984
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:07,680
Does it work?
Yeah,

1985
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,840
I'll show.
I'll get a better photo.

1986
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:13,350
This was just an article.
Here's some of the folks I knew.

1987
01:21:13,351 --> 01:21:18,351
I was too dumb to come up with that,
so they're wearing hoods that stopped 

1988
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:22,921
like oh,
see their face or anything and just see 

1989
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:23,700
the clothes,
which is not really what the reason they

1990
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:27,420
want to take your photo that I mean it 
properly.

1991
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:32,450
You can see what guy is.
There might be a reason way to get 

1992
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,380
around,
but for now that's new.

1993
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,890
Those new cameras that they have now are
so good on camera.

1994
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:40,560
Phones are so good in low light that you
don't even need that anymore.

1995
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,320
You just take a photo of it.
I mean they can capture incredible 

1996
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,740
images and pretty low light with his 
iphone seven like tmz.

1997
01:21:48,741 --> 01:21:51,230
You guys aren't using iphone of course 
for a reason.

1998
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,290
Oh,
okay.

1999
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:57,050
Right.
A strange times comes to privacy.

2000
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,810
Slowly but surely it's all going away.
We're taking collars.

2001
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:04,550
What are you going to move?
Bill the mountains.

2002
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,950
I've,
I'm not fighting any of this shit.

2003
01:22:06,951 --> 01:22:09,380
I'm just going to hang out.
Just look at it.

2004
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:11,730
Disappointed.
Why?

2005
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:12,770
Why?
Why do we have to do this?

2006
01:22:12,771 --> 01:22:16,940
Come on guys.
Let's just go back to playing checkers.

2007
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:20,090
Woodland would.
It's not going to happen.

2008
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:21,560
We're going to keep going forward.

2009
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:25,280
I'm a little nervous about it.
Let's get out.

2010
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,320
Let's come on.
I got the rest of the day ahead of me,

2011
01:22:27,321 --> 01:22:28,730
man.
I can't go down this rabbit hole.

2012
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:30,290
It's all good.
It's all good.

2013
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,230
You're going to be fine.
Especially now.

2014
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,310
You have a little tiny baby that just 
happened.

2015
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:36,110
I tell jokes with them.
She's the best.

2016
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,630
She's the best.
So,

2017
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,720
um,
what's her future going to be like when 

2018
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:43,720
it comes to this shit?
That's what's bizarre.

2019
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:45,650
Like what are our kids going to have to 
deal with 50 years from now?

2020
01:22:45,651 --> 01:22:47,960
Like what kind of bizarre integration 
with it.

2021
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:51,290
They'll deal with it and they'll find it
fun and they'll be happy and,

2022
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,430
uh,
and will be gone.

2023
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:58,540
So try not to be a content.
I don't know what to tell you.

2024
01:22:58,611 --> 01:23:02,540
All I know is I got a special coming out
that's out right now.

2025
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,090
Special.
It's out right now.

2026
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:05,770
I'm,

2027
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,530
I'm very proud of it.
And uh,

2028
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,970
I liked the look of it.
The whole thing.

2029
01:23:09,971 --> 01:23:12,580
I like the jokes that I did on it and I 
hope people feel the same way,

2030
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:18,420
uh,
because I'd like to continue my 

2031
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:18,420
privileged life here.

2032
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:18,420
And this one's black and white.
No,

2033
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,290
the last one is black and white.
This one's color rather,

2034
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,370
right?
Each one.

2035
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:24,430
Each one I do.
I have a look that I'm going for a,

2036
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:29,660
the same way I try to improve as a 
comedian each time is a little bit of a 

2037
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:29,660
different thing.
And um,

2038
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:30,600
you know,
I,

2039
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:31,980
I've always felt,
you know,

2040
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,450
that we went through this horrible 
period of standup specials where they,

2041
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:42,110
they didn't,
it was just a complete lack of respect 

2042
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:43,410
for the art form is this amazing thing 
that one guy,

2043
01:23:43,411 --> 01:23:48,411
a woman can go out there and just talk 
into a microphone and people will 

2044
01:23:48,411 --> 01:23:50,010
fucking listen to it for like,
you know,

2045
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,350
I don't know,
an hour or so.

2046
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,080
It,
uh,

2047
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:56,500
they just started shooting it.
Everybody's looked the same and it's due

2048
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,620
for this look.
Uh,

2049
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,680
well I'm not going to do all my,
give you all my tricks,

2050
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,590
but what I was go out there,
what I was going for in this one,

2051
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:06,600
although that's a shitty image of it on 
this thing.

2052
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:11,601
But um,
there was a few concert films that I 

2053
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:15,801
like to look up.
Like I always try to fuck with the Hdt 

2054
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,340
hd a little bit because it's just,
it's clearer than real life.

2055
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:19,650
So I try to like tone it down a little

2056
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:24,670
bit.
So you gave yourself like a little 

2057
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:24,670
instagram filter.

2058
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,800
Snapchat girls.
You can say that now.

2059
01:24:25,801 --> 01:24:30,801
Like a snapchat thing,
just making it not look like if I'm 

2060
01:24:30,801 --> 01:24:31,760
standing in a tropical fish tank and a 
clown fish is going to swim.

2061
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,410
It's just like.
It's just like when you look at hd,

2062
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:36,210
it's just like fucking like,
oh my God,

2063
01:24:36,211 --> 01:24:41,211
look how fucking white that tee shirt is
and you get like distracted where and I 

2064
01:24:41,461 --> 01:24:44,100
think it makes it not look real.
Whereas if you look at,

2065
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,070
if you look at like,
I don't know,

2066
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:48,150
it's just something that I would look 
at,

2067
01:24:48,151 --> 01:24:50,460
old concert films,
I'd look at old stand up and be like,

2068
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:55,461
why does this look like this really 
happened and why dissolve this shit now 

2069
01:24:55,461 --> 01:24:58,410
looks so fake.
And a lot of it was it was.

2070
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:01,800
It was just too fucking clear and it was
also like edit,

2071
01:25:01,801 --> 01:25:02,340
edit,
edit,

2072
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:02,850
edit,
edit.

2073
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,040
As much as it was going through and it 
makes your brain reset and it rather 

2074
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:12,141
than drawing people in,
you're given them like like an an an 

2075
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:12,141
epileptic

2076
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:17,230
episode.
I did my last special almost entirely 

2077
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:17,390
from the waist up with no edits,
very few edits.

2078
01:25:17,391 --> 01:25:22,391
The only time I edit is when I wanted to
show a side shot or one and I want to 

2079
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:22,880
show like my whole body.
That's it.

2080
01:25:22,881 --> 01:25:25,910
I tried to do it where you are right in 
front of me just watching,

2081
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:30,940
just like you would have.
You're sitting in the crowd at a comedy 

2082
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:30,940
show and they wanted to,
you know,

2083
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:31,250
they always want to like show the 
audience there was,

2084
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,110
want to show this and cut back and 
forth.

2085
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:35,600
I'm like,
every time you do that you make a person

2086
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:38,870
realize that they're watching a film of 
their brain resets to.

2087
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:39,220
Yeah.

2088
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,100
So you were just drawn them in India.
Shit.

2089
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:47,130
Like when somebody watches you do is 
show you not all of a sudden up in the 

2090
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:48,010
balcony or turning around or swooping 
in.

2091
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,080
You got to have a little bit of that 
because it doesn't have to.

2092
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:51,400
It does have to be like,
you know,

2093
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,860
sort of like a concert film.
But like,

2094
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,340
um,
it's all,

2095
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:54,790
how you,

2096
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:00,360
you pick those now when you're doing 
standup and you're also doing F is for 

2097
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:00,360
family.
Like,

2098
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:05,091
you know,
we had this conversation the other day 

2099
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:05,091
at the store where you're talking about 
how it just of swoops in

2100
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:06,500
and takes all your time,
you know,

2101
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,760
during those.
Yeah.

2102
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:09,370
The heavy writing part of it.
Yeah.

2103
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,380
And how much,
how much time do you spend doing that 

2104
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,380
show?
Evidence for fan,

2105
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,420
which by the way,
it's fucking awesome.

2106
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:17,390
I love that show.
It's coming out again in May.

2107
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,850
How many episodes did you do at a time?
Well,

2108
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:21,590
this time we did 10.
They gave us six.

2109
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:26,591
The first uh,
the first season they gave us six 

2110
01:26:26,591 --> 01:26:26,780
because I think they were like,
what the fuck do you guys want to do?

2111
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,420
And then they saw it and then they,
they liked it.

2112
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:34,570
And uh,
that's what I'm guessing because it was 

2113
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:34,570
a weird order.
It's like a half order.

2114
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:34,570
So now,
um,

2115
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,840
now we're doing 10.
Um,

2116
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:42,310
so that comes out in May.
I just realized that math didn't work 

2117
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,310
out on that because it gave me six and I
still,

2118
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:45,230
it was a half four but they used to do 
12 but then they whittled it down to 10.

2119
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,260
So now like when you write that,
how far in advance do you start before 

2120
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:56,081
you,
because it takes awhile to put it 

2121
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:56,081
together and to film it.
Yeah,

2122
01:26:56,081 --> 01:26:56,840
we're,
we're mapping out the uh,

2123
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,570
the third if we get a third season 
because it's,

2124
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:00,260
you know,
it's Kinda weird,

2125
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:01,940
like you just kind of put it all out at 
once.

2126
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:06,890
So we have to see hopefully the people 
that watched it the first time come back

2127
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:09,290
again and then more people come.
But uh,

2128
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:13,700
as far as how that works is like,
you really,

2129
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,410
like,
it's,

2130
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:20,470
it's the war room to do a season is you 
map out the season and you really have 

2131
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:27,431
to like work all the bugs out of it.
And,

2132
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,770
and that's the time when you're like,
are we going to go big here?

2133
01:27:30,771 --> 01:27:33,770
We gonna have this more grounded.
Is this going to happen?

2134
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:38,771
Is that going to happen?
And you really work out the big 

2135
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:41,510
emotional moments in the story lines 
before you get in there.

2136
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,490
So you can,
um,

2137
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:48,820
because as you start to write in this 10
people in the room and the ideas of 

2138
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:49,280
flowing,
it's,

2139
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:51,980
you can kind of veer off,
which can be a good thing.

2140
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,890
It's not like it's set in stone,
like this is what we're writing,

2141
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:57,590
but like you just sort of know,
like,

2142
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,740
you know,
we're going from okay from point a to 

2143
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,730
point b than b to c and then how you get
there is sort of the art of writing it.

2144
01:28:04,731 --> 01:28:07,880
But like you just want to make sure that
all of a sudden,

2145
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:12,881
you know,
gold aid over to c and then blah blah 

2146
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:12,881
blah.
If you got pete,

2147
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:13,280
we've got to go back to this.
How do we correct all of this?

2148
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:18,700
Um,
depending on the type of show that you 

2149
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:18,700
do,
you know,

2150
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,510
I'm like ours.
I'd like to try to keep it grounded in a

2151
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:25,570
certain level of reality,
but also take advantage that it is 

2152
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:25,940
animation so you can get a little 
absurd.

2153
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:27,440
But like,
um,

2154
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,020
and it's just like a balance of that.
It's like a fucking recipe.

2155
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:30,350
Like,
I,

2156
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,360
there's too much salt here.
You got to be going to do a little bit 

2157
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,200
more of this.
So this is the first time I've gone this

2158
01:28:36,201 --> 01:28:41,201
far with anything.
So now I learned a lot in this second 

2159
01:28:41,201 --> 01:28:46,121
season about that.
So we're really hammering out this this 

2160
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:46,880
third season and uh,
you know,

2161
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:48,850
I don't know what.
I'm a total newbie.

2162
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,510
Had you ever written anything before 
like that?

2163
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:54,590
Uh,
no.

2164
01:28:54,591 --> 01:28:56,300
I think I actually could be a decent 
writer.

2165
01:28:56,301 --> 01:29:01,301
I'm just,
I just don't want to do it because it's 

2166
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:01,301
so much fucking work.
I just,

2167
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:01,301
I just don't want to just sit down,
right.

2168
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:03,660
This whole fucking thing.
Sent it to a studio them and be like,

2169
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:05,370
change is change and do this.

2170
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:06,030
Yeah.
Long ago,

2171
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,840
all the way back to the beginning,
like,

2172
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:08,890
um,
you know,

2173
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:13,891
I think if I was,
if I didn't have like then because I 

2174
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:13,891
always have to thing in my head,
I was like,

2175
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,490
oh,
I could just go do a fucking standup Gig

2176
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:19,930
and do it real time and it's done and I 
have money for my fucking ham sandwiches

2177
01:29:19,931 --> 01:29:21,860
for a month.
Why do I want to,

2178
01:29:21,861 --> 01:29:23,580
uh,
because I,

2179
01:29:24,310 --> 01:29:28,900
how hard writers work it.
Like it's fucking unbelievable,

2180
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:34,160
like the level that,
how hard that those people work versus 

2181
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:34,840
like the fucking credit that they get 
and shit.

2182
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:37,270
So I'm,
have,

2183
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:40,510
I have such a level of respect that 
like,

2184
01:29:40,511 --> 01:29:41,370
um,
you know,

2185
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:46,420
I've,
I've talked to some people and they're 

2186
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:46,420
like,
hey,

2187
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:46,420
you want to read it like a movie script 
or something like that,

2188
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:49,681
which I guess I know I could do it,
but it's just like I'm going to write a 

2189
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:52,261
movie strict Andrew F is for family and 
fucking do stand up and try to have my 

2190
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:56,131
specialty better than my last special.
That alone is going to take up so much 

2191
01:29:56,131 --> 01:29:56,131
time.
And then now I'm going to be married and

2192
01:29:56,131 --> 01:30:01,051
be a dad.
There's like only so many fucking hours 

2193
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:01,051
in the day.
And then when would I get to play drums?

2194
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:01,570
Right,
right.

2195
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:04,000
So do I want to fucking also add that?

2196
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:06,580
And if you don't play drums and you 
start going a little wacky.

2197
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:11,790
Yeah.
And there'll be a dick around my wife 

2198
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:11,790
and kids.
So I'm that way with martial arts.

2199
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:14,440
If I don't do something,
some kind of workout like I like,

2200
01:30:14,441 --> 01:30:19,441
if someone says,
well just don't work out for a few 

2201
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:19,441
weeks,
that's not even on the menu,

2202
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:22,981
I can't do it.
It's almost like I have to brush my 

2203
01:30:22,981 --> 01:30:22,981
teeth,
have to work out,

2204
01:30:22,981 --> 01:30:26,140
I have to maintain a balance.
If I don't have that balance,

2205
01:30:26,141 --> 01:30:27,440
I'm,
I,

2206
01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,840
it's weird because it's just a hobby,
but I'm literally obsessed with it.

2207
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,730
I've watched,
I've watched all these videos.

2208
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:36,400
Drum covers.
I watch about it all the time.

2209
01:30:36,401 --> 01:30:36,920
You're,
you're,

2210
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:38,620
you're balls deep.
Yeah.

2211
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,190
Yeah.
But it's like,

2212
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,000
I think things like this fucking hard.
Right?

2213
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,050
It's fun.
It's a fun thing to do.

2214
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,270
And uh,
yeah,

2215
01:30:47,271 --> 01:30:52,271
it keeps me.
It's like something he got to have 

2216
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:52,271
something you're looking forward to is 
how as you as hard as you're working.

2217
01:30:52,271 --> 01:30:56,620
Like um,
I got some road gigs coming up and I am 

2218
01:30:56,620 --> 01:30:57,290
so fucking excited to get because I,
right after I did that special.

2219
01:30:57,291 --> 01:31:01,550
I think I did comics come home for leary
and that's about the only road I haven't

2220
01:31:01,551 --> 01:31:06,551
been.
I haven't been to lax since like 

2221
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:06,551
November,
which is

2222
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:06,551
crazy.
So

2223
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:10,960
I'm,
I'm like chomping at the bit to get out 

2224
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:11,840
there and like last night I tried to do 
an hour man.

2225
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:12,710
I was just like,
Oh God,

2226
01:31:12,711 --> 01:31:14,220
like,
just like with all the new shit.

2227
01:31:14,540 --> 01:31:17,000
Where'd you go last night?
I was down in Largo,

2228
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:20,830
can be at the ice house a Friday night.
Um,

2229
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:22,370
you're the ice house tomorrow to with 
me.

2230
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:22,790
Yeah.
Yeah,

2231
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,520
I'll be down there.
And um,

2232
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:28,100
I just got to a fraud.
The Ice House is the best.

2233
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:31,970
I know all the points I want to talk 
about and uh,

2234
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:35,820
so I just have to start talking about 
them so I,

2235
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:40,821
I have to go out there.
So I'm going out and doing some club 

2236
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:40,821
dates and uh,
you know,

2237
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:42,680
I'll bring in some really funny guys in 
front of me.

2238
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,150
He bringing a Paul [inaudible],
Joe Bart,

2239
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:46,430
nick,
um,

2240
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:50,150
who else I got?
I got Dean del Ray up and when we do San

2241
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:52,210
Jose and I'm,
you know,

2242
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,930
I'm just,
I just,

2243
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,380
I,
I'm,

2244
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:59,500
I'm the whole thing was waiting for the 
kid to come and then she showed up and 

2245
01:31:59,500 --> 01:31:59,980
now that that's done,
now it's just

2246
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,240
like,
you know,

2247
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:02,700
I got to get out there,
dude,

2248
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:04,240
I got to get.
So you're doing theater gigs.

2249
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:06,730
He doing club gigs,
so he's doing clubs when I'm working out

2250
01:32:06,731 --> 01:32:11,731
an hour,
I mean I have to talk in front of me 

2251
01:32:11,731 --> 01:32:13,791
now,
but I'm not going to make people deal 

2252
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:14,320
with all of that bullshit to watch me 
work some shit out.

2253
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,060
So you're going to San Jose.
Are you doing the Improv?

2254
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,440
Yeah,
that's a great club.

2255
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:18,380
Yeah.
So I'm going to do like,

2256
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:19,750
um,
like a Monday,

2257
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,350
Tuesday,
Wednesday.

2258
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,170
It's sort of an off night kind of thing,
you know?

2259
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,630
Uh,
and you know,

2260
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,920
I always feel like Monday,
Tuesday,

2261
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,710
Wednesday people are more forgiving.
Friday,

2262
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,350
Saturday people like I want to show a 
lot of Monday,

2263
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:33,490
Tuesday,
Wednesdays.

2264
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:34,450
Um,
I've,

2265
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:36,490
I've told people that I'm working my 
shit out,

2266
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:37,900
you know,
ticket prices,

2267
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:38,890
you know,
aren't that bad.

2268
01:32:38,891 --> 01:32:39,660
And,
and uh,

2269
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:41,860
um,
yeah.

2270
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:43,210
And um,
it's fun to see too.

2271
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:45,250
I love watching people work shit out.
Yeah.

2272
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:45,820
But I'm,
I'm,

2273
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:47,360
I,
I,

2274
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,960
I'm not one of those people that is 
working to get off the road.

2275
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:53,070
I fucking love the road.
I love doing the road and like,

2276
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:54,490
you know,
I go to games and shit,

2277
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,770
like I'm going to go to Carolina and 
Duke game when I'm out there,

2278
01:32:56,771 --> 01:33:01,771
which is fucking legendary shit.
Like that's just like a one of the,

2279
01:33:02,920 --> 01:33:05,530
that's like a bucket list,
sporting event,

2280
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:10,531
whatever sport you're into is to go 
there and just experience like that 

2281
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:13,000
level of passion and hysteria for 
college basketball.

2282
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,600
I mean it's like,
you know,

2283
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:17,380
it's an overused word but it is a 
basketball Mecca.

2284
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,180
So that's part of your fund for the 
road.

2285
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,660
Yeah,
like a day game that night.

2286
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:22,640
You do the Gig?
Yeah.

2287
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:24,250
And when,
as far as like drawing like this,

2288
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,580
this rehearsal spaces that I know of 
that are just.

2289
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:29,580
And it's the Shit,
because I'm,

2290
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,280
I'm,
you know,

2291
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:35,281
I'm not in town so I don't have any 
responsibility and I just go in with my 

2292
01:33:35,281 --> 01:33:35,281
iphone and my,
all my music,

2293
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,280
put the fucking headphones on and just 
fucking go nuts for like two hours.

2294
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:41,020
It's like rather than,
I guess doing the treadmill,

2295
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:44,320
which I probably should do more of,
but I just do that and it's the greatest

2296
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:49,321
thing ever.
So like I'll ask you if I go to 

2297
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:49,321
someplace and they have enough time,
you know,

2298
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:50,410
I'll ask people my podcast,
hey,

2299
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:51,700
if you don't have a good rehearsal 
space,

2300
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,410
because there's good ones and bad ones,
you know,

2301
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,600
the fucking worst ones that you go.
Then the drum kits,

2302
01:33:55,601 --> 01:33:58,170
they're not fucking tune.
They get old heads and then everything's

2303
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:03,180
been over torqued and you got to like 
fucking take the sticks to try to get 

2304
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,180
them.

2305
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:03,400
You know,
they get all frozen up.

2306
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:08,610
Tiny thing that a lot of people that 
don't get bummed out about the road is 

2307
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:11,701
because they have to do the road.
Like one of the beautiful things about 

2308
01:34:11,701 --> 01:34:14,101
you,
you don't have to do the road you like 

2309
01:34:14,101 --> 01:34:16,001
to do the road.
Like I remember one of the things that 

2310
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:16,001
used to really bum me out when I would 
do clubs,

2311
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:19,090
they would tell me that Richard,
Jenny was just in town.

2312
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:21,310
He fucking hated.
He hates being on the road.

2313
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:22,660
He was grumpy.
He just hated,

2314
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:27,690
hated doing standup because he always 
wanted to have a sitcom who was wanting 

2315
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:28,180
to be like the next Seinfeld and it 
didn't happen for him.

2316
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:33,181
So he was miserable.
But meanwhile to me he was like one of 

2317
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:33,181
my idols.
I was like,

2318
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:35,800
scheduling one of the greatest comics 
ever and he doesn't like doing it.

2319
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:40,980
Like this is all I wanted to do.
I'd show up at a club and they'd be 

2320
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:44,491
like,
I can't believe I'm headline and I'm 

2321
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:44,491
here.
I'm doing it.

2322
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:44,491
And then say,
yeah,

2323
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:45,490
Richard.
So nice that someone's a actually having

2324
01:34:45,491 --> 01:34:46,300
a good time.
Richard,

2325
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:48,520
Jenny was here last week and now he's so
bummed out.

2326
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,300
Yeah,
but you never know.

2327
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:50,680
They'll let scuttle button.
The club.

2328
01:34:50,681 --> 01:34:52,870
He could have just been in a bad moon.
Was a cut that week,

2329
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:54,440
so then all of a sudden that,
you know,

2330
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,240
the fact that he's not here to defend 
whether,

2331
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:57,580
whether he.
I liked it,

2332
01:34:57,581 --> 01:35:02,581
I mean the,
the level that that guy wrote in the 

2333
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:02,581
specialist that he wrote,
he had to have enjoyed it.

2334
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:04,970
He enjoyed some of it,
but I was friends with his ex girlfriend

2335
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:08,270
and she was telling me that that was 
really the case.

2336
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:08,870
He just didn't.

2337
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:13,920
I was really trying to.
I know that you wouldn't have confirmed 

2338
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:13,920
that.
Yeah.

2339
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,190
Well I think back then that was the 
carrot though.

2340
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:19,070
The carrot was always the Sitcom.
It was like that was what everybody went

2341
01:35:19,071 --> 01:35:21,440
for and if you didn't get that,
you felt bummed out.

2342
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:25,280
Whereas somewhere along the line we 
realized that's not necessarily true.

2343
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,180
You're better off without the Sitcom.
You're better off just being a big name,

2344
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:31,820
stand up comic and having a good time.
You're throwing shit.

2345
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:34,740
You don't have to deal with producers 
that when he came up you had to,

2346
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:37,430
you had to be given a special.
You couldn't just do it.

2347
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,600
Yeah.
And then also the network money was 

2348
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:42,600
crazy.
And if you could get to syndication,

2349
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:47,680
you were,
you were set for life and syndication 

2350
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:47,680
shit.
Now,

2351
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:47,680
like when Netflix,
there is no syndication,

2352
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,460
it's just,
it's automatically syndicated.

2353
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,500
While I was on two shows that went to 
syndication,

2354
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:54,170
it's not the same.
It's not what everybody thinks it is.

2355
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:56,990
Like if you're one of the owners of the 
show,

2356
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,080
it's big time.
But like I was sitting news radio's in 

2357
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,080
syndication.
I mean I got,

2358
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:05,030
don't get me wrong,
I got a lot of money from it,

2359
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:10,360
but it wasn't like Seinfeld money,
but it goes down to like $7 checks 

2360
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:15,221
really quickly.
Like however that fucking math works 

2361
01:36:15,221 --> 01:36:17,480
out.
I had to think with my buddies a like 

2362
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:17,550
you just take pictures of residual 
checks,

2363
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:21,260
like trying to beat each other.
And two of my friends got the one cent,

2364
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:23,410
they all within a month.
Love.

2365
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:28,190
She didn't think that exists because I 
got a lot of like dollar 17.

2366
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:31,100
Um,
you know,

2367
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:31,850
I,
I got a,

2368
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:37,030
I got a friend of mine,
I'm not going to say the name of the 

2369
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,030
fucking movie,
but like,

2370
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,400
it's a big time fucking moving.
Everybody loves it.

2371
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:42,710
And they showed it one time on a network
for 24 hours straight and he got played 

2372
01:36:44,301 --> 01:36:47,180
for one plane because it was just one 
day,

2373
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:50,210
but they sold advertising for 24 fucking
hours.

2374
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,180
They do because they just do it and then
they sit back and wait for you to sue 

2375
01:36:56,961 --> 01:36:59,210
them.
And Are you going to go?

2376
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:02,390
Is this going to be worth it to you to 
go through that?

2377
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:04,760
So like the zone probably 20 bucks 
anyway.

2378
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:10,420
Well what I learned,
unfortunately it just like the number 

2379
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:14,171
one commandment of the 10 commandments 
that the number one that's broken I 

2380
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:14,171
think is stealing.

2381
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:15,800
It's just an.
As far as stealing is,

2382
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:20,801
you basically have,
you basically have the illegal side of 

2383
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:24,191
stealing in the legal side of stealing.
So any smart criminal is trying to make 

2384
01:37:24,191 --> 01:37:27,170
his business legit so he doesn't have to
hide his fucking money anymore.

2385
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:32,171
But he can continue to just rob people 
fucking blind because that's basically 

2386
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:34,340
what happens is everybody just like.
I mean,

2387
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:36,110
some of the deals that I've signed,
like for,

2388
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:41,290
for Shit like it okay if you audit us,
but we're only off by like three 

2389
01:37:41,290 --> 01:37:45,251
percent,
then you have to pay for the audit and 

2390
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:45,251
like you literally just built into this 
deal,

2391
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:49,871
a license to steal three percent plus 
what I have to catch you with steel nine

2392
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,520
for,
to basically skim like whatever,

2393
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:55,130
nine percent off of this fucking thing.
And,

2394
01:37:55,250 --> 01:38:00,250
and they go to sleep at night and they 
feel they're good people and they don't 

2395
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:00,660
give a fuck that they're driving a car 
that,

2396
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:05,710
you know,
a bunch of other people paid for and 

2397
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:05,710
they took the money.
They don't give a shit.

2398
01:38:05,710 --> 01:38:06,870
Yeah.
Legal loopholes,

2399
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,160
legal loopholes and find print.
Uh,

2400
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,790
it's,
it's a dirty world

2401
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:15,800
starting as far as trump,
like not reporting is taxes and all that

2402
01:38:15,801 --> 01:38:20,801
type of shit.
It's like you can only get so mad where 

2403
01:38:20,801 --> 01:38:20,801
it's like,
all right,

2404
01:38:20,801 --> 01:38:23,780
so because he figured out the game where
he's kind of like,

2405
01:38:23,781 --> 01:38:27,670
well I'm just robin from thieves.
Right?

2406
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,670
Like that whole fucking bolt,
like politicians is so underpaid.

2407
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:36,671
They need all these guys money to get in
there and then when they get in there 

2408
01:38:36,671 --> 01:38:40,781
they got to hook them up and they give 
him these governmental contracts in the 

2409
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,020
fact that they're allowed to just 
fucking overcharged.

2410
01:38:42,021 --> 01:38:44,480
Like the level they do is just this 
stealing.

2411
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:48,160
So you're giving you like,
like I have no problem playing,

2412
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:53,290
paying taxes.
What fucking drives me up the wall is 

2413
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:56,141
knowing that like the amount of money,
like say you give them fucking 50 grand,

2414
01:38:56,691 --> 01:39:00,830
like the amount of that money that's 
actually going to go for the supplies to

2415
01:39:00,831 --> 01:39:05,831
make a school better,
to feel like a fucking pothole and then 

2416
01:39:05,831 --> 01:39:05,831
the amount that's just going to go into 
this.

2417
01:39:05,831 --> 01:39:07,190
Guys,
I want a shiny watch.

2418
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:10,880
My wife needs fake tits fund on the 
side.

2419
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:12,750
That's what eats me up at night because 
I,

2420
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:13,250
I,
you know,

2421
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:20,350
you see what trump did where he's filed 
for reelection five hours after he took 

2422
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:22,490
office.
No one's ever done that before.

2423
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:27,440
Everybody files for reelection.
Like a year out from the reelection.

2424
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:30,500
He filed for reelection five hours after
office.

2425
01:39:30,501 --> 01:39:33,560
That means when anybody addresses him in
any sort of a campaign ad,

2426
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,920
they have to address him as if they're 
running against him to anything because 

2427
01:39:38,961 --> 01:39:40,580
he's already running for president 
again.

2428
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:45,760
He's running for president in 2008,
so he's essentially change the way they 

2429
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:46,010
dress.
Don't say Mr.

2430
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,820
President.
No,

2431
01:39:46,821 --> 01:39:48,550
I don't know how it works,
but Mr.

2432
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:49,520
President,
president,

2433
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:52,160
pull it up and we'll be able to figure 
out what it.

2434
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,940
What it means.
Figure out what the guy he's organized.

2435
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,950
Say what you want about them.
The men is organized.

2436
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,120
Oh,
he's definitely organized.

2437
01:39:59,121 --> 01:40:04,121
He's mean.
He's been just juking and fucking 

2438
01:40:04,121 --> 01:40:07,490
shucking and jiving in business for a 
long fucking time,

2439
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:13,120
you know,
and he knows how to get his name on 

2440
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:13,120
things.
You know what I mean?

2441
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:16,630
Everywhere you go,
there's some giant building that's gold 

2442
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,720
and it says trump on it.
I think we're going to be all right.

2443
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:18,830
We'll be all right.
I think so.

2444
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,440
Well yeah,

2445
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,780
he's kind of the amount of people.
He's already fucking annoyed.

2446
01:40:22,781 --> 01:40:24,790
You figured the midterm elections come 
two years in.

2447
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
He's got his shit where he's going to 
sprint for fucking two years and then I 

2448
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,280
think everybody else is just going to 
vote for fucking blue ties and blue bras

2449
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,450
and the fucking next one.
Right,

2450
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,640
and you think so?
Yes.

2451
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:40,000
I mean that's what always happens after 
fucking eight years of Clinton.

2452
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,820
Then it went red and then eight years of
Bush.

2453
01:40:42,821 --> 01:40:45,190
This'll make it better.
Let's go over to Obama.

2454
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,950
Obama.
Let's go back over to fucking a.

2455
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,840
let's go back over to the

2456
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:55,120
side.
I think we'd like to see someone who is 

2457
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,350
in the middle of things though.
We would really like to see someone who 

2458
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:01,321
has more maybe libertarian values or 
someone who's more just not adequately 

2459
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,530
writer.
Clearly left

2460
01:41:02,670 --> 01:41:07,670
somebody a little more secure.
His insecurity is what scares me the 

2461
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,030
most.
Like tweeting.

2462
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:11,490
No,
that shit he said about his daughter and

2463
01:41:11,491 --> 01:41:11,970
everybody.
Oh,

2464
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:16,971
that was some weird sexual thing.
Like he's so fucking insecure that 

2465
01:41:16,971 --> 01:41:19,701
people are gonna.
Think his daughter is not good looking 

2466
01:41:19,701 --> 01:41:22,221
that he.
He says what he wants people to say and 

2467
01:41:22,221 --> 01:41:22,221
he wasn't thinking like context.
Oh yeah,

2468
01:41:22,221 --> 01:41:27,211
I date or how does,
she's the greatest of the everything he 

2469
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:27,211
says it.
It's like the same cadence.

2470
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:32,121
It's the same three things.
Like he gets like he has time to watch 

2471
01:41:32,121 --> 01:41:34,770
snl or like if somebody's like,
oh no,

2472
01:41:34,771 --> 01:41:39,771
award show.
Like why are you watching the Golden 

2473
01:41:39,771 --> 01:41:39,771
Globes?
What do you give a fuck?

2474
01:41:39,771 --> 01:41:40,770
What,
what Meryl Streep's Phoebe,

2475
01:41:40,771 --> 01:41:42,030
who gives a fuck?
Says,

2476
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,580
yeah,
you're the leader of the free world,

2477
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:46,650
man.
Fucking not good enough.

2478
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:51,740
Yeah.
Look out to the ocean and see what's 

2479
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:51,740
coming at us,
man.

2480
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:52,950
That wants to be loved up across the 
board by everybody.

2481
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:55,350
Yeah.
I don't know.

2482
01:41:55,351 --> 01:41:56,240
I don't know what it is.
It's a,

2483
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:01,250
we're here.
And what's funny is by finding 

2484
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,480
fascinating as far as like the way,
if you want to be loved to behave,

2485
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:05,180
to behave the way he does and uh,
you know,

2486
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,510
really just have that,
uh,

2487
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,680
you know,
my way or the highway,

2488
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:09,720
just ram it down your throat.
Shut the fuck up.

2489
01:42:09,721 --> 01:42:12,150
It's just this weird.
You know,

2490
01:42:12,151 --> 01:42:17,151
it's weird.
It's weird that you could have that 

2491
01:42:17,151 --> 01:42:17,151
personality and still want to be liked.
It's just like,

2492
01:42:17,151 --> 01:42:17,151
it's like,
do,

2493
01:42:17,151 --> 01:42:20,820
do you enjoy being treated like that?
Then why would you treat other people?

2494
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:23,510
Um,
this way,

2495
01:42:23,511 --> 01:42:24,490
I don't know.
He,

2496
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,690
I don't know his,
his ram it down their throat,

2497
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,870
his approaches a,
a,

2498
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:34,980
you like those stupid Hollywood movies 
where somebody grabs a two by four when 

2499
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,440
I cleaned this town up.
Like it's just like he's going to hurt a

2500
01:42:36,441 --> 01:42:41,441
lot of people because there's a lot of 
innocent people are going to get caught 

2501
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:45,011
up in the wash of a very simplistic 
solution to a huge problem.

2502
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:46,910
Well,
let's get rid of all of them.

2503
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:47,930
You know,
like,

2504
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:49,940
um,
I don't know,

2505
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,070
but I'm just a comedian.
I don't have the fucking answers.

2506
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:54,890
I just wish like,
I don't know.

2507
01:42:54,891 --> 01:42:56,120
What is this Jamie?
Would he pull?

2508
01:42:56,121 --> 01:43:01,121
Pulling up here is about why the things 
that are brought up when filing early 

2509
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:02,960
different things.

2510
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:08,120
A candidate for president is subject to 
different rules than a president is 

2511
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:11,271
afforded different projections.
This has critics on edge and already 

2512
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:16,761
existing concerns about trump's business
entanglements are now heightened by 

2513
01:43:16,761 --> 01:43:20,871
fears that US nationals could fund 
funnel cash to trump through his 

2514
01:43:20,871 --> 01:43:24,310
campaign committee trumps status as a 
candidate.

2515
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:28,600
You could also make it difficult for 
nonprofit organizations take actions for

2516
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:31,180
or against trump and his 
administration's policies.

2517
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:36,630
Tax Exemption.
Organizations have leeway for political 

2518
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:40,201
action,
have more leeway for political action 

2519
01:43:40,201 --> 01:43:42,811
than other nonprofits,
but are still prohibited from certain 

2520
01:43:42,811 --> 01:43:45,151
political actions.
Leading some to worry that trump's 

2521
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:45,220
filings could be a tactic to reduce 
opposition.

2522
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,010
Yeah.
Which it.

2523
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:49,950
Cus that's legal.
That's a great move.

2524
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:52,280
It doesn't.
Considering what he's done so far,

2525
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:55,490
it doesn't make you feel comfortable.
I don't know,

2526
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,350
but we'll survive.
It will survive it.

2527
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:02,430
Anyway.
What do you do this to fucking 

2528
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:02,430
depressed.
I just can't.

2529
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:02,430
You just have somebody fucking 
levelheaded.

2530
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:05,060
What did you want to win?
Oh God,

2531
01:44:05,061 --> 01:44:07,740
I liked Bernie Sanders,
but I didn't like um,

2532
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,030
I didn't like his entire demonization of
anybody who had money was automatically.

2533
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:19,031
It just was so simple and that everybody
who is broke was a fucking hero and it 

2534
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:20,120
just,
it was just cartoon.

2535
01:44:20,121 --> 01:44:22,040
Like people are way more complex than 
that,

2536
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,480
you know,
and uh,

2537
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:26,810
I dunno do it to be honest with you,
it's too fucking big.

2538
01:44:27,170 --> 01:44:28,700
I just knew that I,
I didn't,

2539
01:44:28,730 --> 01:44:33,730
I didn't like Hillary or I didn't like 
trump and I was praying to God that 

2540
01:44:33,730 --> 01:44:33,730
those weren't going to be my two.

2541
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:38,050
It was just like two trains fucking the 
same tractors going pleased.

2542
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,610
Don't be,
don't leave me with these two.

2543
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,220
Could you just fucking not.
What did you not like about Hillary?

2544
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:46,670
I just,
I just didn't think she was a,

2545
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:48,530
I just,
I didn't trust her.

2546
01:44:48,531 --> 01:44:53,531
I just thought she was a big time phony 
and I just felt like she would just 

2547
01:44:53,531 --> 01:44:55,550
fucking do or say I didn't like the 
fucking 2008 that she blew the bankers.

2548
01:44:55,551 --> 01:45:00,551
Don't worry.
I got you guys just completely doesn't 

2549
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:00,650
give a fuck about all the people that 
are upside down in their houses and then

2550
01:45:00,651 --> 01:45:03,710
has the nerve to act like she's the 
people's candidate,

2551
01:45:03,711 --> 01:45:07,640
which is really a sticking point with me
with Democrats is they fucking sit there

2552
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:10,130
and they act like they're men and women 
are the people.

2553
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:15,131
It's like you guys are all filthy,
stinking rich to you and you guys all 

2554
01:45:15,131 --> 01:45:19,031
end up being multimillionaires and the 
bit most highest paying fucking job you 

2555
01:45:19,031 --> 01:45:20,630
can get as the president,
which pays 500 grand a fucking year.

2556
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,690
Okay?
And so you're over 250 grand a year,

2557
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:25,280
which means you're going to get this 
shit taxed out of you.

2558
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:28,040
So how the fuck did you end up being 
worth 40,

2559
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,510
5,000
million dollars?

2560
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,720
There's no way what you're doing is 
above board.

2561
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,230
Every politician crushes it in the 
private sector.

2562
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,270
It's insane.
They,

2563
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:42,430
everyone goes fucking yard.
Nobody starts a business and it shits 

2564
01:45:42,430 --> 01:45:42,770
the bed.
Like,

2565
01:45:42,771 --> 01:45:43,110
uh,
they,

2566
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:45,220
they said the percentage of senators and
they make like,

2567
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:46,580
I don't know if the 200 grand a year or 
something,

2568
01:45:46,581 --> 01:45:48,260
I forget what it is.
And uh,

2569
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,300
there the amount of them that are 
multimillionaires.

2570
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:55,570
Yeah,
the most disturbing thing is public 

2571
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:57,101
speaking.
When you find out that she's speaking 

2572
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:57,101
for the bankers and she's doing these 
$250,000,

2573
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,870
our long speeches and they're washing 
their bribe money.

2574
01:45:59,871 --> 01:46:01,790
It's the people that paid you to get in 
there.

2575
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:04,550
You did what they wanted them to do and 
then just like a comedian,

2576
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:07,520
you get to do your college tour and they
grossly fucking over.

2577
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,800
I used to do a bit about it and then 
you're giving a speech,

2578
01:46:09,801 --> 01:46:14,801
they're not even listening to their city
and they're eating like a fucking deep 

2579
01:46:14,801 --> 01:46:15,200
fried eagle,
like not even giving a fuck.

2580
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:20,820
It's so overt,
like it's almost like a serial killer 

2581
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:21,180
that wants to get caught.
So I just felt like,

2582
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:25,160
like she was just going to be more of 
the same of that preaching,

2583
01:46:25,161 --> 01:46:28,610
this fucking rhetoric as they just keep 
deregulate and shit and trump,

2584
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,650
I feel like what he wants to do aside 
from,

2585
01:46:30,651 --> 01:46:31,880
you know,
uh,

2586
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:33,110
I,
I just think he,

2587
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:38,170
I think he's at the level of rich that 
he finds the government a nuisance and 

2588
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:40,580
he wants to deregulate everything.
So by the time he leaves,

2589
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:45,080
he can put a golf course on top of a 
pipeline on a fucking,

2590
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,190
you know?
Yeah.

2591
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:49,040
Indian reservation land,
native American,

2592
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,490
like I feel like that's what he,
like.

2593
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:52,950
His goals are,
uh,

2594
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:58,670
beyond the bullshit that he's saying.
I think he's going in there and he 

2595
01:46:58,670 --> 01:47:00,330
finally gets through like,
you know,

2596
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:04,350
adjust the whole mixer.
So how the fuck he wants it at.

2597
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:09,351
But here's the thing,
he had to win the presidency to do it 

2598
01:47:09,351 --> 01:47:11,400
and the fucking guy did it and I have to
say it,

2599
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:15,240
the storm watching that guy that he 
weathered was amazing.

2600
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

2601
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,450
He got the,
you know,

2602
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:21,390
and that people were so clearly.
I mean,

2603
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:23,340
I all,
those fucking late night shows hated the

2604
01:47:23,341 --> 01:47:25,710
guy and they will basically campaigning 
against him.

2605
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,260
Um,
I mean,

2606
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,180
you're old enough now that you saw like 
you've seen in our lifetime,

2607
01:47:30,181 --> 01:47:32,040
like people going from like,
you know,

2608
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,560
who you voted for was really like,
Whoa,

2609
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:33,940
whoa,
Whoa,

2610
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,300
hey,
you get into personal to now just people

2611
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:38,000
like totally like overtly.
Uh,

2612
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:39,840
I dunno,
there's so much,

2613
01:47:39,841 --> 01:47:41,900
so much hypocritical shit and I'm part 
of a tube.

2614
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,080
But like I love when people like,
Oh,

2615
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,840
you know,
I'm like,

2616
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:48,690
I was saying it to like the fucking 
celebrity apprentice.

2617
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:54,740
The host of that is now president,
but then yet you're watching the 

2618
01:47:54,740 --> 01:47:57,921
Democrat and the Republican national 
conventions and there's comedians and 

2619
01:47:57,921 --> 01:48:00,300
actors speaking at them,
so it's like,

2620
01:48:00,301 --> 01:48:01,110
well,
what the fuck?

2621
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:03,720
It's Kinda all just.
Yeah,

2622
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:09,230
well it's always been a president.
Does late night talk shows and the 

2623
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:11,340
people running for fucking do sketches 
now on snl.

2624
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:14,890
Like the whole thing has just become 
like this orgy clusterfuck.

2625
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:20,470
It's a popularity contest and now they 
got a person who actually popular who 

2626
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:20,880
want it.
I mean that's really what it is.

2627
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,420
All these people that before,
like before Obama ran for office,

2628
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:29,421
nobody knew who the fuck he was.
He wasn't a popular person with Donald 

2629
01:48:29,421 --> 01:48:33,570
Trump.
Managed to do is become a popular guy 

2630
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:34,440
who won the popularity contest.

2631
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:38,460
He was already popular.
He was already a huge figure in American

2632
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:42,120
culture for decades.
Everybody knew who he was,

2633
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,850
so he's the first guy ever to do it like
that.

2634
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:46,680
And that was the thing they were saying 
about Arnold,

2635
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:51,830
that if arnold a diff,
there wasn't those rules that are in 

2636
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:54,801
place to keep arnold from running for 
president because he was born in 

2637
01:48:54,801 --> 01:48:54,801
Austria,
that he could have done it.

2638
01:48:54,801 --> 01:48:55,590
Right.
You know,

2639
01:48:55,591 --> 01:49:00,591
I mean,
it's Kinda the same thing you might be 

2640
01:49:00,591 --> 01:49:02,040
changing in politics was when Clinton 
played the saxophone on our sineal hall.

2641
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:04,160
That was like a,
uh,

2642
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:07,620
that was like the Beatles on the Ed 
Sullivan show for like politicians going

2643
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:08,250
like,
wait a minute,

2644
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:13,251
that's like,
I don't have to fucking talk policy and 

2645
01:49:13,251 --> 01:49:14,310
I just have to do something cool.
You have the sunglasses on.

2646
01:49:14,311 --> 01:49:15,570
And everyone's like,
this guy's cool.

2647
01:49:15,571 --> 01:49:17,820
Mit was one of the first.
That's right.

2648
01:49:17,821 --> 01:49:20,100
He had those ray bans on,
like fucking Tom Cruise.

2649
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:21,210
He,
those wayfair's.

2650
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:26,270
Yeah.
And he made George senior a fucking war 

2651
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:26,880
hero become a one term president.
Yeah.

2652
01:49:26,910 --> 01:49:28,510
Well that was also a little bit of,
um,

2653
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:31,080
a Ron Paul,
not Ron Paul,

2654
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,610
I'm Ross Perot,
Ross Perot,

2655
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:38,360
Ross Perot,
kind of through the monkey wrench into 

2656
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:38,970
the gears in that election.
Remember that?

2657
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,450
That's,
uh,

2658
01:49:39,451 --> 01:49:44,451
that's one of the craziest guys.
He took full up the whole half hour an 

2659
01:49:44,451 --> 01:49:48,160
hour long spots on television,
just bought that TV station,

2660
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:53,670
just bought NBC for an hour and explain 
the tax problem in this country and 

2661
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:57,690
where your money goes.
He made more sense than it did Bush and 

2662
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:57,760
Clinton did.
But the thing is,

2663
01:49:57,761 --> 01:49:59,910
you can't get people to vote for them 
because they,

2664
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,720
they worry that they're throwing their 
vote away.

2665
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,090
I don't believe that.
I think you were encouraging more people

2666
01:50:04,091 --> 01:50:09,091
like that.
We remember what happened with him and 

2667
01:50:09,091 --> 01:50:09,400
he pulled up to this.
How did it go down this fucking road?

2668
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:14,401
What are we doing right era?
It's becoming like meet the press with 

2669
01:50:14,401 --> 01:50:16,960
two peoples who pressing.
I'm pressing.

2670
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:21,961
We don't know shit.
We really half ass to go on the road and

2671
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,550
not talk about this shit because I think
people are sick of it,

2672
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:27,220
which really fucking kills me.
Trying to promote my specials.

2673
01:50:27,221 --> 01:50:29,230
We just went down the rabbit hole for a 
fucking half hour.

2674
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:31,930
I'm going to try to get away from it 
because I think people are going to need

2675
01:50:31,931 --> 01:50:33,610
a break.
They definitely need a break.

2676
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:36,400
You could see it in their face and 
someone brings up trump on stage.

2677
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:41,630
You could see it unless you have a 
really unique point of view or you're 

2678
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:41,920
just being silly about the whole thing.
You know,

2679
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:47,070
I've seen,
I've seen people take that hard stance 

2680
01:50:47,070 --> 01:50:47,770
left the hard left stance on stage and 
it's just depressing,

2681
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,700
you know.
I don't know.

2682
01:50:51,580 --> 01:50:54,850
Women's March material got any of that?
No,

2683
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,270
I did it last night.
Conan.

2684
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:58,600
I just burned it.
I made photos,

2685
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:02,260
making fun of Madonna saying she just 
not just saying how great she is,

2686
01:51:02,261 --> 01:51:04,840
it's self promotion.
How she was working her back catalog,

2687
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:08,170
uh,
she wear a bra like Ooh,

2688
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:10,750
I'm protesting.
So I just started doing shit like,

2689
01:51:10,751 --> 01:51:15,751
you know,
he wants to put a wall up between here 

2690
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:15,751
and Mexico.

2691
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:17,370
In my world.
There are no borders border lie.

2692
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,990
You can download this on itunes.

2693
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,400
Um,
yeah,

2694
01:51:28,401 --> 01:51:33,401
I dunno,
I like when people do shit because I'm 

2695
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:33,401
full of shit.
So I like hypocritical behavior,

2696
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:37,601
but I'm,
I'm excited to get back out on the road 

2697
01:51:37,601 --> 01:51:39,491
and I hope people see my special.
I'm going to have to bounce out of here 

2698
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:40,910
because I got to get my affairs in 
order.

2699
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:43,610
Now that I'm a dad and also made 
affairs.

2700
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:48,680
Yeah.
I get my affairs in here without taking 

2701
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:48,680
some elk.
I got some elk for you.

2702
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:48,800
Oh Great.
Absolutely.

2703
01:51:48,801 --> 01:51:49,390
I,
uh,

2704
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,140
and we're going to take me on a 
helicopter ride.

2705
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,220
We got to do that.
Dude.

2706
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:54,110
I haven't flown since the beginning of 
November,

2707
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,900
so I got to a.

2708
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:59,670

All right.

2709
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,510
All right.
I'm bringing an instructor though.

2710
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:03,260
Okay.
Okay.

2711
01:52:03,261 --> 01:52:05,040
I'm not taken out the Grand Joe.
Romy.

2712
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:05,550
Yeah.
No,

2713
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:08,000
I'll bring an instructor.
Will go fly up there and was great.

2714
01:52:08,001 --> 01:52:12,500
We'll go up in the forks to a weird gig 
like Bakersfield or something.

2715
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:14,600
Oh yeah.
It just feels great.

2716
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,940
Yeah.
Do you do Bakersfield?

2717
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:18,230
I fill up to bakersfield at a good time.

2718
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:19,130
Well,

2719
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:19,830
That's it.
Let's,

Pick you up at Burbank.

2722
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,980
Just fucking take.
You want to do that?

2723
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:26,330
Let's fucking do this.
Yeah.

2724
01:52:26,331 --> 01:52:31,331
Let's book something.
I don't feel like I got a strong our 

2725
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:31,331
right now.
I'm opening.

2726
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:31,440
Beautiful.
Let's do that.

2727
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,350
It can happen.
Where's your hour at?

2728
01:52:33,351 --> 01:52:38,351
Right now?
I'm 40 plus minutes strong and then I 

2729
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:41,180
can bullshit for half an hour on top of 
the walking wounded child.

2730
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:44,010
Fly Up,
dude.

2731
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,170
It would be the shit.
Yeah,

2732
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,040
do it.
Let's do

2733
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,440
books.
That's a done deal.

2734
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:54,210
German politics.
I'm sorry I'm not bringing this up 

2735
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:54,210
anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen.

2736
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:55,760
I just wanted to see if you had to take 
on it.

2737
01:52:55,761 --> 01:53:00,761
That was different than my take and I'm,
I'm as tired of it as you are a Gary 

2738
01:53:00,761 --> 01:53:01,730

Depressing.

2741
01:53:05,370 --> 01:53:07,100
Yes.
As individuals we can,

2742
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:09,170
we can be respectful to one another.
Yeah.

2743
01:53:09,190 --> 01:53:10,420
Try to be a better person.
Yes.

2744
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,620
I liked that on a positive note.
Ladies and gentleman.

2745
