1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,490
The Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,450
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,420
Oh righty.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:18,930
Uh,

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,790
you're looking at something.

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,190
What's going on too loud,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,180
too loud.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,670
Turned down.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,860
Were very obnoxious here.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,973
I like to be loud.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,013
Is this it right here?

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,231
Check,

13
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:28,501
check,

14
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:28,801
check,

15
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,130
check,

16
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,870
check.

17
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,560
There we go.

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,393
Is that fine?

19
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,433
Do you want to fuck with it?

20
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,313
It's that button right there.

21
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,850
One right below the clock.

22
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,953
Here we go.

23
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,040
Welcome to my country,

24
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:37,491
my friend.

25
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,250
I know in your country it's
frozen solid and you escaped.

26
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:40,950
Came down here.

27
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,280
Did a little drinking last night maybe.

28
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,813
Maybe.

29
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,570
Oh No.

30
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:47,960
Yeah.

31
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,793
Yes.

32
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,800
I've been drinking lots of water and
that's what I was telling you that,

33
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,870
you know,

34
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,280
these long podcast was
just wondering if I.

35
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,330
You can absolutely take a pee break.

36
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,410
Do not be intimidated by the long form.

37
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,710
We just try and have a conversation.

38
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,780
Are you working on your new book and
your new book is entitled the Atheist

39
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,620
Muslim.

40
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,080
That's that title is.

41
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,060
That's like jumbo shrimp
or military intelligence.

42
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,200
Is that a one of those?

43
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,113
It was a

44
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,300
partly a tongue and cheek thing and
then there's a serious element to it,

45
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:20,860
to the tongue in cheek thing is I was,

46
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,630
I have a friend who's a,

47
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,640
she calls herself a feminist Muslim,

48
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,260
so I'm not going to name her right now.

49
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:26,730
Okay.

50
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,370
Um,

51
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,250
so I always have fun
conversations with her,

52
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:30,431
you know,

53
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,080
she's sort of nominally religious,

54
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:32,711
right.

55
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,544
And uh,

56
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,330
you know,

57
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:34,511
uh,

58
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:34,871
that was like,

59
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:36,790
how can you be a feminist Muslim?

60
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:39,810
Isn't that like being a
mediating vegetarian or you know,

61
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,020
it's a contradiction.

62
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,221
And she's like,

63
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:42,881
well no,

64
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:44,740
there's parts of it that I liked.

65
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:45,760
Parts of it I don't like.

66
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,130
So I just,

67
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,520
uh,

68
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,690
me choose essentially saying
that she cherry picks.

69
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,520
So I figured.

70
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,031
And then you know,

71
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:52,721
there's other things,

72
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,020
like there's lgbt Muslims in Toronto,

73
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,610
there's a big community of great people.

74
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,140
Yeah,

75
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,300
yeah,

76
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,840
yeah.

77
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,651
Transgender,

78
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,484
Muslims,

79
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,241
transgender,

80
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,074
Muslims,

81
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,921
gay and lesbian,

82
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:03,260
Muslim.

83
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,170
That's a small crowd that's,

84
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,350
it's hard to find your peers and it's,

85
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,611
it's,

86
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:07,940
it's,

87
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,440
it's actually quite
sizeable and it's like,

88
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:10,550
wait,

89
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,720
you mean that 10 people,

90
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,240
how many transgender Muslims are there?

91
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:14,691
Oh,

92
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:14,961
I don't,

93
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:15,860
I don't know what number,

94
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,110
but they practice like,

95
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:18,411
yeah,

96
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:19,730
they practice their religious,

97
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:20,211
they do,

98
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:20,780
um,

99
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,940
they do like Friday prayers and you know,

100
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,460
things like that have a
lot of events that go on.

101
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:25,940
So,

102
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,530
but clearly in the Muslim religion
like homosexuality and you know,

103
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:31,520
there's a lot of,

104
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,220
there's,

105
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,050
there's a lot of areas of that
that are looked down upon.

106
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:36,740
Right,

107
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,100
right.

108
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,980
So how does one justify
that or rationalize

109
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,890
in their head?

110
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,101
It's,

111
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:45,450
I think what's happening is the Muslim
community that's in North America and

112
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:45,901
Canada,

113
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,630
the United States,

114
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,660
they're a little bit more progressive.

115
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,960
They're sort of going through what
all of the other religious groups went

116
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:54,450
through when they came here
as they kind of have like,

117
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:54,511
you know,

118
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:57,300
the religion part is really
more of an identity issue.

119
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,700
They have broad beliefs
like they'll believe in God,

120
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:02,770
they'll believe with the
stick to some traditions.

121
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,770
But um,

122
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,110
you know,

123
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,580
the large part of it,

124
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,000
like they're integrating pretty well
and it's very different in Europe.

125
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,620
It seems sort of

126
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,111
for like,

127
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:12,561
um,

128
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:16,580
American Jews perhaps like a lot of
American Jews are not really religious at

129
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:16,671
all.

130
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,190
Like I have a lot of friends
that will call themselves Jus,

131
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,700
like my friend Ari Shaffir,

132
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,040
clearly an atheist,

133
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,540
but yet if you talk to him,

134
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,500
he'll tell you he's a Jew.

135
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,470
Yeah.

136
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,660
And there's that.

137
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,280
That was kind of.

138
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,320
Yeah.

139
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,320
The idea of the title of the book is
it's a job that the cherry picking thing.

140
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,600
I was thinking if you
could cherry pick up,

141
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,400
you're going to be a feminist
Muslim and lgbt Muslim if you.

142
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,610
I can cherry pick all.

143
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,330
I can cherry pick all
the way to non belief.

144
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,350
Yeah.

145
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,850
I'll keep the things I like,

146
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,451
like,

147
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,284
uh,

148
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
like I love the Ramadan feasts.

149
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,563
I grew up with that.

150
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,703
Um,

151
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,251
you know,

152
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:52,490
the,

153
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,900
it's just very communal.

154
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,160
Families get together.

155
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:55,551
It's great.

156
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,110
The IED holidays are great.

157
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,630
I'm tax exempt status.

158
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,310
You know,

159
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,150
why not keep that.

160
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,010
But what can you only have tax exempt
status if you operate a religion though,

161
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,870
right?

162
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,110
I mean,

163
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,943
I'm kidding about that.

164
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,460
You can have to operate your own church.

165
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,463
Yeah,

166
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,570
I probably won't be
doing that anytime soon.

167
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,210
You can do it if you want to.

168
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,920
My friend Alex Grey does that.

169
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,731
Our friend Alex,

170
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:17,564
the painter,

171
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,740
he's this amazing psychedelic
artist and he has this,

172
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:22,370
uh,

173
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,530
this organization called the chapel
of the sacred mirrors and uh,

174
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,580
what he's essentially does is,

175
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,620
has done rather is create his own
religion and he has tax exempt status.

176
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,670
Although his is,

177
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,870
I think that not like
the state recognizes it,

178
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:43,130
but his town doesn't want to recognize
that they want like local taxes.

179
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:47,780
And it's very interesting because people
are cool with religions as long as

180
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:48,890
they're really old,

181
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,060
as long as they're,

182
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,570
like,

183
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,730
as soon as you know who made the religion,

184
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:56,330
whether it's even mormonism gets
looked down upon because Joseph Smith,

185
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:57,860
although he lived in the 18 hundreds,

186
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:58,311
everybody,

187
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,380
there's a historical
record of Joseph Smith.

188
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:02,780
It's pretty easy to track.

189
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,200
Yeah.

190
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,910
Whereas,

191
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,490
you know,

192
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,350
scientology is the most made fun of and
that is by a science fiction writer in

193
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,400
the 19 fifties.

194
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,600
It's the easiest to track.

195
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:11,990
It's like,

196
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,860
it's right there.

197
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,270
Anything newer than that,

198
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:14,541
you're like,

199
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:14,841
come on,

200
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:15,800
get the fuck Outta here.

201
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,170
I know you wouldn't believe it.

202
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,420
And even though it's older religions,

203
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,111
if you brought them back,

204
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,250
if they started recently,

205
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,430
some of the,

206
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,030
it's just,

207
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,530
uh,

208
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:22,801
you know,

209
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,230
when religious people make fun
of scientology and what isn't,

210
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,150
it's always entertaining because,

211
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,710
you know,

212
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,461
you're talking about like,

213
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:29,840
well yeah,

214
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,370
Angel was a real and virgin
births really happened,

215
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:34,080
but like this fucking Mormon.

216
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,833
So it's uh,

217
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,220
I know it's,

218
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,350
it's Kinda funny when you look at it,

219
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:44,700
I think I saw this comic where there
were these two religious groups fighting.

220
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,960
They're running against each other and
swords and one of them was screaming,

221
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,220
two plus two equals five.

222
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,110
The other one was saying
two plus two equals three.

223
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,060
And then we about to fight about it.

224
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,460
And that's really what it's like
sometimes when you look at it.

225
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:56,880
Well,

226
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,770
did see the,

227
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,400
the anger

228
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,910
from the people that
were upset at Neil Tyson,

229
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,910
Neil degrasse Tyson for
tweeting about Isaac Newton,

230
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,901
Isaac Newton,

231
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:08,120
who was born on December 25th.

232
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,360
And you know,

233
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,850
there were,

234
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,960
there was a Darwin or Newton
that was born in December,

235
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,820
25th Newton.

236
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,521
Was it Newton?

237
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,270
Yeah.

238
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,050
And he was,

239
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,730
he was tweeting about,

240
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,430
you know,

241
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,430
w w this great man being born on this
great day and so many fucking religious

242
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,920
people got really angry at him.

243
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:28,640
Although he said nothing negative
whatsoever about religion.

244
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,260
Yeah.

245
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,611
But they will,

246
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:29,800
uh,

247
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,050
you know,

248
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,520
you shouldn't on our holiday.

249
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,350
And it to me sort of highlights what
religion is for a lot of people.

250
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:36,810
It's,

251
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,570
it's a group that you belong to.

252
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,531
It's a team.

253
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:41,150
Like I'm a patriots fan,

254
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:41,871
you know,

255
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,190
don't fuck with our team.

256
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,860
And it really does become
something like that.

257
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,130
And when you're talking about American
Jews or Muslims maybe perhaps that don't

258
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:54,410
really follow all of what's in the Koran,

259
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,120
they just decided to cherry pick.

260
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,460
It's kind of a similar
thing you're dealing with.

261
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,450
It is a silhouette similar thing.

262
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,410
That's probably a good thing.

263
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:00,621
I mean,

264
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,280
that's how people sort
of progress forwards,

265
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,680
right?

266
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:03,941
I,

267
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,680
uh,

268
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,790
I mean we're talking about
Jews in the Old Testament is,

269
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,440
you know,

270
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,900
we're talking about killing gay
people like leviticus 2013 says it,

271
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,471
it says,

272
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:12,681
you know,

273
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,480
if there's two men and you find them,

274
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,091
you know,

275
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:17,510
together and the way that a
man should be with a woman,

276
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,370
then there'll be put to death.

277
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,570
That's exactly what it says.

278
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,450
But most Jews don't really
take that seriously.

279
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
They have built beyond it.

280
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,520
Um,

281
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,230
even,

282
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,630
you know,

283
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,400
Christians,

284
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:27,980
you know,

285
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,960
one of the things I look at is Catholics.

286
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,880
The pope says you should not
use birth control or you know,

287
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,170
abortion is a bad thing.

288
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,790
The majority of Catholics are there.

289
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,840
Pro Choice,

290
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,111
you know,

291
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,310
they have premarital sex.

292
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,031
Uh,

293
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:41,780
they are,

294
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,320
you know,

295
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,190
they're perfectly fine with all these
things because the majority are pro choice

296
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,250
over here in the U.

297
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,660
S air.

298
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,493
Is it the zero,

299
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,551
like a statistic,

300
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,180
the prove that.

301
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,331
Yeah,

302
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:50,631
there is.

303
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,560
I don't know the exact number,

304
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,220
but the majority of Catholics in the
United States are actually pro choice.

305
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,680
That's interesting because I would
have not thought that was true.

306
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,460
Yeah,

307
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,180
I would have thought that it would
probably be at the very least 50 slash 50,

308
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,920
but at the very more likely
skewing towards prolife.

309
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:06,610
No,

310
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:06,761
it's,

311
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,281
it's definitely.

312
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:11,390
I mean there are pro choice and Joe
Biden's a Catholic practicing Catholic and

313
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,290
he's also pro choice.

314
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,820
Big is also an idiot though

315
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,580
when we were a comics
back in the funniest.

316
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah,

317
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,201
he is.

318
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:21,680
Yeah.

319
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
Well people forget about this,

320
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:23,720
about Joe Biden,

321
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,560
but you know,

322
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,393
not to.

323
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,920
Everybody makes mistakes and I'm
sure it probably wasn't his fault,

324
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,120
but uh,

325
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,160
in the 19 eighties he was running for
president and he plagiarized a huge chunk

326
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,750
of John f Kennedy's speeches.

327
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,111
Yeah,

328
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:36,680
he did.

329
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,680
And we used to do Joe Biden tonight at
stitches and Joe Biden night would be

330
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,140
like,

331
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,630
we would all go up and try to
remember each other's acts.

332
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,300
Like I would try to do my friends
act and he would try to do my act.

333
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:47,720
We tried it,

334
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,920
we'd steal each other's jokes.

335
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,610
It was like an inside thing that
we would do on open mic night.

336
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,300
Yeah.

337
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,511
That,

338
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:53,720
uh,

339
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,291
this guy,

340
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,124
uh,

341
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,090
I forget who came up with the idea,

342
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
but we would call it,

343
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,530
he was such a known plagiarist that
we would call it Joe Biden tonight.

344
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,221
Yeah.

345
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:02,641
That kind of.

346
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,220
I think that was one of the major
things that killed his campaign.

347
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,030
Not the only thing.

348
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,420
Yeah.

349
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,420
But now he's the vice president
and it's sort of never brought up.

350
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,351
Yeah,

351
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,184
he's,

352
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,390
I think he's done.

353
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,240
There's a lot of stuff he's done that
I think that kind of redeemed him,

354
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,290
you know,

355
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,830
I'm right.

356
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,160
But how did that not come up when
he was debating Sarah Pailin?

357
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,053
It did.

358
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,620
And it didn't come up during the debate,

359
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,790
but during the campaign there were,

360
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,990
people will try to bring it up,

361
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,050
but I think that just,

362
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,530
it had been so long and he had
done so much more since then,

363
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
like with foreign policy,

364
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:37,500
with the violence against
women legislation and so
on that people were willing

365
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,150
to let them get past.

366
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,490
And he has a really strong
personal story too that he,

367
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,703
you know,

368
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
emphasized.

369
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,000
And so I think,

370
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,690
uh,

371
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,100
he was able to move past that.

372
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,090
It's interesting because a lot of times
things like that are real career killers

373
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,880
and it was as far as like him
being the actual president,

374
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:54,714
president,

375
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,820
like when people talk about
Hillary running for president,

376
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,370
no one's talking about Joe
Biden run for president.

377
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,350
If you noticed that like no one,

378
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,290
no.

379
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,600
Was he running for president?

380
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,763
He's not right,

381
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,760
but he's the vice president for eight
fucking years and no one hates him.

382
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,290
You know,

383
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,760
it's not like he's Dan quayle
where everybody's like,

384
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,590
get that fucking moron out of office.

385
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:13,770
He,

386
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,730
he never did.

387
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,170
Like even in the other campaigns,

388
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,010
whenever he's run,

389
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,470
he never really did too well.

390
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,460
I mean he was,

391
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,270
he was running against Obama to back
into it and then Obama chosen was vice

392
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:24,601
president.

393
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,130
He,

394
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,910
I think he was always
in the single digits.

395
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,571
Right.

396
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:29,430
But I mean he is the vice president.

397
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:29,881
He is.

398
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:34,410
I think that that would be like a prime
candidate to keep the Democrats in a

399
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,400
position of power,

400
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,010
but now they're looking
towards a woman instead.

401
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,500
Yeah.

402
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,861
Like Dude,

403
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:39,780
you're a liability.

404
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,690
It was like Dick Cheney,

405
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:42,870
right?

406
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,920
He was vice president,

407
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,620
but there's no fucking way he's going to.

408
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,670
He's probably the most
hated vice president ever.

409
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:51,870
Dick Cheney,

410
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,520
like the most despised,

411
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,830
like there's some people
that supported him for sure,

412
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,930
but the people that hated
him really fucking hated it.

413
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,430
Yeah,

414
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,020
they did.

415
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,470
It was just such a money trail,

416
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,011
you know,

417
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,740
pointing him directly to
Halliburton and all the,

418
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,191
you know,

419
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,950
the weapons of mass destruction
fiasco and all that shit.

420
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,130
I just think he just
seems really dodgy to me.

421
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:14,580
Like I always feel like there's something
under the surface that's just really

422
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:15,960
explosive and evil.

423
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:17,190
Like he comes across that way.

424
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah.

425
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,120
He's definitely doesn't come across
warm and compassionate and interesting.

426
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,220
Yeah.

427
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,180
It's hard to understand a guy like that.

428
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,770
Especially a guy that's gone through
some serious health issues and he does.

429
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,140
It doesn't seem to have
more heart attacks,

430
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,970
so we got a new heart.

431
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,470
He's a.

432
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,740
He had a heart transplant,

433
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,060
which is insane.

434
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,580
Yeah.

435
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,860
Before the heart transplant,

436
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:42,270
he had some sort of a device
that eliminated his pulse.

437
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,710
He didn't have a pulse.

438
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,540
There was some artificial method of
pumping blood through his body and if you

439
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,500
checked his pulse,

440
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:50,460
he didn't exist,

441
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,040
which is probably in the Bible somewhere,

442
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:53,980
you know,

443
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,320
a guy who was the death of millions.

444
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:56,531
I mean,

445
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:01,531
he's directly connected to the death of
at least a million people and he doesn't

446
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,524
have a pulse.

447
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah,

448
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,833
that's,

449
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
that's dark shit.

450
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,441
Yeah.

451
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,120
That's a hell of a way to articulate it,

452
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,013
but yeah,

453
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,860
if it's accurate,

454
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,693
it's accurate.

455
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't know how we got on this.

456
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,400
What we're talking about is
people that are in groups.

457
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,180
I mean there's,

458
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,470
there's,

459
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,800
there's good things involved in being a
group because it gives you some support

460
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:27,801
and it gives you some feeling of comradery
and belong to a social structure.

461
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,730
But it's the.

462
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,750
The real issue though is groups against
other groups diametrically opposed

463
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:36,804
groups like,

464
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,760
like right now being a Muslim is a very
unpopular thing in a lot of parts of the

465
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,530
world.

466
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,250
The Charlie Hebdo thing,

467
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:48,930
this most recent isis video where
they burned the Jordanian pilot ally.

468
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,590
That was just kind of shaking for hours.

469
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,910
I didn't watch it.

470
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,871
I didn't watch it either.

471
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:57,150
I've seen it all at this point.

472
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,080
I know what it looks like.

473
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,440
I've seen the beheadings and the
assassinations and it's just like,

474
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,274
okay,

475
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,323
I get it.

476
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,410
There's evil people.

477
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,981
I get it,

478
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,090
but it's just like this.

479
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,170
It's almost like it's.

480
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,470
If you were a conspiratorially
minded person,

481
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,310
if you're the type of person that believes
black helicopters were circling your

482
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:15,030
house everyday,

483
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,800
taking scans of your phone and you.

484
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,833
I am,

485
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,270
you would say,

486
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,104
okay.

487
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,170
It's almost like we're creating this
monster that so unbelievably horrific and

488
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,440
so impossible to to,

489
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,580
to feel any sympathy towards that.

490
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,261
It's like you,

491
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:35,460
you,

492
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,730
you,

493
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,060
you,

494
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,460
you want them all wiped
off the face of the planet.

495
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:41,790
It's almost like they have
become this so they're,

496
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:46,500
they're so evil in their acts
are so horrendous that like,

497
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,730
it's the perfect instigating weapon like,

498
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:54,170
or the perfect perfect method of
instigation that if you wanted to,

499
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,360
if you were like an evil dictator or
the evil head of some sort of government

500
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,060
and you had this desire to go
to war with another country,

501
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,090
like what you would create would be isis.

502
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:06,871
You would say,

503
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:07,140
alright,

504
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,400
we need some bullshit.

505
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,900
CIA propped up,

506
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,100
organization doesn't,

507
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,790
it's not real and we need
them to be just so heinous.

508
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So beyond belief that everyone agrees we
should go over there and fuck them up.

509
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,760
Yeah.

510
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,840
I like,

511
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,310
I totally see the logic of that.

512
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,510
I don't obviously,

513
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,650
I don't think that's the case.

514
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,880
I don't think that's the case either,

515
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,130
but if it was going to be the case,

516
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,410
like isis is like the perfect candidate.

517
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:32,531
Yeah,

518
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:33,341
it's a prototype.

519
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,260
It's like that's exactly what you'd want.

520
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,461
Yeah.

521
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,790
It's like right in a Hollywood casting,

522
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,091
right?

523
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:37,450
Yeah.

524
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah.

525
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,711
And you know,

526
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,544
what's a,

527
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,530
like this whole idea that
they're a fringe and you know,

528
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,140
that they don't have a lot of support.

529
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,580
You know,

530
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,810
it is one thing that yes,

531
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,460
they don't represent all Muslims,

532
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,660
like they don't even represent,

533
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,050
you know,

534
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,350
the majority of Muslims and everything.

535
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,420
But um,

536
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,180
unfortunately like I think they have
a lot more support than we'd like to

537
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:56,890
believe.

538
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,090
Everybody who comes out and says
that know there's just like a frame,

539
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,690
just a,

540
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,100
you know,

541
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,430
group of guys who are doing this
stuff and nobody really follows them.

542
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,390
That's not true.

543
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,081
Like,

544
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,180
there's a lot of support
and may you see it online,

545
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:08,511
you know,

546
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:11,960
I've talked to people online impact
Stan who totally supportive isis.

547
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,273
Um,

548
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,960
it's a bizarre,

549
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,591
you know,

550
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,040
they are like,

551
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,170
they won't go out and commit
those acts themselves,

552
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,690
but they will definitely share it on.

553
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,291
Well,

554
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,680
I'd follow some people
online that are in Isis.

555
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:26,090
I follow their twitter accounts.

556
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,540
Yeah.

557
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:26,841
You know,

558
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,890
I don't follow them.

559
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:30,230
So like they know I'm falling on a farm,

560
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,720
so I bookmark their twitter
page and I go back to it.

561
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,440
Yeah,

562
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,430
I'm sneaky like that.

563
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,010
But I mean,

564
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,660
I hate to say this,

565
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,170
but they do occasionally have good points.

566
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,850
And one of the good points was they,

567
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,830
after they beheaded one of these guys,

568
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,360
I forget which guy was,

569
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,820
I think it was a journalist
that got beheaded over there.

570
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,500
It was one of the American guys.

571
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,990
They beheaded the,

572
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,080
this guy wrote one guy loses a
body part and everyone goes crazy,

573
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,660
but thousands of people lose their entire
lives and no one blinks an eye like

574
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:06,860
thousands.

575
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,220
I think the way you said it is thousands
of people's bodies are blown to bits

576
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:10,940
and,

577
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,290
and no one blinks an eye.

578
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,011
Yeah,

579
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,050
that's a tough thing to argue against it.

580
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,933
That's what,

581
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,690
whenever this kind of thing happens,

582
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,600
you always have a,

583
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,221
you know,

584
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,310
the sort of Noam Chomsky or kind of,

585
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,020
um,

586
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,440
sort of mindset or you know,

587
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,250
what he thinks is that you've got us
on this side and we're doing all these

588
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,860
terrible things and you've got them and
they're doing these terrible things.

589
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:31,694
What's the difference?

590
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,411
I just,

591
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,820
I don't think it's as simple as that.

592
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,121
I mean,

593
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,050
I'm not saying that,

594
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:36,260
you know,

595
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,760
everything that the US is doing is great
and defending all aspects of American

596
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,594
foreign policy.

597
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,050
But if you're going to have that balance,

598
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,650
you got to a sort of
level the competition.

599
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,460
So,

600
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:49,671
you know,

601
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,720
the US has this,

602
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,830
the biggest,

603
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,470
strongest military in the world
got loads of nuclear weapons.

604
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,330
So on,

605
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,320
like if isis had all of that,

606
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,300
how bad would they be
and what would they do?

607
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,570
That's when you really sort of get an
idea of the intentions and intentions

608
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:05,260
matter.

609
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,093
Right?

610
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,580
So you know,

611
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:07,831
they,

612
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:11,570
they do what they can and
they go all out and they,

613
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,980
I think that,

614
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,390
you know,

615
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,950
like the [inaudible] that they killed,

616
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:16,880
right?

617
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,670
Or the Christians that
they're killing in Mosul,

618
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,490
the poor people that the women in the gay
people that throwing off buildings and

619
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:22,680
you know,

620
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,590
crucifying and stoning to death.

621
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:24,740
I mean,

622
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,230
these are not people who are oil hungry,

623
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:31,040
they're not people who have been sort
of invading their lands or anything like

624
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,270
that.

625
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,670
These are,

626
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,810
these people have nothing to do with it.

627
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,610
They just have some of their
crimes that they're just Shia.

628
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:40,810
They have a different belief
in a different strain of
Islam or their PA states,

629
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:41,781
you know,

630
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:42,470
they left Islam,

631
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,870
they changed their mind or they're,

632
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:45,201
you know,

633
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:45,861
they're a Christian,

634
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:50,430
they're non Muslims are infidels who
are not going to subscribe to the,

635
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:50,701
you know,

636
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,870
the Isis philosophy.

637
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,100
They're not going to pay that tax,

638
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,660
that Jessia that they want them to pay.

639
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,070
So like,

640
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,933
you know,

641
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,980
I think that the foreign policy thing is
an excuse specifically for people like

642
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:02,814
Isis.

643
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,811
It is like,

644
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:06,210
it helps them recruit people for sure.

645
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,453
Um,

646
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,363
it doesn't hurt,

647
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,510
but,

648
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,810
uh,

649
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,970
I don't think that that's
the primary motive.

650
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,830
What do you think the primary motive is?

651
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,080
I think there's a lot of primary motives.

652
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:16,321
I think,

653
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:16,830
you know,

654
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,450
like the US foreign
policy is one thing too,

655
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,230
but this is actually part
of their religious belief.

656
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,410
You've had Sam Harris here,

657
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,730
he's talked about this as well as the
beliefs and behavior and most of the time

658
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,550
when they're in here,

659
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,320
when you have an entire world and
you're seeing these guys in there,

660
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,030
you know,

661
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,500
accurately quoting the Koran.

662
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,101
I mean,

663
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:37,950
there's a couple of verses in the
Koran say behead disbelievers,

664
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,161
you know,

665
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:38,401
eight,

666
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,234
12,

667
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:39,631
you know,

668
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,680
you can google that,

669
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,020
like Sera eight verse 12 and 13,

670
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,641
47.

671
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,960
Four is another one says,

672
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,111
you know,

673
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,010
bighead disbelievers.

674
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,370
So they actually quote this stuff and
they say Allahu Akbar when they do it and

675
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,420
they called themselves the Islamic state.

676
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,010
So,

677
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,270
and,

678
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,960
and they don't just target,

679
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,070
you know,

680
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm sort of,

681
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,420
people were involved in US foreign
policy or anything like that.

682
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,860
They actually target a poor people,

683
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,400
you know,

684
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
use minority groups.

685
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,303
She is,

686
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,970
you know,

687
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,700
gay people who are in Iraq and Syria,

688
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,970
that's what they do and
this doesn't believe it.

689
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,140
So it's a lot more complicated.

690
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,120
I think that it is part
of their religious belief.

691
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,150
And one thing you need to see when you
go to their twitter accounts is that they

692
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,980
genuinely believe what
they're doing is right.

693
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,320
It's okay when you are supported by the
religion that you've sworn allegiance to

694
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,820
and sworn your life too when
you're supported by the text.

695
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,330
Yeah,

696
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:36,600
it,

697
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,200
it really.

698
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,471
I mean,

699
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,950
that's sometimes all you
need to justify horrendous,

700
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,030
horrible acts.

701
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,270
You just need to know that you're
doing it in the name of God.

702
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:45,780
Well,

703
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,740
that's the text.

704
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,330
Is the religion in this case,

705
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:49,950
like the one thing that's universal,

706
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,700
you know,

707
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,950
people say Muslims are not
a monolith and they're not.

708
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,161
I mean,

709
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,200
there's one point 6 billion
Muslims in the world,

710
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,670
so they're obviously not all the same.

711
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,810
The ones in Indonesia,

712
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:58,321
Turkey,

713
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:58,891
Saudi Arabia,

714
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:00,270
they're all very
different from each other.

715
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,603
Um,

716
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,060
but the one thing they all have in common
is the Koran and belief in the Prophet

717
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,270
Muhammad.

718
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,103
So,

719
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,770
uh,

720
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,430
that the Quran again do,

721
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:09,610
you know,

722
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,860
has different interpretations,

723
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:15,861
but it's supposed to be an immutable
texts and unlike a lot of Christians and

724
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,130
Jews who don't believe that,

725
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:17,964
they're like,

726
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,133
you know,

727
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,430
like with Christianity,

728
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,700
if you say that the Bible
is a literal word of God,

729
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,841
you're part of,

730
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,290
I think 30 percent of the US population,

731
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,110
I think it is 30 percent that
is considered fundamentalists
where they believe

732
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:34,810
that it's a literal word of God in Islam,

733
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,140
Muslims among the vast
majority of Muslims.

734
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:41,730
That is a fundamental
requirement to believe that
it is the literal word of God.

735
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,300
Like the,

736
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,840
the idea of scriptural inerrancy,

737
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,670
that anything that's in Chron
that kept it can't be wrong.

738
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,810
So you'll have the more progressive
people who try to justify it.

739
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,033
They'll never say,

740
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,341
well,

741
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:54,671
you know,

742
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,990
that verse in the Koran,

743
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:57,160
I don't believe in it.

744
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,150
I don't think it's right.

745
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,600
They'll try to justify it by
saying at that time it was okay,

746
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,190
or it's being mistranslated or the word
kill actually means embrace whatever it

747
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:06,990
is.

748
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,631
They look at the,

749
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:08,200
uh,

750
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,921
Arabic root.

751
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:09,490
So the,

752
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,323
um,

753
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:10,980
uh,

754
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,813
you know,

755
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,420
find other justifications for it,

756
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,020
but unfortunately to the rest of us who
can read it and now you can google it in

757
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,480
all kinds of different translations and
interpretations and commentaries and

758
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,670
you'd just find it online
and when you see the words,

759
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:28,750
the words are what they are.

760
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,000
I want to be real clear here that I'm
not justifying what they're doing or not

761
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:39,140
trying to exonerate them from the
nature of what their crimes are.

762
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,550
But um,

763
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,030
what,

764
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,200
uh,

765
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,720
what I'm,

766
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,880
what I was going to get to was that,

767
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,310
is that dissimilar,

768
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:50,540
this belief that you can kill people
because of the Koran because they're not

769
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,620
following the word of the cross.

770
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,070
Is that dissimilar than this belief
that you can launch drones into these

771
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,170
nonspecific areas where,

772
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:00,531
you know,

773
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:04,610
this idea of surgical targets is
pretty preposterous at this point.

774
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,470
When you look at the number of people,

775
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,500
the overwhelming number of people that
are innocent that are killed by drones

776
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,130
versus the number of
people that are guilty.

777
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,210
If you,

778
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,210
if you look at that and you look at this
being sanctioned by the United States

779
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:20,211
government,

780
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,410
the constitution,

781
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:24,980
our ideas about law and justice and war,

782
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,700
those are also just things
that are written down on paper.

783
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,241
I mean,

784
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:33,980
they might be less
ideologically based and more,

785
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,010
more state based or more based on the
idea of protecting our nation as opposed

786
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,050
to doing the will of God.

787
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,690
But it is one nation under God.

788
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,441
Ultimately,

789
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:45,981
this is,

790
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:46,280
you know,

791
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,350
this is what we say when we pledge
allegiance now since the 19 fifties,

792
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,340
since they were worried about
the big communist scare,

793
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,031
you know,

794
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:56,990
it used to be one nation indivisible
with liberty and justice for all right?

795
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,390
Yeah.

796
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,270
Now it's one nation under God.

797
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,443
Um,

798
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,360
that was all because of communism.

799
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:02,660
That's,

800
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,560
that's when they didn't.

801
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:06,370
And most folks don't even realize I
wasn't even in there until the 1950.

802
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
I was a reaction to like the,

803
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:08,130
uh,

804
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,170
the red scare.

805
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,103
Um,

806
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,173
but this,

807
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,000
this is the justification,

808
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,240
the horrific acts that are committed in,

809
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,050
in war,

810
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,760
nonspecific targets.

811
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,390
I mean,

812
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,770
when I say nonspecific,

813
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,190
obviously they're trying to
get someone that's in a place,

814
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,941
but you know,

815
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:28,190
when you're shooting a
fucking missile where,

816
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:28,700
you know,

817
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,260
a guy's cell phone is,

818
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,540
that's fairly nonspecific.

819
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,830
I mean,

820
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,460
yeah,

821
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,420
relatively speaking,

822
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,100
relatively spirit will look,

823
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,610
I think,

824
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,391
what are the numbers?

825
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:43,391
I think the numbers of versus like the
amount of casualties that are civilians,

826
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,130
the actual people

827
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,270
that are to kill with drones.

828
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,800
It's something sane number.

829
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,840
It's like more than 80 percent civilians.

830
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,380
Here's,

831
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,060
so the drone thing is a little,

832
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,570
uh,

833
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,130
it's also a complicated issue.

834
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,631
There's this,

835
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,464
uh,

836
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,031
this writer,

837
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,390
her name is Farhan Dodge.

838
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,380
I mean she lives in Norway now,

839
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:01,460
but she's from that area.

840
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:05,000
She's from North Missouri stand where
a lot of the drones were and she wrote

841
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,590
this article a couple of years ago,

842
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,190
I think it was in the daily
times than Asian paper.

843
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:15,191
And then what she talked about was a
sort of the different groups that are in

844
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,990
that area and like northwestern Pakistan,

845
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,250
the Pak Afghan border.

846
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,370
And she said that the locals
over there a lot of times,

847
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,121
uh,

848
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:23,291
you know,

849
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,810
they feel like they're caught between
the Taliban that's sort of taken over the

850
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,703
whole area and they,

851
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,050
you know,

852
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,920
they go out and they put a,

853
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,700
they're shooting young girls in the
head for going to school and they're,

854
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:33,990
you know,

855
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,120
doing all this other bullshit.

856
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,740
And then on the other hand there is the
Pakistani military and they're coming in

857
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,530
with their planes and they're trying to
bomb and that's even more nonspecific.

858
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:47,531
So they feel a lot of them
are actually in favor of it.

859
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:48,951
Like there's many of them.

860
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,784
That's what she said.

861
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,640
So I don't know how true that is.

862
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,091
Right.

863
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:53,571
But I mean,

864
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:56,390
it's definitely a plausible claim.

865
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,710
And so,

866
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,020
you know,

867
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,190
it's kind of anecdotal doing,

868
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:00,680
you know,

869
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,260
one person saying a lot of
them are in favor of it.

870
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:03,670
Yeah.

871
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:03,930
Well,

872
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,161
I mean,

873
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,660
what happened was after she said this,

874
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:05,780
uh,

875
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,080
there were a lot of other accounts that
came out that said the same kind of

876
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:09,410
thing.

877
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:09,601
I mean,

878
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:09,690
they,

879
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,690
they weren't saying that
everybody's in favor of it.

880
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,070
They're saying that it's not as
clear cut as people think it is.

881
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,840
So like with drones,

882
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,081
you know,

883
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:18,501
for instance,

884
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,930
if you like the idea is that when you.

885
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,340
I'm like,

886
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,850
you know,

887
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,830
these are decisions that are,

888
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,100
you know,

889
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,960
you got to choose between bad and worse,

890
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,370
like complicated decisions
are never clear cut,

891
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,220
good or bad.

892
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,960
Right.

893
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,060
So I don't like the drone strikes.

894
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:38,180
I think it sucks that
sometimes they're necessary,

895
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,910
but unfortunately I think sometimes
they aren't necessarily like these are

896
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:41,744
people who are,

897
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,190
if you have a sniper it was going around
killing hundreds of people and you want

898
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,780
to stop them and you know,

899
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,970
he's around a place and
you have a choice between,

900
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,390
you know,

901
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,050
targeting this guy and taking him out
and that may kill a few civilians.

902
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,650
Whereas if you don't do that,

903
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,600
it'll go out and you know,

904
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,050
he'll kill hundreds more
people then and you,

905
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,070
you're making that call.

906
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,630
That's a really tough call to make.

907
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:03,650
I don't know if I could do it,

908
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,401
you know,

909
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:04,760
and,

910
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,680
but I,

911
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:06,050
I,

912
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,810
when you're running countries and we
know when you have a foreign policy,

913
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,160
when you,

914
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,010
when you have to do something
about something that's happening,

915
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:17,090
then it's a call that you have to make
and it's a choice between bad and worse.

916
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,160
It seems so intensely archaic,

917
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:19,910
doesn't it?

918
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,500
Yeah.

919
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,530
Wasn't one of the articles that I pulled
up was talking about an attempt to kill

920
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,790
41 men result in the deaths
of an estimated 1000,

921
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,860
147 people.

922
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,880
So the drones in their attempt to kill
41 different people have killed more than

923
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,930
1000,

924
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,880
147 people.

925
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,063
That's just so.

926
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,343
Well for her.

927
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,780
She talked about this too.

928
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,020
So she talked about the uh,

929
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,780
like so in that area,

930
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,520
nobody's allowed there.

931
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:51,821
Okay.

932
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:54,910
So you're not like journalists don't
go there because it's too dangerous.

933
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:55,600
Even.

934
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,700
What areas is that?

935
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,770
This is in northern south was stan.

936
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,080
Yeah,

937
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,551
in Pakistan.

938
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:03,250
Now the armies in there because
they're fighting against them.

939
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:07,780
Recently after the Taliban has been like
really focusing all their attacks in

940
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,800
within Pakistan,

941
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,210
they have attacked the army school,

942
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,530
um,

943
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,000
and killed all those kids and so on.

944
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,980
So now they're in there.

945
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,410
But before when a lot of
these figures were coming out,

946
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,010
uh,

947
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,970
she said that,

948
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,291
uh,

949
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:19,520
that,

950
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:19,920
uh,

951
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,310
there's no UN people,

952
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:22,810
there's no independent sort of,

953
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,540
um,

954
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,090
uh,

955
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,520
you know,

956
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,650
watchdogs or agencies
that are looking at it.

957
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,090
No journalist can go in there,

958
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:29,410
no politicians can go in there.

959
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,401
Even the police,

960
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:34,060
the police are scared to go in there
because it's just completely ruled by the

961
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,890
Taliban and all these
sort of militant elements.

962
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,420
So a lot of these numbers,

963
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:39,254
like if you look at the,

964
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,540
I think it was a report,

965
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,200
detailed report from Stanford and um,

966
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,370
they talked about how these numbers were
arrived at and there's a wide range.

967
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:49,990
There's some people report their very low,

968
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,430
other people report their very high.

969
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,820
And that's not to say there
haven't been civilian casualties.

970
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:55,654
There have been,

971
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,400
and that's terrible.

972
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,653
But um,

973
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,410
I think that during Bush's time when he
just carried out a few drone strikes,

974
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,120
they were relatively nonsurgical.

975
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,291
I think Obama,

976
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:09,370
one of the reason that he decided to go
ahead and continue the drone strikes is

977
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:13,840
that he founded the most surgical in
the most accurate compared to all of the

978
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:14,980
other options that they had.

979
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,070
That's pretty scary when you think about.

980
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,520
Well,

981
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,160
it makes sense,

982
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,740
bad choosing bad and worse.

983
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,280
Right?

984
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,160
But it makes sense when you look at
the numbers of innocence that have been

985
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,210
killed in the Iraq war.

986
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,700
Yeah.

987
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Like mean mean it's arguable that
it's close to a million dollars,

988
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,220
a million humans rather than.

989
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,171
I mean that's,

990
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:36,720
that's an insane amount of innocent
people that had been killed by feet on the

991
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:37,141
ground,

992
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:37,830
missiles,

993
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,850
bombing campaigns,

994
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:39,763
all of the above.

995
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,590
And when you compare
that to drone strikes,

996
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,020
that's the only way,

997
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,380
kind of like what they're saying.

998
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:49,080
Like it's more surgical than that way.

999
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,681
Then,

1000
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:49,951
you know,

1001
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:53,800
sending a bunch of tanks and
a bunch of troops into a,

1002
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,460
an area that is less surgical.

1003
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,910
So like what the fuck is war man?

1004
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,690
Yeah.

1005
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,520
That's eventually come down to this that,

1006
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:01,880
you know,

1007
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,950
wore socks and you know,

1008
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,100
we're going to have that debate.

1009
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,180
I will agree with you.

1010
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,650
It's terrible when you can avoid it,

1011
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:07,484
you can,

1012
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,580
but if you're of the view that sometimes
it is necessary to prevent even larger

1013
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,350
atrocities and you know,

1014
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,820
sometimes you need to do it to stop it,

1015
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:17,654
I think,

1016
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,660
which is the view that I have.

1017
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,733
I think that,

1018
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,250
um,

1019
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,083
if you,

1020
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,240
the more surgical your methodology is and
it seems like drone strikes tend to be

1021
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,111
better,

1022
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,700
a better option than the other ones.

1023
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:31,940
I mean,

1024
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,700
there's elements of it that
I know about the debate,

1025
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,560
like the fact that
you're sitting far away,

1026
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,430
it's very sort of inhuman don't contact.

1027
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:41,650
You're very detached because,

1028
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:41,801
you know,

1029
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:42,300
you just,

1030
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,470
it's like a remote control on.

1031
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,250
They're firing off a missile.

1032
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,530
Like that part of it sucks.

1033
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,160
Uh,

1034
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,440
but there's a lot of
things about it that suck,

1035
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,240
but I just don't know,

1036
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,260
you know,

1037
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,260
how else I don't know what other options
there are to handle the situation and

1038
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,540
it is affecting them.

1039
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:01,841
Like,

1040
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,930
it's not like the Taliban seemed to be
more upset about the drone strikes and

1041
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:05,764
anybody else,

1042
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,520
you know,

1043
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,730
that means that it is kind
of hitting them and they,

1044
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:13,090
they do know that the world has a lot
of sympathy for civilian casualties.

1045
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:15,010
They know that at that itself.

1046
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,230
Just the fact that you know,

1047
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:17,800
they,

1048
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,800
they know that they can use these
civilian casualties to their benefit that

1049
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,210
automatically shows you that there is a,

1050
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,760
there's an ethical difference
between both sides.

1051
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,623
So it's not.

1052
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:30,901
Well,

1053
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:34,200
you're saying that meaning
that they do it on purpose,

1054
00:30:34,201 --> 00:30:39,201
that they have areas set up in high
civilian population areas knowing that

1055
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,350
they'll get hit in those areas and it
will cause civilian deaths so that those

1056
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:45,800
civilian deaths will be used to
sort of promote their columns.

1057
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:46,190
Yeah.

1058
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,441
Yeah.

1059
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:46,590
They,

1060
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,720
I mean they absolutely do that.

1061
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:47,931
I mean,

1062
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:48,741
think about it again,

1063
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:52,010
you were talking about getting in the
mind of a conspiracy theorist and think

1064
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:57,011
about if you were one of those people
and you knew that a lot of people don't

1065
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,100
agree with you.

1066
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,821
Everybody thinks that,

1067
00:30:58,821 --> 00:30:59,001
you know,

1068
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:00,680
you're back in the stone ages and so on,

1069
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:03,890
but the one time you get a lot of sympathy
is when there are a lot of innocence

1070
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:04,281
killed.

1071
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:05,270
And then you know,

1072
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:05,601
everyone,

1073
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,950
all of these powerful political
figures and journalists,

1074
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,670
everything around the
world suddenly start,

1075
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,560
um,

1076
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,200
you know,

1077
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,090
sort of coming to your
site against your enemy.

1078
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,720
Then why wouldn't you exploit
that when you have nothing.

1079
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,040
You have like shitty weapons,

1080
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:19,191
you know,

1081
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:20,450
you're living in the middle of nowhere.

1082
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,430
And if that's the only power you have,

1083
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,800
that's one of your strongest weapons,

1084
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,000
you know,

1085
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,480
you'd exploited everybody would,

1086
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,710
I can certainly see that.

1087
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:32,890
But I can also certainly see the
argument that one of the best recruiting

1088
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,891
methods for the Taliban or Al Qaeda is
having your family blown up by a drone.

1089
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,430
You know,

1090
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,720
and that has happened to it.

1091
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,341
And it works.

1092
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,121
And that's what I'm saying.

1093
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:45,340
This is really complicated.

1094
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:45,850
It's,

1095
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,683
it's,

1096
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,670
are we in a state of perpetual war?

1097
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,323
Um,

1098
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,091
I don't know.

1099
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:52,924
That's a,

1100
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,970
I'm not qualified to answer.

1101
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,520
What's this a weird war in that sense,

1102
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,420
because all the wars throughout history
seemed to have been about someone trying

1103
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,290
to take over something,

1104
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,740
whereas this one seems to be at least a
big part of the root of it seems to be

1105
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,640
religious ideology.

1106
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,790
It is,

1107
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:13,910
yeah.

1108
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,230
It takes you back to that.

1109
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,060
The Samuel Huntington paper,

1110
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,470
the clash of civilizations.

1111
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,240
What does that paper it's um,

1112
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,610
he predicted it.

1113
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,180
He was this a political scientist,

1114
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,381
I think in the nineties.

1115
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:27,590
He wrote this paper and later expanded
into a book and it's called the clash of

1116
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:28,191
civilizations.

1117
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:31,960
It was like a sort of a prophecy
about the future and um,

1118
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,130
what kind of conflicts
people going to get into.

1119
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:36,170
And he said that it
wouldn't be ideological.

1120
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:40,760
This is about post Cold War and
inside it won't be an ideological,

1121
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,920
it'll be cultural and uh,

1122
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,110
it'll be between like religious groups.

1123
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:50,111
And he actually talked about the Islamic
world and about seven or eight other

1124
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,650
civilizations and how they're going
to get into cultural conflict.

1125
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,863
And,

1126
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,980
and he was conservative and a lot
of people criticized that and yeah,

1127
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,430
that time I thought it was kind of,

1128
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,090
you know,

1129
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,070
it wasn't completely
completely in line with it,

1130
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:05,220
but now more,

1131
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:05,380
you know,

1132
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,530
as time goes on,

1133
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,390
every once in a while go back to no to
revisit the paper and it seems to make

1134
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:11,901
more sense.

1135
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,351
Almost like,

1136
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:12,561
you know,

1137
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:14,540
he kind of knew what he was talking about.

1138
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,460
Have you ever tried to look objectively,

1139
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:21,480
like if you were the engineer of modern
society or modern civilization and he

1140
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:22,680
tried to look objectively,

1141
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:27,681
like sit on it in a high chair with
a desk above the earth and garden,

1142
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:29,220
how do I fix this mess?

1143
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,580
How do I stop all these silly monkeys
from blowing each other up and shooting

1144
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:39,681
rockets from robots that fly above their
cities and blowing up bombs and their

1145
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:40,500
buildings?

1146
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,580
How do you stop that?

1147
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,840
Have you ever.

1148
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,390
Have you ever tried to
see like is there a way,

1149
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,130
like a longterm short term,

1150
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:50,340
any term way to sort
of engineer this away?

1151
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,780
I think the longterm.

1152
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,740
I think we discount the role of a ideology
and belief when it comes to this and

1153
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,410
I don't know how to solve it,

1154
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,030
but I know one way to move closer to
solving it and that's just being honest

1155
00:34:06,031 --> 00:34:07,050
about what the problem is.

1156
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:07,890
You know,

1157
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,910
a lot of the problem,

1158
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,744
like for example,

1159
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,800
the Islamic state,

1160
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,260
you know,

1161
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,540
they're yelling,

1162
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,670
Allahu akbar into the quoting
the Koran and everything.

1163
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,650
I this is it weak,

1164
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,430
but you know,

1165
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,941
cartoons,

1166
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:20,460
people making cartoons and
then getting shot up for it.

1167
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,211
Like,

1168
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:21,391
you know,

1169
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:22,500
these are all things that,

1170
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,330
you know,

1171
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:23,481
there,

1172
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,250
there is an identifiable issue.

1173
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,240
There's a root cause here that
everybody seems to deny it.

1174
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,040
Like including all the prime ministers
like this has nothing to do with

1175
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:32,874
religion,

1176
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,050
but just,

1177
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,640
you know,

1178
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,750
like I grew up in a Libya,

1179
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,770
Saudi Arabia,

1180
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,521
Pakistan.

1181
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,440
I didn't come to North
America until I was 24.

1182
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,010
I grew up in pretty much Muslim majority
countries and some very conservative

1183
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,240
ones all the time.

1184
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,583
And,

1185
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,010
you know,

1186
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:47,850
I just,

1187
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:51,030
whenever I hear people say that this
has nothing to do with religion,

1188
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,250
it just doesn't make any sense to me.

1189
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,810
Is that like an American
liberal convenient thing
to say because it makes you

1190
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:01,020
look super sensitive and
very noam Chomsky ask.

1191
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,521
Yeah,

1192
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,001
it does.

1193
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,470
And then,

1194
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,940
you know,

1195
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,630
there's a,

1196
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,463
a,

1197
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,490
I don't know what goes into it.

1198
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,280
I know that there's a lot of fear and
going to people don't want to criticize

1199
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:10,461
this.

1200
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,000
Um,

1201
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,241
you know,

1202
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:12,720
we saw what happened with someone rusty,

1203
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,340
you know,

1204
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,990
all the way up to the Paris attacks.

1205
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,010
So there is a fear of that and there's
also a fear of being seen as a bigot.

1206
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,433
That was,

1207
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,400
I call it Islamophobia Phobia.

1208
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,770
People like the word and you know,

1209
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,780
I'm a phobia phobia.

1210
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,614
I love it.

1211
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,860
It's something that a lot of
people relate to immediately.

1212
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:32,331
Turn it,

1213
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,164
here it is.

1214
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,470
I hate that term.

1215
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,410
Islamophobia.

1216
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,253
And look,

1217
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,650
what about Christian have phobia.

1218
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,130
What's

1219
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,640
hilarious to me is that a lot
of quote unquote progressive,

1220
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:46,641
very left wing people will openly mock
Christianity while defending Islam or by

1221
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,090
labeling people Islamophobic
who are conservative.

1222
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:51,401
Yeah,

1223
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:51,511
that,

1224
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,380
I mean you gotta you
gotta stay consistent.

1225
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,670
If you're a true liberal,

1226
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:56,410
and I know everybody's saying this,

1227
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,280
well unfortunately not
everybody's saying it,

1228
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,500
I wish more people were saying it,

1229
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,200
but you know,

1230
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,033
if you are,

1231
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,580
for instance opposed
to killing gay people,

1232
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,920
you should be opposed
to killing gay people,

1233
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:10,921
whether it's in the KKK manifesto or the
Bible or the Koran or in the Republican

1234
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:12,650
Party,

1235
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,060
you know,

1236
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,900
or in Uganda,

1237
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,090
it doesn't matter what it is,

1238
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,670
if you're opposed to something you
should be opposed to it across the board.

1239
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,520
It doesn't suddenly
become respectful that,

1240
00:36:21,521 --> 00:36:21,761
okay,

1241
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:22,120
now,

1242
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,841
well it's in the Bible.

1243
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:23,770
So we got to respect that.

1244
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,050
And respect for ideas is
just such an overrated.

1245
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,600
It's considered a virtue in respecting
people's ideas and beliefs and ideas are

1246
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:35,434
not people.

1247
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:35,710
You know,

1248
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,060
that kids and I was trying to,

1249
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,070
that's the problem with
the word Islamophobia,

1250
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,520
is that it implies criticism of an
idea and there is genuine anti Muslim

1251
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:45,580
bigotry.

1252
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,890
People do commit hate
crimes against Muslims,

1253
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,293
but um,

1254
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,710
Muslims are people.

1255
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,030
They are not,

1256
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,650
I mean they're entitled to respect.

1257
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:54,484
They have rights.

1258
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,110
Islam itself is not a person,

1259
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:56,770
it's just a,

1260
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,551
it's a book,

1261
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,540
it's an ideology,

1262
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,960
it's an ideology is a bunch of ideas
in a book so it doesn't have rights and

1263
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,190
it's not entitled to respect.

1264
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,031
So,

1265
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:04,630
um,

1266
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,830
so the idea of Islamophobia is a
phobia of ideas that are irrational and

1267
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:09,510
ancient.

1268
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,761
Yeah.

1269
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,170
That seems to be pretty smart,

1270
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,050
but it's connected somehow
or another to racism.

1271
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:16,990
And this is where it gets weird because
progressive people don't want to

1272
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,970
criticize anybody with extra melanin.

1273
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,450
Yeah.

1274
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,470
Anybody that's remotely browner
than them gets immediate free pass.

1275
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,340
But see,

1276
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,840
like the Boston bombers.

1277
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:26,120
Right?

1278
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,210
And there were from Dagestan?

1279
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:28,690
Yeah.

1280
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,370
They're from where they're from.

1281
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,263
Caucasian.

1282
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,200
Is that how you pronounce it?

1283
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:32,560
Cocky,

1284
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,030
but he doesn't do this or he's wrong.

1285
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,950
He knows what beyonce is.

1286
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,280
Wait is her ring sizes and shoe size.

1287
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:40,390
He knows when she was born.

1288
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,040
He knows who choose to date.

1289
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,180
We need to talk later.

1290
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,403
That's great.

1291
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,723
Actually,

1292
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:52,950
Boston bombers are actually from a place
where the word Caucasian comes from the

1293
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,150
caucus mountains.

1294
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,463
So there from there.

1295
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,520
So you know,

1296
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,360
they were white that the
underwear bomber was black.

1297
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,720
The Jose Padilla was a Hispanic,

1298
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,710
you know this,

1299
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,850
so it's not a race.

1300
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:07,990
All of these people were Muslim.

1301
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,240
And the thing is,

1302
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:10,561
if you're,

1303
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:13,600
if you're saying that criticizing
Islam is somehow racist,

1304
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,360
you're assuming that
all of Islam is a race.

1305
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,690
What does that make you write that itself?

1306
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:19,870
I mean,

1307
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,090
that's,

1308
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,680
that's,

1309
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,970
that's exactly what racism is.

1310
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,340
When you assume that everything
that entire religion is one race.

1311
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:24,680
Yes.

1312
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,790
We're completely ignorant.

1313
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,480
Yeah.

1314
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,980
So there's some white,

1315
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,600
blue eyed Muslims,

1316
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,360
you know,

1317
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,701
so yeah,

1318
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:31,230
there's lots of,

1319
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,300
if you look at Mecca,

1320
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,680
you see like the people that are in Mecca,

1321
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,000
you'll see redheaded people,

1322
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:40,030
red haired people that are walking
around with the traditional garb on,

1323
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:40,864
circling back.

1324
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,481
Yeah.

1325
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:43,400
And then there's a Turkey.

1326
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,350
So Turkey is a big Muslim country.

1327
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:45,711
Egypt,

1328
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:46,610
a big Muslim country.

1329
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,430
Indonesia is Iran where
everybody's Persian.

1330
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,170
That there's the Arab world in the south.

1331
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:51,681
Asians.

1332
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,800
I mean there's just
racially incredibly diverse.

1333
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,220
Yeah.

1334
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:55,830
So,

1335
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,663
um,

1336
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,110
they,

1337
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,390
you know,

1338
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,660
it's not really a race.

1339
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,503
And I was,

1340
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,890
I think I saw something with,

1341
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:04,820
is this woman wearing a niqab and someone
wrote a funny comment about it in the

1342
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,040
cup,

1343
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,380
the face veil and the,

1344
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:06,650
you know,

1345
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,690
full cover the Brca.

1346
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,003
And uh,

1347
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,091
someone was like,

1348
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:11,241
you know,

1349
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:13,850
that's what you're doing is
racist or making fun of this.

1350
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,290
And I'm like,

1351
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:14,571
wow,

1352
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,070
can you tell me what fucking Reishi is?

1353
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,550
Yeah.

1354
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,383
You see,

1355
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,420
how is that racist?

1356
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:19,470
That's mind blowing.

1357
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,240
You don't even know if
it's a man or a woman.

1358
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,350
This can't see these are knee jerk
liberal ideas that are promoted in

1359
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:26,140
universities,

1360
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,780
the hyper sensitive,

1361
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:32,460
hyper progressive atmosphere
that it literally eliminates
objective thinking and

1362
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:33,060
reasoning.

1363
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,290
Yeah.

1364
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:33,860
Because you,

1365
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,310
you are already automatically expected
to behave in a certain way of thinking a

1366
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:41,130
certain way because that is
the progressive manifesto.

1367
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:41,491
Like your,

1368
00:39:41,491 --> 00:39:45,120
your ideas like you're not supposed
to criticize Islamic people.

1369
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,950
It is Islamophobia.

1370
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,580
The idea that we supposed to be in their
land and that is this Islamophobia and

1371
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:55,570
that word is just so fucking thrown
about over the last decade or so.

1372
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,503
It's toxic.

1373
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:00,750
And I was trying to give the example of
myself is that if I went back to Saudi

1374
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,520
Arabia or any of the
countries where I grew up,

1375
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,830
and if they do the stuff that I write,

1376
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,590
then,

1377
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,300
um,

1378
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,660
I have reason to be Islamophobic
because by their Islamic laws,

1379
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,050
you know,

1380
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:10,470
like,

1381
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,440
it's just not something I like
thinking about what could happen to me.

1382
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,461
Well,

1383
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:15,510
you're an apostate,

1384
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,630
an apostate.

1385
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,060
You should be beheaded,

1386
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:18,601
right?

1387
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:19,351
Isn't that the idea?

1388
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,020
Technically I should be the fuck man.

1389
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,480
You should be phobic of those ideas.

1390
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,040
I know.

1391
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,950
It's a legitimate

1392
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,650
fear and it's,

1393
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,600
it's not irrational by any means.

1394
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,890
Phobia means a fear,

1395
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:32,280
right?

1396
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,640
Does it,

1397
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,530
does it mean irrational?

1398
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,000
Just international?

1399
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,410
I think the medical definition
is an irrational fear,

1400
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,510
like irrational fear.

1401
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,430
I think any fear of being beheaded,

1402
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,070
you mean not yet super rational.

1403
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,910
Exactly.

1404
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,160
So that's why that makes
it even more of a misnomer.

1405
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,510
If somebody writes down,

1406
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,600
I want to cut your fucking
head off and you don't,

1407
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,790
you're a phobic of that person.

1408
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:54,350
Like what?

1409
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,080
Well,

1410
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,530
of course I went to cut my
head off because of a belief.

1411
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,203
So you know,

1412
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:03,690
there's that aspect and then there's
also the anti Muslim bigotry which is a

1413
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:05,160
separate thing which is real.

1414
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,381
Yeah.

1415
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,170
And it's based on
people's targeting people.

1416
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:07,871
And you know,

1417
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:08,120
I,

1418
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,380
I have been on the receiving
end of that as well.

1419
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,430
I mean that has happened.

1420
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,030
I mean people have told me after the
Charlie Hebdo toxic and people said,

1421
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:15,181
you know,

1422
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,510
you guys scummy should get outta
here wherever you heard this.

1423
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:20,110
This is like on twitter
or facebook messages.

1424
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,000
Like I'll get emails,

1425
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:22,470
real people or eggs.

1426
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,480
It sounded pretty real.

1427
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,171
You know what I'm saying?

1428
00:41:25,171 --> 00:41:28,410
Like was it like a person where you
knew you could track their account?

1429
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:29,244
You could read their.

1430
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,690
Yeah,

1431
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,430
I knew them.

1432
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,090
Like I know I know who these people are.

1433
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,221
Oh,

1434
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,054
you know them.

1435
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,160
Many of them are real

1436
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,610
life.

1437
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:34,851
No,

1438
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,684
not in person.

1439
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,200
No,

1440
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,430
not in person over here.

1441
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,990
Fortunately like I
haven't really had that.

1442
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,930
The only sort of personal
thing I've had is,

1443
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,260
you know,

1444
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,940
the Tsa at the airport,

1445
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,420
you know,

1446
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,290
the random checks.

1447
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,930
Like I always get selected for the
random check and things like that.

1448
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:48,764
Look at you.

1449
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,790
There you go.

1450
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,320
So that happens and then,

1451
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:52,030
uh,

1452
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,370
you know,

1453
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,660
my passport has,

1454
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,990
you know,

1455
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,210
by like the,

1456
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,530
my record of living in all these different
Middle Eastern countries and the name

1457
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:01,364
and the skin color,

1458
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,690
so that does

1459
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,330
put me in the same category.

1460
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:08,270
So I share that experience with a lot of
people who do look like me and have the

1461
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:09,410
same name that I do.

1462
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,040
But the problem with the word Islam phobia
is that I think it's an injustice and

1463
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:20,390
it's actually an insult to the struggles
of Muslims who have genuinely been

1464
00:42:20,391 --> 00:42:25,391
victim of anti Muslim bigotry to use
their pain and their experience and

1465
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,660
exploited to stifle criticism of Islam.

1466
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,090
Hm.

1467
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,391
Yeah,

1468
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:31,941
that's I,

1469
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,580
I would say that that makes sense.

1470
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:33,970
You know,

1471
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,970
sort of the same way anyone who
disagrees with feminist ideology is

1472
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:42,130
automatically some sort of a,

1473
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
a woman hater misogynists to someone
who's just a big hit in some way against

1474
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:49,180
the female gender.

1475
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,830
That's just how it is,

1476
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:51,161
man.

1477
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:56,161
People love to silence ideas with a
real simple categorization of you.

1478
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:58,221
You know,

1479
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,770
you are a racist,

1480
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,600
you are a warmonger.

1481
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,740
You are a,

1482
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,330
you know,

1483
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,640
I saw someone who wrote that
about Christopher Hitchens,

1484
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:10,090
that he was a sexist and
a warmonger and I'm like,

1485
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,780
okay.

1486
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,270
Did you read any of what he wrote?

1487
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,040
Did you listen to any of what he said?

1488
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:15,903
Like that's,

1489
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,480
that's kind of hilarious.

1490
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:20,200
Like categorize someone and
dismissed them so openly.

1491
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:20,701
Yeah,

1492
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,460
with the labels and I think
a lot of times you know,

1493
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,650
you don't even have
definitions for these terms.

1494
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,130
When you say Islamophobias,

1495
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,710
if you ask someone in a Muslim
liberal Muslim in Boston,

1496
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,540
you know what Islam is,

1497
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:37,890
they'll give you a very
different definition than
someone who's an isis or the

1498
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:41,460
Taliban and we don't claim to be Muslim
so they have different definitions of

1499
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:41,581
it.

1500
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:43,200
I think feminism is the same way.

1501
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,230
You can talk to 10 different
feminists in 10 different definitions.

1502
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,280
This is a real problem
with groups in that sense.

1503
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:51,870
Ideological groups in that sense,

1504
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,390
whether it's men's rights advocates are.

1505
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,690
I mean men's rights advocates are some
of the most fucking hilarious people

1506
00:43:57,691 --> 00:44:02,691
online to read their websites and their
discussion groups and just a bunch of

1507
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:04,014
angry.

1508
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,310
Weird.

1509
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,320
That's a recent discovery.

1510
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,740
I actually didn't know about these
guys until like a couple of years ago.

1511
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,480
I didn't know about them until
I was accused of being one.

1512
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,930
Somebody called me an Mra and I.

1513
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,170
What the fuck is that?

1514
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,450
Some some angry woman was barking at
me on twitter calling me an MRA for.

1515
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,590
I forget what it was about.

1516
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,690
So I went and looked at it and I was like,

1517
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,850
Oh fucking Christ.

1518
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,410
I've found the community this.

1519
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,280
I tapped into this vein
of men to fucking get over

1520
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,860
it.

1521
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,020
Yeah,

1522
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,421
I know.

1523
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,530
I just.

1524
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:38,190
And it's what really sucks
sometimes is that you know,

1525
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:38,370
when,

1526
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:43,370
when you have a certain agenda
associated with just a really radical,

1527
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,544
insane group,

1528
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,000
then even if they have legitimate
viewpoints about something,

1529
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:51,360
if they have like supposedly they
have like one or two points that are

1530
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,194
legitimate,

1531
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,010
you know,

1532
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,620
I guess if you're talking
about the men's rights,

1533
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,430
custody,

1534
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,930
child custody and things like that one,

1535
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,680
those are the two that
would make sense to you.

1536
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:00,840
So that's where it ends.

1537
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,130
Yeah.

1538
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,270
That's like a rational
conversation you can have.

1539
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,480
The problem is anytime you start
talking about those issues,

1540
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,270
you'll automatically get
labeled as part of that.

1541
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,150
Yeah,

1542
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,550
so there's this sort of smearing all
painting you with the same brush as

1543
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:15,170
everybody else,

1544
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,290
but one of the most hilarious things
that I read was that a men's rights

1545
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,470
advocates are unnecessary because feminism
addresses equality and once women are

1546
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,760
treated as completely equal,

1547
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:30,130
then and only then should we
address men's rights and I'm like,

1548
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,130
that's hilarious.

1549
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,110
Like that is just some weird angry girl
who no one wants to touch and she just

1550
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:40,650
has a lot of bitterness and this
is what they're spouting out.

1551
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,551
I've always.

1552
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:42,120
Actually,

1553
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,120
I was talking to a friend about this
yesterday that I think when when you have

1554
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,090
movements and you have
like organized movements,

1555
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,690
it's something that you want to achieve.

1556
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,800
Being in opposition to something just
makes a lot more sense and it's more

1557
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:59,850
unifying than standing for something
and explained that it was like,

1558
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,030
look,

1559
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:00,181
you know,

1560
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:01,014
if you have,

1561
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,190
if you have a say the feminist movement,

1562
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,461
right?

1563
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:05,850
When,

1564
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:06,683
when you had,

1565
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,180
when feminism meant equality,

1566
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,391
you know,

1567
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:09,821
economic,

1568
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:10,081
social,

1569
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,670
political equality for men and women.

1570
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,540
Then you know,

1571
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,380
we're all feminists,

1572
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:13,741
you know,

1573
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:13,950
we,

1574
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,641
we all had that.

1575
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:17,660
We oppose gender inequality
where we're humanists.

1576
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,410
I mean said feminist.

1577
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:23,520
It's just identifying very specifically
with one gender and that's the issue.

1578
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:23,680
No,

1579
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,900
but I'm saying supposing just
supposing feminism was defined this,

1580
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,080
that as something that's in,

1581
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,950
it's a movement that's an or an
ideology that's in opposition to gender

1582
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,480
inequality or patriarchy
or whatever it is,

1583
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:34,050
right?

1584
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:34,351
Then,

1585
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:35,010
um,

1586
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,120
it unifies everybody.

1587
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,790
But the moment it starts
standing for something like,

1588
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:39,031
okay,

1589
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:41,820
you're not a feminist if you're not
pro choice or you're not a feminist,

1590
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:45,990
if you believe that males and
females are not exactly the same or

1591
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,071
psychologically,

1592
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:50,610
or if you don't subscribe
to this sort of gender,

1593
00:46:50,611 --> 00:46:53,400
sociology theory or whatever it is,

1594
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,550
the moment you start excluding people
based on that and you start talking about

1595
00:46:56,551 --> 00:47:00,360
what feminism stands for rather
than what it stands against,

1596
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,190
then you start getting fragmentation.

1597
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,070
And I kind of feel the same way with
the religion and a lot of atheist.

1598
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:06,360
I,

1599
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,540
I liked the anti theist
position that when you're,

1600
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,710
when you're opposed to,

1601
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:11,910
you know,

1602
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,240
the idea of religion and faith and
believing things without evidence,

1603
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,130
you know,

1604
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,920
doing things for no other reason apart
from the fact that it was written in a

1605
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,990
book 2000 years ago.

1606
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,210
If you're a post to that,

1607
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,630
you have a lot of people who
will be part of your movement.

1608
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:28,740
But the moment you start saying,

1609
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:28,900
well,

1610
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,340
atheism stands for being,

1611
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,000
uh,

1612
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,410
having this political stance on something
where it means that you have to like

1613
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:38,170
what you have to agree with
what Glenn Greenwald says,

1614
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,220
being a social justice and then you
start excuse excluding people so well.

1615
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:43,300
Then you get into atheism.

1616
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:43,780
Plus,

1617
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,300
you know,

1618
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,580
when atheism pluses,

1619
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,700
I,

1620
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,510
I do like I had someone
explained it to me briefly,

1621
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,730
but I never really followed up on it.

1622
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,900
It's a hilarious group of social retards
that have decided to make a religion

1623
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:56,711
out of atheism.

1624
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:01,711
And so they've connected atheism with a
system or a group of social values and

1625
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:04,840
ethics and attached this idea.

1626
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,320
It was just a lack of
belief in a deity to,

1627
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,310
on top of that,

1628
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:14,320
all these things that anyone with any
ethics are ordinarily automatically

1629
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:15,154
believes in,

1630
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,120
like a lack,

1631
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,340
like sexual discrimination,

1632
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,270
gender discrimination,

1633
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,110
racial discrimination,

1634
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:24,070
all those things that like moral
ethical people already disagree with.

1635
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,580
They've attached that to atheism
and called it atheism plus.

1636
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah.

1637
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,391
So,

1638
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:28,550
uh,

1639
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:29,383
you know,

1640
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,210
against all those other things,

1641
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,460
but now now it becomes a group,

1642
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,450
like an ideology.

1643
00:48:34,451 --> 00:48:39,160
It's essentially in a way like a
religion because to ascribe to atheism.

1644
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:41,680
Plus you have to be someone who,

1645
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,543
you know,

1646
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,000
these people that go to these conferences
and like you'll listen to speeches,

1647
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,010
he's fucking droning,

1648
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,170
boring speech.

1649
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,720
They should call atheism plus Dha
because anyone who's intelligent already

1650
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:55,961
thinks,

1651
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:56,200
yeah,

1652
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,070
they're your course.

1653
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:58,330
If you're a balanced person,

1654
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,640
you shouldn't believe in
racial discrimination.

1655
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,860
Of course you wouldn't
support sexual discrimination.

1656
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,360
Of course you wouldn't support,

1657
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,470
you know,

1658
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,340
fill in the blank,

1659
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:06,641
you know,

1660
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,680
of course you would be pro women's rights.

1661
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:09,910
Of course you'd be pro,

1662
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,871
you know,

1663
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:15,871
there's a whole group of desires that
they have or I ideological desires that

1664
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,750
they have attached to this idea of,

1665
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:20,893
of atheism.

1666
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,390
It's a hilarious.

1667
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,200
I think that's exactly that,

1668
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:24,491
that,

1669
00:49:24,491 --> 00:49:26,260
that was the point I was
making at the moment.

1670
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:30,460
Atheism starts standing for something
beyond just not believing in a god.

1671
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,280
The moment that happens,

1672
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,150
you start know there's this
fragmentation starts to take place.

1673
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,140
Um,

1674
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,973
and,

1675
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,540
but I,

1676
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,520
I just think that it's better
like the anti theist position,

1677
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,301
just the idea that,

1678
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:44,134
okay,

1679
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,640
it's been many,

1680
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,580
many years and now this
whole religion thing,

1681
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,550
like a respect for religion and all the
stuff that's being done in the name of

1682
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:51,790
it,

1683
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,541
this is kind of enough.

1684
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,470
So all of us are rational.

1685
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,660
People are going to take
a position against this,

1686
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,380
you know,

1687
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,213
find another,

1688
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,680
find something else to guide
your actions apart from these,

1689
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:00,970
you know,

1690
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:04,930
sort of archaic social and legal codes.

1691
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,791
And if we had that position,

1692
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:09,430
you can have people from all kinds of,

1693
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:10,320
uh,

1694
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,990
uh,

1695
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,920
subscribe to all kinds of belief systems
even to come and join your cause.

1696
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,690
But the moment you start saying,

1697
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:16,961
well,

1698
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:17,741
if you're an atheist,

1699
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,270
then you have to stand for this,

1700
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,890
but you have to be pro choice.

1701
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,460
There's a lot of pro life
atheists that are still atheist,

1702
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,433
so you can't.

1703
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,201
Well,

1704
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:28,280
that's why they call it atheism

1705
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,020
plus in their ideas.

1706
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:31,730
But if you listen to them talk,

1707
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,600
it's a lot of these really,

1708
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,560
really weak guys who just go looking for
social brownie points and then trying

1709
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:41,480
to get women to love them by standing
so powerfully and strong in favor of

1710
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:42,081
equality.

1711
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:42,914
It's like there's.

1712
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,160
There's a certain aspect of
feminism that's sort of in,

1713
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:46,820
in,

1714
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,820
in sort of engage themselves with atheism
and they've kind of embedded into it.

1715
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:57,650
And these radical feminist ideas have
also like become a part of atheism.

1716
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:02,651
Plus it's very strange to listen to what
they say and completely intolerant of

1717
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:08,210
other people's ideas and aggressive in
attacking and doxing and going after

1718
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,970
people who disagree or
who they think have,

1719
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,630
you know,

1720
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,630
in some way or another just stood
out against what their ideas are.

1721
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,380
That I have seen a lot and
it's a aggressive recently
thinking that all these

1722
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:23,594
labels,

1723
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:24,480
you know,

1724
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,480
when you see what are some of the
atheists activists that are out there,

1725
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:29,971
especially now,

1726
00:51:29,971 --> 00:51:30,920
there's such a big moment.

1727
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,770
There's a lot of really,

1728
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:34,280
really angry people and um,

1729
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,320
and for good reason in some ways.

1730
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:36,920
No,

1731
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,753
I understand.

1732
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,961
I mean look,

1733
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,280
real religious ideology,

1734
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:44,360
especially radical radical religious
fundamentalism has done horrible damage to

1735
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:47,620
people and there's a lot of people that
grew up in that and there they have an

1736
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,400
extreme backlash against it.

1737
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,670
And so they're angry because of
that and know I'm completely.

1738
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:55,550
I'm not saying that they
shouldn't be totally with that.

1739
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:56,380
I mean if I

1740
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,180
had the life that I on Hirsi Ali did,

1741
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:58,961
you know,

1742
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,090
where I grew up and went,

1743
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:03,190
underwent genital mutilation
and yet all of these things,

1744
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,210
um,

1745
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,043
as a woman.

1746
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:08,830
And I would be angry too
if I was impressed by that.

1747
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,110
I mean,

1748
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:09,300
I,

1749
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,290
I have a roof by the way,

1750
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:11,501
you know,

1751
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:11,620
that,

1752
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,570
but the blogger in Saudi Arabia,

1753
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,260
which one is the,

1754
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,980
the,

1755
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,030
a blogger that they've
jailed and senator even,

1756
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,240
they've been like lashing him.

1757
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,813
Um,

1758
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,150
they lost them 50 times.

1759
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,511
Okay.

1760
00:52:22,511 --> 00:52:23,090
So I'll tell you,

1761
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:23,923
tell me sir.

1762
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:24,860
So he,

1763
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,693
um,

1764
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,340
it's actually someone that I know my
girlfriend's really good friends with his

1765
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,170
wife and his kids and everything,

1766
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:34,300
so we know them personally.

1767
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,553
And uh,

1768
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,470
he started a website
called free Saudi liberals.

1769
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,980
So you wanted to start talking
about liberalism and sort of just,

1770
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:42,191
you know,

1771
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:43,090
different innovative,

1772
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,440
non status quo ideas in Saudi Arabia and
he essentially got a jail sentence for

1773
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:54,190
10 years with a thousand lashes.

1774
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,460
So they would take them
out into the public,

1775
00:52:57,461 --> 00:52:58,690
outside of Moscow after Friday.

1776
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:00,040
Prayers and of folly,

1777
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,013
Moscon Jetta.

1778
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,200
And uh,

1779
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,440
they just take a cane and they lashed
him 50 times every Friday until the 1000

1780
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,550
lashes are complete.

1781
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,650
So they did the first set,

1782
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,630
think about four or five weeks ago.

1783
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,280
And so,

1784
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:15,491
you know,

1785
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:16,720
we all started writing about it.

1786
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,810
All of us really became a huge story.

1787
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,860
There's a lot of pressure and then the
Charlie Hebdo attacks happened and the

1788
00:53:23,861 --> 00:53:28,861
Saudi ambassador was in the free
speech rally in Paris and in a,

1789
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,820
I think that was on a Sunday and
they'd actually last riff on Friday

1790
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:35,470
and he was in free speech rally.

1791
00:53:35,471 --> 00:53:36,241
So a lot of people wrote.

1792
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:36,730
I wrote,

1793
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,600
I wrote a piece for CNN about it.

1794
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,880
I'm know just talking
about the double standard.

1795
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,220
So how many lashes is
this received so far?

1796
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,000
50.

1797
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,370
And it was supposed to
continue every week,

1798
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,271
but uh,

1799
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:49,104
the,

1800
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,440
he had a medical review and the doctors
said that he's not fit to be lasting and

1801
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:53,791
next week,

1802
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:58,320
which is fucking bizarre because basically
they said that his wounds have healed

1803
00:53:58,321 --> 00:53:59,154
enough.

1804
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,730
Yeah.

1805
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,590
Critical new wounds to create new ones.

1806
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:01,801
Yeah.

1807
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:06,801
So fucking close up before we rip them
open again and lashed with what are they

1808
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:08,700
using to beat them with?

1809
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:09,840
They use a cane.

1810
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,860
They use a really sharp bamboo
cane with like edges to it,

1811
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:14,160
like what they used in Singapore.

1812
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,510
What I know about it is,

1813
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:15,781
yeah,

1814
00:54:15,781 --> 00:54:16,890
it's a cane like that,

1815
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:17,490
but it's got.

1816
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,291
Apparently it's a,

1817
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:19,410
it's got a very sharp edge,

1818
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,360
so it does catch a slice.

1819
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,650
You Open 50 times,

1820
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,813
50 times,

1821
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:25,591
so it's,

1822
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:25,771
I mean,

1823
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:26,820
they don't even have to hit you.

1824
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:30,570
They can just like lightly and it
will still cause cuts on your body,

1825
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,370
but they're beating the shit
out of this guy with this.

1826
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,600
I'm just saying there's a,

1827
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,301
there's a,

1828
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:35,280
a distribution.

1829
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:36,750
You have to distribute it between,

1830
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,000
like the knees all the
way up to the upper back.

1831
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,811
Oh my God.

1832
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:41,100
So he's scarred for life.

1833
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:42,840
He scarred and I mean he's,

1834
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:43,674
uh,

1835
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,380
it was uh,

1836
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:44,700
his,

1837
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,320
his wife was just really,

1838
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:47,910
really upset or names and stuff.

1839
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:48,744
And uh,

1840
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,040
after the first lashing,

1841
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:50,280
you know,

1842
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,113
she,

1843
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,860
he was in really bad medical condition.

1844
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:55,020
He wasn't getting any medical
help and she just said,

1845
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:55,351
she's like,

1846
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:55,680
you know,

1847
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,110
I don't think he's going
to survive it and he's,

1848
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,233
you know,

1849
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,091
when you talk to him,

1850
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,980
he's just like a very gentle,

1851
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,910
very nice,

1852
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,360
you know,

1853
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,530
thinking kind of guy,

1854
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,560
just very sort of introspective and
he's like really more of an intellectual

1855
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,311
kind of person,

1856
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,550
but he's not very physically
robust or anything like that.

1857
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,990
So it's,

1858
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,860
what did he write?

1859
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,220
He wrote,

1860
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,800
I'm a man.

1861
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,600
He just wrote sort of like liberal things.

1862
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:25,620
He started talking about how her
religion and politics should be separate.

1863
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,420
Just the basis of secularism.

1864
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,240
There was one post that
I liked that he wrote,

1865
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:30,840
uh,

1866
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,600
that was about,

1867
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,433
um,

1868
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,540
astronomers,

1869
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,291
like there were these,

1870
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:34,910
uh,

1871
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,460
uh,

1872
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,930
some Saudi cleric,

1873
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,820
religious leader with a lot of influence,

1874
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:39,721
you know,

1875
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:42,180
who was essentially saying that,

1876
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:42,550
you know,

1877
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,330
I think he said something like
traveling to planets as haraam or,

1878
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:45,600
you know,

1879
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,660
at the zoo saying
something about astronomy.

1880
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,350
Her Rom.

1881
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:48,750
Yeah.

1882
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,890
Around being sinful.

1883
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,240
So,

1884
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:51,620
and I,

1885
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,710
if I remember this correctly,

1886
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:56,150
and he essentially wrote this really
sarcastic thing about Sherry as

1887
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,040
astronomers.

1888
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,361
He was like,

1889
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:58,194
oh,

1890
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,130
I didn't know these sharia astronomers
existed and we should just forget about

1891
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:05,760
what all the scientists are saying and
what all the tilex scopes do and we

1892
00:56:05,761 --> 00:56:08,910
should just listen to these guys because
they have knowledge nobody else has

1893
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:10,380
from centuries ago.

1894
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,440
So he would write sort of
sarcastic things like that now.

1895
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,310
He never openly challenge religion,

1896
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:16,490
you know,

1897
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,430
being wrong or anything,

1898
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,770
but he was just an
advocate for secularism.

1899
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,120
So,

1900
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,953
um,

1901
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,390
and that,

1902
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:23,360
that's really all he did.

1903
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,203
I mean,

1904
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,060
I,

1905
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,510
you know,

1906
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,920
people tend to think that like,

1907
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,101
well,

1908
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:28,180
what did he really do?

1909
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:28,811
You know,

1910
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:30,070
but I,

1911
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:30,943
I can't,

1912
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,660
uh,

1913
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,740
I can't say it any other way.

1914
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,360
The guy who all he did was,

1915
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,700
he just blogged on this thing
called free Saudi liberals,

1916
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,940
man.

1917
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,230
And so Saudi Arabia is another,

1918
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,310
like I grew up there,

1919
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:42,991
right?

1920
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:43,260
That was,

1921
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,220
that was there for about 12 years.

1922
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,260
So I could talk about that forever.

1923
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,080
But King Abdullah just died,

1924
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,273
right?

1925
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,650
And I always tell people this,

1926
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:56,980
that the month of James
Foley was beheaded in,

1927
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,823
uh,

1928
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,930
August 2014,

1929
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:00,700
that same month a,

1930
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,490
Saudi Arabia beheaded 19 people.

1931
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,620
And it wasn't just for murder,

1932
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:07,270
um,

1933
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:07,960
there were murdered.

1934
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,900
They were beheaded for sorcery,

1935
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,760
for cannabis smuggling,

1936
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:13,623
you know,

1937
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,190
will probably resonate
with you a little bit.

1938
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,360
You know,

1939
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,630
all kinds of crimes that
are not really crime.

1940
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,800
Both of those resonated.

1941
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:21,910
I'm a sorcerer as well.

1942
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,110
I don't like to talk about it,

1943
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:25,060
but I do a lot of witchcraft.

1944
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:25,660
Yeah.

1945
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,560
My spare time,

1946
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,180
she cats fucking sorcery.

1947
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,740
What does that mean?

1948
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,180
How do you get beheaded for sorcery?

1949
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:36,160
What is sorcery?

1950
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,150
Up Black Magic doing spells on people.

1951
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,920
Oh my God.

1952
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:43,300
Yeah.

1953
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,410
Promising people that
you can sort of say hi,

1954
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,241
they can't get pregnant.

1955
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:46,451
It's like,

1956
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:46,661
okay,

1957
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:48,280
I can get you pregnant.

1958
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,900
God Sorcery,

1959
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,740
Huh?

1960
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,320
Your head cut off for
sorcery in Saudi Arabia.

1961
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,220
And that's our allies.

1962
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:54,520
Right?

1963
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,990
Happening as we speak.

1964
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,213
It's still doing it.

1965
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:57,941
And it'd be headed,

1966
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,440
I think 10 people in January.

1967
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,730
Oh my God.

1968
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,583
And these are public.

1969
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,820
These are public beheadings with a sword,

1970
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:04,720
you know the.

1971
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,553
So you could watch.

1972
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:06,490
Yeah.

1973
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,800
So if I go over there,

1974
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,010
I could watch a beheading.

1975
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,431
You know,

1976
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:11,740
what they would do if you flew over
there and you were a foreigner,

1977
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,300
it would be in the middle of a market
place or outside a mosque and they would,

1978
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,900
uh,

1979
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,280
push you up to the front
because you're a foreigner.

1980
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:20,500
They want to show you how they rock it.

1981
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:20,861
Yeah.

1982
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,371
You'll see.

1983
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:25,450
You'll see kids running towards the scene
when the executions about to happen or

1984
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,583
is about to happen.

1985
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:31,390
That the video of rife is online
when he was lashed and it's online.

1986
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,310
It's online,

1987
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,910
there's someone actually
secretly filmed it,

1988
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,480
but no one really sees.

1989
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,720
You can see people running towards,

1990
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:38,170
uh,

1991
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:39,850
where the lashing was about take place.

1992
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:41,650
How clearly do you see
them getting lashed?

1993
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,050
You don't see it very
clearly and you know,

1994
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:44,660
so what happened?

1995
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,440
A Kid?

1996
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:45,600
No,

1997
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:45,701
no,

1998
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:46,200
he's not.

1999
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,440
He's,

2000
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,261
he's clothed.

2001
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:49,420
And then he's got his hands in shackles.

2002
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:50,890
He's guys had raised up.

2003
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:52,660
So they're beating him
through the clothes.

2004
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,890
They're beating them through the clouds
and from a distance you can't really

2005
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,110
appreciate what it's
like because you know,

2006
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,370
the beginning of the cane is really,

2007
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:00,971
really sharp.

2008
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,430
And so you don't know
exactly what happens.

2009
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,090
Um,

2010
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:04,750
it's,

2011
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,170
it's,

2012
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,280
you can't see it very clearly,

2013
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:11,281
but the thing that is most striking
about that video is the people around it,

2014
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:14,400
there's like hundreds of
normal regular Saudi's,

2015
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:15,130
uh,

2016
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,450
that are gathered around there cheering
afterwards and they all yell Allahu

2017
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:23,000
Akbar when the lashes are complete and
there's little kids like little five,

2018
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:23,271
six,

2019
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:27,350
seven year old kids and they're all
excitedly running towards the scene and so

2020
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:28,040
on.

2021
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,560
So these are things
that they see in public.

2022
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,390
I mean that not a lot of
people here know this.

2023
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,250
There's a in Riyadh,

2024
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,470
the place where they do
the public executions,

2025
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,871
you know,

2026
00:59:36,871 --> 00:59:38,840
at least when I was there it
was called Chop Chop Square.

2027
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:42,950
That's what we used to
Wyatt Chop Chop Square.

2028
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:46,750
Was he sort of affectionate term for it?

2029
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:46,910
Yeah,

2030
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,240
there's a,

2031
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,160
there's a market of which there was chop,

2032
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:49,771
Chop Square.

2033
00:59:49,771 --> 00:59:50,160
And.

2034
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,430
But if you criticize
that you're Islamophobic,

2035
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,480
did you know that?

2036
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:53,691
Yeah.

2037
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:54,720
Because then it,

2038
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,663
then they'll say,

2039
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,570
they'll say,

2040
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:56,721
well,

2041
00:59:56,721 --> 00:59:58,190
this has nothing to do with Islam.

2042
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,370
And then you'll show them the verses in
the Koran that actually say that you can

2043
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:04,070
be head people for all kinds
of things and they'll say,

2044
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,221
well,

2045
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:06,320
that's mistranslated misinterpret it.

2046
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,090
And it was at a different time,

2047
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:09,690
a source context.

2048
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,710
Nineteen people in August,

2049
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:15,230
the month of James Foley
was beheaded by Isis,

2050
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,370
the Saudi government,

2051
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,083
or ally,

2052
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,850
the one that Obama just recently
went to pay respects to the king.

2053
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,370
And Fareed Zakaria actually asked him,

2054
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,600
asked Obama about.

2055
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:27,351
He's like,

2056
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:30,830
are you going to mention the
blogger that they have jailed?

2057
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,521
You know,

2058
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:32,420
and then he didn't.

2059
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,111
He's like,

2060
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:33,411
well,

2061
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:33,681
you know,

2062
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:35,720
right now I'm just going to
pay respects to the king,

2063
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:36,711
you know.

2064
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:37,110
But,

2065
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:37,520
uh,

2066
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,780
with human rights abuses,

2067
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:38,900
you know,

2068
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,591
with our allies,

2069
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,270
it's very tough to have that dialogue.

2070
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,740
What kind of fucking allies are that?

2071
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,460
It's like having a friend who has a slave.

2072
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,011
So like,

2073
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:46,841
I really love the dude.

2074
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:48,280
I don't want to talk to
him about his slaves,

2075
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:50,920
but he's got this guy shackled
up in his basement and yeah,

2076
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,390
guys digging holes for him.

2077
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,680
He's a good dude though.

2078
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:54,451
I don't want to talk to him,

2079
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:54,661
bobby,

2080
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:55,151
he's my friend.

2081
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:55,984
We're going to barbecue.

2082
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:56,560
You know,

2083
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,480
what they did was King Abdullah is,

2084
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:59,200
he's a little bit,

2085
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,220
but

2086
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,053
like the pope,

2087
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:00,893
um,

2088
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,960
he's a,

2089
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:06,090
he just says something that's really
common sense to the rest of us.

2090
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:07,223
Like,

2091
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:07,561
yes,

2092
01:01:07,561 --> 01:01:09,120
I think women should be allowed to vote.

2093
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:11,400
Will Start doing that in 2015.

2094
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,050
And everybody praises him.

2095
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,520
Like he said something amazing.

2096
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:14,851
It's like,

2097
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:15,031
you know,

2098
01:01:15,031 --> 01:01:15,864
the pope says,

2099
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,131
okay,

2100
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,480
maybe condoms are okay.

2101
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:23,600
He gets this sort of disproportionate
praise for saying it even though it's a

2102
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:25,770
rational thing that everybody should.

2103
01:01:25,771 --> 01:01:26,520
So they're,

2104
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:26,731
they're,

2105
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:31,610
they're getting praised and lauded for
pretty much a bringing their people know

2106
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,080
forward into the 19th century.

2107
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:35,881
So there was like,

2108
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:36,150
well,

2109
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,130
I'm glad you're not in
the 17th century anymore.

2110
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:39,510
I'm glad you're in the 19th century.

2111
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,960
It's so such a low standard.

2112
01:01:41,961 --> 01:01:43,530
So it's like a really low bar for them.

2113
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,580
And uh,

2114
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,450
and so Abdullah,

2115
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,790
I'm working on this story right now.

2116
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:49,530
Just talk to these two women who,

2117
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:50,160
well,

2118
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,440
I saw the story where King
Abdullah's own daughters.

2119
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,320
So he's got like a shitload of wives
and whole bunch of kids and you know,

2120
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,213
he had this one,

2121
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,430
I think it was a Jordanian wife
and he had four daughters with her.

2122
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,511
It didn't have a son,

2123
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:02,010
so he wasn't happy about that.

2124
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,323
And uh,

2125
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,940
he's had them under house arrest,

2126
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,190
imprisoned for 15 years.

2127
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,600
So why?

2128
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,830
Because they spoke up
about a male guardianship.

2129
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:18,330
There's a law in Saudi Arabia at that
says that women are not allowed to do

2130
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:23,331
anything without permission of a
male guardian like travel work.

2131
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:24,330
Really?

2132
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:24,511
Yeah.

2133
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,400
They can have some things that
can't even do with the permit.

2134
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:26,970
They can.

2135
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,140
They're not allowed to drive.

2136
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:28,951
Yeah,

2137
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:29,430
I've heard that.

2138
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:33,120
So they can't do that even with
permission of a male guardian,

2139
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:34,920
but pretty much anything else,

2140
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:37,740
whether it's a working or
traveling or any of that stuff,

2141
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:42,741
that they can't do it without express
permission of a male guardian.

2142
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,030
So they spoke out about it
because their guardian was there.

2143
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,250
Dad was a king who they barely even knew.

2144
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,713
And uh,

2145
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,460
their mother,

2146
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,180
right.

2147
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,870
She was,

2148
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:55,830
she's also female.

2149
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,770
So it really restricted a lot
of things that they could do.

2150
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,880
So they started talking
about gender discrimination,

2151
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:02,150
you know,

2152
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,983
shoes,

2153
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,211
uh,

2154
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:08,130
the situation of women in Saudi Arabia
and they did an interview in 2013 and

2155
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:09,000
it's online,

2156
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,170
it's a buy with Russia today with Rt.

2157
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,270
Um,

2158
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,710
I think that's what it stands for.

2159
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:14,544
RUssia today.

2160
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,420
So,

2161
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:15,960
and they,

2162
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,290
they were able to get a skype connection
and do this interview and they spoke

2163
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,750
out and after that nobody
really heard from them again.

2164
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,430
They didn't do any other interviews.

2165
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,150
So I actually

2166
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:28,660
got in touch with I.

2167
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:32,550
So here's where my connection happened
is I went to a school called monarchal

2168
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:33,180
riad,

2169
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:38,180
whIch was like an english medium school
for foreigners and saudis as well in

2170
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,163
riyadh.

2171
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:45,350
And she was in the girl's branch and
I knew these two girls who were in the

2172
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:48,420
girl's branch who went to school with her,

2173
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:50,490
who were good friends
with one of the daughters,

2174
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:51,181
the youngest one,

2175
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:52,140
her name is Joe Walker.

2176
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,960
And when I,

2177
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:55,321
you know,

2178
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:57,090
when they found out
about this imprisonment,

2179
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:57,781
they were just shocked.

2180
01:03:57,781 --> 01:03:57,931
I mean,

2181
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:00,660
they went to high school with this
girl and she was king up the daughter,

2182
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:01,711
so,

2183
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:01,930
uh,

2184
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:03,510
I'm actually working
on a piece about that.

2185
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,940
I just didn't whole interview
with them for an hour is the,

2186
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,030
about a week ago and it's just
the whole story's crazy because,

2187
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,660
uh,

2188
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,590
abdullah is being,

2189
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:13,811
you know,

2190
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:16,170
cameron obama,

2191
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,780
everybody's been praising him as a
reformer and all the things that he's done

2192
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:24,390
for women in Saudi Arabia.

2193
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:29,930
And he had his own fouR daughters are
pros have been imprisoned in their being.

2194
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,130
They've been starved,

2195
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:32,790
you know,

2196
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,170
they've had it,

2197
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,660
a lot of their dog died of starvation
because they weren't getting enough food

2198
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:39,480
for all these things that
have been happening in the,

2199
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:39,870
you know,

2200
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,040
the,

2201
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:40,280
the,

2202
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,240
the hypocrisy and the double standards.

2203
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,073
JuSt amazing.

2204
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:43,360
And we,

2205
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:48,360
westminster abbey and in the uk
flew their flags at half mast,

2206
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:49,181
went up,

2207
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:50,014
dilla died.

2208
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,020
This is,

2209
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,840
this is a guy who sanctioned
all those beheadings.

2210
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:54,031
I mean,

2211
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:54,320
they,

2212
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,320
he can stop that shit if he wants to have
the sorcery beheadings and the lashing

2213
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:02,080
of bloggers and the imprisonment
of his own daughters.

2214
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:02,923
He could stop that.

2215
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,410
He could have stopped it and he didn't,

2216
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,440
he just said that,

2217
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:05,870
well,

2218
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,010
will allow women to vote in 2015,

2219
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,143
fuck.

2220
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:13,710
But it's like good job will allow women
to vote on things that we agree with.

2221
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,633
Exactly.

2222
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,590
And you don't really get an
option to vote on a lot of things.

2223
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:17,741
Like,

2224
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:17,980
do you

2225
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,813
want to king?

2226
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,810
No,

2227
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,643
I don't want to king.

2228
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,500
Do you think that people should
have their head cut off or sorcery?

2229
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,580
Uh,

2230
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:26,380
I would say that that's not progressive.

2231
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:26,711
Yeah,

2232
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:27,200
that's his,

2233
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,710
that's his,

2234
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:28,231
his own,

2235
01:05:28,231 --> 01:05:29,080
if that's his call.

2236
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:30,620
So it's a,

2237
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,250
it's a different world out there.

2238
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:34,210
I think it's,

2239
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,044
and uh,

2240
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:36,370
that's why it's hard.

2241
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:36,520
Like,

2242
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,671
you know,

2243
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,390
when you,

2244
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,780
when you're there and
you come here and um,

2245
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:42,200
you know,

2246
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,360
and when you hear like the sort of the
noam chomsky thing or the glenn greenwald

2247
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:47,194
thing that,

2248
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:47,790
you know,

2249
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:52,100
we need to stop all this
llama phobia and yeah,

2250
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,620
when you see the apologist
and he immediately cuts you
off and it affects people

2251
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:01,950
like a rife badawi the blogger and it
affects people like that actually harms

2252
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:02,490
them.

2253
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,000
I mean the,

2254
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,401
the,

2255
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:08,350
the people that we should be
getting behind and supporting
in those parts of the

2256
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:10,420
world are the dissidents
and the reformers.

2257
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:10,751
I mean there,

2258
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:11,011
there,

2259
01:06:11,011 --> 01:06:12,460
and there are a lot of them just,

2260
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:13,000
you can't,

2261
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,710
you don't hear from them
because they can't speak

2262
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,130
well because they're terrified.

2263
01:06:16,131 --> 01:06:21,131
Like the same way people are so terrified
of islam that when this charlie hebdo

2264
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:22,430
thing came out,

2265
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,750
no one,

2266
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,670
no one on the left,

2267
01:06:25,671 --> 01:06:30,430
like actively criticized it or
publish those images or you know,

2268
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:32,300
put it on the front
pages of their magazines.

2269
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:32,561
It was,

2270
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:33,920
it wasn't something that was done.

2271
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:37,580
It wasn't like something where
everyone stood in unity and said,

2272
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:38,930
this is an everyone's terrified.

2273
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,120
They're terrified that
they're going to be next.

2274
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,950
They're going to get their heads cut off,

2275
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:43,790
they're going to get shot.

2276
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,540
This one is going to storm their office
and gunned them down because they also

2277
01:06:47,541 --> 01:06:50,180
published the cartoon and sam
harris made a really good point.

2278
01:06:50,181 --> 01:06:55,181
Like it was the one chance
that journalists had
uniformly to stand up against

2279
01:06:56,571 --> 01:06:59,060
this type of shit and
just everyone publish it.

2280
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,230
every fucking magazine,

2281
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,100
every newspaper,

2282
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,350
everyone across the world
publish those images,

2283
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:04,611
but everybody's like,

2284
01:07:04,611 --> 01:07:05,900
fuck that.

2285
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:07,850
Self preservation took over.

2286
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,040
But did you see that thing on a,

2287
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,370
on sky news?

2288
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,503
There was this,

2289
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,180
there's this woman who was interviewing,

2290
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:15,611
like when they,

2291
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:18,920
when they did the reprint and
they put the cover of know,

2292
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:19,621
put them on that,

2293
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:20,610
on the cover again,

2294
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:20,940
you know,

2295
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:21,773
crying and so on.

2296
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,161
So,

2297
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:23,610
uh,

2298
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,850
she was interviewing somebody about
that and then the woman that she was

2299
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:31,320
interviewing started pulling up the
paper and showing the cartoon and she

2300
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,280
immediately cut away,

2301
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:33,210
say,

2302
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:33,601
I'm sorry,

2303
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:37,110
we can't show that and I'm so sorry
to anybody who was offended and so on.

2304
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,330
Anybody who was offended at a cartoon,

2305
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:40,973
that's amazing.

2306
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:41,401
You know,

2307
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:42,030
this stuff.

2308
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:42,863
Um,

2309
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:43,681
there's a lot of,

2310
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:46,630
other than my mom gets
upset at me some time.

2311
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:46,951
She's like,

2312
01:07:46,951 --> 01:07:47,400
you know,

2313
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,820
can you do the criticism
but don't do the mockery.

2314
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:52,163
and uh,

2315
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,630
as I mean I will.

2316
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,431
It just means that,

2317
01:07:55,431 --> 01:07:55,611
you know,

2318
01:07:55,611 --> 01:07:56,640
when you make fun of it,

2319
01:07:56,641 --> 01:07:59,910
when you draw cartoons and it's insulting
and it's different now I understand

2320
01:07:59,911 --> 01:08:00,744
where she's coming from,

2321
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,390
but I think mockery is super important.

2322
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,650
Like if you think about the
interview or the seth rogen movie,

2323
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:08,360
you know,

2324
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,020
you have all of these,

2325
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:10,650
uh,

2326
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:11,120
sort of,

2327
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:11,900
uh,

2328
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,330
journalists and everybody
writing all these inquisitive,

2329
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,000
you know,

2330
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,810
biting critiques of the north korean
regime and all that does is that,

2331
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:21,210
you know,

2332
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:24,290
because kim jong un wants to be
taken seriously and it gives them,

2333
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:24,471
you know,

2334
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:24,711
he's like,

2335
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:25,070
okay,

2336
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,641
I'm legitimate.

2337
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,440
Everybody's criTicizing me and you know,

2338
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,850
they don't like what I do,

2339
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,110
but when you make a movie with
like dick jokes and you know,

2340
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:34,790
the kind of thing that the interview was,

2341
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,133
um,

2342
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,310
and you make fun of it.

2343
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,930
He goes ape shit

2344
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,520
because I didn't go ape shit over the,

2345
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,930
the team America movie.

2346
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:43,980
They did actually.

2347
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:44,800
Yeah.

2348
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,010
Yeah.

2349
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:45,211
Kim.

2350
01:08:45,211 --> 01:08:48,390
John gale was not happy
about it and I wasn't happy,

2351
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:49,620
but nothing happened.

2352
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,670
It wasn't like,

2353
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,960
it wasn't like what happened here and
I'm not sure exactly why they didn't.

2354
01:08:54,961 --> 01:08:55,501
That was a long,

2355
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:57,600
long time ago and his dad's
a little bit more chill.

2356
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,970
Probably some possible.

2357
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,740
He might be more sensitive.

2358
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:03,060
He's the young one.

2359
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,301
Yeah,

2360
01:09:03,301 --> 01:09:04,134
maybe.

2361
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:04,740
Yeah.

2362
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,520
Maybe feels less legitimate because
he just kinda got it from his dad.

2363
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,530
He's a little insecure I think probably,

2364
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:11,810
but he's got fat.

2365
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,790
Face it.

2366
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,610
Lazy fuck can work up.

2367
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:19,640
Yeah,

2368
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,473
he's a.

2369
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,061
That'S the thing like,

2370
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:22,721
you know when you,

2371
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:25,450
when you have a kInd of mockery cartoon,

2372
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,620
like the dick jokes and the cartoons
piss these people off a lot more because

2373
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,150
they want to be taken seriously.

2374
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,500
like they have these like they can't do
it through ideas because their ideas are

2375
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:37,690
all bullshit right there.

2376
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:37,961
You know,

2377
01:09:37,961 --> 01:09:39,330
women can't drive or you know,

2378
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,220
you should be beheaded if you leave the
religion or change your mind about what

2379
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:43,054
you believe and so on.

2380
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:47,860
Those are the kinds of things that you're
going to get people flocking to you

2381
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:48,260
with,

2382
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:48,640
you know,

2383
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,380
through rational discourse.

2384
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,870
So know you have to use other means.

2385
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,370
Why Is,

2386
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,910
why is that part of the world
so archaic and their beliefs?

2387
01:09:57,911 --> 01:09:59,890
Is it because that's the
cradle of civilization?

2388
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,600
That's the oldest form of symbol,

2389
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,980
what we know today,

2390
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,520
like the oldest civilizations that
were aware of that we can track.

2391
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:08,320
It waS like 6,000 plus years ago,

2392
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,610
which is mesopotamia,

2393
01:10:09,611 --> 01:10:10,150
right?

2394
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:10,983
The middle east,

2395
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,373
Iraq,

2396
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,720
babylon that,

2397
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:14,170
those,

2398
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:15,070
those areas,

2399
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:20,071
that's where we believe civilization sort
of began and those same areas have the

2400
01:10:22,121 --> 01:10:27,121
most archaic form of religion and
social justice that their ideas are so

2401
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,880
barbaric in a way or so old.

2402
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:31,540
There's so.

2403
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,250
I mean the idea that women have to cover
themselves and veils and they have to

2404
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,940
these oppressive ideas.

2405
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,570
It's the exact opposite of
where the world is heading,

2406
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,980
especially because of the internet.

2407
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,920
There's more and more openness.

2408
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,450
The exchange of information.

2409
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:49,990
It's quicker than it's ever been before
and it's really hard to like hold on to

2410
01:10:49,991 --> 01:10:51,820
like a really stupid idea today.

2411
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:52,661
Stupid,

2412
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:53,590
oppressive idea,

2413
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,150
but in that part of the world,

2414
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,630
not so much and it's lIke this momentum,

2415
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,390
the momentum of the past is so strong.

2416
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,380
well,

2417
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:02,630
you know,

2418
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:03,590
one of the reasons for that,

2419
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:08,591
that's where I think our role comes in
a little bit or the role of the west.

2420
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,610
The though the us is,

2421
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:11,444
um,

2422
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:12,771
you know,

2423
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:12,891
the,

2424
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,770
the reason that the saudis are lashing
bride for the reason that they're

2425
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:21,890
beheading people for sorcery has nothing
to do with us foreign policy or western

2426
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,300
imperialism or anything like that,

2427
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,480
but the reason they've
been able to maintain it,

2428
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:33,340
reason they can actually
keep those archaic legal
codes in place and not really

2429
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:37,290
have to do anything about it is because

2430
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,990
they're very rich.

2431
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,483
They have a lot of oil.

2432
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:45,030
They don't really need to
progress to making that money.

2433
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,551
and uh,

2434
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,430
the reason that they have that is because,

2435
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,570
you know,

2436
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,010
we've all prop them up.

2437
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,070
We have supported them and you know,

2438
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:53,310
I mean,

2439
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,080
you saw like,

2440
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,990
do you Remember when,

2441
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:55,620
uh,

2442
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,320
when king abdullah visited Texas,

2443
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:59,730
I think it was in 2005.

2444
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:00,750
And then George Bush was

2445
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,880
holding hands with them.

2446
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:02,170
Yeah.

2447
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,630
They were walking around holding hands.

2448
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,530
He had to kiss each other.

2449
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,730
She got bullied.

2450
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,060
Yeah.

2451
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:09,820
That's that.

2452
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,301
And they,

2453
01:12:10,301 --> 01:12:11,134
uh,

2454
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:11,831
so you had that.

2455
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:14,170
And then in a few years later when obama,

2456
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,500
his first year of his presidency
was a ge 20 summit in london.

2457
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:18,963
And um,

2458
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,540
and then there was a controversy where
everybody thought he bowed to the saudi

2459
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:23,020
king,

2460
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,110
which he sort of did
right when you met him,

2461
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,944
shook his hand and hE,

2462
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:28,513
um,

2463
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,430
so that's kind of,

2464
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:30,641
uh,

2465
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:33,970
that symbolizes where the
us saudi relationship is,

2466
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,190
but they have to do that.

2467
01:12:36,191 --> 01:12:36,761
It's not just,

2468
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:36,881
you know,

2469
01:12:36,881 --> 01:12:38,900
we can blame the leaders for being allies,

2470
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,551
Saudi Arabia,

2471
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:40,720
but you know,

2472
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:41,440
it's,

2473
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,120
it's of the same thing that you see when,

2474
01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:43,270
you know,

2475
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:47,620
people driving ground their
suv filling up with gas.

2476
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:51,100
And I will say that every time
we fill our cars up with gas,

2477
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:52,600
we're all bowing to the saudi king.

2478
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,440
Same thing

2479
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,251
with fracking.

2480
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:57,020
Now it's kind of changed quite a bit.

2481
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:57,300
You know,

2482
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,450
United States produces more gas in anyone.

2483
01:12:59,451 --> 01:12:59,800
No.

2484
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,190
Yeah,

2485
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:00,780
no.

2486
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,020
That should change.

2487
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:03,310
And I think that that's a,

2488
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,780
it is a positive thing.

2489
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:04,991
I mean,

2490
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:07,720
whatever the controversies about
fracking right now and you have to make

2491
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:08,830
everything safer obviously.

2492
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:14,220
But eventually anything that helps us get
off foreign foreign oil because that's

2493
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:15,510
what funds it.

2494
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,920
I mean,

2495
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,700
yeah.

2496
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:16,890
Well,

2497
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:21,890
this is like abu dhabi and dubai
in the areas that were just 50,

2498
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,020
60 years ago,

2499
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:28,470
baron mean there was nothing
there and now they're thriving.

2500
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,470
Huge citieS and the economy is just.

2501
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,030
Just blossomed out of oil.

2502
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:35,910
Yeah,

2503
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:38,700
it's oil and then tourism
and things like that,

2504
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:40,620
but it's not really innovation.

2505
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,640
It's not like they're providing some
sort of service or manufacturing and kind

2506
01:13:44,641 --> 01:13:46,230
of goods or they've got any,

2507
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,950
any even cultural elements that are
going around all over the world.

2508
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:50,400
That is,

2509
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:50,511
well,

2510
01:13:50,511 --> 01:13:51,520
how does it touch?

2511
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,600
How does that change the woRld?

2512
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,440
That's the reason for their success.

2513
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:56,210
you said it yourself,

2514
01:13:56,210 --> 01:14:00,120
see oil change that and you
change things drastically.

2515
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:01,990
They're like they Are the.

2516
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:07,310
The thing that would put an end to all
of them is a if they ran out of oil or if

2517
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:08,990
we didn't need their own.

2518
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,033
Would that though?

2519
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:10,521
I mean,

2520
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:11,900
what would really is there.

2521
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,830
it seems like there's so
much momentum on their side.

2522
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:15,141
I mean the.

2523
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:17,500
The culture has been
so firmly established.

2524
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,130
Their mindset has been
so firmly established.

2525
01:14:20,131 --> 01:14:25,131
This adherence to radical islamic
philosophy and ideology is so firmly

2526
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,053
established.

2527
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,690
How does one ever change that?

2528
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:31,530
You change it when you have to go,

2529
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:32,091
right,

2530
01:14:32,091 --> 01:14:33,920
like when you have to move on with life,

2531
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,480
when you can't maintain that.

2532
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,050
When you do like if the rest of the world
is moving on and you are not able to

2533
01:14:39,051 --> 01:14:42,350
stay in that bubble when you need to
have international trade relationships,

2534
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:42,710
when you,

2535
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:47,030
when you are dependent on a diplomatic
relations with other countries and you

2536
01:14:47,031 --> 01:14:49,040
can't just get away wIth the
shit that you do all the time,

2537
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,010
then that's how countries evolve.

2538
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:52,940
That's how they progress.

2539
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:57,440
They haven't needed to do
that yet because they're fine.

2540
01:14:57,441 --> 01:14:58,161
They're in their bubble,

2541
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,150
they've got a lot of oil money.

2542
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,321
Everyone's happy.

2543
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:01,131
Everyone's well fed.

2544
01:15:01,131 --> 01:15:02,550
I mean if they're obscene,

2545
01:15:02,551 --> 01:15:03,550
lee rich like,

2546
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:03,641
well,

2547
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:04,120
you know,

2548
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:04,953
like trillium.

2549
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,640
Oh they're fucking crazy rich.

2550
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,140
I was there like the
just going into reality.

2551
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,650
You can't as a tourist
you can go under the.

2552
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,613
And this is,

2553
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,390
I'm talking about the mid nineties.

2554
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:14,721
I mean,

2555
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:14,931
you know,

2556
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:15,764
when you see those,

2557
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:19,520
those movies with all the
futuristic cities and stuff,

2558
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:20,563
it was a.

2559
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,010
It really looked like that.

2560
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,450
The architecture of the buildings,

2561
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:24,060
the highways,

2562
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:24,890
and just,

2563
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:25,340
uh,

2564
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,850
it's beautiful to see this.

2565
01:15:26,851 --> 01:15:30,380
It's the people that are walking
around her all wearing burkas and

2566
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:35,200
agent close with the most
sophisticated modern city.

2567
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:36,550
It's such a weird thing.

2568
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:36,870
Knowledge.

2569
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,970
it gets it's contradiction.

2570
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,560
It is really strange.

2571
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,071
It's like,

2572
01:15:41,071 --> 01:15:44,400
and there's one royal family
that's running it as a
whole bunch of brothers and

2573
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:44,930
it's,

2574
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:45,691
it's kind of like,

2575
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:46,460
uh,

2576
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:46,670
and,

2577
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,503
and the,

2578
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:51,210
the people who live there and come stay
there for a little while and go away.

2579
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,660
All the expatriates.

2580
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:53,743
It's a,

2581
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:54,900
it's a,

2582
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,250
it's like they're running a hotel.

2583
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:59,850
It's like a family running a hotel
and it's got all its money and sort of

2584
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,220
american accounts.

2585
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:01,831
Those accounts,

2586
01:16:01,831 --> 01:16:02,041
you know,

2587
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:02,874
wherever.

2588
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,863
And uh,

2589
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,090
people just check in and
check out all the time.

2590
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,120
You get paid according to your passport.

2591
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,300
I met a dude,

2592
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,140
I don't want to say his name,

2593
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:16,000
he's a prince in one of those
places who listens to my podcast.

2594
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,870
We had a long conversation about amazing.

2595
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:22,120
Now you may be good as a young guy,

2596
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:22,730
you know,

2597
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:25,780
it was weird talking to this
young guy who's probably,

2598
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:26,380
you know,

2599
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,730
we didn't discuss his finances,

2600
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,740
but I'm assuming he's insanely wealthy,

2601
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,051
but he just wanted it.

2602
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:33,100
He wanted to sit down with
me and talk about the ufc.

2603
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,300
He's a big fan.

2604
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:34,820
oh yeah.

2605
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:35,200
Absolutely.

2606
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,750
At this weird conversation about,

2607
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,170
you know,

2608
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:42,610
strategies and tactics in fighters and
the trends and where things are moving

2609
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:43,271
and changing.

2610
01:16:43,271 --> 01:16:43,661
But you know,

2611
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:44,494
I'm talking to,

2612
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,300
you know,

2613
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:50,300
a guy who could one day be the head
of one of these gigantic governments.

2614
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,750
[inaudible].

2615
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,290
I mean,

2616
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,550
I guess you'd call it a government.

2617
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,050
It's not really monarchy.

2618
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,940
Would you call it the monarchy to kinda.

2619
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,160
I mean it's a kind of government,

2620
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,010
but it was very strange,

2621
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,260
very strange to have this conversation,

2622
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,320
you know?

2623
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:06,850
Yeah.

2624
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,500
It's a really different world.

2625
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,860
It's like another planet.

2626
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,280
And to be fair,

2627
01:17:11,281 --> 01:17:13,320
his was a less suppressive.

2628
01:17:13,321 --> 01:17:16,380
We're not talking about like Saudi
Arabia beheading people over sorcery.

2629
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,610
It's not that,

2630
01:17:17,611 --> 01:17:18,444
but

2631
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:19,831
you know,

2632
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:21,150
that part of the world is,

2633
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:21,830
it's,

2634
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,680
it is,

2635
01:17:22,681 --> 01:17:23,010
it,

2636
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,810
it's almost impossible,

2637
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,670
I think for a lot of people who are
apologists for that part of the world to

2638
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,100
rationalize it or to
understand that the way you do,

2639
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:32,933
uh,

2640
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,023
it's,

2641
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:34,590
you know what,

2642
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:38,600
it's really unbelievable and
I understand that now when,

2643
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,670
when I was there,

2644
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:44,830
I'm just explaining the way
that things happen there.

2645
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,560
Two people over here,

2646
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,470
it's just so removed and so alien that
people either shut it out of their mind

2647
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,490
or they don't believe it

2648
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,730
because I've seen that a lot.

2649
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,310
And,

2650
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,920
uh,

2651
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,110
you know,

2652
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,220
I'll tell you stories of
what I'm doing in my book as,

2653
01:17:58,221 --> 01:17:58,391
you know,

2654
01:17:58,391 --> 01:17:59,350
when I talk about these things,

2655
01:17:59,351 --> 01:18:04,351
I was trying to bring personal anecdotes
into it before I go into the topic in

2656
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,030
detail because it helps.

2657
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,093
Um,

2658
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,220
it helps people to relate to it.

2659
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,510
So this is something that happened
when I was in fifth grade.

2660
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:14,830
So I went to the american school there,

2661
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,360
which is kind of why I talk like this.

2662
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:18,730
And uh,

2663
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:19,931
when I was in fifth grade,

2664
01:18:19,931 --> 01:18:21,940
we made snowflakes during the winter.

2665
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,033
I got a paper,

2666
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:26,530
fold up a piece of paper and you cut it
and make some things and we decorated

2667
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:30,010
them with glue and glitter
and our names and so on.

2668
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:32,090
And the teacher put them up on the,

2669
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,243
on the door,

2670
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,090
right.

2671
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:35,830
Or the bulletin board and
I can't remember exactly.

2672
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,290
And you know,

2673
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:41,770
you take a lot of pride in that
kind of stuff when you're a kid.

2674
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:46,210
I was like 10 or 11 years old and there
a ministry of education guy who used to

2675
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:49,330
come in and use to check the school
to make sure everything is operating

2676
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:49,940
correctly,

2677
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:50,110
you know,

2678
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,410
like you,

2679
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:51,610
you have to say winter holidays,

2680
01:18:51,611 --> 01:18:53,110
you can speak about christmas.

2681
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,660
You couldn't have read
during valentine's and so on.

2682
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,100
So they,

2683
01:18:57,101 --> 01:18:57,340
uh,

2684
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:01,810
he saw the snowflakes and he started
yelling at the teacher and arabic teacher

2685
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:06,811
didn't even know arabic and in front of
all the kids and he Just took a pair of

2686
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:09,790
scissors and he cut one of the
tips off of each of the snoWflakes.

2687
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:11,290
Yeah.

2688
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:11,591
And,

2689
01:19:11,591 --> 01:19:12,280
uh,

2690
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:12,941
so I remember thinking,

2691
01:19:12,941 --> 01:19:13,181
I was like,

2692
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:13,531
wow,

2693
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:14,590
it worked really hard on that.

2694
01:19:14,591 --> 01:19:15,720
And you know,

2695
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:19,690
he just like amputated one of the tIps
of the snowflakes and then we asked the

2696
01:19:19,691 --> 01:19:22,030
teacher what happened
and we wanted to know.

2697
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,013
And um,

2698
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:24,910
that's when I found out
about the star of david.

2699
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,390
So david has six points,

2700
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:32,530
so anything that has like six
points is a apparently band there.

2701
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,680
So she told us about the star of david.

2702
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,690
She said it's a sign of the jews.

2703
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,670
So this was my introduction to the jews.

2704
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:41,260
I didn't really know anything
about the jews before,

2705
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:42,760
but I just thought it was like,

2706
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:43,121
wow,

2707
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:43,870
these,

2708
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:44,650
you know,

2709
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:45,940
these must be scary people,

2710
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:46,803
whoever they are,

2711
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,070
the guys cutting tips off as catholics
fucking snowflakes criticized.

2712
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,960
So I went back and uh,

2713
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:55,481
you know,

2714
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:57,160
I asked my dad about it.

2715
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,290
My dad was adopted as a professor,

2716
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,270
so it was fairly fairly rational guy.

2717
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,870
And then he told me about the
whole Israel palestinian history,

2718
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,970
explained it to me as well
as I could understand it.

2719
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,100
And then he pulled out a map.

2720
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:08,611
It was one of those,

2721
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:08,760
you know,

2722
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,930
inflatable globes,

2723
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,473
um,

2724
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,030
and you tried to show me Israel on
the map and it wasn't there like,

2725
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:15,301
this is,

2726
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:15,991
this map was,

2727
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:16,824
we bought it in the,

2728
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,450
in a bookstore in riyadh,

2729
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,730
and there's no Israel,

2730
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,601
there was no Israel.

2731
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:22,410
It was like a,

2732
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,920
it wasn't even like they
labeled it something else.

2733
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:26,070
So they made it all palestine.

2734
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,270
Like I remember this distinctly.

2735
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:28,051
There was a border,

2736
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:30,800
they'd drawn the border and the
rest of it was the same color as the

2737
01:20:30,801 --> 01:20:34,860
mediterranean and same
color as the car was as a c,

2738
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,180
so it was just like a little notch.

2739
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,493
Um,

2740
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,180
so it was,

2741
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,760
I remember we bought the
world book encyclopedia,

2742
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:42,811
you know,

2743
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:43,644
around that time,

2744
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:44,370
uh,

2745
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,270
that was a big thing.

2746
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:46,710
Encyclopedias are obsolete now.

2747
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,250
But,

2748
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,570
and they'd taken out the,

2749
01:20:48,571 --> 01:20:49,404
uh,

2750
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,810
the entrIes on Israel and
evolution and everything,

2751
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,440
you know,

2752
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,170
you pay a lot of money for it
and they took it out so they,

2753
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,760
they'll do those things.

2754
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:57,001
Now,

2755
01:20:57,001 --> 01:20:58,110
what I'm saying is,

2756
01:20:58,840 --> 01:20:59,220
uh,

2757
01:20:59,220 --> 01:20:59,570
you know,

2758
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:00,340
the,

2759
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:00,600
the,

2760
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,770
this was my introduction.

2761
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:02,840
This is what I saw in my.

2762
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:03,271
Fortunately,

2763
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:05,580
my father was rational and you know,

2764
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:07,440
he told me the right story,

2765
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:10,170
but there were a lot of other
kids that also went home.

2766
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:11,940
They ask their parents the same questions,

2767
01:21:12,310 --> 01:21:12,660
you know,

2768
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:17,190
what is the star of david or the jews
and I don't know what kind of responses

2769
01:21:17,191 --> 01:21:18,024
they got.

2770
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,290
I don't know what they were told.

2771
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:21,600
So it's,

2772
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,463
uh,

2773
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:23,130
you,

2774
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,870
you live with that in school,

2775
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,990
you live with that as a kid
who's even if you're a foreigner,

2776
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,090
even if you're going
to an american school,

2777
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:30,841
you know,

2778
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:35,670
you have these ideas around you and
the kids who were in the saudi schools,

2779
01:21:35,671 --> 01:21:39,000
which are separate on the way that
foreigners are not allowed to go to saudi

2780
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:39,834
schools.

2781
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:40,950
Um,

2782
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,280
their textbooks are just insane.

2783
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,440
The kind of stuff they have about jews,

2784
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:48,090
about infidels and you know,

2785
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,013
everything.

2786
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,380
They,

2787
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,990
they actually teach this stuff to kids.

2788
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:52,861
You know,

2789
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:57,570
in the uk recently there was a saudi
school that was in the uk and they were

2790
01:21:57,571 --> 01:22:00,550
using some of these textbooks and
there was a big brouhaha about it.

2791
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,980
A brouhaha.

2792
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:02,790
No.

2793
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:03,330
Yeah,

2794
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,470
they love the term.

2795
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,433
Sorry,

2796
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,330
that's,

2797
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:11,720
I was wanting to say that
I ever fucking say brouhaha

2798
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:13,361
credible,

2799
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,520
that they have to cut your snowflake.

2800
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,880
Your snowflake was symbolic
of these evil wizard.

2801
01:22:18,881 --> 01:22:20,980
Jews didn't their sorcery.

2802
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,720
Nobody would have made that connection.

2803
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,060
But that's what I mean.

2804
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:28,740
It's stuff that's so unimaginable and
things that you wouldn't even think of.

2805
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:34,650
I watched a documentary once
on the suicide bombers and uh,

2806
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,110
there was a school that they were running,

2807
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:38,920
um,

2808
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,920
where they had these images in this
children's school of these kids that had

2809
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:49,561
blown themselves up in images of them in
these holy images of them covered with

2810
01:22:49,601 --> 01:22:50,070
their,

2811
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,240
their explosive vests.

2812
01:22:52,241 --> 01:22:53,500
and they were,

2813
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,190
they had a saying on the
wall above them that said,

2814
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,660
the children of today or
tomorrow's holy martyrs.

2815
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,740
And there's just like trying to,

2816
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,280
trying to wrap your mind
around the idea that you are,

2817
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:16,440
you're promoting that you were going to
raise these children to be holy martyrs.

2818
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:21,610
Meaning they are going to blow themselves
up and kill a bunch of bad people with

2819
01:23:21,611 --> 01:23:23,530
them and this is going
to be a great thing.

2820
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,400
And then their images are going to be
displayed at this school and everyone's

2821
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:30,870
going to praise them and it's,

2822
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,530
it's impossible.

2823
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,710
It didn't make any sense.

2824
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,300
It was,

2825
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:34,880
it didn't,

2826
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,900
it didn't fit it.

2827
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,810
I tried to find a place for it in my head.

2828
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,370
I tried to shove it in there somewhere.

2829
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:39,601
I'm like,

2830
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:40,580
this has got to be fake.

2831
01:23:40,581 --> 01:23:41,414
You can't be real.

2832
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:41,611
Yeah.

2833
01:23:41,611 --> 01:23:41,741
It's,

2834
01:23:41,741 --> 01:23:46,741
It's a tough thing that I'm realizing
more and more as I live here with every

2835
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:50,160
passing year that people who have been
raised here so very difficult for them to

2836
01:23:50,161 --> 01:23:53,060
comprehend that mindset
because we grew up like,

2837
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,480
I grew up in a shia muslim family.

2838
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:55,643
So,

2839
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:56,350
um,

2840
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,970
can you explain the difference
for folks who don't know?

2841
01:23:57,971 --> 01:23:58,804
What is the difference?

2842
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,420
There are basically two
different schools of thought.

2843
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:04,110
So after,

2844
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:04,681
after,

2845
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:05,130
uh,

2846
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:06,720
the prophet mohammed died,

2847
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:07,853
um,

2848
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:09,420
you had his,

2849
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,273
uh,

2850
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,581
his best friend,

2851
01:24:11,581 --> 01:24:12,420
his name is albuquerque,

2852
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:13,140
right?

2853
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:13,611
And we're just,

2854
01:24:13,611 --> 01:24:15,600
what the current isis
caliphate is named after.

2855
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:16,591
And uh,

2856
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:21,210
you had his son in law and his
cousin and his name is ali.

2857
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,580
So I name I'm named after,

2858
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:24,690
you know,

2859
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:26,940
I don't know how that ended up like,

2860
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,781
what we're named after,

2861
01:24:27,781 --> 01:24:28,380
but anyway,

2862
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,670
so what happens is he had these two
different lines and there was a,

2863
01:24:32,671 --> 01:24:33,960
there was a conflict about,

2864
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,571
uh,

2865
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:34,930
you know,

2866
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:35,763
people were,

2867
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,460
they couldn't decide who the
successor was going to be.

2868
01:24:38,461 --> 01:24:42,450
Some people kind of flock to the califit
which was elbow bucker and the other

2869
01:24:42,451 --> 01:24:44,640
caliphs and others flocked to the moms,

2870
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,650
which was a alley.

2871
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:47,700
So it was his successor.

2872
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,510
It was just basically you had conflict
about who the successor was going to be

2873
01:24:51,511 --> 01:24:53,550
in different people took different sites.

2874
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,010
That's the long story short.

2875
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:01,130
Well that became Incredibly confusing to
americans when the Iraq war went on and

2876
01:25:02,851 --> 01:25:03,840
we realized that,

2877
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:04,081
oh,

2878
01:25:04,081 --> 01:25:04,321
okay,

2879
01:25:04,321 --> 01:25:08,340
there's a war going on now that we've
killed saddam hussein between the sunni

2880
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,293
and the shia.

2881
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:09,991
It's like,

2882
01:25:09,991 --> 01:25:10,680
what,

2883
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,513
wait a minute.

2884
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,980
The muslims don't like each other.

2885
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,750
Like what kind of crazy shit is this

2886
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,840
that they've been fighting and it's
not just as soon he is and she has as a

2887
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:19,900
whole bunch of other factions.

2888
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:20,940
One of the major ones.

2889
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,720
What are the other ones?

2890
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:21,931
Oh,

2891
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:25,290
there's too many names as I can know
for talking about all the different

2892
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,260
branches off a couple.

2893
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,810
So there's aliens lutheran,

2894
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,451
so yeah,

2895
01:25:30,451 --> 01:25:31,290
there's a sydney's in the,

2896
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:34,920
as their primary within the sheet
as you've got two different groups.

2897
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:35,930
There's the [inaudible],

2898
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:38,550
which is the 12 version
they believe in 12 and moms.

2899
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:43,910
And then there's another group that
split off after the sixth and mom into a

2900
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:44,520
separate,

2901
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,780
sort of like descendency.

2902
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,150
And those are the,

2903
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:47,430
the,

2904
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:51,010
they're called the smileys in sydney's,

2905
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:52,780
you've got a salafi sydney's,

2906
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,840
which is a lot of the,

2907
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:56,040
the ones in Saudi Arabia.

2908
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:56,874
we're very conservative.

2909
01:25:56,890 --> 01:25:59,870
You have four major schools of
thought within the sneezers,

2910
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,200
the uh,

2911
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,100
you want the names.

2912
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,570
I mean it's like a humbling
shafi malarkey and how to fee.

2913
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,700
So these are four different
schools of thought.

2914
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:08,810
They practice different things.

2915
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:09,411
Like for instance,

2916
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:12,830
the shafi sect does for them,

2917
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,640
female genital mutilation is mandatory.

2918
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,740
Mandatory mandatory.

2919
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:21,860
So in Indonesia and in a lot of southeast,

2920
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,240
southeast asian countries,

2921
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,261
Indonesia,

2922
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,960
where reza aslan says that women
are 100 percent equal to men.

2923
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,801
I would say.

2924
01:26:27,801 --> 01:26:28,100
Yeah.

2925
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,360
When it comes to circumcision rates,

2926
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:33,800
they are more than 80 percent of
men and women there are circumcised.

2927
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:38,330
So circumcision for a man that was not
nearly as brutal as circumcision for a

2928
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,030
female,

2929
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,460
it is just cutting off skin.

2930
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:41,990
You're not cutting off the tourists.

2931
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:47,110
There's four different kinds
of fgm according to the who,

2932
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:52,520
so that ranges from just nicking the
clitoris to all the way to removing the

2933
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:53,630
clitoris and the labia.

2934
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,130
So making it as just sort
of a scarring ritual.

2935
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:57,351
Yeah.

2936
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:57,601
Nick,

2937
01:26:57,601 --> 01:26:58,434
a circle.

2938
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,270
It's still pretty fucked up and
they're all banned over here.

2939
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:02,931
So it's,

2940
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:04,130
there's different grades to it.

2941
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:05,953
Um,

2942
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:07,123
but in.

2943
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,050
So that's one example,

2944
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:09,561
right?

2945
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:10,780
Of the sect.

2946
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,370
And then the molecules have a different
belief than hunter fees have different

2947
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:14,060
beliefs.

2948
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:14,540
So,

2949
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:19,220
and they'd range and they know there's
really liberal ones within each sector is

2950
01:27:19,221 --> 01:27:20,390
really conservative ones.

2951
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,730
So it's very wide.

2952
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,420
Like,

2953
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:23,681
you know,

2954
01:27:23,681 --> 01:27:27,050
you have jihadists who will actually
go out and they'll carry out these

2955
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:28,410
martyrdom operations.

2956
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:29,244
Then you have,

2957
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:29,750
um,

2958
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:33,230
islamists who agree with political islam,

2959
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,590
but not all of them are necessarily
going to carry out these operations.

2960
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:41,240
And then you have a moderate muslims and
a lot of moderate muslims are extremely

2961
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:44,360
conservative and they do believe in all
those like conservative things like,

2962
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:44,960
you know,

2963
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,370
being gay is not a good thing.

2964
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:47,330
Women should cover herself,

2965
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:49,160
so a lot of moderates will believe this,

2966
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:49,910
but they're,

2967
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:54,910
they reject the political ideology of
islam and then you have a liberal and

2968
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,080
progressive moderates and
there are different as well.

2969
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,160
So it's a very,

2970
01:27:58,161 --> 01:27:58,401
you know,

2971
01:27:58,401 --> 01:27:59,870
it's a one point 6 billion people,

2972
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,940
so it's a very wide,

2973
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:03,320
it's extremely,

2974
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,250
extremely diverse.

2975
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,833
What is,

2976
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,220
which is the more conservative of faction,

2977
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:09,860
the sunni,

2978
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:10,880
sunni or shia,

2979
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,133
um,

2980
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:14,360
this conservative elements in both.

2981
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:14,780
Like,

2982
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,500
just to give you an example that
may be more recognizable to you is,

2983
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:19,543
um,

2984
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,290
the iranian theocracy.

2985
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:23,420
If you can keep that closer to like,

2986
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,520
we don't want to vary
too much from the sound.

2987
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:25,970
You can just.

2988
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:26,220
Oh,

2989
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,841
hold it towards you.

2990
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,680
It moves around a lot.

2991
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:28,200
Okay.

2992
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,520
Cool.

2993
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,151
but it's weird.

2994
01:28:29,151 --> 01:28:30,350
These things are very directional.

2995
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,070
Sorry.

2996
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:31,480
There we go.

2997
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:31,800
Oh,

2998
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,633
there

2999
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,270
was the iranian theocracy
is shia theocracy.

3000
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,320
So that's extremely conservative.

3001
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,243
Shia islam.

3002
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:41,090
uh,

3003
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:42,500
the saudis are sydney.

3004
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,970
It's extremely conservative,

3005
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,343
sunni islam,

3006
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,510
what do they hate about each other?

3007
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:48,680
That they're willing to go to war,

3008
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,690
the bronx successor.

3009
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,220
So historicAl difference between
shias and sydney's in it.

3010
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:56,360
So it's like baptist
going after catholics.

3011
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,430
Yeah,

3012
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:58,550
sort of in that way.

3013
01:28:58,970 --> 01:28:59,510
And uh,

3014
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,930
yeah,

3015
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:00,763
pretty much similar.

3016
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:03,270
They just have different ideas
of what the belief should be.

3017
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:04,651
and uh,

3018
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:07,860
there is an element of labeling
people who don't agree with you,

3019
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:08,821
non muslims.

3020
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:12,040
So a lot of saudis will say
that the has are coffer,

3021
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:16,590
there are apostates because they
rejected belief in the caliphs um,

3022
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:18,211
and then,

3023
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:18,330
uh,

3024
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:21,570
that makes them punishable
by death and then,

3025
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:21,781
you know,

3026
01:29:21,781 --> 01:29:23,310
you have to go out and
you have to kill them.

3027
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:26,280
And there's also an
ethniC thing there too,

3028
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:26,461
those,

3029
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,710
the arabic and persian ethnic rivalry.

3030
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:30,480
So it's extremely complicated.

3031
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:31,380
And that's why bush,

3032
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:32,311
uh,

3033
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:37,311
ended up in such a mess when he went
into Iraq because I don't think he,

3034
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,650
I mean this is a hard thing tO
understand for a lot of people.

3035
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,500
And apparently I didn't
know from what I read to he,

3036
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,730
I don't think he had any idea.

3037
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:49,620
I don't think he knew the difference
between shias and cindy's beyond just the

3038
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:50,454
superficial level.

3039
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,230
He probably had no idea that that was
going to go down and there was going to be

3040
01:29:53,231 --> 01:29:55,390
some sort of a brutal civil war.

3041
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,660
Try to reclaim power mean no one,

3042
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:02,950
no one in this country had any
idea that that was going to happen.

3043
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:07,120
There was going to be a civil war between
the two competing factions of islam.

3044
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:07,920
Yeah.

3045
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,170
I,

3046
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,200
I have a friend.

3047
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:09,500
His,

3048
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:10,190
uh,

3049
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:11,440
his name is festival pathar.

3050
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,590
He is a,

3051
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,700
he's an iraqi.

3052
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,110
He was,

3053
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:17,390
he grew up in Iraq and he started the
global secular humanist movement while he

3054
01:30:17,391 --> 01:30:18,224
was in Iraq.

3055
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:22,160
So he became a target for a lot of
people and the global secular humanist

3056
01:30:22,161 --> 01:30:26,300
movement now has I think 300,000
followers on facebook and so on.

3057
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:31,130
So it became a huge and he was also from
a shia family and he was targeted by al

3058
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:33,410
qaeda and they managed
to kill his brother.

3059
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,330
And then after that he went into.

3060
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,470
He was running around all over all kinds
of different countries until he finally

3061
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:40,820
got refugee status in the us.

3062
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:45,850
And he came here recently and he's
full of stories about Iraq and how

3063
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,270
complicated it is.

3064
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:48,613
And um,

3065
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,930
some of the other people I've talked to,

3066
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:52,170
they say that the read,

3067
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:56,270
the reason that saddam hussein was so
effective is because he ruled with an iron

3068
01:30:56,271 --> 01:31:01,220
fist and he kept all of these sort of
religious rivalries under control and he

3069
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:04,310
presented to anybody he was fair to eat,

3070
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,151
like pro secular.

3071
01:31:05,151 --> 01:31:09,080
A lot of these dictatorships
are so they're secular and uh,

3072
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:10,011
you know,

3073
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:13,970
they just didn't in the moment
you took that fist away.

3074
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,520
Everything just went nuts.

3075
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:17,951
Yeah.

3076
01:31:17,951 --> 01:31:20,650
That's what it seems like
from our point of view,

3077
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,760
from our confused point of view
when all that was going down.

3078
01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:29,550
That was a very strange moment where
most americans were standing back going,

3079
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:29,731
wait,

3080
01:31:29,731 --> 01:31:29,851
wait,

3081
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,011
wait.

3082
01:31:30,011 --> 01:31:30,844
What's going on?

3083
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,290
Like they're competing against,

3084
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:32,381
well,

3085
01:31:32,381 --> 01:31:33,670
they're fighting with each other,

3086
01:31:33,671 --> 01:31:35,820
like in their two rival sections of white.

3087
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:39,160
But no one knew that there
were rival factions of islam.

3088
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,600
Um,

3089
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,940
this guy raise a aslan.

3090
01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:48,340
He is a very interesting
sort of polarizing figure.

3091
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:48,940
I mean,

3092
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:52,000
some people think that he is a,

3093
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:55,120
like an interesting historian,

3094
01:31:55,121 --> 01:31:59,680
a voice of reason and other people think
he's completely disingenuous and not

3095
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:02,080
just like incorrect about certain things,

3096
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:03,700
but that he's just,

3097
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:04,080
he's,

3098
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:04,960
he's full of shit.

3099
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:05,973
Yeah.

3100
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:10,150
That's sort of sam harris's
take on him is that he's just,

3101
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:11,680
he's just dishonest.

3102
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:12,450
I,

3103
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,960
I agree with sam harris and
I think he's very dishonest.

3104
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,480
What is his objective?

3105
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:17,740
Like what is he trying to do?

3106
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,940
Because my friend duncan is enamored by
my friend duncan read his book on jesus

3107
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:22,774
and he's just.

3108
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:26,050
He said it's an absolutely fascinating
book and just really thinks the guy's

3109
01:32:26,170 --> 01:32:27,130
very interesting.

3110
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:31,510
But then I talked to sam about him
and sam said that he had some really

3111
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:33,370
dishonest dealings with them.

3112
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:35,110
Some conversations with them where,

3113
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,013
yeah,

3114
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:36,741
he's,

3115
01:32:36,741 --> 01:32:38,240
I'm like,

3116
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:39,560
I've only read the stuff he's had.

3117
01:32:39,561 --> 01:32:41,660
I've had some exchanges with
them on twitter and so on.

3118
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:42,640
And uh,

3119
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,460
he,

3120
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,570
he's sort of like a very
classic apologist and um,

3121
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:48,463
and he's muslim.

3122
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,623
He's muslim.

3123
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:50,370
So I,

3124
01:32:50,370 --> 01:32:51,720
I don't know about his belief.

3125
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,430
I'm not sure whether he really is a
practicing or believing muSlim or not,

3126
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:56,510
but he is.

3127
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:59,050
He's definitely an apologist and
he's one of these guys who whenever,

3128
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:00,830
whenever anything terrible happens,

3129
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:01,131
it's like,

3130
01:33:01,131 --> 01:33:01,281
well,

3131
01:33:01,281 --> 01:33:04,700
we got to look for the root cause
islam is not the root cause.

3132
01:33:04,701 --> 01:33:09,130
And at one point he
sAid that I'm like his,

3133
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:11,270
he's one of those guys who
responds with everything by,

3134
01:33:11,271 --> 01:33:13,340
with accusations of
bigotry and islamophobia.

3135
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:16,250
Like he'll just cAll you
a bigot and he knows,

3136
01:33:16,251 --> 01:33:16,931
especially that,

3137
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:17,100
you know,

3138
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,080
people here,

3139
01:33:18,081 --> 01:33:20,150
especially liberal white westerners,

3140
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,790
that's the last thing
they want to be called.

3141
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:25,430
It's just a great way to
shut down the conversation.

3142
01:33:25,431 --> 01:33:26,600
Then people know this.

3143
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,450
People in the muslim world
generally they know this.

3144
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,690
They know they can completely
shut you up if you just accused.

3145
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:34,320
They just accused you of racism.

3146
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:34,641
And so there's,

3147
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:36,800
there's so much guilt involved with that,

3148
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,030
especially white people.

3149
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,233
We're so guilty.

3150
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:39,741
Yeah.

3151
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:41,270
And the dwight sort of western like,

3152
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:41,470
you know,

3153
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:42,530
they mean well,

3154
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,410
but they have the sense that they're like,

3155
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:45,800
okay,

3156
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,450
we don't want to be called racist.

3157
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:48,980
I want to be called bigots.

3158
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,253
Um,

3159
01:33:51,350 --> 01:33:51,561
so,

3160
01:33:51,561 --> 01:33:51,701
and,

3161
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:52,800
and I think he kind of,

3162
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:58,220
he uses that a lot and one of the things
that he said for instances that he

3163
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:00,110
actually wrote these books,

3164
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,640
the koran the scriptures,

3165
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:04,430
they don't mean anything
in and of themselves.

3166
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,020
These words have no meaning.

3167
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,600
It is the people like a misogynist,

3168
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:11,990
violent person will bring their meeting
out and they'll see in it what they

3169
01:34:11,991 --> 01:34:12,171
want,

3170
01:34:12,171 --> 01:34:14,900
like as if the book is
full of rorschach tests,

3171
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,040
just like an ink blots,

3172
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:16,650
right?

3173
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,650
You can interpret and these
words don't mean anything.

3174
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:19,733
And,

3175
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,160
and I was just thinking
about the implication,

3176
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:25,600
and I wrote this for the
richard dawkins website is a,

3177
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,571
you know,

3178
01:34:26,571 --> 01:34:29,480
if he's saying that like these people,

3179
01:34:29,481 --> 01:34:30,860
they didn't get their ideas from the book,

3180
01:34:30,861 --> 01:34:31,940
the book has nothing to do with it.

3181
01:34:31,941 --> 01:34:35,150
Then he's saying that all of the
people in the muslim world are

3182
01:34:35,151 --> 01:34:39,080
disproportionately inherently
violent and misogynistic,

3183
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:39,980
right?

3184
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,630
Because like the words
don't have any meaning.

3185
01:34:41,631 --> 01:34:44,420
Then they've chosen to behave this way.

3186
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:47,390
It's got to be something in their dna
and they're rationalizing it with those

3187
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:48,800
words that don't mean anything.

3188
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:49,783
And that's bigoted.

3189
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,840
You're essentially,

3190
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:54,890
that's actually even more bigoted because
you're saying that these people are

3191
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:55,850
inherently like that.

3192
01:34:55,851 --> 01:34:56,810
It's in their dna.

3193
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,040
That's the way the people are.

3194
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:01,670
It's not that had been led by some
ancient misled rather buy some ancient

3195
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:03,500
ideology and you can't fix it.

3196
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:04,120
Right?

3197
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:06,170
It's like because they're just like that.

3198
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:08,240
So to me that actually sounds,

3199
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:09,920
that's a much worse position to have.

3200
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:15,220
It's a much more bigoted position to
have and to neglect obvious causes.

3201
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:17,830
I'm like,

3202
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:17,991
you know,

3203
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:19,520
when we talk about root causes,

3204
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,290
anytime someone says a allahu akbar
there do something or they say,

3205
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,101
jesus made me do.

3206
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:26,570
It was kind of ignored that and like,

3207
01:35:26,571 --> 01:35:26,721
okay,

3208
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:27,330
let's ignore that.

3209
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:29,140
Let's look beyond every time.

3210
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,680
But when you're looking beyond something,

3211
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:31,940
you're never going to see
what's in front of you.

3212
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:32,510
Right?

3213
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:33,920
So if I'm,

3214
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,790
if I tell you I did something
horrific act because it was,

3215
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:41,060
my political beliefs are because I
played a certain video game or I liked a

3216
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:42,400
certain band or a.

3217
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,741
It was,

3218
01:35:42,741 --> 01:35:44,540
I was pissed off about us foreign policy.

3219
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:47,030
You'll take that at face value.

3220
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,590
Everyone was like moments.

3221
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:50,030
Anybody says us foreign policy,

3222
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,030
you know,

3223
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,471
reza,

3224
01:35:51,471 --> 01:35:51,890
aslan,

3225
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:52,730
glenn greenwald,

3226
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,580
and I'll be like,

3227
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,413
okay.

3228
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,060
They said what the cause was,

3229
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:56,894
we should believe them,

3230
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,320
but way more than us foreign policy.

3231
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:02,780
They're telling you why
they're doing things.

3232
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:03,890
They're doing it for god.

3233
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,180
They're doing it for the afterlife.

3234
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,370
And when we listened to that,

3235
01:36:07,371 --> 01:36:08,810
we don't take that at face value.

3236
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:09,260
We're like,

3237
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:09,501
no,

3238
01:36:09,501 --> 01:36:10,340
that's impossible.

3239
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:11,660
It has to be something beyond it.

3240
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:12,860
Um,

3241
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:16,760
it's the only thing that
we don't believe that,

3242
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,061
you know,

3243
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:20,060
religion and religious belief
can actually do these things.

3244
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:24,370
They can actually trigger
people to act on them.

3245
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:25,910
How do you,

3246
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:29,580
that's almost impossible to fix it.

3247
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:29,901
It's,

3248
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:31,160
it's a tough thing to fix.

3249
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:31,731
And I,

3250
01:36:31,731 --> 01:36:32,564
um,

3251
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:34,090
there's this one after that,

3252
01:36:34,091 --> 01:36:34,310
uh,

3253
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:37,940
do you know about the attack on the
school in Pakistan where they killed 100

3254
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:42,140
people in 132 kids and they just went in,

3255
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,100
there were like seven suicide bombers.

3256
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,930
It just went in and they just took out
all those kids under the age 12 to 14.

3257
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,180
So that shook up the world.

3258
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:52,003
And um,

3259
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:56,840
after that I was talking online
to this taliban sympathizer,

3260
01:36:56,841 --> 01:36:58,120
I don't know if he was
a member of the band,

3261
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:01,040
but he was definitely a
sympathizer and you know,

3262
01:37:01,041 --> 01:37:01,370
he,

3263
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:04,700
he told me something that
just completely like,

3264
01:37:04,701 --> 01:37:05,930
it was actually really chilling.

3265
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:07,490
And he said,

3266
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:08,061
he's like,

3267
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:08,270
you know,

3268
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:09,103
I don't,

3269
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:11,840
it's not that I believe in an afterlife.

3270
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:16,550
I know there's an afterlife is like
we don't think of death as an end.

3271
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:17,150
You know,

3272
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,740
death is like,

3273
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:20,510
this is just a human concept.

3274
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,051
Something.

3275
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:22,850
People who need to believe in materialism,

3276
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:23,630
belief,

3277
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:25,190
we know that death is not an end.

3278
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:27,410
And then he pointed out the word,

3279
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:30,890
which is the language
from Pakistan for death,

3280
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:31,990
which is integral.

3281
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,510
And then the goal
actually means transition.

3282
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:35,391
It doesn't mean,

3283
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:38,060
and it doesn't mean death as we know it.

3284
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:43,010
so you said even the word for death and
the column means transition means you're

3285
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:44,060
moving onto another world.

3286
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:47,050
And then he went into more detail.

3287
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:47,481
He's like,

3288
01:37:47,481 --> 01:37:48,230
uh,

3289
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:48,891
these kids,

3290
01:37:48,891 --> 01:37:49,011
like,

3291
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:49,270
you know,

3292
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:51,470
if kids have had the chance to sin,

3293
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:53,480
there's a higher chance
of them going to hell.

3294
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,350
But if they're young and innocent,

3295
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:57,930
then they're immediately
going to go to heaven.

3296
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:03,180
So we don't think of or we don't think
that we're killing these kids and we're

3297
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:04,020
ending their lives.

3298
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:07,500
We think that we're actually sending
them to a place where they're going to be

3299
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:09,920
protected from their evil infidel parents.

3300
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,730
Oh fuck.

3301
01:38:10,730 --> 01:38:11,740
and they're not able to sense.

3302
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,960
And then he,

3303
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:13,620
uh,

3304
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,341
he said that,

3305
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:15,174
uh,

3306
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,990
if I'm trying to remember all of it
because there was some really important

3307
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:19,530
elements of,

3308
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:19,710
you know,

3309
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:20,101
what he said,

3310
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:21,750
that gives us insight into how they think.

3311
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:22,280
Yeah.

3312
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:22,741
And then he said,

3313
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:24,300
the reason that we blow ourselves up,

3314
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:25,050
it was like,

3315
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:25,171
you know,

3316
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:26,320
we were killing ourselves.

3317
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:27,510
Death was such a bad thing.

3318
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:28,890
We wouldn't do it ourselves,

3319
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:32,130
but we know where we're going and we
know where we're taking the kids as well.

3320
01:38:32,131 --> 01:38:34,980
So we just don't think of
it in the way that you do.

3321
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:37,200
And most muslims,

3322
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:41,040
and he was talking about all the
muslims condemning it and he's like most

3323
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:41,341
muslims,

3324
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:42,570
their faith is in this pure.

3325
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:46,560
If they really believed that there was
a heaven there were doing the right

3326
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:46,741
thing,

3327
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:47,574
they're going to get there.

3328
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,050
They wouldn't be mourning this.

3329
01:38:49,051 --> 01:38:50,190
There will be celebrating it.

3330
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:50,611
He's like,

3331
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:52,510
but they are a poor faith and you know,

3332
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,030
we're of the right faith.

3333
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:54,950
And I say,

3334
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:55,260
you know,

3335
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:55,980
when you.

3336
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:58,190
So that's the mindset that
you're going up against.

3337
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,230
How do you fight it?

3338
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:04,030
You fight it like that scene from aliens
where he says you gotta pull out new

3339
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:04,873
kit from orbit.

3340
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:08,830
So ever see that scene where it's still
tax different from what you were saying

3341
01:39:08,831 --> 01:39:09,700
about the drones.

3342
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:11,140
Yeah.

3343
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:13,660
It seems like we need a
nuke the entire world.

3344
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:15,910
Start fresh with new monkeys now.

3345
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,520
People are just so fucked.

3346
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:23,140
The fact that a human being in 2015 can
literally operate and think that way.

3347
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:23,960
No,

3348
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,661
it was,

3349
01:39:24,661 --> 01:39:24,870
uh,

3350
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,050
it was absolutely amazing.

3351
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:27,820
But it's important to.

3352
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:31,450
I think I was watching this movie and I
know was it a tv show and someone said

3353
01:39:31,451 --> 01:39:32,284
something,

3354
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:33,163
um,

3355
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:38,340
where they said that moment you demonize
your enemy or the moment you call your

3356
01:39:38,381 --> 01:39:39,214
enemy the devil,

3357
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,470
you're not going to be
able to understand them.

3358
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:42,920
You know,

3359
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,790
the moment you've decided
that there are the other,

3360
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:47,680
and this is just pure evil,

3361
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:50,680
you'll never understand their
motivation for why they do what they do.

3362
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:51,920
Um,

3363
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:52,190
anything.

3364
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:53,110
I think it's important.

3365
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,450
Like that was a very eye
opening conversation for me.

3366
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,700
I'm sure you know what I want.

3367
01:39:57,701 --> 01:39:58,170
Please go.

3368
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:58,610
Go on.

3369
01:39:58,610 --> 01:39:58,741
No,

3370
01:39:58,741 --> 01:39:59,100
no.

3371
01:39:59,100 --> 01:39:59,770
I was just saying I've,

3372
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:00,820
I've heard that before.

3373
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:02,920
People have told me
that since I was a kid,

3374
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:04,870
I was raised religiously.

3375
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:06,043
Um,

3376
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:06,831
you know,

3377
01:40:06,831 --> 01:40:08,860
that it's not permanent.

3378
01:40:08,861 --> 01:40:09,310
You know,

3379
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,080
life is just temporary
and it's the afterlife.

3380
01:40:11,081 --> 01:40:16,081
but I don't think anybody really like
truly truly believes that that's it.

3381
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:18,310
And that's why this life is useless.

3382
01:40:18,311 --> 01:40:22,510
People still get upset when their loved
ones die and they still fear death.

3383
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:23,373
They don't want to die already.

3384
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,611
If they really,

3385
01:40:24,611 --> 01:40:26,290
really thought that there
were going to some place,

3386
01:40:26,291 --> 01:40:27,130
great afterwards.

3387
01:40:27,131 --> 01:40:30,310
So it wouldn't be that much
of a fear of any of us.

3388
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:30,510
I mean,

3389
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:31,440
imagine like if you,

3390
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,231
if he thought,

3391
01:40:32,231 --> 01:40:32,381
okay,

3392
01:40:32,381 --> 01:40:35,680
my death is a fucking
ticket to eternal bliss,

3393
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:38,950
then it's not something that
would scare you if you really,

3394
01:40:38,951 --> 01:40:43,390
really knew that these people really
know that and they're all too willing to

3395
01:40:43,391 --> 01:40:44,770
kill themselves and kill others.

3396
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:50,470
The charlie hebdo thing
confused the shit out of me.

3397
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,810
Not that people were willing
to kill people over the.

3398
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:56,200
I kind of already had
that idea in my head,

3399
01:40:56,410 --> 01:41:01,210
but the reaction by a lot of left wing
progressive people in the United States

3400
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:03,430
condemning the racism of those cartoons.

3401
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:04,271
I was like,

3402
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:06,670
what the fuck are you even talking about?

3403
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:11,700
You're talking about a
massacre and horrific murderous
massacre and you've chose

3404
01:41:12,851 --> 01:41:16,480
to condemn the quote unquote
racism of these cartoons,

3405
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:17,710
which,

3406
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:17,981
you know,

3407
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:21,340
it's like killing the people
that write mad magazine.

3408
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:22,690
I mean it's not much different,

3409
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:23,120
you know,

3410
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,830
mad magazine or you know,

3411
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:30,010
name any sort of controversial south
park going after the guys from south park

3412
01:41:30,401 --> 01:41:31,390
killing south park.

3413
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:32,080
Yeah.

3414
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,390
It's killing matt stone and trey parker.

3415
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:34,841
I mean,

3416
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:36,370
it's not much different.

3417
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:36,830
Yeah.

3418
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:38,800
They know.

3419
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:39,971
What is that,

3420
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:41,830
that apologist thinking,

3421
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:46,840
that weird sort of thinking
that's embodied by a lot
of those really progressive

3422
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:47,674
left wing,

3423
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:48,400
like,

3424
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,500
like really radical left wing people.

3425
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,730
Like what is that?

3426
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:55,730
There's a sensitivity to hurting
people and hurting their feelings

3427
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,310
over murder.

3428
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:57,690
Yeah.

3429
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:58,380
Over murder.

3430
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:58,830
Yeah.

3431
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:01,890
I think that they think they'll
always say that I don't,

3432
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:03,450
I'm not defending the murders.

3433
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:04,201
That was horrific.

3434
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:04,890
I condemn it,

3435
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:08,130
but then there's always a button
and then there's this whole sort of

3436
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,510
Justification for it.

3437
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:12,540
This is a sensitive
thing for me because I,

3438
01:42:12,541 --> 01:42:13,740
I'm like a,

3439
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:15,660
I'm a free speech absolutist.

3440
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:16,680
Like I just,

3441
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:17,010
uh,

3442
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,731
when I grew up,

3443
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:18,990
there's a lot of things I can say,

3444
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:19,780
you know,

3445
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:21,180
I have a friend who is being,

3446
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:23,370
was in jail for 10 years and he's being,

3447
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:27,690
he's been sentenced to lashing
for doing exactly what I do here,

3448
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,081
you know?

3449
01:42:28,081 --> 01:42:31,320
So when I look at him and I
both grew up in Saudi Arabia,

3450
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,760
we're both writers.

3451
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:34,110
We're both pro secularism.

3452
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:36,000
But when I,

3453
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:40,560
when I say something I can
say it and there's no like,

3454
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,460
it's fine.

3455
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:42,540
And when he does it,

3456
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:43,920
he gets slashed and tortured,

3457
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,440
so free speech is a big thing for me.

3458
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:48,121
So coming here,

3459
01:42:48,121 --> 01:42:48,371
like I,

3460
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,270
I just don't think when it comes
to the cartoons or the movie,

3461
01:42:51,271 --> 01:42:51,930
the interview,

3462
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:52,501
people were saying,

3463
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:52,681
well,

3464
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:53,610
it's a shitty movie anyway.

3465
01:42:53,611 --> 01:42:54,261
I didn't think that.

3466
01:42:54,261 --> 01:42:55,094
I thought it was hilarious.

3467
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:56,460
But the,

3468
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,091
you know,

3469
01:42:57,091 --> 01:43:01,740
when they start talking about the content
of what is being criticized or attack,

3470
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:05,730
I just think it's completely irrelevant
in the context of what's happening.

3471
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:10,440
Like it doesn't mAtter what
was in the charlie hebdo

3472
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,710
doing that because they're terrified of,

3473
01:43:13,711 --> 01:43:18,570
of retribution and they're so terrified
that they're willing to side with the,

3474
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:23,630
the murderous religious fundamentalists
because they're almost Worried that

3475
01:43:24,421 --> 01:43:25,830
they're going to get attack themselves.

3476
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:26,071
they're like,

3477
01:43:26,071 --> 01:43:26,401
well,

3478
01:43:26,401 --> 01:43:26,710
you know,

3479
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:29,340
I mean those cartoons were
kind of a really racist.

3480
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:30,151
And they mean.

3481
01:43:30,151 --> 01:43:30,984
I'm not saying that the,

3482
01:43:31,140 --> 01:43:32,460
that the murders were cool,

3483
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:33,361
but I'm sAying like,

3484
01:43:33,361 --> 01:43:33,661
hey,

3485
01:43:33,661 --> 01:43:36,780
why are you promoting like
horrible racist cartoons?

3486
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:37,140
I mean,

3487
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:38,130
let's look at that.

3488
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:38,471
Well,

3489
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:40,540
that's where the
islamophobia phobia comes in.

3490
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,493
yeah.

3491
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:45,440
They have a very certain way of talking.

3492
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,610
Have you ever noticed these people that
are super progressive and super liberal

3493
01:43:49,611 --> 01:43:52,970
and they have this weird of
certain words and I mean,

3494
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:57,971
I'm not saying that it's cool
to mUrder all those people,

3495
01:43:57,981 --> 01:44:01,100
but liKe let's look at
why were they so upset?

3496
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,323
Yeah,

3497
01:44:02,530 --> 01:44:03,363
it's,

3498
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,400
you know,

3499
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:05,300
it is what it is.

3500
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,770
We live in an easy culture.

3501
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,740
People are more upset about.

3502
01:44:09,741 --> 01:44:10,574
It's not,

3503
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,530
there's this value,

3504
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:14,000
the value of freedom of speech.

3505
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,930
Okay.

3506
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,240
Which I think is extremely
important taken for granted.

3507
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:18,620
Very much so by americans.

3508
01:44:18,621 --> 01:44:19,454
And so yeah,

3509
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,040
that's something that
I ended festival there.

3510
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,410
Guy from Iraq I told you about.

3511
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,250
He says the same thing.

3512
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:25,401
You know,

3513
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:25,671
we,

3514
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:26,504
when he came here,

3515
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:26,960
he was like,

3516
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,170
in a lot of people are sort of apologists
about it because there's a freedom of

3517
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:33,350
speech and then there is this sort of
political correctness and not to offend

3518
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:34,130
anybody.

3519
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:34,963
And um,

3520
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:35,991
people will say,

3521
01:44:35,991 --> 01:44:39,140
one thing I've been hearing
a lot is a freedom of speech.

3522
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:40,490
Doesn't mean the freedom to offend.

3523
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:41,783
and I'm thinking,

3524
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:42,700
I'm thinking,

3525
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,050
well,

3526
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:44,690
that's exactly what it means.

3527
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,171
Yeah.

3528
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:50,171
There's no point of freedom of speech
and it means you have the freedom to talk

3529
01:44:50,271 --> 01:44:54,380
about being offended by that freedom
of speech that other person expressed.

3530
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:54,621
Yeah.

3531
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:55,451
Everybody said that.

3532
01:44:55,451 --> 01:44:58,430
The fact that you can have
this conversation about
what freedom of speech means

3533
01:44:58,431 --> 01:45:03,431
is that's what freedom of speech is and
if the whole reason it's protected so

3534
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:06,110
strongly is because of the.

3535
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,340
It means the right that all of
us have to offend other people.

3536
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:10,730
Right.

3537
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:12,800
Which was why I have a huge issue.

3538
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:16,190
When people say something that
other people deemed to be offensive,

3539
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,030
they automatically go after their
employers and try to get them fired.

3540
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:21,440
Like this isn't just a freedom of.

3541
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,230
You're not just speaking about them.

3542
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:27,830
Now you're taking action
to try to get them fired.

3543
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:29,060
Which is very different.

3544
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:32,340
I mean this is a very different
kind of activism and it's,

3545
01:45:32,341 --> 01:45:32,560
it's,

3546
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:32,910
it's.

3547
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:35,510
I mean like what you're doing is like,

3548
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:40,511
it's like there's like
there's a negativity attached
to it that's very strange.

3549
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,640
It's like it's an aggressive negativity,

3550
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:48,820
a rebound from something that they
believe is a incorrect weird that we have.

3551
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,390
We have the right to have
the right to be offended.

3552
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:55,850
They don't have the
right not to be offended.

3553
01:45:56,060 --> 01:45:56,450
You know that.

3554
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,283
That's the idea.

3555
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,310
You know,

3556
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:01,070
nobody has a right not to be
offended if you don't like something.

3557
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,210
You don't have to listen to it.

3558
01:46:02,211 --> 01:46:04,340
You can shut it down or
counter speech with speech.

3559
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:05,810
Exactly,

3560
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:06,320
exactly.

3561
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,720
That's a very good way of putting
a counter speech with speech,

3562
01:46:08,721 --> 01:46:09,920
kind of freedom with freedom.

3563
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,320
If you don't like the way
someone expresses himself,

3564
01:46:12,321 --> 01:46:16,340
talk about the way they express themselves
and what you specifically you find

3565
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:17,151
incorrect about it.

3566
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:18,650
And that's how dialogues gets started.

3567
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:19,783
And you know,

3568
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,850
people become illuminaTed
by those sort of dialogues.

3569
01:46:22,851 --> 01:46:24,560
Even people that have opposing ideas.

3570
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,040
You,

3571
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:25,700
you see,

3572
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,170
you can see where a person comes from,

3573
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,490
even if you don't agree with it,

3574
01:46:28,491 --> 01:46:29,930
you could see where a person comes from.

3575
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,191
I,

3576
01:46:31,191 --> 01:46:31,551
you know,

3577
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:32,320
there's this,

3578
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,670
we also talked about hate speech
because I think one of the,

3579
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,510
one of the biggest problems
with France and europe is a,

3580
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,120
it,

3581
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,680
a lot of european countries is that,

3582
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:39,990
uh,

3583
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:43,880
they have laws against hate speech and
the use of laws against hate crimes.

3584
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,960
Hate speech is protected
as part of free speech.

3585
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:49,650
And I think that's right.

3586
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,510
I number remember the westboro baptist
church really where the supreme court

3587
01:46:54,511 --> 01:46:57,130
voted eight to allow
them to pick a few notes.

3588
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,520
And as you know,

3589
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,433
as much as you,

3590
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,500
that idea is important or anything of
the westboro baptist church does is

3591
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:05,334
important.

3592
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,263
Um,

3593
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:09,480
that is a right and they should be able
to do it as long as it's not a crime and

3594
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,314
this his speech.

3595
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:10,741
But,

3596
01:47:10,741 --> 01:47:10,891
you know,

3597
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:12,380
they have In,

3598
01:47:12,381 --> 01:47:12,841
in France,

3599
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:14,370
they've got holocaust denial laws.

3600
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:16,260
They have rules against,

3601
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:17,150
uh,

3602
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:17,700
you know,

3603
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,533
attacking,

3604
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:19,713
you know,

3605
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:20,643
like the.

3606
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:21,691
Let me put it this way,

3607
01:47:21,691 --> 01:47:23,190
the very same things,

3608
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,900
same rules that,

3609
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:25,610
uh,

3610
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:29,580
that their hate speech laws were actually
used by the government at times to

3611
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:30,690
warren charlie hebdo.

3612
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:31,651
Like,

3613
01:47:31,651 --> 01:47:31,791
you know,

3614
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:33,330
what you're doing is you're
engaging in hate speech.

3615
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:37,530
So the same hate speech laws that
actually protected the killers,

3616
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:39,150
right?

3617
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:42,540
Protected their right to
express themselves and to say,

3618
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:43,374
okay,

3619
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,900
do everything from subjugate women to um,

3620
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:46,720
you know,

3621
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:47,553
uh,

3622
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:48,643
um,

3623
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:51,270
impinge on gay rights for instance.

3624
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:55,050
I get all of those same things that
seemed hate speech laws were used to warn

3625
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:56,610
the charlie hebdo people.

3626
01:47:56,611 --> 01:47:56,791
I mean,

3627
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:57,230
they had that,

3628
01:47:57,230 --> 01:47:57,310
uh,

3629
01:47:57,310 --> 01:47:58,410
that fashion designer,

3630
01:47:59,050 --> 01:47:59,400
uh,

3631
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,270
who was arrested for antisemitic
remarks that he made in a bar.

3632
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:04,140
And so,

3633
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:05,270
yeah,

3634
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:06,720
so if you have hate speech laws,

3635
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:07,620
if you have things like that,

3636
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:08,521
then,

3637
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:09,210
um,

3638
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:10,770
that causes a lot of issues.

3639
01:48:10,771 --> 01:48:14,760
It doesn't work very well for people
who are making the cartoons like charlie

3640
01:48:14,761 --> 01:48:18,750
hebdo and actually ends up protecting
their attackers and their ideology.

3641
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:19,160
I,

3642
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:19,471
when,

3643
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:22,650
when I look at the apologists,

3644
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:23,840
especially in America,

3645
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:26,240
I often wonder whether or not it's a,

3646
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,650
it's a case of people.

3647
01:48:27,651 --> 01:48:29,480
It's like very similar to people.

3648
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:34,010
Like almost like winning the lottery and
becoming spoiled and not appreciating

3649
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:38,900
the earning of that money or someone
who inherited millions of dollars.

3650
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:43,280
And you usually find them all fucked up
and drunk and they become drug addicts.

3651
01:48:43,281 --> 01:48:44,420
It's like they have.

3652
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:45,710
They're so spoiled.

3653
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:49,970
They're so spoiled by this freedom
that they don't appreciate it.

3654
01:48:49,971 --> 01:48:50,930
It's almost like you.

3655
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:56,060
We've had so much freedom and it's gone
on for so long with no consequences that

3656
01:48:56,061 --> 01:49:00,590
until you actually see personally the
effects of those consequences of free

3657
01:49:00,591 --> 01:49:01,190
speech.

3658
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:03,860
You don't appreciate free speech
for what it really truly is.

3659
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:06,080
Like you may disagree with someone,

3660
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:09,620
but if you disagree with their
ability to express themselves,

3661
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:11,420
you're part of the problem.

3662
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:12,433
Yeah.

3663
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:12,860
Yeah.

3664
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:14,240
I agree with all of that.

3665
01:49:14,810 --> 01:49:14,971
Yeah.

3666
01:49:14,971 --> 01:49:15,530
I mean you don't.

3667
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,220
You might think those.

3668
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,140
I think those cartoons or stupid as fuck.

3669
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:18,610
I wouldn't.

3670
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:19,610
I wouldn't draw them.

3671
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:21,860
I wouldn't waste my time
drawing those cartoons.

3672
01:49:21,861 --> 01:49:22,610
I think they suck.

3673
01:49:22,610 --> 01:49:23,540
It's not my culture.

3674
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:23,830
I don't.

3675
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:24,663
I don't get it.

3676
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:27,710
Maybe if I spoke french and I
understood where they were coming from,

3677
01:49:27,711 --> 01:49:28,790
I would think it would be funnier.

3678
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:33,170
But to think that there's something wrong
with them doing it to the point where

3679
01:49:33,171 --> 01:49:38,171
you're bringing that up instead
of a mass murder on a magazine,

3680
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,130
the shooting the,

3681
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:43,820
the cartoonists and did the
thing you want to discuss.

3682
01:49:43,821 --> 01:49:44,120
It's like,

3683
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,030
well those cartoons are really racist.

3684
01:49:46,031 --> 01:49:46,260
Yes.

3685
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:49,030
The merit of content has
nothing to do with it.

3686
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:51,470
It shouldn't even be
an issue or something.

3687
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:53,080
I don't even know why it was an issue.

3688
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:54,820
And I've,

3689
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:55,210
you know,

3690
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:57,010
there's this idea that it supposing,

3691
01:49:57,011 --> 01:49:57,191
you know,

3692
01:49:57,191 --> 01:50:00,860
we said that the cartoons were hate
speech and they were criticizing and

3693
01:50:00,861 --> 01:50:04,900
ideology that a lot of people found out
of the belief that a lot of people were

3694
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:08,920
very sensitive about or like a historical
or public figure who has been dead for

3695
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:09,521
a long time.

3696
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:10,354
And you know,

3697
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:11,650
the people are sensitive about.

3698
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,390
So supposing you had that,

3699
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,313
you know,

3700
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:15,483
again,

3701
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:16,620
sort of a,

3702
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,360
even the competition there,

3703
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:18,640
you know,

3704
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,010
pull out the va,

3705
01:50:20,011 --> 01:50:21,460
they used to lampoon religions,

3706
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,751
all the religions.

3707
01:50:22,751 --> 01:50:23,584
It wasn't just own.

3708
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:24,131
So,

3709
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:24,520
you know,

3710
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:25,353
pull out the bible,

3711
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,020
pull out the chron,

3712
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:31,020
opened it up to certain things
and there's more hate speech.

3713
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:34,930
And those books then there could ever
be in the charlie hebdo cartoons,

3714
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,423
like there's the,

3715
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,470
if you're talking about
incitement to violence,

3716
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:39,430
you know,

3717
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:41,170
killing infidels apostates,

3718
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:41,741
you know,

3719
01:50:41,741 --> 01:50:44,920
go to deuteronomy and if
you go to deuteronomy 20,

3720
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:45,910
um,

3721
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:47,890
and you read it reads
like an isis rule book,

3722
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,330
it says,

3723
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:49,691
it says,

3724
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:49,870
you know,

3725
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:50,710
go into the land,

3726
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:51,190
you know,

3727
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:54,820
take the sword to all of the men that you
can take the women and the children as

3728
01:50:54,821 --> 01:50:55,271
slaves.

3729
01:50:55,271 --> 01:50:55,421
I mean,

3730
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:56,890
tHat's exactly what it says.

3731
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:58,210
And then in the quran,

3732
01:50:58,211 --> 01:50:58,751
47,

3733
01:50:58,751 --> 01:50:59,051
three,

3734
01:50:59,051 --> 01:51:00,100
it says the exact same thing.

3735
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,750
Well why is it then,

3736
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:06,751
what is it about radical islam where they
don't just have that written but take

3737
01:51:07,901 --> 01:51:10,180
that and use it in the form of practice.

3738
01:51:10,181 --> 01:51:12,820
Whereas radical christian fundamentalist,

3739
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:15,220
very rarely go out and kill gays.

3740
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,540
So very rarely,

3741
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:17,530
you know.

3742
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:17,741
YeaH.

3743
01:51:17,741 --> 01:51:21,670
They did do it for a long time
at one point session during.

3744
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:21,971
Yeah.

3745
01:51:21,971 --> 01:51:22,540
So they did.

3746
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:23,170
So it was,

3747
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:25,240
it was during that time
that they did do it.

3748
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:26,470
And there is a response.

3749
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:28,030
A lot of times when you talk about islam,

3750
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:29,920
when you criticize islam as well,

3751
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:31,900
christianity had its dark ages to,

3752
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:32,380
you know,

3753
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:33,220
several centuries ago,

3754
01:51:33,221 --> 01:51:33,461
I'm like,

3755
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:33,641
yeah,

3756
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:36,490
and how would you have reacted
when that was happening?

3757
01:51:36,491 --> 01:51:40,240
then that's the same way you have to
approach what's happening now with this

3758
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:41,980
song because you know they're
going through the same thing.

3759
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:44,320
The books are really not that different.

3760
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,720
Like the new testament's a little nicer,

3761
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,020
like in the new testament that all
the torture begins after you die.

3762
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:53,890
It's like the old testament's
only during your life occur on.

3763
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:54,724
It's a bit of both.

3764
01:51:54,990 --> 01:51:55,360
Uh,

3765
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:55,841
but well,

3766
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:58,210
how did christianity rise above,

3767
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:02,770
how did they get past that
into this lesser retarded
stage that they're at right

3768
01:52:02,771 --> 01:52:03,220
now?

3769
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:05,480
Secularism separating religion and state.

3770
01:52:05,481 --> 01:52:09,130
So the good thing about secularism is
that it allows freedom of religion is the

3771
01:52:09,131 --> 01:52:14,131
only system that allows every religion
to really openly the complete religious

3772
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:17,080
freedom for everybody.

3773
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:18,401
But at the same time,

3774
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:19,930
it separates that from politics.

3775
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:23,700
So it allows us to some
of coexistence and um,

3776
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:25,173
I kind of,

3777
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:28,480
I always think that there's
several steps to enlightenment.

3778
01:52:28,481 --> 01:52:29,110
I mean,

3779
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:32,020
for me and lightened mid would be if
nobody had any religious beliefs at all,

3780
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:33,880
everybody was just kind
of operating rationally.

3781
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:34,750
That would be very nice.

3782
01:52:35,210 --> 01:52:36,340
Hasn't happened anywhere yet.

3783
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,960
But I would say that,

3784
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:38,141
you know,

3785
01:52:38,141 --> 01:52:40,930
you'd have a reformation
and after the reformation,

3786
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:41,051
you know,

3787
01:52:41,051 --> 01:52:44,950
that would get you to secularism where
you separate religion and state and then

3788
01:52:44,951 --> 01:52:45,860
you move to a point where,

3789
01:52:45,861 --> 01:52:46,011
you know,

3790
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:49,670
people can actually have that conversation
and they can reject irrational

3791
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:50,504
beliefs entirely.

3792
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,590
But the step before reformation
nor to have a reformation,

3793
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:55,610
you have to,

3794
01:52:55,611 --> 01:52:56,340
uh,

3795
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:56,720
uh,

3796
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:57,860
especially in the muslim world,

3797
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,700
you have to reject the idea of
scriptural than there and see,

3798
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:01,680
you know,

3799
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,070
have to stop taking the quran.

3800
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:05,190
Literally not,

3801
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:08,300
not just justifying the
stuff that's in there saying,

3802
01:53:08,301 --> 01:53:08,700
okay,

3803
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:09,060
you know,

3804
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:09,831
there's this in here.

3805
01:53:09,831 --> 01:53:10,910
We don't believe that anymore.

3806
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:11,900
Um,

3807
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,210
and stop thinking that it's
the literal word of god,

3808
01:53:14,211 --> 01:53:15,410
which is a very tough thing to do.

3809
01:53:15,411 --> 01:53:16,100
But,

3810
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:16,670
um,

3811
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:16,850
well,

3812
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:18,580
it's what,

3813
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,020
what becomes the basis
of your ideology then?

3814
01:53:22,021 --> 01:53:24,830
And it seems like people want an ideology.

3815
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:29,420
They want to have some sort of a very
rigid set of rules and patterns of

3816
01:53:29,421 --> 01:53:31,580
behavior that they're expected to follow.

3817
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,010
And if those aren't coming from
god and they're coming from men,

3818
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,960
if they're coming from man,

3819
01:53:35,961 --> 01:53:37,100
they're open to dispute.

3820
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:39,050
And that becomes the issue
with a lot of people.

3821
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:43,790
So much so that they're willing to accept
these ideas that were written down,

3822
01:53:43,791 --> 01:53:46,280
that are preposterous if propose today,

3823
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:50,510
like the ancient writings
and stories from the bible,

3824
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:51,530
from the old testament,

3825
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:56,531
especially if you try to say today that
you found a book and that this book was

3826
01:53:57,471 --> 01:53:58,880
written last week by god.

3827
01:53:59,210 --> 01:53:59,760
And uh,

3828
01:53:59,760 --> 01:53:59,980
he,

3829
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:01,250
he wanted me to read it to you.

3830
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:01,761
And uh,

3831
01:54:01,761 --> 01:54:04,160
apparently fuck all these scientists.

3832
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,950
There was actually just two people's,

3833
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:06,561
adam and eve.

3834
01:54:06,561 --> 01:54:07,670
And that's where people came from.

3835
01:54:07,671 --> 01:54:09,410
An eve actually came from adam's riB.

3836
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:11,780
So that bitches super lucky,

3837
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:15,320
she fucked up the whole thing because
she talked to the snake and she ate an

3838
01:54:15,321 --> 01:54:17,120
apple and the snake told her,

3839
01:54:17,121 --> 01:54:17,631
eat the apple.

3840
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:18,021
But everybody,

3841
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:18,501
god said,

3842
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:19,340
don't eat the apple.

3843
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,270
she ate the snake.

3844
01:54:20,271 --> 01:54:23,680
And so because that we're fucked and
they realized they were naked and that

3845
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:24,051
people go,

3846
01:54:24,051 --> 01:54:24,221
whoa,

3847
01:54:24,221 --> 01:54:24,351
whoa,

3848
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:24,501
whoa,

3849
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:24,711
whoa,

3850
01:54:24,711 --> 01:54:25,190
whoa.

3851
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:27,270
Shut the fuck up outta here.

3852
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:28,161
Let's just stop it.

3853
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:28,330
Right?

3854
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:29,031
Let's get outta here,

3855
01:54:29,031 --> 01:54:29,510
dummy.

3856
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:29,910
Wow.

3857
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,310
Who taught you about life?

3858
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,610
Let's see.

3859
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:32,221
That's when you,

3860
01:54:32,221 --> 01:54:34,530
when you say all of
that stuff and you know.

3861
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:35,403
And,

3862
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:35,930
and,

3863
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:38,790
and when we were talking about
mormonism in scientology earlier,

3864
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:39,391
I mean,

3865
01:54:39,391 --> 01:54:42,670
this stuff sounds so much more
insane than mormonism and scientific.

3866
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,820
It's right up there.

3867
01:54:43,821 --> 01:54:44,061
Well,

3868
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:46,330
the scientologists tufts
pretty fucking insane.

3869
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:46,820
That's,

3870
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,690
that is pretty insane.

3871
01:54:47,691 --> 01:54:50,460
But the whole thing about
the theat tins and the,

3872
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:50,751
you know,

3873
01:54:50,751 --> 01:54:53,780
you're fucking from a
volcano or some shit.

3874
01:54:53,781 --> 01:54:55,820
They dropped your soul cases really.

3875
01:54:55,821 --> 01:54:56,654
I mean this is,

3876
01:54:56,660 --> 01:54:59,420
this stuff is just as bad.

3877
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:02,420
It's all obviously fiction,

3878
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:04,460
all obviously fiction.

3879
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:09,490
And the more we become illuminated about
the actual true nature of matter of

3880
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:11,990
biological life,

3881
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:15,200
the process of adams and the,

3882
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:17,210
the subatomic particles.

3883
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:20,840
And when we get deeper and deeper into
the very nature of reality itself,

3884
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,160
the more we can explain,

3885
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:26,090
the less religion becomes valid and
the more it becomes pretty obvious that

3886
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:29,750
someone in a very distant time where
there was no science and there was no,

3887
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:34,100
there was no base of knowledge where it
had been accumulated over thousands of

3888
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:37,040
years of people slowly but
surely measuring things
and figuring things out and

3889
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:41,600
coming up with newer and better ways to
measure things that were based on the

3890
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:43,260
discoveries of people before them.

3891
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,093
And we're all,

3892
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:48,240
all of us mean the reason why we celebrate
guys like isaac newton or darwin is

3893
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:53,010
because we've all piggybacked on their
discoveries and learned more in every

3894
01:55:53,011 --> 01:55:54,680
scientist and every biologist,

3895
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:57,030
every anthropologists has dug up bones.

3896
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:01,050
WE've added another little piece to this
puzzle that's constantly evolving and

3897
01:56:01,051 --> 01:56:02,100
growing and changing.

3898
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:04,870
And then something like
religion comes along that says,

3899
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:06,690
stop all this fucking learning.

3900
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,003
Cut it out.

3901
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:13,120
I mean the very idea of it
is anti progress because
you're supposed to rely on

3902
01:56:13,441 --> 01:56:14,040
some old,

3903
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:14,940
ancient shit.

3904
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:20,130
It's like going back to when galileo was
imprisoned or copernicus was chastised

3905
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:22,140
going back to when these people were were,

3906
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:27,141
were thought of as enemies of god because
they had these crazy ideas that we

3907
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:31,620
today except as fact measurable fact,

3908
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:33,920
undeniable fact they work

3909
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:36,580
and that it's also the process.

3910
01:56:36,581 --> 01:56:36,980
I meAn the,

3911
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:39,220
the what's at the heart of religion,

3912
01:56:39,221 --> 01:56:42,400
his infallibility like the idea that,

3913
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:42,680
you know,

3914
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:43,513
this,

3915
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:46,000
this can't change that immutable.

3916
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:47,710
So infallibility,

3917
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:49,660
on the other hand with science,

3918
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:54,780
the heart of a scientific
inquiry is falsifiability,

3919
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:56,463
which means,

3920
01:56:56,530 --> 01:56:57,080
you know,

3921
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,950
just the whole idea that you
start with the assumption that,

3922
01:56:59,951 --> 01:57:00,311
okay,

3923
01:57:00,311 --> 01:57:01,420
this could be wrong.

3924
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:03,000
How do I prove that it's right?

3925
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:04,233
You know,

3926
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:05,620
with faith it's different.

3927
01:57:05,621 --> 01:57:08,050
You start with the conclusion
you're left with is my conclusion.

3928
01:57:08,051 --> 01:57:10,990
I don't need evidence for it and I'm
going to work backwards and see what I can

3929
01:57:10,991 --> 01:57:12,130
do to strengthen my belief.

3930
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:12,551
You know,

3931
01:57:12,551 --> 01:57:13,070
it's,

3932
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:15,340
it's two completely different dynamics.

3933
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:16,443
So

3934
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,710
yeah,

3935
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:18,071
I mean,

3936
01:57:18,071 --> 01:57:20,080
the idea that the two
of them can coincide,

3937
01:57:20,081 --> 01:57:23,200
it seems less and less
viable as time goes on.

3938
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,850
the basics are the one that
when you look at the basics,

3939
01:57:26,851 --> 01:57:27,450
uh,

3940
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:28,470
the way that they work,

3941
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,740
and it also seems like as time goes on,

3942
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:34,460
because of these ideas being
less and less compatible,

3943
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,210
the opposing factions,

3944
01:57:36,450 --> 01:57:40,350
science and religion are more
vehemently opposed to each other.

3945
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:45,430
They're more aggressive about their
deniaL or the more aggressive about their

3946
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:51,520
non accepting of these fundamentalist
ideas that scientists today are more

3947
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:57,060
aggressive about their ideas that
atheism is the way to go and that these

3948
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,290
religious fundamentalists ideas
that are being pushed on people are,

3949
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:01,830
you know,

3950
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:06,830
a form of ideological poison they fuck
with the mind because they give the mind

3951
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,000
these very rigid patterns that
you're expected to adhere,

3952
01:58:12,001 --> 01:58:12,570
to,

3953
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:13,403
conform to.

3954
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:14,730
And if you do not,

3955
01:58:14,940 --> 01:58:16,110
I mean the idea of like,

3956
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:18,480
if you don't believe or
you fall out of faith,

3957
01:58:18,481 --> 01:58:18,850
you should.

3958
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:20,340
You're supposed to have your head removed.

3959
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,140
I mean that should tell you right there.

3960
01:58:22,141 --> 01:58:22,430
what is,

3961
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:23,101
where do you think,

3962
01:58:23,101 --> 01:58:25,650
you think with your fucking head
while you've been thinking too much.

3963
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:27,210
So we're going to cut
your fucking head off.

3964
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:31,740
You don't think you need to abide by
this shit that was written down on

3965
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:36,030
parchment back when they thought the
world was flat and the sun was 17 miles

3966
01:58:36,031 --> 01:58:36,780
away.

3967
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:41,040
That's what you need to abide by because
otherwise you're going to fuck up

3968
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:42,003
party.

3969
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:42,710
Yeah.

3970
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:46,960
Does it kind of brings you back to the
whole community thing that I think a lot

3971
01:58:46,961 --> 01:58:47,321
of people,

3972
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:52,321
they want that identification and they
want that sense of identity and group

3973
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:54,250
identity that religion gives them.

3974
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:54,580
They,

3975
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:57,460
they needed so much that
that's why they take.

3976
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,520
I'm just attacks on their ideology
personally cheer when there's reprisal for

3977
01:59:04,511 --> 01:59:05,344
these attacks,

3978
01:59:05,710 --> 01:59:06,810
these verbal attacks on there.

3979
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:10,810
I mean there's people that cheered
when those guys were murdered.

3980
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:15,190
Those people that cheered
all in a where I grew up,

3981
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:16,780
people used to celebrate it all the time.

3982
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,790
I mean like educated people,

3983
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:23,290
they wouldn't say it to like within our
own living room we were sitting there

3984
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:23,710
are,

3985
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:24,010
you know,

3986
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,200
educated uncles and aunts who had,

3987
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:26,950
you know,

3988
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:29,440
been overseas and they'd studied overseas.

3989
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:30,041
They came back,

3990
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:30,281
you know,

3991
01:59:30,281 --> 01:59:33,430
when something like nine slash
11 would happen or you know,

3992
01:59:33,431 --> 01:59:35,170
any kind of attack against
America would happen.

3993
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:36,190
Even civilians,

3994
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:36,750
you know,

3995
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:38,020
be completely supportive of it,

3996
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,490
but you know,

3997
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:44,020
when they'd go out and they talked
to their white friends and be like,

3998
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:44,231
you know,

3999
01:59:44,231 --> 01:59:44,381
yeah,

4000
01:59:44,381 --> 01:59:45,071
this is terrible.

4001
01:59:45,071 --> 01:59:45,904
We condemn it.

4002
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:46,631
There are,

4003
01:59:46,631 --> 01:59:49,900
there are root causes far do we should
understand what their legitimate

4004
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:52,000
grievances are and why they did it.

4005
01:59:52,001 --> 01:59:53,530
But that doesn't justify the murder.

4006
01:59:53,740 --> 01:59:56,740
But alone in your house they
will tell a lot of times.

4007
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:57,623
Yeah.

4008
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:58,420
Fortunately,

4009
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:00,160
not particularly in my house,

4010
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:01,930
but extended family,

4011
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,411
family,

4012
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:02,801
friends.

4013
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:04,480
I mean just on a daily basis,

4014
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,620
we're surrounded by it.

4015
02:00:05,621 --> 02:00:08,350
I mean when the [inaudible] came down,

4016
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,723
um,

4017
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:10,001
you know,

4018
02:00:10,001 --> 02:00:12,070
a lot of my extended family,

4019
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:13,030
a lot of my friends,

4020
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,140
you know,

4021
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,580
teachers at school and everything,

4022
02:00:15,581 --> 02:00:15,761
they,

4023
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:17,050
they all supported it.

4024
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:18,813
Yeah.

4025
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:21,430
There was a guy who wrote a book,

4026
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:23,140
not even a good book.

4027
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:24,460
Yeah.

4028
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:25,151
He was never,

4029
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:26,440
I've never been able to read it.

4030
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:29,350
Like I liked it and I've
read some of his stuff,

4031
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:31,150
but satanic verses just couldn't.

4032
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:33,070
It's just really dense and I can't,

4033
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:33,880
uh,

4034
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,420
can't.

4035
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:35,650
It's not interesting.

4036
02:00:36,150 --> 02:00:36,530
It just,

4037
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:37,363
yeah,

4038
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:39,070
it takes a lot of focus,

4039
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:40,710
I think to really get through it.

4040
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:41,920
You need to sit down and really,

4041
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,870
well you need to be interested in it.

4042
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:45,810
But it's just bizarre because I mean,

4043
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,920
it's not even specifically about mohammed,

4044
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:48,191
right?

4045
02:00:48,191 --> 02:00:48,770
I meaN the,

4046
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:49,140
the,

4047
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:52,190
the autonomy versus sit down.

4048
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:53,211
It is kind of a,

4049
02:00:53,211 --> 02:00:54,460
It is about mohammed's life.

4050
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:58,570
Sort of the satanic verses where I
guess the way the qur'an was supposedly

4051
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:02,830
revealed was that mom had got
these revelations from above.

4052
02:01:03,250 --> 02:01:04,240
And um,

4053
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:09,570
at one point he got these
revelations that said that idolatry,

4054
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:10,890
certain elements of idolatry or,

4055
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:11,410
okay,

4056
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:12,910
it was like these three idol gods and,

4057
02:01:12,911 --> 02:01:13,151
you know,

4058
02:01:13,151 --> 02:01:13,391
okay,

4059
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:13,871
fine,

4060
02:01:13,871 --> 02:01:16,960
we can respect that or
people that follow them,

4061
02:01:16,961 --> 02:01:17,794
but they're okay.

4062
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,813
Um,

4063
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:20,080
and then later on he's like,

4064
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:20,261
no,

4065
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:20,350
no,

4066
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:21,430
that was satan talking to me.

4067
02:01:21,431 --> 02:01:22,264
It wasn't goD.

4068
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:24,160
So those were the satanic verses.

4069
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:29,790
So they didn't end up being part of
the koran and that's where some unrest.

4070
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,361
he got the idea.

4071
02:01:31,361 --> 02:01:32,171
So it was,

4072
02:01:32,171 --> 02:01:33,270
it was based on a,

4073
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:34,263
uh,

4074
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:38,080
on an actual documented piece
of sort of islamic history.

4075
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:39,740
And he did,

4076
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,540
he changed the name of mama and he had a
lot of similar elements was symbolic of

4077
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,021
his life,

4078
02:01:45,021 --> 02:01:45,550
but

4079
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:47,020
so because he changed the name,

4080
02:01:47,021 --> 02:01:48,250
he thought he was going to be okay.

4081
02:01:48,850 --> 02:01:49,001
Yeah,

4082
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,650
I mean he knew that it was a satire,

4083
02:01:50,651 --> 02:01:50,860
like,

4084
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:51,041
you know,

4085
02:01:51,041 --> 02:01:51,874
like animal farm,

4086
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:54,430
they use animals to
represent like real people.

4087
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:55,100
Right.

4088
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:55,380
Um,

4089
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:56,340
so he did this,

4090
02:01:56,341 --> 02:01:58,230
he had fictional characters then,

4091
02:01:58,231 --> 02:01:58,440
you know,

4092
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,700
the sort of different time settings

4093
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:03,010
and he thought it would be okay because
he had fictional characters because he

4094
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:04,550
mentioned mohammed by name.

4095
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,110
I,

4096
02:02:05,110 --> 02:02:05,660
I don't,

4097
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:07,790
I don't know if he
thought it would be okay.

4098
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:08,624
I knew.

4099
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:09,663
I mean I think

4100
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:12,740
he knew that there would be some backlash.

4101
02:02:12,741 --> 02:02:14,000
I didn't think at that time.

4102
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:17,000
I'm not sure if he really thought that
he would have to go under a heading.

4103
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:18,480
Probably would've never wrote it.

4104
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:19,830
I mean,

4105
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:21,180
what is he okay.

4106
02:02:21,181 --> 02:02:23,100
Now is he allowed to just go anywhere now?

4107
02:02:23,101 --> 02:02:25,380
Like did they ever release?

4108
02:02:25,570 --> 02:02:26,820
I don't have him.

4109
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:28,980
I don't know if he travels
with armed security,

4110
02:02:28,981 --> 02:02:29,361
I mean I don't,

4111
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:30,240
I don't know him personally,

4112
02:02:30,241 --> 02:02:30,810
but

4113
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:31,171
he,

4114
02:02:31,171 --> 02:02:32,004
um,

4115
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:35,080
he does tend to do all the
talk shows and everything.

4116
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:37,860
He was really under hiding
in those first 10 years.

4117
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,740
And this is where the
spread the risk comes in.

4118
02:02:40,741 --> 02:02:45,540
I think there's so many people talking
about this stuff now that we're not in

4119
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:46,590
the rusty days anymore.

4120
02:02:48,090 --> 02:02:50,700
There's a lot of people who are
talking about or writing about it.

4121
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:52,200
It's all online.

4122
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:53,373
Um,

4123
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,110
so that process has started.

4124
02:02:55,111 --> 02:02:56,070
So in that way,

4125
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:56,370
you know,

4126
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:57,540
a little bit optimistic.

4127
02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:01,050
The fact that some honesty can really
show pathak joe's shows you see them

4128
02:03:01,051 --> 02:03:01,531
everywhere.

4129
02:03:01,531 --> 02:03:03,510
He does public speeches,

4130
02:03:03,511 --> 02:03:04,830
he does debates,

4131
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:05,410
you know,

4132
02:03:05,410 --> 02:03:08,680
I'm wonder what is like if he does like
the bill maher show when we're kind of

4133
02:03:08,681 --> 02:03:09,730
security they have.

4134
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:10,361
Yeah.

4135
02:03:10,361 --> 02:03:10,930
I don't know.

4136
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:11,763
I'm not sure.

4137
02:03:11,950 --> 02:03:14,170
I wouldn't want to see it in person.

4138
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:14,860
Yeah,

4139
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:15,490
because you know,

4140
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:17,620
you wouldn't want to be
there the day it goes down.

4141
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:19,631
Well,

4142
02:03:19,631 --> 02:03:20,010
you know,

4143
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:20,970
ion hirsi ali,

4144
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,270
she does travel to the orange.

4145
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:23,403
Yeah.

4146
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:24,960
Does she know that?

4147
02:03:24,961 --> 02:03:25,081
Yeah.

4148
02:03:25,081 --> 02:03:26,250
That's pretty well known.

4149
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:27,330
So she still does,

4150
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:29,213
Um,

4151
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:30,080
and it,

4152
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:30,390
it's,

4153
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,900
it's,

4154
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:35,790
it's actually tougher for women who
decide to change their mind about islam

4155
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:37,650
because uh,

4156
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:37,981
you know,

4157
02:03:37,981 --> 02:03:39,390
lIke with my girlfriend,

4158
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:42,270
she's also like a secular activists,

4159
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:46,350
but whenever anybody wants to send
me hate mail or hate messages,

4160
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:47,633
they'll always,

4161
02:03:47,810 --> 02:03:48,643
um,

4162
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:49,130
you know,

4163
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,270
sort of argue with me,

4164
02:03:51,570 --> 02:03:52,680
it'd be like into your bullshit.

4165
02:03:52,681 --> 02:03:53,461
Everything you're saying,

4166
02:03:53,461 --> 02:03:54,294
it sucks,

4167
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,000
you know,

4168
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,280
as you're going to go to hell or you know,

4169
02:03:56,281 --> 02:03:57,600
you should get your head chopped off,

4170
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,473
whatever it is,

4171
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:58,770
you know,

4172
02:03:58,770 --> 02:03:59,700
they'll say things like that.

4173
02:04:00,030 --> 02:04:00,870
But with her,

4174
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,270
it's always a sexual thing.

4175
02:04:03,271 --> 02:04:03,571
Like the,

4176
02:04:03,571 --> 02:04:04,800
the threats that you know,

4177
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:07,080
she gets are rape threats,

4178
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:07,921
rape threats,

4179
02:04:07,921 --> 02:04:08,754
you know,

4180
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:13,410
just all kinds of things that they would
do and she'll get hundreds of them.

4181
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:14,210
Like there's a lot.

4182
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:14,860
Hundreds.

4183
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:15,151
Yeah.

4184
02:04:15,151 --> 02:04:15,984
Hundreds.

4185
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:16,360
No.

4186
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:16,680
What,

4187
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,980
what do you do when you get those?

4188
02:04:17,981 --> 02:04:19,750
Do you report those to the fbi?

4189
02:04:19,751 --> 02:04:20,200
Do you,

4190
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:21,250
do you save them?

4191
02:04:21,251 --> 02:04:22,810
Do you document them like,

4192
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:23,170
yeah,

4193
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:25,000
we saved them and we do.

4194
02:04:25,001 --> 02:04:25,360
I mean,

4195
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:27,880
the hundreds that actuallY
happened in one incident.

4196
02:04:27,881 --> 02:04:28,210
It was,

4197
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:28,531
there's a,

4198
02:04:28,531 --> 02:04:33,531
there's a politician in Pakistan who she
knows personally and who has been sort

4199
02:04:34,751 --> 02:04:39,751
of a very vocal in his opposition to
the taliban and she just said that she

4200
02:04:40,111 --> 02:04:40,944
supports him,

4201
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:41,580
right?

4202
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:46,580
And just because of that and because
he is under a lot of threat targets and

4203
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:48,000
then she had some argument,

4204
02:04:48,070 --> 02:04:48,420
some,

4205
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:51,250
some of the people who oppose him and uh,

4206
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:55,320
then the rape threats started
coming in and so at that point,

4207
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:55,501
you know,

4208
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:56,340
we would report it.

4209
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:58,440
So we will report things like that.

4210
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:01,230
I can't talk too much about what happened,

4211
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,673
um,

4212
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:07,920
but most of the time they come from
overseas and some kids sitting in villages

4213
02:05:07,921 --> 02:05:11,640
and over the laptop or a
cell phone and sending frets.

4214
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:12,511
So,

4215
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:12,780
but,

4216
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:13,021
you know,

4217
02:05:13,021 --> 02:05:14,760
there's always a chance to have
one or two of them are real.

4218
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:16,200
And this is obviously a real issue.

4219
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,473
Um,

4220
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:19,590
but it is just generally,

4221
02:05:19,591 --> 02:05:23,700
it's a lot worse for women than it
is for men because there's this idea,

4222
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:26,490
especially among conservative cultures.

4223
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:27,330
Um,

4224
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:27,851
and uh,

4225
02:05:27,851 --> 02:05:30,090
a lot of the muslim culture is that,

4226
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:30,360
uh,

4227
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,180
if,

4228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:31,460
if,

4229
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:34,560
if a man decides not to follow religion,

4230
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:35,281
you know,

4231
02:05:35,281 --> 02:05:36,120
that's a separate thing,

4232
02:05:36,121 --> 02:05:37,920
but if a woman decides
not to follow religion,

4233
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:39,240
she's lost all morality.

4234
02:05:40,590 --> 02:05:41,640
So she'll do anything.

4235
02:05:41,670 --> 02:05:42,361
she'll drink,

4236
02:05:42,361 --> 02:05:43,091
she'll have sex.

4237
02:05:43,091 --> 02:05:44,130
You'll crazy bitch.

4238
02:05:44,131 --> 02:05:44,461
Absolutely.

4239
02:05:44,461 --> 02:05:44,551
Yeah,

4240
02:05:44,551 --> 02:05:45,110
exactly.

4241
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:47,270
Dare Sex.

4242
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:48,840
Just trying to be like an american.

4243
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:49,890
Exactly.

4244
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,630
Because that's how they measure morality.

4245
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:53,640
Like there is a lot of,

4246
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:57,720
a lot of the people who killed people
and they behead people and stuff.

4247
02:05:57,770 --> 02:05:58,860
They were really upset.

4248
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:00,360
Like when they talk about morality,

4249
02:06:00,361 --> 02:06:02,220
like lapsed western morality,

4250
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:04,430
they talk about chicks
and miniskirts drinks,

4251
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:05,970
sex and things like that.

4252
02:06:06,150 --> 02:06:07,600
Unbelievable while,

4253
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:08,140
but they,

4254
02:06:08,140 --> 02:06:11,910
they don't think of the murder and
the martyrdom and all those things are

4255
02:06:11,911 --> 02:06:12,600
virtuous.

4256
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,280
They actually think that
those things are good.

4257
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,800
So

4258
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,633
backwards.

4259
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:17,503
it's so,

4260
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:19,543
it's so,

4261
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:19,911
I mean,

4262
02:06:19,911 --> 02:06:20,721
the word archaic,

4263
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:21,441
I keep using it,

4264
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:22,910
but that really is the word.

4265
02:06:22,911 --> 02:06:23,171
It's,

4266
02:06:23,171 --> 02:06:26,540
it's such an ancient version
of thinking and this,

4267
02:06:26,541 --> 02:06:29,630
it's almost like an operating
system that's so outdated.

4268
02:06:29,631 --> 02:06:31,400
Like you're trying to fuck with das.

4269
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:32,750
Like you're trying to like,

4270
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:33,501
you know what I mean?

4271
02:06:33,501 --> 02:06:34,820
You're trying to like get on twitter,

4272
02:06:34,821 --> 02:06:36,110
but you're only using dos.

4273
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:41,470
It's like god damn the operating system
of fundamental religion is so fucking

4274
02:06:42,561 --> 02:06:43,394
broken.

4275
02:06:43,450 --> 02:06:46,680
I know and a lot of times they think
that they have the updated software.

4276
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:47,773
We have the most,

4277
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:49,350
we have the most recent relIgion,

4278
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:54,510
like islam came after christianity
came to after that we had this great

4279
02:06:54,511 --> 02:06:55,344
civilization.

4280
02:06:55,680 --> 02:07:00,680
So and in which they did at one point
and why are we in such bad shape?

4281
02:07:02,810 --> 02:07:03,700
I watched the world,

4282
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:05,691
sorry,

4283
02:07:05,691 --> 02:07:08,750
watch the speech once where
this guy was talking about,

4284
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:11,060
he was asking questions or the,

4285
02:07:11,061 --> 02:07:15,050
the audience was asking questions about
a certain aspects of islam and how do

4286
02:07:15,051 --> 02:07:16,490
they know whether,

4287
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:17,300
you know,

4288
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:20,360
if one religion says one
thing but islam says another.

4289
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:24,830
And his answer was it's very simple
because islam is the truth and everybody

4290
02:07:24,831 --> 02:07:25,491
starts clapping.

4291
02:07:25,491 --> 02:07:25,731
I'm like,

4292
02:07:25,731 --> 02:07:26,564
wow,

4293
02:07:27,170 --> 02:07:28,003
that's a,

4294
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:29,780
that's a,

4295
02:07:29,780 --> 02:07:31,010
that's hilarious.

4296
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:34,300
It's hilarious that somebody
should look into is ah,

4297
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:35,080
like,

4298
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,260
you know,

4299
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:35,630
there,

4300
02:07:35,630 --> 02:07:36,110
there

4301
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:37,240
is precedent for this.

4302
02:07:37,241 --> 02:07:37,381
Like,

4303
02:07:37,381 --> 02:07:37,590
you know,

4304
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:40,510
like we were talking about the holy
books around here and the holy books are

4305
02:07:40,511 --> 02:07:41,344
very similar.

4306
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:46,480
A lot of the stuff is like in the old
testament actually mentioned stoning to

4307
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:47,620
death.

4308
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:48,850
The crown doesn't even mention it.

4309
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:50,330
It's in the [inaudible],

4310
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:51,130
which is a separate,

4311
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:55,000
sort of like a lesser god
source of guidance and islam.

4312
02:07:55,390 --> 02:08:00,390
And so there's many things that are in
all of the scriptures that are pretty

4313
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:01,924
important.

4314
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:04,210
But how is it that,

4315
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:04,840
you know,

4316
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:07,600
jews and christians were
able to move past it.

4317
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:08,081
I mean,

4318
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:09,400
they had their dark ages too.

4319
02:08:09,401 --> 02:08:11,740
They did some really fucked
up shit at one point.

4320
02:08:12,090 --> 02:08:12,700
Um,

4321
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,530
but they moved past that
and they're here now.

4322
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:15,670
What is the answer to that?

4323
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:17,823
I think the,

4324
02:08:18,080 --> 02:08:22,210
and this is one of the things I'm
exploring my book and I think,

4325
02:08:22,211 --> 02:08:23,044
uh,

4326
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:23,953
like with,

4327
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,070
with,

4328
02:08:25,070 --> 02:08:26,560
with jews and with christians,

4329
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:31,090
that they were able to have a genuine
reformation where they're able to bond and

4330
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:34,870
come together on a sense of
community rather than ideology.

4331
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:35,501
Like,

4332
02:08:35,501 --> 02:08:35,651
you know,

4333
02:08:35,651 --> 02:08:35,980
if you're,

4334
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:36,820
if you're jewish,

4335
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:38,570
you can be an atheist jew,

4336
02:08:38,571 --> 02:08:39,640
you can be an agnostic jew,

4337
02:08:39,641 --> 02:08:40,630
you can be a secular jew,

4338
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:41,860
you can be an orthodox jew,

4339
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:43,150
but nobody's ever going to say,

4340
02:08:43,151 --> 02:08:43,301
okay,

4341
02:08:43,301 --> 02:08:44,350
you're not a junior anymore,

4342
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,273
right?

4343
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:45,971
You did this,

4344
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:47,440
you eat bacon or whatever.

4345
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:48,493
Um,

4346
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:49,383
with christians,

4347
02:08:49,420 --> 02:08:49,631
again,

4348
02:08:49,631 --> 02:08:50,560
we were taLking about the catholic,

4349
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:51,130
sorry,

4350
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:51,280
uh,

4351
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:51,551
the,

4352
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:52,384
uh,

4353
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:53,650
a lot of them pro choice,

4354
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:53,940
they'll,

4355
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:56,200
they'll that they'll still
end up going to church.

4356
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:57,760
But you can't be an atheist christian.

4357
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:00,880
You technically can't
be an atheist christian.

4358
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,930
Not even technically if you,

4359
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:05,080
if you tell christians
that you're an atheist,

4360
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:06,930
they'll look at you like
you just shit on a plate.

4361
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:08,261
Mean they,

4362
02:09:08,261 --> 02:09:12,190
they are not interested in hearing
that there's a strong faction of

4363
02:09:12,191 --> 02:09:13,030
christianity,

4364
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:15,440
fundamentalist faction
of christianity that it,

4365
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:20,590
they were incredibly upset at
the word atheist or atheist.

4366
02:09:20,780 --> 02:09:21,613
It's a very bad.

4367
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:24,620
I mean they actually think of
atheists this worse than rapists.

4368
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:29,640
I think I was reading that they had added
a data survey on how many or who you

4369
02:09:30,741 --> 02:09:31,311
despise.

4370
02:09:31,311 --> 02:09:33,790
Most people actually
think atheists are worse.

4371
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:34,633
Worsened rapist.

4372
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:35,780
So you have.

4373
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,651
But at the same time,

4374
02:09:36,651 --> 02:09:37,484
you don't get,

4375
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:39,480
you don't get murdered,

4376
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:40,290
so you don't get murdered.

4377
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:43,460
You don't even get excommunicated from
the community as you used condoms.

4378
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,900
Like no one's going to say,

4379
02:09:44,901 --> 02:09:45,420
okay,

4380
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:46,460
you use birth control,

4381
02:09:46,461 --> 02:09:48,080
so you're not a catholic anymore.

4382
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:50,060
But with islam,

4383
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:50,990
it's still,

4384
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:53,540
a lot of muslims are still in that.

4385
02:09:53,541 --> 02:09:55,070
you can sit 10 people down.

4386
02:09:55,071 --> 02:09:56,400
One of them's gonna say music's ascend,

4387
02:09:56,540 --> 02:09:58,190
another one's going to say
you got to cover your head,

4388
02:09:58,550 --> 02:09:59,090
um,

4389
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:02,330
and you'll have all these
different viewpoints and they'll,

4390
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,460
there's going to be
fragmentation based on that.

4391
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:06,590
But if they are able to come around,

4392
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:07,200
if they,

4393
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,840
if they're able to focus instead on,

4394
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:11,450
instead of the ideology
focused on the community,

4395
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:11,810
you know,

4396
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:13,910
we were saying that the identity of,

4397
02:10:13,911 --> 02:10:14,091
you know,

4398
02:10:14,091 --> 02:10:14,811
going to church,

4399
02:10:14,811 --> 02:10:14,991
you know,

4400
02:10:14,991 --> 02:10:19,991
having your own family and friends and
that sort of communal atmosphere that a

4401
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:24,140
religious belonging to a
religious group gives you.

4402
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:25,190
Which is a benefit

4403
02:10:25,570 --> 02:10:26,381
for a lot of people.

4404
02:10:26,381 --> 02:10:26,880
That mean that,

4405
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:31,880
that sense of community is so huge for a
comfort to people providing people with

4406
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:33,461
this,

4407
02:10:33,461 --> 02:10:33,890
uh,

4408
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:38,890
this group that they can rely upon and
they feel connected to and joined with.

4409
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:41,540
There's a lot of benefit to them.

4410
02:10:42,030 --> 02:10:47,030
The idea that it has to be attached
to some archaic belief system to some

4411
02:10:47,511 --> 02:10:52,160
ridiculous old shit that was written
down when people had a very poor

4412
02:10:52,161 --> 02:10:53,900
understanding of reality,

4413
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:55,220
very poor.

4414
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,390
Like,

4415
02:10:56,390 --> 02:11:01,390
and that's what's really bizarre about
the islamic religion is that at one point

4416
02:11:01,761 --> 02:11:02,271
in time,

4417
02:11:02,271 --> 02:11:02,511
you know,

4418
02:11:02,511 --> 02:11:03,344
in the early,

4419
02:11:03,630 --> 02:11:04,463
you know,

4420
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:09,530
just like the 12 hundreds and before
islam was at the forefront of science and

4421
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:11,900
philosophy and writing.

4422
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:15,170
I mean it was one of the islamic world.

4423
02:11:15,171 --> 02:11:19,370
The muslim world was one of the
more advanced cultures on earth.

4424
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:21,500
And it wasn't really an,

4425
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:21,871
again,

4426
02:11:21,871 --> 02:11:22,520
this,

4427
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,020
this is where we make that
distinction between islam,

4428
02:11:25,021 --> 02:11:27,480
the religion and the muslims followed it.

4429
02:11:27,481 --> 02:11:29,730
And a lot of this was done
by the matassa lights,

4430
02:11:29,731 --> 02:11:32,190
which is very sort of a openminded.

4431
02:11:32,540 --> 02:11:36,420
I'm very progressive sect of muslims,

4432
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,230
you know,

4433
02:11:37,230 --> 02:11:42,230
and a lot of those thiNgs happened
not because of islam but despite it.

4434
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,340
Even baCk then.

4435
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:44,620
Yeah.

4436
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:45,271
Even back then,

4437
02:11:45,271 --> 02:11:46,170
it's always been like that.

4438
02:11:46,171 --> 02:11:46,351
I mean,

4439
02:11:46,351 --> 02:11:49,580
newton was a religious christian
because you'd had the time.

4440
02:11:49,590 --> 02:11:50,790
It was like a virgin though too.

4441
02:11:50,791 --> 02:11:51,870
Wasn't even really weird.

4442
02:11:52,150 --> 02:11:52,290
Uh,

4443
02:11:52,290 --> 02:11:52,531
yeah,

4444
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:52,950
he was a,

4445
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:53,730
he was a virgin.

4446
02:11:53,730 --> 02:11:55,640
He didn't like,

4447
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,330
there was no evolution.

4448
02:11:57,331 --> 02:11:58,680
Like nobody knew about evolution.

4449
02:11:58,681 --> 02:12:00,030
It was pre darwin and everything.

4450
02:12:00,031 --> 02:12:02,790
So this is a lot of things he
didn't know if he had known,

4451
02:12:02,791 --> 02:12:04,030
he may not have been a,

4452
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:05,460
we can't speculate on that,

4453
02:12:05,461 --> 02:12:06,210
but I mean he was,

4454
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:11,210
he was a religious christian but we don't
identify his achievements as christian

4455
02:12:11,731 --> 02:12:12,564
achievements.

4456
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:14,340
We don't identify.

4457
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:18,990
I'm like albert einstein's achievements
as somethinG at the stewart and he

4458
02:12:18,991 --> 02:12:20,410
wasn't even albert einstein.

4459
02:12:20,411 --> 02:12:21,300
It wasn't even reliGious.

4460
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,200
So,

4461
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,033
um,

4462
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,400
but so with this,

4463
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:27,390
the fact that there were muslims in a
certain part of the world that we're

4464
02:12:27,391 --> 02:12:28,550
engaging in,

4465
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:29,560
you know,

4466
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:33,390
a lot of scientific inquiry and they
were really moving forward and there were

4467
02:12:33,391 --> 02:12:35,610
being progressive and they're
making new discoveries.

4468
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:39,900
Know this is something that is more of a,

4469
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:45,290
it's a more of a testament to science
and to free thinking than it is to the

4470
02:12:46,351 --> 02:12:47,190
religion itself.

4471
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,580
They just seem to be muslims
that's similar to the fact that

4472
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:52,221
darwin,

4473
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:56,020
when he was proposing use theories that
predominant scientific community was

4474
02:12:56,030 --> 02:13:01,030
christian [inaudible] most of the
people that he told his ideas to were in

4475
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:06,131
opposition of these ideas
initially because it went
opposite of their christian

4476
02:13:06,231 --> 02:13:06,770
beliefs.

4477
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:06,940
Like,

4478
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:07,490
yeah,

4479
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:12,490
we think of scientists today as being
almost universally secular or at least the

4480
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:15,320
ones that we pay attention to and respect.

4481
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:20,150
We think of them as having at the
very least an agnostic religious base.

4482
02:13:20,390 --> 02:13:22,550
But back then there were predominantly

4483
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:23,350
christian.

4484
02:13:23,350 --> 02:13:23,561
Yeah,

4485
02:13:23,561 --> 02:13:24,160
a lot of them.

4486
02:13:24,160 --> 02:13:27,730
They were in America and everywhere.

4487
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:32,940
And I think what we do is we sometimes
Look at it other way around when you

4488
02:13:33,481 --> 02:13:33,781
have,

4489
02:13:33,781 --> 02:13:35,670
when you had all that
scientific progress happening,

4490
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,833
um,

4491
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:40,080
in the sort of the golden age of muslims.

4492
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:41,263
Um,

4493
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:43,440
then that was happening again,

4494
02:13:43,441 --> 02:13:45,900
like it was happening despite
the fact that it was islam.

4495
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:47,700
Now when you have all of these,

4496
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:48,000
uh,

4497
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:48,833
all the terrorism,

4498
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:50,160
all these things happening,

4499
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:54,960
there's a direct relationship between
words in the scripture and what they're

4500
02:13:54,961 --> 02:13:55,710
doing.

4501
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,330
So what we do is now we say,

4502
02:13:57,331 --> 02:13:57,840
okay,

4503
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,010
just because they're muslims,

4504
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:00,660
they just happened to be muslim.

4505
02:14:00,661 --> 02:14:01,494
That's why they're doing it.

4506
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:04,680
But at that time we actually attributed
to islam when it's really the other way

4507
02:14:04,681 --> 02:14:05,514
around.

4508
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:07,020
Right.

4509
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:07,770
That makes sense.

4510
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:08,290
Like there's a,

4511
02:14:08,290 --> 02:14:11,210
there isn't anything in
the quran that had been.

4512
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:13,200
The crown says strange things,

4513
02:14:13,201 --> 02:14:17,340
just like any other holy
scripture in [inaudible] 86,

4514
02:14:17,870 --> 02:14:18,120
right?

4515
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:19,230
Verses five to seven,

4516
02:14:19,231 --> 02:14:24,231
it says that a man was created from a
fluid ejected between the backbone and the

4517
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:25,560
ribs.

4518
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:29,460
So essentially it's saying that semen
or sperm was created in the chest.

4519
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:30,061
You know,

4520
02:14:30,061 --> 02:14:32,220
this is like a backbone and the ribs,

4521
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:33,570
the backbone and the ribs.

4522
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:37,780
So 86 feeling the belly rent
could be looking at this room.

4523
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:38,480
Yeah,

4524
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,020
I mean you can broaden it and you can,

4525
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:41,670
you can try to just
select where your liver,

4526
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:44,850
the lower lower ribs if you think so.

4527
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:46,020
That could be.

4528
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:47,390
I think it's just the testes man.

4529
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:48,383
It couldn't be,

4530
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,410
so that seems like a
pretty vague the ribs.

4531
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:52,771
It's like,

4532
02:14:52,771 --> 02:14:52,981
yeah,

4533
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:54,930
it's like saying chicago is
in the western hemisphere,

4534
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:59,020
but you miss the western hemisphere
because this is really a,

4535
02:14:59,021 --> 02:14:59,854
you know,

4536
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:02,820
there's absolutely no scientific
basis to that whatsoever.

4537
02:15:02,890 --> 02:15:03,780
Just flat out wrong.

4538
02:15:04,210 --> 02:15:05,043
Um,

4539
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,360
but you know,

4540
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:07,223
they,

4541
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:10,710
so it doesn't have any set that
the koran doesn't necessarily.

4542
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:12,240
It's not conducive to,

4543
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:13,081
you know,

4544
02:15:13,081 --> 02:15:14,760
robust scientific inquiry.

4545
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:15,870
Right.

4546
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:18,210
But it is unfortunately linked,

4547
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:18,680
like,

4548
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:18,870
you know,

4549
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:20,460
the words of the current in the scripture,

4550
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:24,390
it is linked to a lot of the violence
that you see a lot of the subjugation of

4551
02:15:24,391 --> 02:15:25,320
women that you see.

4552
02:15:26,820 --> 02:15:30,540
And that connection is something
that should be acknowledged.

4553
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:31,800
That's islamophobic.

4554
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:32,753
How dare you.

4555
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:33,390
There you go.

4556
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:34,290
I'm a racist.

4557
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:34,921
You are,

4558
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:36,510
you're a racist against yourself.

4559
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:37,711
You son of a,

4560
02:15:37,711 --> 02:15:38,200
b.

4561
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:40,000
How and racist racist.

4562
02:15:40,001 --> 02:15:41,610
Just like gross as well.

4563
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:41,910
Yeah.

4564
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:43,110
I've been athletic.

4565
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:44,160
Oh yeah,

4566
02:15:44,161 --> 02:15:44,850
that's right.

4567
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:46,050
He was a silly boy.

4568
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,281
Yeah.

4569
02:15:47,281 --> 02:15:49,020
That ben affleck thing was pretty weird.

4570
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:49,380
Huh?

4571
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:50,160
[inaudible].

4572
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:54,600
I think he was just trying to get
brownie points though that on that show.

4573
02:15:54,601 --> 02:15:56,130
like the fact that that happened.

4574
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:56,530
It was,

4575
02:15:56,530 --> 02:15:59,160
there was such outrage everywhere,

4576
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:03,280
like I've just noticed that when someone
says something like that or if there's

4577
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,840
a curtain Burned or cartoons drawn,

4578
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,420
this is like a lot of outrage,

4579
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:11,480
but it just not the kind of thing you
see when people burn people alive or

4580
02:16:11,721 --> 02:16:12,554
something.

4581
02:16:12,570 --> 02:16:17,570
Then you get hashtags and when boko haram
like bulk around killing 2000 people,

4582
02:16:18,750 --> 02:16:20,060
kidnapping all those school girls,

4583
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:22,200
you get to hashtags and things.

4584
02:16:22,201 --> 02:16:24,960
You don't get the kind of outcry
that you get over cartoons.

4585
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:26,340
Yeah.

4586
02:16:26,340 --> 02:16:26,731
That will.

4587
02:16:26,731 --> 02:16:28,480
That was in africa too and you know,

4588
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:30,970
we have a of this going on over there.

4589
02:16:31,200 --> 02:16:31,380
No,

4590
02:16:31,380 --> 02:16:32,213
like dark floor.

4591
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:35,530
It's like 500,000 people
killed by an arab,

4592
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:36,041
the ga.

4593
02:16:36,041 --> 02:16:39,880
We'd militia and we could
go on and on and on forever,

4594
02:16:39,881 --> 02:16:40,390
right?

4595
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:40,811
Yeah,

4596
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:41,340
we could.

4597
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:42,173
Yeah.

4598
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:43,263
Let's see.

4599
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:44,710
Before I get too depressed,

4600
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:45,603
let's end this.

4601
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:46,150
Yeah.

4602
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:48,670
When will your book be available?

4603
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,381
Um,

4604
02:16:49,381 --> 02:16:53,400
I'm still working on it right now
where I'm in the middle of sort of like

4605
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:54,243
negotiating,

4606
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:55,720
like talking to publishers.

4607
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:57,460
So it's still happening.

4608
02:16:57,461 --> 02:16:58,060
It's a,

4609
02:16:58,060 --> 02:17:00,190
there's more interest in it
than I thought there would be.

4610
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:02,380
So it's a good thing.

4611
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:02,981
So I'm,

4612
02:17:02,981 --> 02:17:03,340
uh,

4613
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:04,173
I'm actually,

4614
02:17:04,330 --> 02:17:05,110
I'm looking forward to it.

4615
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:06,490
I think the timeline is probably,

4616
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:11,260
I would say about a year that's like my
personal goal will let me know when it's

4617
02:17:11,261 --> 02:17:12,110
done and it's out.

4618
02:17:12,111 --> 02:17:13,030
And let's do this again,

4619
02:17:13,031 --> 02:17:13,241
man.

4620
02:17:13,241 --> 02:17:13,781
This is great.

4621
02:17:13,781 --> 02:17:14,270
It'd be awesome.

4622
02:17:14,270 --> 02:17:15,700
Give people your twitter address.

4623
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:16,780

02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:27,590
A website you can just go.

4635
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:27,961
Go ahead.

4636

There's a lot of fun.

thank you.

4646
02:17:39,170 --> 02:17:40,003
I don't want to say fun.

4647
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:40,840
Stimulating,

4648
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:41,740
depressing at times,

4649
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:42,740
but at least it's.

4650
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:43,570
Yes.

4651
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:44,260
Very enlIghtening.

4652
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:47,020
Thank god I have a diagnosis
before you get into management.

4653
02:17:47,021 --> 02:17:49,150
a diagnosis is not the fun part.

4654
02:17:49,330 --> 02:17:49,870
Yeah,

4655
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:50,590

It's a tough situation.
