1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,860
Oh false swag five,
four,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,060
three,
two.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,440
Yes,
yes.

4
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,910
Ladies and gentlemen.
Yes,

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,363
we're here.
We,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm sorry we didn't go live earlier.
Folks tweeted it 20 minutes ago.

7
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:17,654
We just said a bunch of shit.
We could never talked to you about 

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,383
gossip.
A lot of it had to do with Dick's as 

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,900
usual course.
When shops on.

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,740
It's about Dick's.
Go do what you gotta do.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,050
Dixon gossip.
Speaking dicks.

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,490
That fucking thing.
You're driving around.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,280
You're driving around a kid's toy that 
the La.

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,600
It's so crazy,
Mr.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,170
fuck boy,
toy dude.

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,670
I was because I came straight from the 
airport.

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,200
Tell him what it is.
That's a slingshot.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,680
So it's uh,
there's,

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,450
you know,
it's a three wheeler,

20
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:54,860
so big two wheels in the front one the 
back.

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,200
It looks like Bruce Wayne's like,
yeah,

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,560
like batmobile,
like weird toy.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,360
It looks like you shouldn't be able to 
drive in the street.

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,260
You're like,
wait a minute,

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,000
how do you.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,890
You could just drive that around.
Quitting.

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,430
Know how does that work?
That's A.

28
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,990
is that a car?
Like what is that?

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,973
I don't know what it is,
but technically it's considered a 

30
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:12,920
motorcycle.
And you know,

31
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:13,880
I,
I have the helmet,

32
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:16,880
I wear the helmet sometimes kids,
if you're listening,

33
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,080
definitely wear a helmet when you have 
it.

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,333
But I was,
I parked at the airport because I don't 

35
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:25,321
want to park my,
a porsche parked at the airport and then

36
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,550
I uh,
I thought I have time to go home because

37
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,384
I land this morning from San Francisco,
don't have time to go home and change 

38
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,320
the cards out and then come here and you
know,

39
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,061
take a shower,
whatever.

40
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,530
But I didn't.
So I was like,

41
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:36,851
ah,
fuck.

42
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,920
I just struggle all the way down there.
Go on the four or five over the hill.

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,350
It's lovely though.

44
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,483
The wind in my face.
I got fucking eighties rock on this 

45
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:48,860
fucking.
I was feeling myself,

46
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,120
man.
I thought did.

47
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,163
I mean people are like me.
Like that's either the coolest guy I've 

48
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,790
ever seen.
The biggest tool.

49
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,640
It's like it hit me with your best shot.
I'm just fucking flying man.

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,533
That's hilarious.
You listening to Pat Benatar just wowed 

51
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,690
and Oh my God,
I love it man.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,730
Because again,
I would never get on a motorcycle,

53
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:15,800
but because this thing is so big,
so it's a little safer,

54
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,830
a little little sick.
It's because people can see it,

55
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,690
like most likely get fucked up.
Can't see it.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
That's a big part.
But this thing,

57
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,600
I mean when to my face I can see like 
everything meant like a car.

58
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,400
You're sewing clothes.
This I love it.

59
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,790
And the stick shift.
Like I feel like I'm one with the road.

60
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,710
Oh really?
Oh yeah.

61
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,340
Oh yeah,
that's better.

62
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,860
It isn't,
it isn't driving,

63
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,221
uh,
you feel.

64
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:42,770
I feel more like I said with the road,
I feel like,

65
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,630
uh,
like Paul Newman or some shit,

66
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,493
like a race car driver.
Especially with that thing that seems 

67
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
like the sweet spot between a motorcycle
and a car.

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,530
Exactly.
That's why it makes sense.

69
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:53,810
And the gas mileage on it is super 
beast.

70
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,650
It's awesome.
I'll probably weighs nothing right now.

71
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,760
Thing little engine in its fast.
But if your ways.

72
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,040
Can

73
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,780
you pick it up?
I don't know.

74
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,460
We should try after this.
Should I pick it up?

75
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,610
You and I can definitely pick it up if 
it weighs somewhere around like,

76
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,680
like a really light light car is 
supposed to be the most fun to drive,

77
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,370
let's say like a 19,
73 porsche because they're not,

78
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,150
they're not that powerful,
but they don't really need to be 1973.

79
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,010
Porsche has like 200 horsepower.
It's like,

80
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:21,844
wow,
there's a fast little car because they 

81
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:26,020
way you can get them down to like 1900 
pounds.

82
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,250
That's insane.
It might.

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,030
My Gt three is 3000 pounds,
so think of nuts.

84
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,960
So severity light.
That's why.

85
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,930
That's why when you're buying a porsche,
if you get the Targa,

86
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,610
there's so much heavier glass.
They're heavy,

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,453
heaviest,
fuck.

88
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,910
All that bullshit.
Look sick though.

89
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,460
They do look cool,
but I don't think they are.

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,760
Especially the old ones.
I don't think they're the most rigid.

91
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,983
I don't think they had that debt.
Like I used to have an NSX that had a 

92
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,930
target top.
What do you got to your 1700 years at?

93
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,140
You were saying Porsche.
Wow,

94
00:03:59,141 --> 00:03:59,974
that's light.
That's lighter than probably one of the 

95
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,290
lightest cars you could get.
Here's the stickler,

96
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,960
no airbags,
so if someone were to hit me,

97
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,920
that's no Bueno.
I live life on the edge though,

98
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,850
fellas.
Look at that thing.

99
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,400
She can do it that way.
Like having no airbags.

100
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,600
How does that work?
I'm not sure.

101
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,434
It's basically a motorcycle.
It's considered a motorcycle on the 

102
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,650
street,
but they say cops.

103
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,484
If they see you that a helmet,
they will pull you over and pound the 

104
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,210
car.
I just.

105
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,073
These things are so new.
They think I'm like some low budget 

106
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:30,100
alley cat,
Bruce Wayne or something like that.

107
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,850
They thumbs up past seven of them.
I mean if you don't have a helmet on.

108
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,010
Yeah,
and I go in Carpool.

109
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,020
I go in Carpool like an asshole just 
blaring eighties rockaway.

110
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,190
A carpool because it's a motorcycle.

111
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm like,
well classically it's a motorcycle.

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,393
Wow,
you could.

113
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,280
You could go into the Hov in that.
I'm not sure,

114
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,650
Joe.
There's really no rules.

115
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,290
I'm kind of no man's land right now,
so you can.

116
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,060
You're allowed to go in.
How funny is that?

117
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,310
You're allowed to go in the Carpool lane
and a fucking motorcycle.

118
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,280
That's the opposite of carpooling in it 
when it's so stupid,

119
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,990
like if you're carpooling on a 
motorcycle,

120
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,560
you putting somebody at risk corral.
If you get somebody on the back with you

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,470
soon.
Every time I see a guy on a motorcycle,

122
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,560
I see one person I see like,
well it's dangerous,

123
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,900
but it's gotten worse.
I see two people on a motorcycle.

124
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,040
I'll go,
well this is.

125
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,083
This is like exponentially more 
dangerous and usually it's his girl in 

126
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,980
the back with like she is daisy dukes on
or something.

127
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,940
Right,
and how much,

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,120
how good are you at adjusting with that 
extra 125 pounds in the back.

129
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,870
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

130
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,510
That extra hundred 25 pounds or whatever
she weighed one.

131
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,280
Let's go one for.
Let's make a real woman.

132
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,600
Let's say she's a hundred 50 pounds,
so if you get to 150 pounds behind you,

133
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,600
how good are you at correcting for that?
If you really practice that,

134
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,410
are you good in the moment when the shit
hits the fan?

135
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,420
Do you make good decisions?
Do you even know if you do?

136
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,463
I think it's one of those things where 
it doesn't matter if you're both on a 

137
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:50,434
motorcycle and you have daisy dukes on 
craft gives off fucked meat goes 

138
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,510
everywhere.
Super Meaty.

139
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,320
Oh,
just chunks of meat.

140
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,250
Hit the gravel

141
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
and rip apart and tear would go barefoot
and shorts,

142
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,280
no shirt riding a motorcycle and you can
do that in Colorado.

143
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,680
You didn't have to have a helmet.
I think Nevada has no helmet too.

144
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,540
It's a bunch of places like that.
Arizona,

145
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,374
no helmets.
I saw these dudes riding around and 

146
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,940
Harley Davidson's no helmet and I was 
like,

147
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,430
what kind of fear though?
Like for you to ride a motorcycle,

148
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,440
how are you going to tell them where to 
a helmet if they.

149
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,910
If,
if they don't want to wear one,

150
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,740
who gives a fuck?
Because that's the only thing that could

151
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:28,910
save their life.
I know,

152
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:30,620
but if they're on a motorcycle,
you know what I'm saying?

153
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:30,951
Like,
yeah,

154
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,784
whatever,
man,

155
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,890
this is how I like to live.
Well,

156
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,360
there's A.
There's an argument there,

157
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,070
man.
For sure.

158
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,903
I don't.
I don't think he should be able to tell 

159
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,084
people what to do,
but I think guidelines for young people 

160
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,174
are very,
very important because they make good 

161
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,600
point,
impulsive decisions and if you you could

162
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,530
protect more of them.

163
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,423
If you made a mandatory helmet law,
maybe you should say up to age 30 and 

164
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,674
over age 30.
You do it over the fucking why they do 

165
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,440
it because you can't have all those 
loopholes.

166
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,880
Kenya.
Yeah,

167
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,980
probably makes sense.
I think the reason why they do it,

168
00:06:57,981 --> 00:07:00,610
it's for insurance.
I think insurance policies don't.

169
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,400
They don't want to pay out for injuries 
and death and all that shit.

170
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,610
That's why they make seatbelt laws.
That's why they make helmet laws.

171
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,500
I don't really think it's to protect 
people.

172
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,530
I think protecting people as a 
consequence of protecting their money.

173
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,020
It makes sense.
Yeah.

174
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,790
Gross is that.
I'm pretty sure that's true though.

175
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,120
That's live.
So they realized how people,

176
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,090
how many people get injured and how much
they have to pay.

177
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,400
So they factored in and they say,
well,

178
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:28,280
just lobby for more protection in the 
car is more airbags,

179
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,160
airbags,
mandatory seatbelts,

180
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,070
all that different stuff.

181
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,880
Like a lot of that is really under the 
guise of protecting us.

182
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,340
It's really the protective insurance 
company's money.

183
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,690
It's nasty.
They say,

184
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,880
uh,
your,

185
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,803
your odds of getting a motorcycle 
accident your first year of owning a 

186
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,960
motorcycle or 99 percent.
Oh my God.

187
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,240
Ninety nine percent of people get in 
some sort of.

188
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,143
They wreck it.
They do something their first year of 

189
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,320
driving a motorcycle.
Wow.

190
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,590
That's why you don't buy a super fancy 
motorcycle your first year.

191
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,210
Do you ever see Dean Dale reading when 
he wiped?

192
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,670
No,
he wiped back when he's fat.

193
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,900
Dean Dean,
um,

194
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,800
got off sugar completely.
Really impressive.

195
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,780
Actually.
He was always,

196
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,600
it was never fat,
but he was a guy who was not taking care

197
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,280
of himself.
Sorry,

198
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,893
not going to the gym.
And he got real thick and he was on a 

199
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,720
motorcycle and some crazy meth head 
caught them off.

200
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
Some lady,
I might've been a stolen car.

201
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,870
It was something like super sketchy,
but she,

202
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,440
she crashed into him.
He wiped,

203
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:32,130
she never stopped and he just got tow up
all of his side,

204
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,950
his legs,
his arm.

205
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,710
He just got severely jacked.
Yeah,

206
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,300
there is.
God Damn.

207
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,790
Yeah.
Dean del Rey living life.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,833
There's a,
um,

209
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,260
there's a picture of the actual wound if
you could find it.

210
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,560
He put up the actual wound on his,
uh,

211
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,110
especially on his back inside.
It's really bad.

212
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,120
I mean he fucking.
I mean,

213
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,890
if I'm going to crash,
I want to be because of my error,

214
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,300
not some random lady not seeing me on 
meth.

215
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah,
it ain't.

216
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,210
No,
it's not in there.

217
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,830
It's a,
there's a picture of it.

218
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,660
Oh well the worst.
But anyway,

219
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,930
all that white shit all over his side.
Those bandages.

220
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,950
I mean,
that's how big the,

221
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,110
the fucking giant tear is.

222
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,213
It goes.
His skin is fucked up for a good solid 

223
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,420
foot and a half.
How funny is this?

224
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,940
And so in the NFL,
NBA,

225
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,810
Nhl motorcycles are illegal.
Once you sign that contract,

226
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:28,410
you cannot drive a motorcycle.
I'm sure there's guys that have them,

227
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,380
but legally it will void your contract 
with the UFC.

228
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,560
You can win a motorcycle.
They give you motorcycles.

229
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,600
That's because of the deal with Harley.
I get it.

230
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,740
And Weird.
Yeah.

231
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,940
Well they're also like,
I don't know.

232
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,540
I mean you got to think of who was 
running the UFC.

233
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,760
Right?
It was owned by two guys,

234
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,990
the fertittas that were independently 
map,

235
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:47,824
very,
very wealthy already and very wise 

236
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,490
business and they were fans,
so they just decided,

237
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,360
fuck this,
let's just try it.

238
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,060
Let's try and make this work.
Try to make it real.

239
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,703
They hired Dana fucking white to be the 
president who was crazy and it all 

240
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:03,030
worked.

241
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,160
It was going to give away.
It was like said.

242
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,580
It's great.
It's great.

243
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,310
Like his craziness is part of the reason
why it's so appealing.

244
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,130
Like when Oscar de la Hoya was talking 
shit about the mayweather,

245
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,360
Mcgregor fight and he and he goes,
well,

246
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,280
he was like,
lol.

247
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,210
Is this guy sniffing coke again?
I love that.

248
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,910
Such a,
such a role.

249
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,320
He didn't need to even go into the cross
dressing.

250
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,540
No.
Yeah,

251
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,520
you're right.
Jack could coulda gotten nasty came with

252
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,770
that,
the sniffing coke.

253
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:36,771
A lot of people don't come,
but don't tell him,

254
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,010
don't make us make the UFC with the 
whatever.

255
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:41,844
10 million followers,
blast a picture in high heels and went 

256
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,744
out without him having to do it because 
if it's an obvious second thing and you 

257
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,040
say the first thing and be real mild,
everybody else would pick up the slack,

258
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,580
I assume.
Did you see a dose?

259
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,460
Dos?
Yeah.

260
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,300
At dose.
Back to see it.

261
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,310
The graphic he made of triple g Canelo 
and Osceola was in the middle as a cross

262
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,254
dresser.

263
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,150
He didn't want to me with a fanny pack 
on.

264
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,090
It's Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

265
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,220
That's funny.
Oh my God.

266
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,630
Oscar.
Oscar,

267
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,890
Oscar.
Shut the fuck up.

268
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,150
Please.
Shut the fuck up.

269
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,570
Oscar was smart though because with the 
all the hyper mayweather,

270
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:24,750
Mcgregor,
he would go on and shit on it.

271
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,540
Write Shit on the fight.
Just to hype up his fight though.

272
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,280
Go to that nate and nick.
Picture.

273
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,290
That's everyone's on steroids.
Go Scroll up.

274
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Scroll up to the top whole.
Everybody is on steroids.

275
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,900
What a great picture.
They might be right.

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,730
Yeah,
they might be right.

277
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,230
You know what I started watching last 
night,

278
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,920
I don't know if you'd say an ICARUS or a
car wreck on Netflix.

279
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,560
Yes.
It's all about doping and this,

280
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,280
uh,
this guy is helping the Russian

281
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,113
team.
There was one estimate that it was 

282
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:57,814
somewhere in the high nineties of 
Russian athletes are on performance 

283
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,290
enhancing drugs.
That make sense that,

284
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,173
that.
That's my thing with this whole Jon 

285
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,650
Jones stuff,
like I go back and forth.

286
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:10,570
I'm going to quote our friend Eddie 
Bravo.

287
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,750
When you look into it,
when you look into it,

288
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:14,584
that Toronto,
like so many guys article came out 

289
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,124
today,
I think I'm Fox Fox sports are came out 

290
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,403
today of this guy who was a minor league
baseball player and he's a pro now and 

291
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,724
he's tested twice for it,
positive and a third time and he's 

292
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,260
waiting to see if he gets banned for 
life because three strikes.

293
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,094
You're out in baseball fan for life and 
they're saying the how many guys in 

294
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:36,700
baseball get tests hot for this Toronto 
Ball?

295
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,623
And they say in GNC,
they have 47 products at GNC that this 

296
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,030
can show up us.
Wow.

297
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,080
I know.
So I saw that.

298
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,850
I'm like,
Oh fuck yeah,

299
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:47,860
but wait a minute.
He's not supposed to be taking anything.

300
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,873
You're talking about a guy who's already
lost his ability to make a living from 

301
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:51,754
Mexican Dick Pills.
Like why would he ever just take 

302
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,690
something off the shelf at Gnc?
Well,

303
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,524
we're,
we're not giving the Guy Kudos because 

304
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,650
he's the smartest tool in the shed.
Sharp,

305
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,100
Sharp,
Sharp,

306
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,220
what I say,
smartest tool in the shed.

307
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,100
Tools.
A smart to smoke a little weed.

308
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,940
You know what I'm saying?
Like he might've been like,

309
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,260
oh,
I need energy.

310
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,910
Give me this.
What is that?

311
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,390
She Pi on the bolts out of his neck and 
he takes that dude.

312
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,530
The truth is,
I would never do steroids.

313
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:26,350
I put that on my children.
I put that on my heavenly father.

314
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,040
He did not bring heavenly father.
I love how we capitalize heavenly father

315
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,670
because for sure in fact,
read.

316
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,050
You don't want to go to hell spec 
aspect.

317
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,650
I'm Jones thirties facing up,
man.

318
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,020
Imagine if he comes back at 34 and still
fucks everybody,

319
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,220
but he's 260 pounds at heavyweight.
Fuck all this cut and wait.

320
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:48,940
Just just go on a power lift and rampage
for the next four years.

321
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,850
Keep your body in shape.
Still Fuck everybody up at heavyweight.

322
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,713
But if you look at that Tran of ball man
and see how much per how many guys test 

323
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,970
hot for it and they're like,
what the fuck?

324
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,700
It's not in there.
I can see Jones argument a little bit.

325
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,720
I know I go back and forth and I'm off 
the stream,

326
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,583
but when I see that and I see how big of
an issue it is in baseball and Minor 

327
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,630
League Baseball,
Usada and the commission might be like,

328
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,100
fuck,
look at all these guys,

329
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,420
man,
we got real issue here.

330
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,403
Maybe did fuck up.
So then I think there's no way to give 

331
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,284
them for years,
but I realize now I haven't heard of 

332
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,300
anybody else tested positive for the 
stuff in the UFC.

333
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,240
Have you?
Is it the same stuff?

334
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:29,410
Frank Mir test positive for you?
This is the other thing.

335
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,430
Usually if a guy tests hot for something
out of one of those major camps,

336
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,623
other guys can test hot for the same 
stuff unless he's getting it straight 

337
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,610
from the power lifter guys.
Yeah.

338
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,110
Whereas NFL brothers didn't.

339
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,550
Frank Mir eat kangaroo.
Those like tainted kangaroo meat,

340
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,250
Bro was at the worst argument for 
people.

341
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,550
I mean,
you're the smartest tool in the shed.

342
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,103
Some people eat kangaroo,
but it's not common table fair in 

343
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,950
Australia.
No,

344
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,933
fuck no.
I was just in Australia doing the 

345
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,600
kangaroo burger.
The venison beef eating.

346
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,043
Yeah,
but he didn't say what he was flagged 

347
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,810
for.
My favorite part,

348
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,644
however,
he was still given a maximum punishment 

349
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:15,434
by.
You saw the,

350
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,740
I think as he claimed,
he listed numerous potential sources for

351
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,000
the positive test including eating 
kangaroo meat while in Australia.

352
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,000
You saw it as like,
what out of here.

353
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,100
That's the best you got.
We've heard a bunch of shit,

354
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,740
but that's all you got.
Boy.

355
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,150
You know what's interesting?
It's like how much does it help?

356
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,710
How much like what you think about like 
what these guys are doing.

357
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,690
I mean definitely steroids help right to
steroids make you a better athlete.

358
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,090
They allow you to recover,
let's say 10 percent better.

359
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,850
Yeah.
It's hard to tell though,

360
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:54,851
because could John beat Daniel cormay 
without that small dosage of Toronto?

361
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,590
Yes,
he could do.

362
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,180
That's what DC was saying.
He was like,

363
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,200
the guy doesn't need to do it.
He's super talented.

364
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,550
Doesn't need to do it.
I know.

365
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:07,160
That's why when you look at the 
evidence,

366
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,040
you're like,
why this small amount of Trento ball and

367
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,900
you see all the other guys tested 
positive for it.

368
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,270
How much would this really help him?
And he risked all this to take something

369
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,390
piss hot and it's really not helping 
that much.

370
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,910
And then where do we stop?
So right now we want to enlist.

371
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,620
And I had been the fucking poster boy of
making fun of John on this stuff.

372
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,050
But in all seriousness,
we're do.

373
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,140
We'd say,
all right,

374
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,510
most guys are doing it because there's 
this heard Luke Thomas talking about it.

375
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,450
Uh,
they uh,

376
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,240
a water right.
Sat in water.

377
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:40,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

378
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,483
What is the Big One?
I think in 2007 they did this survey of 

379
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,510
athletes including fires that were going
overseas and competing and they,

380
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,060
they ask them at,
at,

381
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,003
at a kind of under the radar how many 
guys are doing performance enhancing 

382
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,920
drugs.
It was an alarming number,

383
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:00,110
like 78 percent.
And that's people,

384
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,973
you know.
I bet it would be a little higher than 

385
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,290
that.
Yeah.

386
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,690
So like,
you know what I'm saying?

387
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,241
So we're,
we're,

388
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:08,240
we're gonna Tarnish John's name and he's
not the greatest of all time,

389
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,170
but it's like,
okay,

390
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,210
but then you'll pay to watch over him 
fight.

391
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,310
You pay to watch vitor Belfort fight,
you know,

392
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,890
like we don't know exactly who's doing 
what.

393
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,630
Right?
But if overeem becomes a champ,

394
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,800
I guarantee you,
if he pisses hot as a champ,

395
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:21,680
people turned on him to know I get it.

396
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,460
But he,
he's,

397
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,950
he's tested for way worse things than 
John has,

398
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,000
but he hasn't.
He,

399
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,160
we tested for testosterone,
right?

400
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,260
Didn't he?
It was just testosterone.

401
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,020
Oh my God.
I had elevated testosterone levels.

402
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:33,854
Bane.
I mean the same shit when he was Uber 

403
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,160
Room.
That's more than testosterone.

404
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,520
But he,
but he tested positive for that,

405
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,560
didn't he?
And he said a doctor gave him a shot.

406
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,730
Wasn't that like the whole deal at some 
doctor's shoulder at for?

407
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,770
I know they don't.
I don't,

408
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,680
but let's just think about what they are
like.

409
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,710
So he tested positive for testosterone,
I believe.

410
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,813
Well if you just pause for that.
And if you had a exemption that means 

411
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,910
his levels were on that feed doorbell 
for Nate Marquardt Shit where they test.

412
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,650
You're like,
holy fuck man,

413
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,290
how are you now?
It's one of the other guys.

414
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,303
He's one of the first guys pop by Usada 
I believe he was also the one who 

415
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,990
remember he ran away.

416
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,930
Oh that's right.
Got to go.

417
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,540
Literally sprinted to his car that he 
got.

418
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,860
Daniel got a big man run.
Yeah.

419
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,950
And then we had to come back.
He ran to his car.

420
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,930
He asked them after like a post or a 
preflight pr thing.

421
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,700
He's like,
Oh shit.

422
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,400
And then ran like,
you know how he runs in the octagon?

423
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,140
He was like doing that and so got away 
and he got in his car and drove off.

424
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,951
Yeah.
What happens?

425
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:36,090
You get in serious trouble,
right?

426
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,430
Fuck yeah.
Someone convinced them to come back.

427
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Probably Dana was like,
what the fuck happened with vandelay and

428
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:45,350
vandelay for life?
The social life.

429
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,730
I don't think that was use out of 
though.

430
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,980
I feel like that was Nevada.
The Nevada commission.

431
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,980
They're the same ones.
You want a band nate for letter.

432
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,990
Nick for life and fucking told Connor.
He owes him $2,000,000

433
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:59,670
and then he has shoot commercial 
$150,000

434
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,380
and and shoot a commercial and what?

435
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,630
Fuck you.
I'm not finding any commercial.

436
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,530
Yeah.
Do you know that?

437
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,413
Yeah.
What was the commercial and 

438
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:09,550
anti-bullying commercial pace?
Hundred $50,000.

439
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,850
Shoot this commercial for free.
Why would I.

440
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,950
Why would I do an anti bullying 
commercial?

441
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:14,784
When you're bullying me,
you're bullying me into doing an anti 

442
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,110
bullying commercial or conscious.
We're like,

443
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
all right,
well cool.

444
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:21,300
I'll do the commercial,
but I'm gonna give you.

445
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:23,820
My rate is about 2 million commercial 
right now.

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,630
I need about 100.
One point 7 million.

447
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,490
That's why I need you guys all meet 
that,

448
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,443
so I'll pay the fine,
but you don't mean one point seven to 

449
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:32,184
the commercial.
There's a lady in Nevada state athletic 

450
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:37,410
commission is very mean.
Know that one lady.

451
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,260
Think of that your job,
but I've been to,

452
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,770
I forget who was a.
was it John John?

453
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,720
Was it Nick Diaz?
It might've been Nick Diaz,

454
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,003
but just the scolding that she was given
one of the fighters while this was all 

455
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:54,060
going down when they were going over 
some sort of a positive like you know,

456
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,550
because they're government officials,
you know,

457
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,630
so they feel like they have this power 
and they,

458
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,010
it becomes like a tyranny.

459
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,933
They're not nice.
Like you don't have a personal 

460
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,304
relationship with this guy.
You shouldn't have personal issues like 

461
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,224
just stern faced anger in your voice.
You're in like some sort of a 

462
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:12,730
competition to convict someone and to 
punish them go thing.

463
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,850
Absolutely.
Yes.

464
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,150
It's not like,
look,

465
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,250
they're there can absolutely be like 
what?

466
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,830
Say what you want about the Golden 
Snitch,

467
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,760
right?
Novitsky.

468
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,590
I like it.
So when I spray snitch,

469
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,680
that's a positive.
It's a fun thing to say,

470
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,040
but someone gave me a golden snitch.
Toilets,

471
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,300
you know,
from a Harry Potter.

472
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,790
No others.
Golden snitch to Harry Potter.

473
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,320
Carry on.
The Novitsky is never angry about it.

474
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,500
Never emotional about it.
Very factual.

475
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,220
Like when he describes what a thing,
what's not casting judgment,

476
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,010
he's not being mean.
He's just saying this is what we have,

477
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,923
this is how we know he's doing his job.
The Guy Catch John with this trend of 

478
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,920
bull shit.

479
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,950
God,
I hope that happens.

480
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,933
He's not doing any of that.
Also your realized when they brought on 

481
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,693
Novitsky is day.
We're trying to paint the picture to 

482
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:02,530
sell it for the most money possible to 
be taken serious.

483
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,140
So you signed this huge reebok 
endorsement deal,

484
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,540
you know,
you start doing pump and dump,

485
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,790
is that what you're saying?
It's got to pump it and then the,

486
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:14,050
the and then frank and Lorenzo just sold
the remaining shares too.

487
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,213
Like we're really out.
Someone was just telling me about how 

488
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,084
they do that with businesses.
Like some businesses are not operating 

489
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,390
just to try to make a profit.
They're operating to sell.

490
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,390
Yes.
And I went why it's.

491
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,623
And then this one guy was telling me 
that his friend had a business that was 

492
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,240
operating that way,
but then it didn't sell,

493
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:35,074
the sell fell apart and then they have 
to change the business plan and then 

494
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,750
start making it a business to make 
money.

495
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,960
Like what the fuck are you talking about
with the fertittas?

496
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,360
I mean you're talking straight maverick 
when it comes to business.

497
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:47,194
So with all all they have going on,
they don't need the UFC do well if that 

498
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,930
doesn't help his mind thing,
I mean shit.

499
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:54,250
And right now they look at it and as a 
business.

500
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,670
So let's take these steps with the 
strict test and get fucked guys down the

501
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,400
road.
Don't care reebok this don't care.

502
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,263
That's not our deal.
This is what's going to make it look 

503
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,710
best for buyers.
That's what we're doing for billy.

504
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:10,450
And Go fuck yourselves.
How fun fell is just genius strategy.

505
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,330
Really,
really teach it at Harvard with Dana.

506
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,040
Then the fertittas.
Did the project teach at Harvard?

507
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,173
Yeah.
Really think about it that way in terms 

508
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,770
of I could just a giant sum of money to 
be earned.

509
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,723
You only look at as they earned it too 
because you think about like where the 

510
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,590
business was before they came along and 
how they were 40 plus million dollars in

511
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,660
debt.
When they filmed the ultimate fighter,

512
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,080
they were losing so much fucking money.
Just hand over fist,

513
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:39,280
losing money and there and at one point 
Lorenzo would call Dana and said,

514
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,710
let's sell it.
Try to find some buyers in the morning.

515
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,210
Then he woke up in the morning,
change his mind.

516
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,350
It's like,
fuck that to him.

517
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,303
We're going to keep it.
I mean that's how much money they were 

518
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,304
losing it.
Not a lot of people would have done 

519
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,544
that.
Depends how much money I have in the 

520
00:22:52,391 --> 00:22:53,440
bank.
Yeah,

521
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:55,210
but even if with a lot of money in the 
bank,

522
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,250
you can't just keep chewing through 
money.

523
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,760
You will,
you know,

524
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,370
you're $40,000,000.
That means a couple years,

525
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,910
year $100,000,000
in like you're going to get that hundred

526
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,210
million dollars back.

527
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,290
Not very likely.
How bout their cousin bought the Houston

528
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,110
Rockets for two point $2,000,000,000.
That family is fucking falling.

529
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,953
Hashtag ball it Hashtag ball and I 
stopped talking to deb needs a loan for 

530
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:17,980
two years.
Yeah,

531
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,960
Johnny does need alone.
He to someone.

532
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:22,510
Nice.
It tell Johnny doesn't need 14 houses.

533
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,870
Johnny settled down in a night.
I mean,

534
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,704
what kind of speed are you want?
Will you sign the mortgage for that 

535
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,480
14,000?
You're like fuck,

536
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,570
just killing it.
But that 14 towns like holy shit,

537
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,910
what do you do with you don't do 
anything with them.

538
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:41,360
That's the problem.
So he go thing.

539
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,400
Look at that.
Johnny Depp's,

540
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,920
Kentucky Horse Farm fails to sell at 
auction.

541
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,990
I wish

542
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,920
that bitch go for two point nine.
He just did it.

543
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,840
Just happen no matter what.
Like lookup,

544
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,370
scroll up and look at that picture of 
him.

545
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,170
Does it just happen no matter what?
That after awhile you almost become like

546
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,850
a caricature.
You become one of the characters.

547
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,113
Yeah,
I mean you,

548
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,953
you paint yourself as the odd fellow 
who's she know on the outside for the 

549
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,044
longest time and then all of a sudden 
you become this blockbuster guy because 

550
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:13,454
johnny didn't for the longest time you 
should talk about because he's a very 

551
00:24:15,201 --> 00:24:16,690
respected actor.
Hell yeah.

552
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,533
And he used to talk about how he doesn't
want to be Mr blockbuster guy and then 

553
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,124
he gets on pirates of the Caribbean.
They probably just thinks it's a cool 

554
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,000
part,
but it's still disney,

555
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:26,834
you know,
Disney.

556
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,400
But it seems like a cool part.
I mean,

557
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,650
so it was alice in wonderland that 
didn't fuck his life up.

558
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,420
Alice in wonderland,
which is great.

559
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,403
Good movie.
He was a great movie and he was awesome 

560
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,780
and amazing as the mad hatter.
I was the mad hatter for Halloween.

561
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,530
I dressed up,
but he's,

562
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,270
you know,
he's a legit,

563
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:48,650
brilliant actor and then all of a sudden
he's in this blockbuster that's a Disney

564
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,484
thing.
So all of a sudden he becomes this like 

565
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,080
huge international,
just top of the food chain superstar got

566
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,440
a Jack Sparrow tat to you.
Here's the jacks.

567
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,570
You hit the spiro on his forearm.
He.

568
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,000
How would you feel like if I had a fear 
factor tattoo on my leg,

569
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,720
a big MTV center right here.
I wasn't on MTV.

570
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,650
That's right.
And See,

571
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,753
but if it was on my thigh and it just 
said failure is not a factor for me on 

572
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:15,970
your ribs.
Fear not.

573
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,383
Oh,
and you pull up in that slingshot real 

574
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:20,930
dick move.

575
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,790
I would have to gold plate it.
Yeah.

576
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,160
I felt like that slingshots missing some
bling.

577
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,300
I needed to be Shinier.
Yeah.

578
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,010
Sometimes.
I don't know man with Johnny Depp.

579
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:32,990
He just got too into it.
Well,

580
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:33,824
I just think you know,
when you're on something that you don't 

581
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,670
enjoy,
it's one thing that does happen.

582
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,030
I happened to a lot of people on bad 
sitcoms that are making a ton of money.

583
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,960
They just start going crazy and buying 
all these things because they need these

584
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,470
things to make them feel good because 
their work doesn't.

585
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,763
At least.
Yeah.

586
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,953
At least I'm working,
but I'm going to get that new Ferrari 

587
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,880
Ferrari for whatever the fuck it is.
Four 59.

588
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,643
Is that the newest one?
I'm whatever it is on the top of the 

589
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:01,670
food and shit,
dope ass Ferrari.

590
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,980
I mean maybe you just like Ferrari's,
but then you know,

591
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:08,480
maybe you just buy a yacht maybe by this
and maybe you buy that and then you sign

592
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:10,740
a deal to do the show that you don't 
even want to do anymore,

593
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,490
but you have to sign that deal now 
because you've got a $12,000,000

594
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:16,290
mansion in Malibu overlooking the.

595
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,060
I think.
I think done Johnny Depp.

596
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,040
Anyone his life go now after four house 
he goes,

597
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,560
God,
I might chill out on the fifth one,

598
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,930
man.
Not really even staying the other ones.

599
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,630
This is just a theory.
No one was like 10 bro.

600
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,930
I think we should take a break.
This is 14.

601
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,140
This is just a theory,
but I think that one of the things about

602
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:44,340
a guy like Johnny Depp is

603
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,383
if you want,
and I don't know this amber heard lady 

604
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,850
who was living with.
She seems nice enough to me.

605
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
Very beautiful.
Matter of fact,

606
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,154
I read somewhere that she was like some 
computer program said that she was the 

607
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:01,500
most beautiful person alive.
He didn't even make sense to me.

608
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,820
Right.
Like symmetrical.

609
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,170
I guess.
Her eyes or something.

610
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,930
I don't know.
Yeah.

611
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,763
Well my computer's different.
My thought is when she's beautiful 

612
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,333
school,
but my thought is when you're a dude 

613
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:14,100
like him and you got a girl like that in
like,

614
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,993
you know,
you're,

615
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,093
you're having a great time.
Like one of the great things to do is 

616
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:20,904
probably just buy a ton of shit and just
impress this girl and just take her on 

617
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:27,890
this journey.
The goal,

618
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,550
what kind of once 14,
how crazy he's doing.

619
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,390
Well,
he didn't.

620
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,550
He didn't buy 14 houses with her.

621
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,920
I'm sure you only bought a few eight,
but he's going crazy.

622
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:41,580
He's buying all kinds of shit.
Like she loves that,

623
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,820
but this is what I think.
I think things just escalate.

624
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,113
Think things just escalate,
spiral out of control and they just get 

625
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,340
you get away from yourself.
Next thing you know,

626
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,174
you're standing on the fucking red 
carpet with eyeliner on and silver 

627
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,290
chains and your insured is opening the 
chest.

628
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,273
I need.
You're acting like you're on some crazy 

629
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,420
indie rock band and you're 53.
You become a caricature Jack Sparrow,

630
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,593
you start dressing like the what you 
think people want to see like the 

631
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,800
instead of you and you kind of forget 
who you are.

632
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:11,760
Maybe.
I mean,

633
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,270
I'm not just saying just him.
I'm not.

634
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,550
Jim Carey's latest interview.
Yes,

635
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,550
I was going to bring that up.
He's playing,

636
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,841
he's playing.
He's,

637
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:21,660
but he's getting ready for a character 
who acts like that.

638
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,020
He's an character that moment.
That's not Jim Carrey.

639
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,360
He's doing.
He's also my favorite human being,

640
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,194
one of them,
but he's playing a character in that so 

641
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,430
he has a new role

642
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,880
who he's playing,
but the guys,

643
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,743
he just signed it.
They announced yesterday signed for a 

644
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,163
new show on showtime where he's playing 
a comedian that's freaking out later in 

645
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:40,840
life or something like that

646
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,420
and that's what he's doing now.
He was a part of the whole,

647
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,460
I'm dying up here thing.
He's a producer,

648
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,093
so he's playing a character of a 
comedian who's freaking out who freaks 

649
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,980
out like that.
Like that's a typical to that role.

650
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,220
So that's kind of what he's doing there.
He was supposed to play,

651
00:28:57,221 --> 00:29:02,050
or at least there's a rumor that he was 
supposed to play Terence Mckenna in some

652
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:03,900
sort of biography.
The fame

653
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,230
psychedelic adventure,
tourists turns Mckenna be great on this.

654
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,570
Amazing on it.
She is Andy do frame.

655
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,910
I'm sorry.
Andy Kaufman painting too,

656
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,123
like,
Hey,

657
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,280
he's got some really cool painting that 
he's been doing recently.

658
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,950
It's a real cool little piece that 
doesn't look recent.

659
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,913
It looks a lot younger there.
I think this has been been prior two or 

660
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:27,630
three year time period that Scott made 
over this six minute video.

661
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,580
Do you ever see his dog?
Cool stuff,

662
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,050
man.
I know he's a sick painter.

663
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,780
That thing with the neon and black.
Go back to that for a second.

664
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:34,614
Jamie.
The thing with the neon and black that 

665
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:40,630
he was just super talented.
That's really cool looking dude.

666
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,250
Did you see his daughter when she was on
American

667
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,740
idol and the poor girls getting ready to
sing?

668
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,210
You know,
the biggest night of her life,

669
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,750
like let's go ahead and wire it.
Ended her famous father,

670
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:51,280
Jim Carrey,
gyms all.

671
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,470
Hey,
he's like on skype.

672
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:54,460
He's like,
hey baby,

673
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,700
good luck that I take it away.
Little carry.

674
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,020
I'm like,
Oh God,

675
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,210
what a shitty moment man.
For her,

676
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,700
like let her have her moment,
man,

677
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,000
to bring it to your dad's Jim Carrey.
Television man,

678
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:09,220
that's how they do it.
They go 100 percent cheese on.

679
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Don't go at all this.
They want to appeal to Joe Slack,

680
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,680
jaw sitting on his easy chair at home 
just like this.

681
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,340
I feel like even Joe Slack jaw doesn't 
like that bullshit.

682
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,400
There's enough people that do and enough
people that will tolerate it.

683
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,190
See Ratings Beg to differ.
Well,

684
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,100
they don't really.
They do still have good ratings.

685
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:31,210
It's just a tired show.

686
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,500
Well,
it depends what it is.

687
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,770
Like if you think about most shows like 
ratings are down in general,

688
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:39,160
but look at things that are more organic
and real,

689
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,600
right?
Like your show,

690
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,280
like look,
other podcasts,

691
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,114
like other shows on youtube,
stuff like that where it's not so 

692
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,353
bullshit producer Tony,
how to feel what opinions you should 

693
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:49,924
have,
but they're stuck in that model because 

694
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,800
they have commercials.
They're stuck in that model because they

695
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:54,634
have to those commercials that they have
to interrupt their show with like 

696
00:30:58,151 --> 00:31:00,400
everything has to kind of wrap up every 
few minutes.

697
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,583
How many minutes did they go without 
commercials on a regular intelligence 

698
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,090
bubble?
Guppies let you play the full thing,

699
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,410
but it's like bubble guppies.
My kids love it.

700
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,540
Oh my kid's obsessed.
They loved it when they were little.

701
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,860
Let's find that out.
I get on at 22 minutes,

702
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,390
seven minutes or so,
every seven minutes.

703
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,520
Roughly every seven minutes for a 
sitcom.

704
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,410
And do you think they do the same for an
hour show?

705
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,480
The brakes are different depending on 
the show,

706
00:31:28,481 --> 00:31:29,890
but it's like 12 minutes,
20 minutes.

707
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:33,370
They're always going to be.
You can never get real deep.

708
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,540
What if they frontloaded it like 
podcasts and does no one's gonna.

709
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,010
Watch that part.
No one's watching them anyways.

710
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,963
Sometimes they do that.
Like this show is brought to you 

711
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,600
commercial free.
By then you don't get it,

712
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,910
but they still announced that every 
phone.

713
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,783
That's probably the way to do it.
That's probably the way to do it or 

714
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,724
product placement is a way to do it.
Just don't be gross product placement 

715
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,121
stuff.
Yeah,

716
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:52,954
you just can't be gross about it.
It's like the team and someone is 

717
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:57,370
drinking a coke show a coke.
It's nothing wrong with that.

718
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,580
As long as it makes sense for the scene.

719
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,200
You know what I mean?
Like the.

720
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:05,680
The idea that you're going to put stuff 
in there that doesn't belong for product

721
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,330
placement.
Well that's gross,

722
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,850
but if you could figure out some way 
where it's organic,

723
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,310
I think that model is terrible.
It's so hilarious like that.

724
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,570
Yeah.
He's tough,

725
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,470
powerful rob lowe,
but dimey very handsome,

726
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,233
but I,
I think they're going to start 

727
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:29,821
gravitating towards more that realness.
They have to smell bullshit now.

728
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,933
Yeah,
but Joe Slack jaw sit in his arm chair 

729
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,340
in rural Illinois.
Sorry to pick on you,

730
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,183
Illinois.
Just to pick the state could say 

731
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:40,340
Massachusetts Montana,
but he's just sitting there and he's got

732
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,174
his mouth open and maybe that appeals to
him and maybe you'll tolerate it and 

733
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,470
then there's that whole spectrum in 
between.

734
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,560
True of people that like this.
My favorite show,

735
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,470
I love it when people kept saying,
I fucking love it.

736
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,483
I love it when they get up there and 
they try to sing and that voice cracks 

737
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,390
and you know,
they're embarrassed.

738
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,750
Oh,
I made me feel so good.

739
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,823
People do lot.
I used to love it when I'd watch 

740
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:09,000
American idol,
my favorite part was the people that saw

741
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,190
me to those.
That's my.

742
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,140
When they get all serious,
that's like,

743
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,710
hey,
I gotta go,

744
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,481
alright,
you're good.

745
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,314
I'm out.
Whatever happened to that lady who was 

746
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:17,474
like,
she looked like she was like inner 

747
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,760
fifties teeth.
Ralph's,

748
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,320
Susan Boyle.
That's America.

749
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,330
Got Talent factor in England.
It was,

750
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,173
it expectation.
What happened is that Simon cowel guys 

751
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:28,560
on everything,
he's ridiculous.

752
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:30,200
And I heard,
I heard she got bond,

753
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,240
crazy bond.
Those black girls.

754
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,110
Um,
I heard,

755
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,130
not that that matters,
but it,

756
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,060
um,
right.

757
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,160
Um,
I heard Susan Boyle,

758
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,310
I got paid bank and it was like,
fuck this fame thing.

759
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,590
Well,
really it's almost like you,

760
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:44,570
some of them laying on her teeth.
Britain's got talent.

761
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,230
Britain's got talent.
So great.

762
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,040
She was two.
I remember when they,

763
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,420
they just didn't expect it and she came 
out and just smashed it.

764
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,580
Mastered.
I remember was when I was like,

765
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,414
Whoa,
that is crazy that she can sing that 

766
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:03,020
good today.
Well she,

767
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,390
hold on,
she just turned 50.

768
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,410
She's my age.
Yeah.

769
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,510
How's that possible?
Well,

770
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,440
that's crazy.
That scares the fucking shit out of me.

771
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
You're aging like cheese.
She's aging like fruit.

772
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,160
Wow.
She got a use it or lose it baby.

773
00:34:19,161 --> 00:34:20,840
She's using her voice man.
Yeah,

774
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,033
but voice around.
I'm sure she's still probably singing 

775
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,483
here and there just isn't like tour.
I know she kind of bounced out of the 

776
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:30,320
spotlight though.
Well if she lives simple,

777
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,690
you know,
or she made a ton of money.

778
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,160
It's a weight loss photos.
Oh,

779
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:41,170
she's 56 son Kenny Bro.
She can't,

780
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,070
she won.
She was 50.

781
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,050
We'll see what our program looks like in
six years.

782
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,430
Talks about that shit.
I look like her.

783
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,720
Yeah.
All those talent shows are fucking weird

784
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:57,500
man.
You know America's got talent and what's

785
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:01,850
the one with Jennifer Lopez is on one of
them now.

786
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,710
Oh,
she has a dance show.

787
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,230
Right?
And then that country music guys on with

788
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:10,070
that other girl with Katy Perry hosted 
our painter like $25,

789
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,680
million bucks to content,
some crazy amount of money to host.

790
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,620
And he was like,
hell no.

791
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,290
He would be onto Donald Trump.
Hates black people.

792
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,210
How about Donald Trump going at espn?
Yeah,

793
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,780
but he's wrong.
He's sober.

794
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:24,641
Leaving.
No,

795
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,390
there were ratings are up.
Like,

796
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,470
that's so crazy.
Returns aren't up.

797
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,313
Are they down?
Yeah,

798
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,710
it does.
Because of him.

799
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,010
People leaving cable and somebody said 
that the ratings are up though.

800
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,140
The recent ratings.
Maybe.

801
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,860
Maybe I just read things and I just go 
with the NFL is back.

802
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,750
I mean they're just up because the 
summer's over.

803
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,930
But in general they're down.
Just in Esp.

804
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:48,000
They had all those cuts,
had killed a bunch of people.

805
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:49,590
Budget cuts.
He cut so much talent.

806
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:50,550
But that was it.
Oh,

807
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,330
what's her name?
Jamal came out was like,

808
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,530
on her.
Granted she's an employee of Espn,

809
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,250
but on her personal social media on 
twitter,

810
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,140
she was saying he's a racist,
stuff like that.

811
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,390
He's a white supremacist.
And uh,

812
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,253
she said he's the worst president of her
lifetime and a lot of people said that 

813
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,000
it's just the fact that she is a public 
media figures.

814
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,480
Everybody wanted her fired.
And this is like,

815
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,340
it's weird outrage culture we live in,
right?

816
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,860
She's entitled to Her fucking opinion.
Now the thing is,

817
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,783
does espn want people on their network 
being all political and talking about 

818
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,440
shit like that on their social media?
And do they have rules about that?

819
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,330
Because some companies do have rules 
about that,

820
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:28,680
whether you agree with those rules or 
not.

821
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,740
Some companies do have rules on what you
can and can't say on social media.

822
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,840
But here's the thing that I found 
fascinating.

823
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,280
Donald trump didn't talk about her,
talked about espn.

824
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
I thought that was a chicken shit thing 
to do.

825
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,430
Like there was a woman who works for 
espn.

826
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,200
Oh yes,
that's true.

827
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,650
That's what I'm saying.
There's a woman that works for Espn,

828
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,380
a very specific person,
not espn,

829
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,813
you know,
telling lies should apologize or 

830
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,230
whatever the fuck he wrote.
He didn't call her out.

831
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,090
He didn't call her out.
I think he's,

832
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,623
he's knows you can't do it,
especially not now and everybody thinks 

833
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:04,284
you're a white supremacist.
Can't pick on the black lady he picked 

834
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,700
on Rosie O'donnell all day long.
Right?

835
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,410
He'll go after everybody else.
Call him a loser girl.

836
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,320
Miss America and her little speech 
slammed him too.

837
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,154
She said a whole bunch of shit about him
and you see this gentleman is that Kirk 

838
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,000
Cameron looks like Kirk Cameron.
That's homeboy from survivor.

839
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,620
Who is it from survivor from survive.
Some bachelor Bachelorette.

840
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,113
You ever seen him getting roasted and 
when he was accused of cheating on his 

841
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,210
girl classic.
Anyways,

842
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,920
yeah,
that Miss America,

843
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,430
she said Shit about trump and no one's 
going after her necessarily.

844
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:41,340
She's quote unquote gaining millions of 
fans right now.

845
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,810
Right.
But what's interesting is I watched a.

846
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,220
someone posted something about Anthony 
Bordain.

847
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,340
Anthony Bourdain was caught by TMZ or 
the airport.

848
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,080
Okay.
Very quick.

849
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,630
Sort of silly interview.
They asked them a question,

850
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,830
if you had to cook for Kim Jong Un and 
Donald Trump,

851
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,030
what would you serve?
And he goes,

852
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,950
hemlock.
And he walks away.

853
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,730
It's a joke.
It's a fucking one line is also funny.

854
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,780
He's a funny guy.
He says a one liner and all these people

855
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:10,614
are saying,
should he be fired from CNN for saying 

856
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:15,290
that he would poison trump if he had,
you know,

857
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,910
good luck to secret service is going to 
contact you,

858
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:20,250
and so I look at his fucking twitter 
page man,

859
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,593
and it's crazy.
All these fucking psychos are telling 

860
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:27,420
the secret service.
They should investigate it.

861
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:28,254
CNN,
are you going to fire him like you 

862
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,980
fired?
Raise the Azelex people.

863
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,170
Men Outright Co out,
excuse me.

864
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,370
Outrage culture.
People are getting excited

865
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,560
about things being outrageous instead of
just going,

866
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,780
this weed is got me coughing instead of 
just looking at it and going,

867
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:44,800
well,
I don't agree with that.

868
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,870
Fuck that guy.
Or going well,

869
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:47,704
that was obviously a joke,
which was like the normal person would 

870
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,190
do it like affects you.
Like not at all.

871
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,600
Do you really think that Anthony Bordain
wants to fucking poison Donald Trump and

872
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,500
they should lose our jobs?
She's amazing by the way.

873
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,140
She's a beast on its culture.
Outrage culture.

874
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,540
People just decide they can try to 
affect something.

875
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,540
And then things start getting ramped up,
the momentum kicks in,

876
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,750
all these other people jump on board and
they get excited about being a part of a

877
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,260
group that wants to get Anthony Bourdain
kicked off the day,

878
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,810
what they want,
some sort of weird direction.

879
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,644
They think they're important enough 
where they can get these people fired 

880
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,920
and they think if they get together 
enough,

881
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:21,754
they're going to have the power to 
affect that person life even believed 

882
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:23,700
there.

883
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,200
Right.
Bunch of pitches.

884
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,990
Right.
And I kept saying,

885
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,060
you know,
threatening the life of Potus.

886
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:31,830
I kept saying,
you got,

887
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,190
what are you talking about?
The king,

888
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,203
you guys are out of your mind.
This is a person with a terrible job 

889
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:36,914
saying that game of thrones Donald Trump
is a person with a job that no one 

890
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:39,910
wants.
Okay.

891
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,650
That's what he is doing a good job at 
it.

892
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,960
No,
but is anybody doing a good job at it?

893
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,823
No.
I think Obama was like the best 

894
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,460
president we ever had.
And you look at it.

895
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,520
I know people can get mad at me for this
and there's a lot,

896
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,680
a lot of things that I think that he did
that I don't agree with,

897
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,543
like the way went after the press with 
the way he promised to protect 

898
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:58,864
whistleblowers,
but he never did like free speech and 

899
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,193
people having to give up their sources 
was damaged heavily during Obama's 

900
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:05,764
administration.

901
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,530
The use of drones,
unprecedented use of drones,

902
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:12,160
unprecedented amount of civilian deaths 
during his administration.

903
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,170
The question is,
how much of that was his fault?

904
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,020
How much can one man even control?
I mean,

905
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:19,450
this,
I think it's an impossible fucking job,

906
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,493
but the way he carries himself,
like a person I'd love more than it is 

907
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:27,790
about here,
the way he can enunciate clearly.

908
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,300
He,
he's,

909
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,133
uh,
to me it was like a good representative 

910
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:34,630
of what I would like to see as a calm,
peaceful,

911
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,520
educated American who's smart and he is 
just,

912
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,240
he's affable,
he seems friendly and Nice.

913
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,133
He seems like one of us,
he's the first president that kind of 

914
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,420
seems like one of us where you could 
chill with them and you could have.

915
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,900
I could actually relate to them.
Yes.

916
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:53,050
They don't Bill Clinton White House and 
I don't believe.

917
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,960
I think if I was alone with Clinton,
I probably wouldn't be able to jive with

918
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:56,950
them.
I just don't think.

919
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,220
Especially if you're alone,
there's a chicken.

920
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,040
The room.
I think it looked right past you.

921
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,580
You'd be like a distraction.
You have to cock block with that room.

922
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,590
Yeah,
I think almost not like a rooster.

923
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,430
I think Clinton's a straight up rooster.
Yeah,

924
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,980
he's in that room.
It was like he just can't help himself.

925
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,510
He's just got that.
She's flinging Dick.

926
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,900
I got time to talk to some fucking old 
comedian.

927
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,150
I'm hurting the sligo.
Oh,

928
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,290
you were fat,
but you voted for my grades.

929
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,490
Get the fuck out.
That was a long time ago.

930
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,570
Fuck.
Face to get my deck.

931
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,570
I'd love to talk to you,
but I ain't got that much time.

932
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:40,250
If you looked at me lately,
motherfucker.

933
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,750
I'm dying.
Okay.

934
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,680
I'm here for you.
Fucking this up,

935
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,110
man.
Hilarious.

936
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,120
That's exactly like,
hey,

937
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,770
have you ever been on Air Force One?
You know,

938
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,060
I still get to use it.
I wonder if they still get to use it.

939
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,980
They get secret service through the rest
of their lives.

940
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,140
How they fly around.
They fly around commercial.

941
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,873
Although,
uh,

942
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,060
President Carter was on a train like 
high five and they're not train a flight

943
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,000
high and everyone,
President Carter was a beautiful person.

944
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:09,500
That's why you only lasted one term.

945
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,713
You know,
they've negotiated with the hostages in 

946
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:14,414
Iran to make sure that the hostages 
weren't released until after Ronald 

947
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,880
Reagan was elected president.
Now that is some shady shirt,

948
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,433
dirty shit politics.
You kept Americans imprisoned extra so 

949
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,790
that you would look good and they would 
be released when this fucking actor with

950
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,700
slick black,
black hair gotta crack a few eggs,

951
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:36,600
make an omelet man.
It's so.

952
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,580
None of that stuff spreads me when it 
comes to politics or none of it.

953
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:41,414
So it's all business.
Reagan was also the first guy who used 

954
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,370
the religious groups of our country to 
get elected.

955
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,280
He got them on board with him to let you
got to do well.

956
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,460
He brought in religion to politics and a
lot of ways or made it,

957
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,353
made it popular and obvious that that 
was a good choice to align yourself as 

958
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:01,184
being the PR.
Like no president today could be an 

959
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:06,470
atheist.
I don't think I disagree.

960
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,840
Yeah,
because what do they live in for?

961
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,090
They're out there in the White House 
when to launch a nuclear bomb.

962
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:12,710
They think that the end doesn't mean 
anything.

963
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,990
Okay.
I'm here for God's heavenly glory.

964
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,490
Well,
what's my heavenly father?

965
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,950
I'm looking over my heavenly father 
right now.

966
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,930
What's the percentage of atheists in 
the,

967
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,690
in the United States now?
It's higher than ever,

968
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,240
but it's still low.
I don't think so,

969
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,113
man.

970
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,763
Fuck Sakes.
But I think it's less than 30 percent 

971
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,953
get,
but you need those if you want to run 

972
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:35,384
for president because people are more 
concerned about the Lord than they are 

973
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,580
about anything else.
Okay.

974
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:44,030
Twenty two percent of the US population 
is religiously unaffiliated.

975
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,600
Atheist makeup.
Three point one percent ignacious makeup

976
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,300
for percent of the US population.
Two percent.

977
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,930
So it says at 22 percent,
but it says they're not religious.

978
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:56,803
The religiously unaffiliated.
Those are votes for the theist 

979
00:43:59,150 --> 00:43:59,983
president,
but I don't know if that means 

980
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:03,440
religiously unaffiliated like they could
believe in God,

981
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,100
but they just don't belong to a certain 
church we get in those votes.

982
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,031
Okay.
Two,

983
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:09,530
14 general.
Yeah.

984
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,413
Those.
Those votes I think would go towards a 

985
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,420
religious person.
If the person go back,

986
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:18,380
please,
if the person believes in God said to 14

987
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:19,214
General Social Survey reported that 21 
percent of Americans had no religion 

988
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,300
with three percent being atheist and 
five percent agnostic.

989
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,450
That's not even as much as I thought.
It's not that many people,

990
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:31,070
Ma'am are.
You cannot.

991
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,010
I just don't

992
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,843
think I shouldn't say this.
I shouldn't say this in a blanket term 

993
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:35,424
because maybe it can happen,
but I just think it's not a good 

994
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,244
strategy if you're just trying to get 
into office because trump was never 

995
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,350
religious and now he talks about God all
the time.

996
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,670
Now it's all,
you know,

997
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,310
God this and God that it's a strategy.
I mean,

998
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:48,144
it's like you almost.
It's like words that you have to say 

999
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,100
like,
Ma'am and Sir that don't know.

1000
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:52,270
It totally makes sense to you.
Well,

1001
00:44:52,271 --> 00:44:53,160
did you,
I heard the,

1002
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:54,840
uh,
I think the governor,

1003
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,340
or maybe it's the mayor,
Florida,

1004
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,174
when the hurricane was about to hit,
I'm watching just balls deep in it on 

1005
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:01,230
the hurricane,
stuff that he's,

1006
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,310
he goes,
you know,

1007
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,860
your money's great but big C and you 
just pray for us.

1008
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,690
Just keep praying for us.
That's all we need.

1009
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,580
We need to pray before this thing hits.
I'm like,

1010
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,370
dude,
you better figure shit out like that.

1011
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,220
It sounds good.
And he was everything.

1012
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:16,110
Just keep praying for us.
Just pray.

1013
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,370
That's all I asked.
Everyone here,

1014
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:18,120
pray for us.
I'm like,

1015
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,830
man,
you need more than that brother.

1016
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,810
I made it work,

1017
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,693
Bro.
Did you see this going around yesterday 

1018
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,154
afternoon,
facebook and got in trouble after some 

1019
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,024
people were digging into the advertising
thing that was going around also 

1020
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:34,820
yesterday with the algorithms that 
people are looking into the Russian.

1021
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,353
I think someone uncovered that $100,000
had been paid to either some Russian ad 

1022
00:45:39,141 --> 00:45:41,870
agency or something.
I didn't follow the exact story,

1023
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:42,704
but digging into that,
they found this story that Jew haters 

1024
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,100
and an algorithm created,
uh,

1025
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,340
this tag two people and labeled them as 
Jew haters,

1026
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:55,610
and so someone could buy a targeted ad 
to them and what they were,

1027
00:45:55,611 --> 00:45:58,310
I guess they were assuming is that trump
people did it or they were.

1028
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,660
Hold on,
hold on.

1029
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:00,930
You're not saying this right.
Sorry.

1030
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,510
Explain this more clearly.
So someone could put an ad on your page.

1031
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,091
No,
no,

1032
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:08,400
no.
A lot of hypothetical.

1033
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,234
Yeah.
I could put out an ad if I was a buying 

1034
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,480
for Hillary,
for instance,

1035
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,314
in this situation or for trump and 
targeted towards people that were 

1036
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:17,760
labeled as Jew haters.

1037
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,930
We're labeled as within facebook.
Okay.

1038
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,793
So there's four.
So facebook has a category of Jew 

1039
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,644
haters.

1040
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,120
They're saying it was done by a computer
algorithm,

1041
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,500
not by,
excuse me,

1042
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:31,300
by a person.
It just sort of happened.

1043
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,680
What?
Yeah.

1044
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,380
And that's what this is.
It's still being uncovered right now.

1045
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:37,840
This just hit yesterday,
Jew haters was trending on twitter.

1046
00:46:37,841 --> 00:46:38,170
Now

1047
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,170
what is going on?
Facebook advertising the best that there

1048
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,330
is like for anyone because of the 
algorithms,

1049
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,540
because you can pick out a certain 
demographic.

1050
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,790
If you have a show in San Francisco or 
in La,

1051
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,540
you can literally pick everyone in a 10 
mile radius and they will see that that,

1052
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,690
but that is such a crazy eight or figure
it out.

1053
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,190
Yeah,
but what a crazy thing.

1054
00:47:00,191 --> 00:47:02,240
The idea that you could reach a group of
Jews.

1055
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,440
How about don't allow those people to be
their reaching them with it.

1056
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,520
On this same answer,
in the same vein,

1057
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,354
I was going to ask you a second ago when
you said you were looking at Anthony 

1058
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,780
Bourdain's twitter account.
You saw a bunch of hate.

1059
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,733
Yeah.

1060
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,100
Do you think that that could be bots Bot
let me correct that.

1061
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,260
It wasn't Anthony Bourdain's twitter 
account.

1062
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,210
It was a under the tweet by TMZ for show
the video.

1063
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:28,910
Then there was all even that even,
but I'm sure they probably went this.

1064
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,130
It even easier to do.

1065
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,110
Then you could specifically by by that 
hate for cheap,

1066
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,730
25 bucks,
10 bucks,

1067
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,170
but they also hire people that might be 
multiple twins that mean by the,

1068
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,161
by that,
hey,

1069
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:42,994
you could send the messages that you 
want and you could set up a couple of 

1070
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,430
keywords and 500 accounts.
We'll just start sending those messages,

1071
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,030
fake accounts,
fake accounts,

1072
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,873
so accounts.
How many people are going to go look 

1073
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:53,830
through to find out how many of those 
accounts are fake,

1074
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,613
right?
Do you have to write out the tweet for 

1075
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,190
those fig fig?
It'll fill in the word

1076
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,183
holy shit.
So how do you know if someone is doing 

1077
00:48:02,531 --> 00:48:04,870
that?
Great question.

1078
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,850
They're fighting that on youtube or 
facebook,

1079
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,450
twitter,
the finding it everywhere and they're in

1080
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:09,830
it,
right?

1081
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,350
How do they know?
Well,

1082
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,184
they,
they can tell by the algorithms in the 

1083
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:15,140
computer.
Programmers can figure it out,

1084
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,990
can make fake accounts for sure,
and that's why I went twitter,

1085
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:18,824
instagram,
they can do a flush of all those Bot 

1086
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,300
accounts and so you'll see a lot of 
people's followers like Kim Kardashians.

1087
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,440
She lost like 3 million because there 
were a bunch of Bot accounts.

1088
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,530
Fake accounts.
Well,

1089
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:28,364
there's so many fake shit.
I thought she lost three minute when 

1090
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:32,810
people saw her real ass.
Good Lord.

1091
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,010
Really?
Did you see that?

1092
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,620
No,
I've seen the port now.

1093
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,400
Did you see that Mexican disaster?
No,

1094
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,640
she was on the beach in Mexico and she 
didn't have her own photographer.

1095
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,310
Here's the thing,
do whatever you want.

1096
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,760
Don't want to body shame.
But yes I do,

1097
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,910
but let me just explain my position on 
this.

1098
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,820
When she shows,
when she shows all these pictures of her

1099
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:54,763
giant perfect ass,
she's showing an extremely unrealistic 

1100
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:00,680
representation of a human being.

1101
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,873
So what she does is she hires a 
photographer to follow her everywhere 

1102
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:04,784
and take pictures,
and then they photoshop the shit out of 

1103
00:49:06,561 --> 00:49:08,900
him.
They cleaned away all the lumps and then

1104
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:10,280
she looks amazing.
Right?

1105
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,710
So while she was on the beach,
they were.

1106
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,190
They were taking pictures of her and she
didn't know they were there.

1107
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,930
That is a dumper that's gross.
That is a thing that's not real.

1108
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,793
That is all fat that someone stuffed 
into your ass like a giant diaper and 

1109
00:49:25,431 --> 00:49:26,264
when they smoothed it out and put it on 
instagram with all the retouches and 

1110
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:30,734
everything like that,
this forces women to like think that 

1111
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:36,170
this is possible,
but this is normal.

1112
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,033
My Girl's ass beats by the way,
but it's reel to reel and she's got a 

1113
00:49:40,071 --> 00:49:42,860
body that it makes sense and she makes 
her look like Mr.

1114
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,783
Burns as like if you have a giant head 
and then a tiny little nose like one of 

1115
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:48,920
them plastic surgery knows people are 
going to go,

1116
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,680
hey,
this isn't right.

1117
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:52,843
Like you did something weird.
She's what she's doing is not only not 

1118
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,390
hot.
You could promise she becomes famous and

1119
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:01,170
then it becomes a thing that people do 
down here.

1120
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,680
Hold on.
Remember when we're talking about wigs,

1121
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:05,570
we weren't you here when we're talking 
about powdered wigs.

1122
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:08,150
Was that you?
As you made a big think about that?

1123
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,373
These fucking guys with syphilis that 
were losing their hair and started 

1124
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:14,540
wearing wigs.
Everybody started shaving their head and

1125
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:17,810
wearing those goddamn countered with 
because they looked like those guys.

1126
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,590
They wanted to be cool.
You cannot hang on Kim.

1127
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,440
Credentialing to make an ass as cool.
My man.

1128
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,800
No,
that's not a real class.

1129
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,693
She didn't make gas cool.
J Lo made assets way before Kim 

1130
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:28,760
Kardashians.

1131
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,220
I saw legit,
super legit.

1132
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,580
Legit.
That's a real class.

1133
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,940
This is a disaster.
This is my problem with Kim Kardashian.

1134
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,350
Well not my problem.
Kim Kardashian.

1135
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:42,510
And granted she's influenced a lot of 
people and I would not,

1136
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,350
I would not kick her out of bed.
I look at those because those pictures,

1137
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,290
those pictures are being sent to a 
cartoonist,

1138
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,520
you know,
whatever.

1139
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,890
But um,
they're not real.

1140
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:53,240
The problem is,
is her sister who little sister.

1141
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:55,820
So like my nanny's daughters always 
around our house.

1142
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:58,940
She's 12,
she's in seventh grade.

1143
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,140
Every most girls,
especially in middle school,

1144
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,540
high school.
Everyone looks at Kylie Jenner.

1145
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,740
She's a fucking let you sprints Diana.
Like they think she's the shit.

1146
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,110
Have you seen what that bitch has gone 
through?

1147
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,153
Its in saying the plastic surgery said 
you're talking complete reconstruction 

1148
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:20,480
of her face,
body ass,

1149
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,710
titties,
ribs,

1150
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,210
completely different person.
Go reconstruct.

1151
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,073
It's not Smith shaved her chin down,
yes and cheekbones and make her look 

1152
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:33,041
like Kim and hurt us and they cut into 
the bone in her jaw when she was 16.

1153
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,143
What the fuck are we doing?
But now all these little girls look up 

1154
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,120
to her like she's this huge role model 
and I asked him like why do you,

1155
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,130
why?
Why do you like her?

1156
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,200
And like just the life.
And then you know,

1157
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,120
she,
she comes out with all this stuff.

1158
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:47,954
She has lube aton.
She's driving guy because all of a 

1159
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,200
sudden they think like that.
Oh that's what I.

1160
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,550
that's what I get to big wigs,
big ways.

1161
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,480
The same thing.
So same goddamn thing.

1162
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:57,563
And so those dudes wearing wigs that 
everybody sees and they think they're 

1163
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,350
the shit and so they want to copy them.
That's why it's dangerous.

1164
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:03,980
It's dangerous.
Different though it is,

1165
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:07,100
but it's not same fishes but it's,
it's the same theory.

1166
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:08,930
It's the same thing that happens to 
people,

1167
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,190
but what she's doing is bonkers.
It's,

1168
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,253
but it doesn't matter.
It becomes a trend and then people get 

1169
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,700
sucked into that trend and she becomes 
important.

1170
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,770
Here's why I'm mad at myself.
I'm not mad at her.

1171
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:20,370
Stop it all though.
I don't want to look at these pictures.

1172
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:21,990
You stop at Jamie.
Jamie,

1173
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,240
Jamie,
Jamie,

1174
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:26,680
Jamie.
I'm the one explaining all of it.

1175
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,520
He'll come in and Jamie will come into 
here.

1176
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,170
What happened with beyonce and Jay z?
I'll go,

1177
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,470
no,
I'm Jay.

1178
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:33,470
I'm with you,
man.

1179
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,330
Did you hear the tweet?
Kanye and Jay z are back together.

1180
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,980
Get them as fucking Ritalin,
but with her.

1181
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:48,470
What's.
What's I get why people are going to go.

1182
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:50,150
She's beautiful.
I'm mad at myself being like,

1183
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,051
God damn.
She's fine.

1184
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:53,720
She's feeling she's hot.
She's not an ugly woman.

1185
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,980
No,
no.

1186
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,650
She's sexy now.
You need a young daughter.

1187
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,060
Both.
Are you talking about Kim?

1188
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,193
Oh,
Kim.

1189
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,033
Kim's great.
I'm talking about Kylie who I think 

1190
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,240
she's 21,
but before you know basic white girl,

1191
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:06,074
average flat ass white girl.
Then now she's this video vixen and I'm 

1192
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,770
not mad at her and she thinks that ass.
It'd be like a water balloon.

1193
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,020
Have you ever felt?
No.

1194
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,570
What's it like?
Pretty Glorious.

1195
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,650
Really?
A fake one?

1196
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:18,980
No,
no,

1197
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,490
no.
Not.

1198
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,520
Not if they have implants,
but they can take fat from their stomach

1199
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:25,320
or their size and they inject the fat 
and ugly ass no different.

1200
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,100
Right.
But when they

1201
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,933
walked over to the bathroom and then you
see their ask going back and forth like 

1202
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:31,440
a water bed.
Doesn't that freak you out?

1203
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,743
It was a.
There was a video of what does that 

1204
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:39,800
young age as lately Zalea,
whatever her name is.

1205
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,230
There was a video of her shaking her ass
and someone sent it to me.

1206
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:43,950
They go,
dude,

1207
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,960
what the fuck is this?
Was it cool?

1208
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,870
No.
She's wearing these skin tight pants and

1209
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:49,704
as she's shaking her ass,
it's like you ever try to fuck on a 

1210
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,500
waterbed?
Yeah,

1211
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:53,400
it's a nightmare.
Yeah.

1212
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:54,263
I had one when I was 21.
It was a disaster and as a kid and then 

1213
00:53:56,281 --> 00:54:00,180
I swapped it out for one with Baffles,
which is actually pretty bad ass.

1214
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,680
A water bed that has.
Yeah.

1215
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,620
Baffles are it.
It's not one giant bag.

1216
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,800
It's a bunch of tubes.
That makes sense.

1217
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,580
When you get in there,
it's pretty firm,

1218
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:10,640
but you feel the cool,
the warm plots.

1219
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,580
It's pretty dope but you get and you 
could fuck with one of those,

1220
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,910
but with the other one it's like trying 
to fuck on a whale the fucking night.

1221
00:54:22,401 --> 00:54:23,234
It's like trying to fuck while your 
paddleboarding is trying to fuck on one 

1222
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,590
of those.
Fuck the one of those vibrating machine.

1223
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,900
It's just a night.
Yeah,

1224
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:30,863
so that's what her ass looks like.
She's shaking her ass and it's going 

1225
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:38,571
back and forth and back and forth like 
some crazy ass camel thing.

1226
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:41,570
Like you're storing water in Medicaid 
thing,

1227
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:46,110
scalable,
showing fruit back,

1228
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,650
dooring water in it.
It's like there's something going on.

1229
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,810
It doesn't make any sense.
Who is this?

1230
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,470
I mean that's fine right there.
That's not the video.

1231
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,420
There was a video of her dancing 
onstage.

1232
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,640
I wish I didn't like that stuff.
Pink Pants.

1233
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:03,750
Yeah,
but this is like,

1234
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,880
this is a little amusement as will be 
looking at different colors.

1235
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,010
It's negative,
you know,

1236
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,780
but that,
that that's the culture we live in.

1237
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:17,781
That's what we like or not.
We sir no big titties and disaster and I

1238
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:20,280
don't like it.
I didn't ask that.

1239
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,030
I like big cities like crossfit checks.
I like chicks.

1240
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:27,300
The two squats and shit.
I like chicks that looked good.

1241
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,760
It looks strong and healthy.
That's what looks good.

1242
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,220
Strong,
healthy type of chicks.

1243
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,130
Kaolin well he's not here.
Let's leave him out of this.

1244
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:39,310
Callan loves like the big bulky,
like shredded girl who if she had a dick

1245
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:39,641
like,
oh,

1246
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:41,280
that makes sense.
Yeah.

1247
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:43,020
No,
I mean the girls that look like girls,

1248
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,400
girls will lift.

1249
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah.
When you see their ass,

1250
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:52,860
you know that isn't earned ass.
That's not some fat experiment.

1251
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,753
Dr Frankenstein's lab.
I don't have to picture you with a tube 

1252
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,830
running down your mouth.
Keep you alive,

1253
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,820
but you gotTa fucking your noses taped 
up and you're lying there with your eyes

1254
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,770
rolled back in your head while they 
fucking ass.

1255
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Like a caulking gun is to both at the 
same finish line though.

1256
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:15,000
It's just,
it's not healthy.

1257
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,090
They're not as vibrant.
I see a woman that's in shape.

1258
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,080
She had some counselors were like,
I'm sure like a man who's in shape.

1259
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:26,380
It's the same thing to people like 
people like things that are healthy.

1260
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,410
It seems like you're talking about sex,
right?

1261
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,430
Well,
sex,

1262
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,470
you don't want to have sex with somebody
who's sick.

1263
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:34,480
Right?
You don't want to have sex.

1264
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:35,323
Someone who doesn't feel good,
you don't want to have sex with someone 

1265
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,800
who's barely making it.

1266
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,633
Like if you get a staph infection 
because someone's been pumping fat into 

1267
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:45,070
your asshole and then all of a sudden 
you're feeling feeling sad,

1268
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,810
but you still have this big ass.
Is that sexy?

1269
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:48,040
No,
that's not fun.

1270
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:48,903
It's not exciting.
Like you're looking at an unhealthy 

1271
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,593
persons body.
Like you look at her body like that's 

1272
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:57,550
not a working out body.
She hasn't worked out for.

1273
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,384
She does because that's a lazy person's 
body results and I'm not saying lazy 

1274
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:05,320
person like mom,
that is a full time job.

1275
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,790
Listen,
if you can't work out,

1276
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,650
I'm not blaming you.
If you don't want to work out,

1277
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:09,484
I'm not blaming you,
but if your fucking job is only to be 

1278
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,760
professional,
hot chick and that's your body,

1279
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,220
you better work out.
Yeah,

1280
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,550
you got to get on that horse.
At least eat or good.

1281
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:22,180
That's what I'm talking about.

1282
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,310
I liked that.
I also love that.

1283
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,420
I'd like to talk a Gal who does some 
dead lifts.

1284
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,330
I like how she's using those path to 
cover shins.

1285
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,590
Something gross about girls scarred up 
shins.

1286
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,473
Unless they fight,
unless they do Moitai then it's kind of 

1287
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,420
even then.
Then it's hot again.

1288
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:41,920
Leave and then gangster ass chick lit.
That's a good picture jamie,

1289
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,750
but I feel like bodies should be earned 
in the gym.

1290
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,040
I mean I just feel like pumping some 
stuff into your ass,

1291
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,250
but it's a trick.
What about titties?

1292
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,450
That's where I vacillate.
Exactly,

1293
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,200
but here's the thing,
you can't earn titties.

1294
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,960
That's why I let it go,
because you can't earn them.

1295
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:06,460
You can earn an ass.
He kind of subject a little bit.

1296
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,730
Little bit.
Almost genetics.

1297
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,351
Yeah,
but I mean,

1298
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,760
come on,
let's be just be honest,

1299
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:10,840
but we're talking about most.

1300
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,240
You can do some squats and deadlifts and
lunges,

1301
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:16,690
build that SMP thing.
How much you could probably affect it.

1302
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,583
You put.
You might be able to not be able to get 

1303
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:20,860
to Jayla levels,
but I bet you get to pretty perky levels

1304
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,750
sometimes.
I don't know.

1305
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,160
I don't know what he was doing.
What?

1306
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:26,530
I don't know how they're working out.
I don't know if they got a good trainer.

1307
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:28,780
I don't know if they lift heavy,
they'll have to see the program.

1308
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,160
Yeah.
You'd have to see their program.

1309
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:30,994
You have to find out what their diet is 
because people make a lot of goddamn 

1310
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,750
excuses.
Genetics or genetic,

1311
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,720
like Jamie's not going to get as big as 
fucking Yoel Romero.

1312
00:58:38,721 --> 00:58:40,210
It's just not in the cards.
One hundred percent.

1313
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:40,990
True.
Right.

1314
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,823
Genetics do come into factor,
but when you just blame genetics for 

1315
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:45,191
everything,
it's like,

1316
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,780
okay,
but did you work?

1317
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,680
How hard did you work?
Did you try?

1318
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,430
Did you advance at all,
like where was your starting point?

1319
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:53,860
Where are you at now and how much effort
did you put in along the way?

1320
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,250
You're cool with titties because that's 
a real woman's ass.

1321
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,040
She is so real.
Forty held sheedy 85 years old.

1322
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,870
Fifty one.
The good thing about that,

1323
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:05,743
you can shoot loads in there all day 
long and nothing's happening all day 

1324
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:10,570
long.
No one's home game over.

1325
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:15,210
They're about to have a kid or to.
Everybody's trying to.

1326
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,020
You're all practicing.
I would try.

1327
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,810
I saw that the,
uh,

1328
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,631
the vine,
I was like,

1329
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:20,464
I would in pregnant her right now and 
figuring out was probably still viable 

1330
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:25,220
for another four or five years.
Her genetics.

1331
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,340
She is a straight smoke show.
Yeah.

1332
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:32,870
That's superior genetics.
She Never Latina superior genetics.

1333
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:35,030
Correct.
But also hard work.

1334
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,980
She works out hard,
man.

1335
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,680
You ever see her dance routines and all 
this stuff that she does?

1336
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:43,670
She's carving out hard hundred percent.
Yeah.

1337
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:44,504
I mean that's,
she's a professional hot chick was also 

1338
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:48,530
a singer who's also an actress.
She has talent.

1339
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,330
These other groups come out,
do not write,

1340
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:52,000
but she also works hard.
See,

1341
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,380
that's what I think.
That's sexy.

1342
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,850
Yeah,
and that's what I think.

1343
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,400
Like if you want to spy,
like if you want to be a man,

1344
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:00,800
right?
You wouldn't be built like the rock.

1345
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,693
Right.
I see the rock on the fucking instagram 

1346
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,510
in the gym.
Every God damn day we're here.

1347
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,910
We're getting it done.
You know,

1348
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,210
nobody works harder.
Alright.

1349
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,410
Have a good day.
Everybody.

1350
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,370
He's like all inspiring and shit.
He's shocked to the fucking gills.

1351
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:14,630
He looks huge,
right?

1352
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:19,280
That isn't clearly,
but that's an earned physique.

1353
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,810
Does not stuffing fucking silicon plates
in his muscles to puff them up.

1354
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,733
He's not injecting synthol in there to 
look like one of them crazy 

1355
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,530
possibilities and other stuff though.
It's a four,

1356
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:33,290
but he's working out.
He's working out hard.

1357
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,960
I don't know what his test levels are.
The probably elevated,

1358
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:41,260
but the point is even with drugs that's 
accessible.

1359
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,410
See,
it's still hard work,

1360
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,530
but yes,
it's still a real muscle.

1361
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,443
Yes.
Where I draw the line look of girls 

1362
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:53,850
could take a steroid that made them grow
an ass through.

1363
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,720
Wouldn't be a flat ass on the planet 
Earth Gangland.

1364
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,583
There would be no girls.
The difference between girls and men is 

1365
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,990
that because there's a lot of guys don't
want to take steroids.

1366
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,651
They're like,
fuck that.

1367
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:04,730
I'm not going to hold.
Some don't.

1368
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:09,770
If steroids existed for women's assets,
who would be as common as botox?

1369
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,520
They would all be jamming it.

1370
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,720
It'd be like here die.
Every girl would have a fat ass.

1371
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,090
If you could afford it.
If they could figure out a way to break.

1372
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:20,924
Like I said,
I was driving on the street the other 

1373
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:22,640
day.
I saw a sign that said Botox.

1374
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:23,960
$12.
God,

1375
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,580
Doug,
that's a deal for sure.

1376
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,520
Don't go there.
You Bell's Palsy.

1377
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,560
He had a stroke.
Apparently.

1378
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:34,394
Like a very tricky process.
You've got to know when you're shooting 

1379
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:37,530
that stuff.
Fuck yeah.

1380
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,000
I saw a deal for a lazy guy surgery by 
one kid,

1381
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,900
one in Venice by no,
you cannot do that.

1382
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:45,734
You cannot skimp on your eyeballs.
Please go to a reputable laser eye 

1383
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:51,870
surgeon.
I only get one next week.

1384
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,580
You don't want to deal on a deal on ice 
surgery or surgery.

1385
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:57,423
Implants or tattoos,
you hear about that one person that got 

1386
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:01,430
arrested,
they were given.

1387
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:02,264
People ask jobs and they pretended to be
a doctor and they weren't a doctor and 

1388
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:07,560
they were shooting all kinds of stuff 
into people's assets.

1389
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:12,561
There wasn't cement cement into the ass 
of these people.

1390
01:02:13,131 --> 01:02:15,860
Oh my God,
God did wrong with.

1391
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,140
People are crazy.
They're suiting rental form.

1392
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:19,370
Kardashians.
I blamed kindergarten.

1393
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,483
She

1394
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,310
because that lady is working at 
walgreens like,

1395
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:24,144
fuck,
I look like Kim Kardashian grab her ass 

1396
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:28,080
and you literally feel a rock of some 
and they're like,

1397
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:32,850
what do you have a given tumor?
This cancer is this fucking kidney stone

1398
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,570
that didn't pass lodged up and your ass 
cheeks nuts,

1399
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,473
man.
In many ways through your hip just 

1400
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,850
lodged itself.
But here's the thing with tidies,

1401
01:02:41,851 --> 01:02:43,950
I'm all about them.
I'm all about implants.

1402
01:02:43,951 --> 01:02:47,490
We go back to the thing.
You cannot earn big breasts.

1403
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,453
You can't earn them.
So what about guys with calf implants 

1404
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,510
that you celebrate that?
No.

1405
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,000
John was Needham.
Jon Jones needs.

1406
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:55,500
I mean he doesn't need them.
How about that?

1407
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:59,330
Well,
Jon Jones has the calf have an ankle and

1408
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,600
he doesn't,
he doesn't care,

1409
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,870
not like a Samoan ankle.
Here's the capital of like a white girl.

1410
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:04,704
And by the way,
there's a glorious picture of Mark Hunt 

1411
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,090
with a fanny pack that I put on 
instagram today.

1412
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,980
And a whole cogan stash you.
How about that fanny pack though?

1413
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:15,120
Pretty gangster.
So please by support.

1414
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:18,370
Mark Hunt's new book is out now.
Um,

1415
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,561
yeah,
look at that.

1416
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,330
It's a fucking camel.
Fanny pack.

1417
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,350
Extra points.
He sells gangster.

1418
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,520
He's the most gangster guy ever.
I do love that.

1419
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:28,920
Stash.
You know,

1420
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,850
I saw was a scary gentlemen an article 
though,

1421
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,950
an interview they did with him.
That was a very,

1422
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,690
uh,
sad and disappointed.

1423
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,570
You know,
like he was telling us.

1424
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,011
No,
no,

1425
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:42,170
no.
That was terrible task.

1426
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,330
So rough scale overcame that.
It wasn't about that.

1427
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,270
It was about his brain damage.
Oh really?

1428
01:03:48,271 --> 01:03:49,104
What was he saying?
Saying these are already starting to 

1429
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:50,904
slur his words and forget things.
That mustache and fanny pack shows me 

1430
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:54,564
that I looked for signs that when I saw 
the mustache in that fanny pack was 

1431
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,580
Lorius.
You can't be every day when I run dia,

1432
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,560
I don't wear it to the Goddamn 
supermarket like a psycho.

1433
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,730
I do.
I do.

1434
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,740
They make sense though when you think 
about them.

1435
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,270
They're awesome.
I just don't,

1436
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,520
I just don't do shit.
But.

1437
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,600
So he was saying it.
I'd be done.

1438
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:13,660
Okay.
I'll give you one of my thanks.

1439
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,020
But uh,
he was saying that he has brain trauma.

1440
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,050
No Shit Sir.
Yeah,

1441
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:19,771
no shit.
For sure.

1442
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:21,990
We know,
but he was talking about it,

1443
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,320
that he's slurring his words and just 
having trouble remembering things.

1444
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,150
But then you also said he was born to do
this.

1445
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,540
What are we supposed to do?
And if he dies doing this,

1446
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,160
he'd be fine with that.
He put a,

1447
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:35,790
there's a caveat to that.
He said if I die in the ring,

1448
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,010
like I want to die in the ring,
go out on my shield,

1449
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,490
but it better not be from someone who's 
on pds.

1450
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,353
Yeah.
And that's a really good point for 

1451
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:47,610
people over the last five people he 
fought and he tested positive for PDS or

1452
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,710
tested?
No,

1453
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:52,380
I think it was all pd because it was 
brought all of them.

1454
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,230
It was allister's test,
positive in the past,

1455
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:00,470
these for doom and I'm jake bigfoot and 
jds right now is um,

1456
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,680
you know,
that's just a diuretic,

1457
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:03,480
but I'm just saying as far as failing 
tests,

1458
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,370
if you would just go by failed tests 
almost every.

1459
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:06,323
If you look at Mark Hunt's career and he
went through and went guys test 

1460
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,801
positive.
You're like,

1461
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:11,634
oh my,
no wonder he's infuriated at apple and 

1462
01:05:14,461 --> 01:05:18,400
he has brain trauma.
Superior genetics like Mark Hunt's

1463
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,233
genetics are insane.
Like his ability to take a punch for 

1464
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:22,384
years was ungodly.
You would see him get hit and you'd be 

1465
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,530
like,
this doesn't even make sense.

1466
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:28,420
Is that he took cro,
cop head kicks,

1467
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,160
Bro.
What are you working at?

1468
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,450
What you show me?
Ah,

1469
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,010
let's just go through them.
Cro.

1470
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:36,970
Cop.
Our Silva is tested positive.

1471
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,460
Did Verdugo test positive for somebody?
Yes,

1472
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,650
for doom.
When did he test positive?

1473
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,300
Um,
awhile ago.

1474
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,820
Okay.
So a positive,

1475
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,600
steep pays 100 percent legit as clean as
they come.

1476
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,360
There's big Silva again.
How dare you.

1477
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,253
He had a drop on them the first time you
saw crushed him the second time because 

1478
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,440
the second time you side was involved in
bigfoot.

1479
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,020
Silva wasn't on the juice and he got the
first time.

1480
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,780
The first time bigfoot Silva was on the 
Jews.

1481
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:06,640
He tested positive.
Not only that,

1482
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:09,670
he tested negative before the fight and 
positive after the fight,

1483
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:10,683
which means he juiced himself up before 
the fight and they had that incredible 

1484
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,090
epic five round war.

1485
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,983
Remember that fight and it was amazing.
It was so epic that Dana White had a 

1486
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:20,914
bunch of Mark Hunt roots of fights too.
They made like for two before to ever 

1487
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:27,514
happened.
They printed up the jackets for two and 

1488
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,060
he sent me one and I was like,
dude,

1489
01:06:31,061 --> 01:06:31,894
I'm all in.
That was one of the craziest fights of 

1490
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:36,520
all time and then a week later came big 
foot test positive and he's like,

1491
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:39,700
this dumb motherfucker like this could 
have been like this.

1492
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,990
Incredible.
Yeah.

1493
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:42,940
I mean it was just the Joshua Klitschko 
style.

1494
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,560
Incredible.
Incredible matchup.

1495
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:47,340
Right?
So He tests positive and then you saw it

1496
01:06:47,341 --> 01:06:50,740
as on his ass.
Then they come back for the second fight

1497
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,860
and mark hunches smokes them in the 
first round.

1498
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:56,260
I mean just ran through them,
but you just look at him.

1499
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:58,380
So he got big foot jds is under,
you know,

1500
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,400
he's had his issues.

1501
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:00,283
He got Ben Rothwell busted.
What I was going to say though is if 

1502
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,550
anybody legitimately has a reason for 
using steroids,

1503
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:07,563
it's bigfoot because bigfoot has real 
gigantism and he had a tumor removed 

1504
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,614
from his pituitary gland.
Like his body doesn't produce 

1505
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,770
testosterone,
right?

1506
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,970
Or any hormones,
right?

1507
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,740
Body's a wreck.
This is a.

1508
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,660
This is a gray area because it's not 
great because it's brain surgery.

1509
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:24,640
He had a tumor on his pituitary aware of
that.

1510
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,820
Look at him.
So even even if you get,

1511
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,683
if you give them trt,
you'd have to regulate so much where he 

1512
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,384
doesn't have such an advantage.
I'm not saying you should cause him 

1513
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:34,930
without.
It is awful.

1514
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,590
You can't compete.
I'm saying more than that.

1515
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:40,900
Maybe you shouldn't be able to compete.
That's what I'm saying.

1516
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,670
That's what I'm saying.
This isn't the business for you.

1517
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:44,770
If you have to have testosterone to 
compete,

1518
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,170
unless you want to go to Russia or 
Japan,

1519
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,780
it's skin birthed out there.
Oh,

1520
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:50,900
well,
he's probably done it.

1521
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:53,620
I mean he's had so many,
so many crazy crazy fights,

1522
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,560
but he was the first guy to Tko Faye 
door.

1523
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,543
Yeah,
he was at that shit when he mounted 

1524
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,850
them,
like ankle lock in his.

1525
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:01,684
Just giant finger going like this and 
then just did fader was done because 

1526
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,950
fader in all seriousness should've been 
a two.

1527
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:09,784
Oh,
five pounder.

1528
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:15,190
He's just a tank who's just unbelievably
talented and ridiculously skillful

1529
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,160
in his.
His execution and just figured out a way

1530
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,420
to win was lightening fast.
Fucked a lot of people out.

1531
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:23,263
But God damn.
Could you imagine if he got himself and 

1532
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,900
ferocious shape at two?
Oh,

1533
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:28,900
five nuts,
man.

1534
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,350
Two 40 2:30,
2:30,

1535
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:34,260
2:30
2:28.

1536
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,150
Good.
Solid.

1537
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,860
Twenty pounds of fat.
One hundred percent.

1538
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,260
Yeah.
So he's really like to 18,

1539
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,790
which ain't shit to cut to two.
Oh,

1540
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,510
five.
Okay.

1541
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:44,420
Well Anthony Johnson goes,
what if he changed his diet?

1542
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:46,250
Who knows?
He might literally be like two,

1543
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:47,200
oh seven.
You know,

1544
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,230
if he lost all that weight,
explosive a real belly,

1545
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:52,670
and I'm like,
Gosh.

1546
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,900
And Dad got.
Yeah,

1547
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:57,170
I mean that might be 25 pounds.
You know what I mean?

1548
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:58,004
He literally might be like to 10.
Here's back to marketing and this is 

1549
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,210
bombing.
I gotta get this out.

1550
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,470
So he says,
Hey,

1551
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:05,180
I see signs of brain trauma,
right?

1552
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,960
Like I'm slurring my words speech than 
isn't he a main event next month?

1553
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,030
Yeah.
Like at what point does,

1554
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,450
when you hear that,
does the UFC and the commissioning of.

1555
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,450
Oh,
let's stop.

1556
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:15,960
Let's stop.
Let's stop you.

1557
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,040
You're slurring your words and who's 
fighting that?

1558
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:20,080
Russian cat.
Oh,

1559
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,390
like 11.
Right.

1560
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:27,391
A big fight for fucking market.
Which Russian guys get to Bora.

1561
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:32,840
I forget that there's so many goddamn 
Russians now from Russia.

1562
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,140
Russians are taking over the world,
um,

1563
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,640
that Russian got it stopped.
Stephan struve.

1564
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:38,893
That's pretty God damn impressive.
Any other Molena tattooed hosting round 

1565
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,270
is bad because we're identical.
Mulana tattoo that the grandma had a big

1566
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:44,961
fan.
Yeah,

1567
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:48,600
I guess you're welcome movie.
Um,

1568
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,230
yeah,
that guy's a bad ass.

1569
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,250
He's have a sweet left high.
Kick it doesn't do much orthodox.

1570
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:55,880
Yeah.
Just uh,

1571
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,000
you know what I'm saying?
If you're marketing,

1572
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,501
you're like,
all right,

1573
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:58,334
I'll do it.
At least I'm the main event on 

1574
01:09:58,701 --> 01:09:59,210
Australia.

1575
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,043
But at what point do we have someone 
where we have a guy like the golden 

1576
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:07,220
snitch in the UFC who is watching out 
for that stuff is going,

1577
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:09,000
man.
So Mark Hunt doing every word.

1578
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,260
He has some real issues.
Man.

1579
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,113
You know,
where someone to look out to take care 

1580
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:15,260
of these guys because mark come.
What's going on and shield I don't want.

1581
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,183
I don't want to watch marketing 10 years
shitting his pants and drooling and 

1582
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,390
doesn't remember his fight career.
Right?

1583
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,720
I don't give a fuck if he repeats that 
Russian guy in Australia.

1584
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,420
He has nothing.
He has nothing to prove.

1585
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,670
Yeah.
What's it do for him?

1586
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,950
Well,
at a certain point you really,

1587
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:31,893
you have to have some sort of a 
regulation that stops people from 

1588
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:35,684
hurting themselves when they're,
they've taken too much damage and they 

1589
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:39,230
can't make good decisions anymore.
Right?

1590
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,640
But then it becomes a personal freedom 
issue.

1591
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,493
Free will,
right?

1592
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,080
Because because there's a certain amount
of damage you're going to take,

1593
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:45,914
like there's fights that probably 
shouldn't get made like Francis and 

1594
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:49,671
gone.
Oh,

1595
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:50,960
versus almost anybody.

1596
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,290
Almost anybody says agreeing to getting 
your fucking head scrambled.

1597
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,133
Yeah.
I want to see what happens with 

1598
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,134
allister.
I want to see if allister can survive 

1599
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,100
for allister.
Yeah.

1600
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:07,400
Because in Ghana clip some once and 
allister could be in deep,

1601
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:08,390
deep trouble.
Also,

1602
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,320
Francis has never fought a strike or a 
high level striker,

1603
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,710
let alone the best of all time.
The division,

1604
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,660
but you don't have the same chin so it 
doesn't.

1605
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:17,250
It's interesting.
Match up fast.

1606
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,860
Too many scary.
Allister's Francis Francis.

1607
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:21,960
Well alster is clearly fast too,
but.

1608
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,150
But Francis always do is touch that 
chin.

1609
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,760
Once true Francis puts people to sleep.

1610
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,420
I got to see him do at a high level,
really high level.

1611
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,240
Jump on the train when you have the 
capabilities,

1612
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:39,270
but when you watched it with a Lawsky,
Arloski is already down down the slope.

1613
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,000
You know,
he's already slide and way down and he's

1614
01:11:43,001 --> 01:11:43,834
been knocked out.
Who knows how many times been down the 

1615
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:45,520
slope.
Yeah,

1616
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,740
he's been down the slope,
so that was impressive.

1617
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,710
It was a good test because Arlovski 
still knocked out.

1618
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,780
Travis Brown just a couple of years ago.
He still cannot.

1619
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,660
Yeah,
I still can fuck you up,

1620
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,500
you know,
if you make.

1621
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,390
If you fuck up.
True.

1622
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,230
I'm just saying that the fucked up big 
foot too.

1623
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,170
Yeah,
that's true.

1624
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,370
That was a while ago though,
Joe.

1625
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,740
It was.
He went on that tier.

1626
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,740
Yeah.
Now it's over,

1627
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:08,540
but yeah.
Well Steve Big Steve ended that.

1628
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,070
But a guy like I think jds to be a good 
test for him.

1629
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:15,280
Alistair overeem be pretty good.
Yeah,

1630
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,031
no,
for sure.

1631
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:16,864
Look,
it's a great denim on board because 

1632
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:20,140
right now to be honest,
we need them.

1633
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,610
We need a young killer,
like a guide to bring some life into the

1634
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:25,444
heavyweight division.
He just has everything going as far as 

1635
01:12:27,941 --> 01:12:30,700
like his ability knock it dead,
his look.

1636
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,833
I mean he just jacked that the market 
believes can be tough until his English 

1637
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,510
is better.
I don't think so.

1638
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,920
Really check was coming out of the 
corner.

1639
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:42,970
If he starts American people at heavy 
Wayne and you can get a highlight reel,

1640
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:44,790
the heavyweight champion based work,
working people,

1641
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,390
he's from Cleveland and he's not a draw.
He knows.

1642
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:51,010
I don't understand it.
Is it a marketing thing?

1643
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:51,963
One hundred percent.
I haven't done it right or I'm not 

1644
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,590
blaming the US public has to jump on the
public.

1645
01:12:56,591 --> 01:12:57,460
It's not the UFC.

1646
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,820
I mean still doing his thing.
He's doing their thing with them,

1647
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:01,654
but sometimes the stars don't align 
where you become this crossover pop 

1648
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:09,280
culture icon ass public.
They're like a white guy standard.

1649
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,690
What?
He's a firefighter though.

1650
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:13,030
Standard.
But he's knocked out everyone's standard

1651
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,800
va.
How is that standard?

1652
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:18,730
It just people want it and.
But He's real humble and you know,

1653
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,360
well spoken and she's not cocky so they 
don't.

1654
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,433
They were drawn to negativity,
withdrawn to the John Jones and the 

1655
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:27,560
economy,
you know,

1656
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,430
they want that kind of that it wasn't 
really negative.

1657
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,560
He's not talking about.
But she talks a lot of shit.

1658
01:13:32,561 --> 01:13:35,010
He's going to be hot.
Takes deep take.

1659
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,290
He's working his ass off.
Training hard to win the fight.

1660
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,730
Isn't that crazy?
That.

1661
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,670
Well wIth connor,
the thing that sort of sensational about

1662
01:13:42,671 --> 01:13:43,504
him is he has both of those things.
He has fighting ability and he also has 

1663
01:13:46,331 --> 01:13:47,164
this crazy personality that's magnetic 
cord where steve page just has the 

1664
01:13:50,741 --> 01:13:51,700
fighting ability and just.

1665
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,380
I don't know,
I just love his work ethic.

1666
01:13:53,381 --> 01:13:55,300
I love the fact that he still has a 
firearm gig.

1667
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:55,990
I love it,
man.

1668
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,823
Not that people dead.
Just your heavyweight champion of the 

1669
01:13:58,481 --> 01:14:00,760
world is not a draw,
which is insane.

1670
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:01,720
Yeah.
I know.

1671
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:05,960
And even a francis knocks out.
Allister knocked out steve Bay.

1672
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,730
There's no way to draw.
Yeah,

1673
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,873
it.
There's just these and I don't have the 

1674
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:13,060
formula.
Trust me.

1675
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:13,894
The ucb hit me up if I did.
There's this weird superstar soup and 

1676
01:14:17,071 --> 01:14:19,870
you have a few ingredients in your myth.
We don't know what the others are,

1677
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:21,430
but guys hit it.
Yeah,

1678
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:23,680
you hit it almost sunk by chance.
Yeah.

1679
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,750
They just come around once a every now 
and then.

1680
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:27,370
Conner wasn't like that early in his 
career.

1681
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:28,840
Just good.
Not at all.

1682
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:30,700
He was just a great fighter,
you know,

1683
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:34,810
he's just like looking promising and 
then all of a sudden it gets to the ufc.

1684
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:35,823
He feels the crowd,
all the irish people behind him and he 

1685
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:41,860
starts talking shit and going off and 
then people love it and he talks more.

1686
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:42,694
Shit goes off more than he starts 
predicting what round is going to merck 

1687
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:47,950
people in and then he starts pulling it 
off and then he's like,

1688
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,620
who the fuck is that guy?
And everybody goes crazy.

1689
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:55,621
And the thing about john john didn't get
really mainstream espn coverage.

1690
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,320
Good morning America till you went bad.
Then people are like,

1691
01:14:59,321 --> 01:15:00,910
oh,
I want to see that bad ass fight.

1692
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:04,630
He's been amazing for how long he had a 
press conference that he.

1693
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,630
He said,
what I've always said,

1694
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:09,330
he said,
at the end of the day,

1695
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,350
he goes,
uh,

1696
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,890
about him.
I've always said about him.

1697
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,970
He goes,
at the end of the day,

1698
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,570
I'm a bad motherfucker.
I'm a wild motherfucker.

1699
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,750
I want.
And that's what I do.

1700
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:17,950
perfect.
At the end of the day,

1701
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:20,110
that's what said at the end of the day,
I'm a wild motherfucker.

1702
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,160
I'm like,
that's what I would say.

1703
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,180
That's it,
brother.

1704
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,493
Run with that.
I told them that too when I talked to 

1705
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:25,714
him about it.
You know when he wanted to have a 

1706
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:29,040
conversation before he did the podcast 
and you know,

1707
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,310
we wanted to come clean.
I go,

1708
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:31,750
dude,
you're going to make mistakes.

1709
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:33,490
You're a wild motherfucker.
It's okay.

1710
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:34,324
That's.
You don't get to be as good as you are 

1711
01:15:36,101 --> 01:15:36,934
without being a wild motherfucker.
You don't have to apologize for it to 

1712
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,060
john.
If he came out and went,

1713
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:40,900
listen,
me and haley,

1714
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:43,300
I'm going to make some steaks and I 
probably make a lot more.

1715
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,820
I'm a wild motherfucker.
I'm the baddest dude on the planet.

1716
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,650
This is what you get.
Love it or hate it,

1717
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,513
but he dropped them.
I just can't do things that hurt people 

1718
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,410
like the driving fucked up,
smashing into that lady's car.

1719
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,283
You Take away the things that hurt 
people and you just have party and 

1720
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:58,060
having a good time and occasionally do 
blow.

1721
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,570
Nobody's going to care and that's give 
up.

1722
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,540
That's a great guy.
That's a fun guy.

1723
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:02,374
It's like you just gotta make sure you 
avoid hurting other people and then 

1724
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,670
this,
this thyroid thing is the goddamn that's

1725
01:16:09,671 --> 01:16:12,000
the knife in the heart like this.
I said,

1726
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:12,940
you gotta,
you gotta,

1727
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,833
you gotta.
Look into this drought ball stuff with 

1728
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:16,030
the,
with the baseball.

1729
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,520
All these guys who have all these 
problems that gnc.

1730
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:19,354
It's in all these supplements.
I saw that and again I've been roasting 

1731
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,374
john bad because I'm upset.
I'm mad at him because he's my favorite 

1732
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:26,830
fighter,
one of them,

1733
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,160
so it is possible that he could have 
taken something that's trace elements of

1734
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:30,994
this.
I've also seen that other things are 

1735
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:34,084
recognized as that stuff in the task,
but I have a hard time believing that 

1736
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:38,980
you wouldn't know that.

1737
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,940
I know so I have a hard time.
Once they come clean with us,

1738
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,710
they'd come out with this.
I don't think it's ever been proven once

1739
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:45,903
that they said that a person had tested 
positive for something and that that 

1740
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:51,490
person had never actually taken that 
thing.

1741
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:53,130
I don't.
I have not seen that one.

1742
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:54,870
No,
you saw a so thorough it.

1743
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,713
Listen man,
if you have the golden snitch on your 

1744
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:58,990
trail,
you're fucked.

1745
01:16:58,991 --> 01:17:02,230
He's like sherlock holmes of pds.
You are so fucked.

1746
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,590
And again,
Just fucking dead calm about it.

1747
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,220
Not judgmental.
Just the facts going over the details.

1748
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,613
This is what bothered me the little bit 
and why I'm going back and forth on 

1749
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:17,120
John.
If my career was in jeopardy,

1750
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,520
I would be out there be like,
listen,

1751
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:22,010
this is what fucking happened and hear 
me out.

1752
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,790
I'm not going radio silent.
Sending these weird cryptic tweets doing

1753
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:26,240
this.

1754
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,350
Even if my manager like,
dude,

1755
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,750
let's wait.
I'm doing a press comes like listened to

1756
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:30,680
me right now,
man.

1757
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,873
This maybe I took this supplement.
I've never done steroids in my fucking 

1758
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:35,450
life.
That is bullshit.

1759
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,360
Yeah,
but you can't say too much if it's going

1760
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:39,194
to go to some sort of a arbitration or a
trial or I don't know what the process 

1761
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,600
can.
You can if you didn't take it,

1762
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,000
but here's the thing.
He's got to find out how.

1763
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,910
If there is a way that something 
happened,

1764
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,070
a loophole safe you,
maybe it's you,

1765
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:52,953
okay.
Say you take something from gmc and 

1766
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,940
maybe you take a bunch of shit and you 
thought everything was good and then you

1767
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,570
get tested positive before you say 
anything.

1768
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:03,404
I never took steroids.
Like you have to find out what the fuck 

1769
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,580
it is was in those stuff,
those things.

1770
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,443
So you have to report those things and 
then they have to check and then they 

1771
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:13,180
have to independently by those things 
from a shelf,

1772
01:18:13,181 --> 01:18:17,450
from somewhere else to confirmation.
And that's a process.

1773
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:19,460
And this is one of the thing that jeff 
novitsky said.

1774
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:23,630
You got to let the process play out 
before you start accusing john.

1775
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,050
So there'll be a process.
I'm just saying,

1776
01:18:27,051 --> 01:18:29,750
man,
that's not good a sample and be sample.

1777
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:31,520
It's not good.
It's not good.

1778
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:34,970
I just think it could go a long ways 
with his fans and everything going on.

1779
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:37,970
If he came out and was just like,
let me tell you guys,

1780
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,630
you're going to hear this because the 
public right now we see test a,

1781
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:43,730
test b both positive.
Oh fuck steroids.

1782
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,530
He's dead to me.
Um,

1783
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,470
but if you look at a tweet where he said
that he never took steroids,

1784
01:18:49,471 --> 01:18:51,260
his kids,
his heavenly father,

1785
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,340
remember he capitalize.

1786
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,110
Heavenly father.
So skeptical.

1787
01:18:54,111 --> 01:18:55,820
So fuck off.
Fuck off.

1788
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,480
That actually made me go.
Hmm.

1789
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,550
He was on steroids,
huh?

1790
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,331
Yeah,
it'd be too.

1791
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:00,410
I was like,
god damn it.

1792
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,770
Let me put all right.
You clearly understood what he went.

1793
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,860
Heavenly father,
I was like,

1794
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,840
oh,
you're a bad guy sean.

1795
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,670
He's a bad guy.
How about,

1796
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,280
how about john does this?
And we're all like,

1797
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:11,870
oh,
fucking the worst.

1798
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:15,380
Greatest of all time my ass.
Then brian cushing football,

1799
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:18,050
brian cushion captain of the houston 
texans.

1800
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,720
He's been caught I think two or three 
times before.

1801
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,630
Straight up test,
positive for p,

1802
01:19:22,631 --> 01:19:24,290
d,
like straight up steroids.

1803
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:28,190
And he's a monster linebacker.
Have used test again,

1804
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,100
I think your band or he's gonna miss 
like 10 games.

1805
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:34,520
They docked $4,000,000
of his paycheck.

1806
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,190
the media doesn't make it nothing about 
it.

1807
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:40,610
This guy's a superstar Ball.
Of course they're on steroids.

1808
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,970
Everybody who's 360 pounds of solid 
muscle is on steroids.

1809
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,310
But how crazy.
We just give them a ride off,

1810
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:48,020
like they shouldn't be testing those 
guys.

1811
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,790
It's ridiculous,
but he's up.

1812
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:52,220
He's playing a position to where he hits
guys.

1813
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,083
He's taken years off their life.
He's given them bring trauma and he's 

1814
01:19:55,881 --> 01:19:57,770
rocking them.
Jack to the gills.

1815
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,050
That's what people want to see.
If you want to see football,

1816
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,180
okay,
you want to see big giant guys colliding

1817
01:20:02,181 --> 01:20:03,014
with each other.
You don't see natural athletes are out 

1818
01:20:04,611 --> 01:20:07,100
there like trying to fucking pound whey 
protein in the middle of the night.

1819
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,920
WHere do you want to see natural grass 
on the ufc?

1820
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,740
Hate to tell ya.
I hear ya.

1821
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,950
Those guys aren't right.
I hear you.

1822
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:14,933
But there's weight classes in the ufc 
and that's where it gets different 

1823
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,380
because you're talking about god's 
trying to get as big and as fast,

1824
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,700
as powerful as they can and we've all 
known forever.

1825
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,620
You ask the average person to football 
players take pe.

1826
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,390
Of course They do.
Of course they do.

1827
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,100
You'll look into these mountains.
Well,

1828
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:31,110
most people assume you'll see posts on 
pds,

1829
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,080
like I've had some talks and what did we
say?

1830
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,980
Lie though,
I mean there's a giant percentage but,

1831
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:40,020
but there's a different standard way 
less are now,

1832
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:40,854
but I think for the longest time,
42 supplements including some that are 

1833
01:20:44,781 --> 01:20:49,781
available at gnc contribute or positive 
test for toronto ball sports article.

1834
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:50,950
YeaH.
Yeah.

1835
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:52,710
The official said the cubs,
again,

1836
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:55,650
we're reminded this week that players 
should only.

1837
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:56,543
She used only supplement certified by 
nsf international and independent 

1838
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:01,890
organization,
the tests and approved products,

1839
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,220
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
So there's a lot of shit.

1840
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,260
Look,
the union havers concerned about the run

1841
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,094
of suspension of tyrannical and 
continues to seek evidence that might 

1842
01:21:10,831 --> 01:21:11,664
shed light on why some players are 
testing positive because so many guys 

1843
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,150
are testing positive for it.

1844
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,073
Well,
isn't this a short acting drug though 

1845
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:19,440
that's out of your system fairly 
quickly?

1846
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,540
I think that was the thing about this 
stuff,

1847
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,590
but then there's even debate on that 
though,

1848
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:26,550
jill.
Yeah.

1849
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:27,384
Why did I see?
Why don'T I see something that said it 

1850
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:30,840
had a 60 day window.
I've seen,

1851
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,550
I've seen months.
I've seen weeks,

1852
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:34,380
I've seen days,
I've seen ours again.

1853
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:37,200
We don't fucking know dude.
It's been explained to me the stuff that

1854
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:38,034
gets out of your system the quickest is 
those little edible testosterone things 

1855
01:21:41,101 --> 01:21:41,934
like the gummies and stuff around them,
but those are just a few hours in a few 

1856
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,990
hours or out of your system.
The other thing we're going to,

1857
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,530
just like we're doing now with baseball,
like barry bonds,

1858
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:52,410
mark mcgwire,
sammy sosa at the time were like,

1859
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,070
oh my god.
Pds whole month.

1860
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,520
That doesn't count.
The years go by,

1861
01:21:56,530 --> 01:21:57,363
we're like,
those guys are still pretty fucking 

1862
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:58,320
good.

1863
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,153
If even the pitchers were sauced up,
I think that could happen with john to 

1864
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,890
like five,
10 years that he knows he's the greatest

1865
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:05,790
of all time still.
Yeah,

1866
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:08,010
but no,
because danIel cormier wasn't sauced up.

1867
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:12,570
Daniel cormier was totally on the notch.
You don't believe that?

1868
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,550
I don't know.
I assume he is.

1869
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:16,170
You have to know.
I assume he is.

1870
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,480
I have no idea.
I have no reason not to.

1871
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:23,220
I don't know anything in this world 
anymore.

1872
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:24,270
When it comes.
Well,

1873
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,920
you know,
you gotta think man,

1874
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,430
you're held on the line.
Your futures on the line.

1875
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:30,383
Your career's on the line.
You've been out of the game for 

1876
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,590
essentially two and a half years plus 
one fight in between there,

1877
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,120
the osp fight,
but he's been at a cage for a long time.

1878
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,860
You got to fight the best in the world,
the best in the world.

1879
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:48,970
Skeptical tomato.
You got all this pressure on you and you

1880
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,570
just go just a little bit,
get a little bit.

1881
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,190
I don't know if you need that help if 
you're.

1882
01:22:56,191 --> 01:22:59,040
John might not.
Might not to go the club.

1883
01:22:59,041 --> 01:22:59,874
Do a couple of cans of coke.
That's maybe it's one of those things 

1884
01:23:02,581 --> 01:23:04,860
where he's always used it,
got away with it.

1885
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,093
Now he didn't.
Maybe he took a supplement that had an 

1886
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:11,170
in it.
I mean we really don't know.

1887
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:15,220
It's one of the things that stress that 
I really believe you got to kinda before

1888
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:19,180
casting 100 percent judgment on them.
You gotta let it play out,

1889
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,100
but this is the thing we say.
Let it play out.

1890
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:22,143
Again.
I know I'm playing both sides of the 

1891
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,310
field here,
but when you say let it play out,

1892
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,220
we.
We know he has a history of fucking up.

1893
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,533
Yeah,
he's going to hang him before it's 

1894
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:31,460
actually come out because we go,
no,

1895
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:32,303
he's consistently good at beating people
up and fucking up and here's another 

1896
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:36,430
fuck up.
Yeah,

1897
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:38,200
that's a good way of looking at it.
Yeah,

1898
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,610
that's why.
That's why everyone's like,

1899
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:40,540
nope,
he's done to me.

1900
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,250
Well,
it's depressing to us,

1901
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:46,320
right?
As fans because he's so fucking good and

1902
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:49,450
to know that he's going to be out 
possibly for four years now.

1903
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:53,440
That shit's just devastating to me when 
we meet him.

1904
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,760
I know people don't know.
We don't know.

1905
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:55,594
We fucking medium.
He was like steep pay for the 

1906
01:23:57,521 --> 01:23:58,900
heavyweight title.
You fucked.

1907
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,940
He didn't even know about that.
Well now you know,

1908
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:06,310
tough fight for steep bit and then he 
was gonna fight.

1909
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,144
Brock lesnar we gusts in dc again.
There's so much out there to versus 

1910
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:15,800
steep a for the heavyweight title would 
be wise.

1911
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,970
We'll talk about fucking dragons and jon
snow.

1912
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,620
It's because neither one of them is 
happening.

1913
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:21,640
It's interesting,
right?

1914
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:22,474
It's like what your theory about the 
fertittas pumping up with reebok and 

1915
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:30,880
with usada and then just to sell that 
science do theory,

1916
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,220
but it's a very good theory that I 
haven't heard before.

1917
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:37,450
A word I'd never heard it.
Is your theory entirely your idea to.

1918
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,870
I mean,
it's evidence,

1919
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,270
it's just.
But the evidence was always there.

1920
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:45,130
Always,
always put two and two together.

1921
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:45,964
What they're doing.
It's genius mean if they really played 

1922
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:50,410
at that,
that three d chess,

1923
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,540
that's fucking genius.
One hundred percent.

1924
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:54,850
That's what they're doing.
But it really is a smart man.

1925
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,300
If you just bought it and you were a 
wme,

1926
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:03,870
he probably um,
fertitta is this jewish sot of thing?

1927
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,970
Are we doing with this?
Yeah.

1928
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,010
Yeah.
You're going,

1929
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:10,730
hold on.
Is your how.

1930
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:12,710
How long has it been?
I don't know what their deal is with you

1931
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:15,640
because you saw it as a,
an employee of the ufc.

1932
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,280
It's fine.
Now.

1933
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,081
Realize that.
Right?

1934
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:17,914
Find out what,
how long the deal is with the ufc and 

1935
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:22,510
usada let's say.
Yes.

1936
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:25,720
Let's say here's these 10 years.
You can't do 10 years,

1937
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:26,883
10 years,
going to be buying 14 houses if it's 

1938
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,084
tangible.
What happens if they abandoned it and 

1939
01:25:33,071 --> 01:25:35,470
all of a sudden everybody just comes 
like Eric Silva comes back.

1940
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:38,530
Jack writing skill.
Everybody are jacked.

1941
01:25:38,570 --> 01:25:39,403
Allister goes back to being ubering.
I'll ask to do is pass the one at the 

1942
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:44,200
weigh ins set.
We're going sizzler.

1943
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,353
They better pray to god.
That golden snitch contract runs out in 

1944
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:49,414
the next two years.
You bringing that russian cat from a 

1945
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,960
charisse,
it whatever it is.

1946
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:55,090
Are you bringing everybody in?
Anybody?

1947
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,620
All The russians,
they're the best at it.

1948
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:58,180
All of them.
Bring them in.

1949
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,430
This guy had this dude on a protocol.
I fell asleep.

1950
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:02,500
I Was watching.
I want only watch the first 15 minutes.

1951
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,240
Then I to bed.
I'm going to watch the rest of it.

1952
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,193
I've heard about him,
but he was banging like five different 

1953
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:10,370
things in his ass.
These like amber liquids.

1954
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,840
It looked like Jack Daniels.
You know,

1955
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:16,430
he's a cyclist.
he was a very slim guy,

1956
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,593
but he just started doing this.
He just started doing this while I was 

1957
01:26:19,221 --> 01:26:20,054
listening to sky and I guess the idea is
that they're going to test him and he's 

1958
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,390
given ped forever and he's going to test
the siCk.

1959
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:26,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

1960
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:28,170
I need to see the whole thing.
Or like I said,

1961
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:29,440
like 15,
20 minutes into it.

1962
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,150
I wme you're looking at that going,
um,

1963
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,130
when's that contract up?
Went to the reebok.

1964
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:38,120
You're literally going,
you're going to tear it down and go,

1965
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:38,720
let,
let,

1966
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,790
let us do it.
Like you guys got to this point.

1967
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,500
Like this isn't working for us now.
Yeah.

1968
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:43,334
those are two ideas that look good to 
sell to another company and make it 

1969
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,130
legit.
But the thing is like,

1970
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,180
if you can get a better deal,
like right,

1971
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:51,014
you have a deal with reebok goes for so 
long and then if it's profitable for 

1972
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:55,670
reebok and adidas comes in and goes,
hey,

1973
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,530
we like what you're doing here.
Uh,

1974
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,250
let's,
uh,

1975
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,960
switch it up,
let's go adidas.

1976
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:03,350
And then you have a bidding war between 
adidas and reebok.

1977
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,760
And then maybe nike thinks about it too.
And you know,

1978
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,030
if you can prove that you're cleaning 
the sport up,

1979
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:09,080
right,
with usada,

1980
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,860
that's a very smart move to get a big 
company to invest in a sport that's when

1981
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:13,280
you do it.

1982
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,470
But the big company as to see some sort 
of a payback,

1983
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:17,240
that's why people were pissed off 
because they were like,

1984
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:21,440
well the sponsorship doesn't match what 
we were getting before.

1985
01:27:21,441 --> 01:27:23,630
And you know,
I know you had a real issue with that.

1986
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:26,240
It was a big like $100 plus thousand 
dollars a fight.

1987
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,931
Yeah.
That,

1988
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:31,030
that was the biggest issue is I liked 
the uniform system and make it look like

1989
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:31,903
professional sport.
But if you're gonna bring in a major 

1990
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,060
sponsor like that,
then cut down,

1991
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:37,430
guys pays,
then you're fucking the product.

1992
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,264
You're fucking the fighters.
And wHat you don't realize is you 

1993
01:27:40,371 --> 01:27:44,270
actually fucking reebok the ufc as the 
middleman.

1994
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,680
You're screwing reebok because no one 
had any issues with reebok.

1995
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:49,040
They,
they're owning the crossfit world.

1996
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:51,280
They're doing things actually like I 
have no issues with your back.

1997
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,090
I talked to represent from reebok the 
other day.

1998
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:54,400
You want to send me a fight?
Kip?

1999
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:56,210
I'm so,
for who?

2000
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,060
Who does it say new boxing shoes and 
some shorts you want to send me?

2001
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:02,420
I'm like,
all right,

2002
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,253
cool man.
I would like you honest fight kit so I 

2003
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,920
could spell her name.
I want mine.

2004
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:07,873
How much if I gave you $10,000,000,
do you think you could spell you on and 

2005
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,130
you jet checks last?
Nope.

2006
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,113
Nope.
Nope.

2007
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,260
Nope.
Not even close.

2008
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,550
I bet she came.
spell it,

2009
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,440
get her together.
She's like,

2010
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:21,050
who is this?
What is this z?

2011
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:22,460
Or ask something.
Jamie.

2012
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:23,773
I just see that as it was.
It's just the program they started 

2013
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:28,030
together so they can cancel it anytime.
Maybe would imagine.

2014
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,960
They probably one a contract.
It doesn't say that they have a longterm

2015
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:37,160
usada or only thing I forgot is that the
ufc has committed millions of dollars to

2016
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:37,994
in an out of competition for sure to 
bring in for the ufc to bring in a big 

2017
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:43,694
sponsor like reebok,
like that's a good way to ensure that 

2018
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:47,144
you've got to clean sport,
that you represent you to represent a 

2019
01:28:48,441 --> 01:28:49,580
clean sport.
You know?

2020
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,533
That's why that fighter.
The other night when gavin tucker 

2021
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:53,864
fought,
I'm god damn it wasn't John Tucker 

2022
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:58,160
because he's,
you know,

2023
01:28:58,161 --> 01:28:59,510
he's the guy who took the beat down,
right?

2024
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:01,610
Yes.
Would that riff right?

2025
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,543
That ref

2026
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,260
that stopped the fight?
Scared to admit social.

2027
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,740
The m no.
He looked great though.

2028
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,210
Rick.
Rick the gladiator.

2029
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:10,021
Yes.
Yes.

2030
01:29:10,021 --> 01:29:13,030
Rick to first take mustache glen to 
freshman.

2031
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:16,350
Glen beat the shit out of him.
Beat the brakes off way too much.

2032
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:19,410
It was like that fight should have been 
stopped like minutes before.

2033
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:20,940
Horrible.
It's not good.

2034
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,610
Like when you see that,
like if I was reebok and be like,

2035
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:24,990
hey,
this guy can't do.

2036
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:28,440
We can't sponsor a fight with this guy's
a ref ever again.

2037
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,220
The sport that will do that.
Whatever.

2038
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,400
You got to know it now.
You know.

2039
01:29:34,401 --> 01:29:36,570
You know what I'd do if I was the ufc,
if I'm wme,

2040
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,450
I get rid of the snitch.
I don't say anything,

2041
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:45,480
but I don't say anything.
I let people assume I let people.

2042
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:46,603
Everyone assume.
I'm sure there's a nondisclosure all 

2043
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,633
that.
Don't think the golden snitch is going 

2044
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:52,970
to go on the ariel helwani show.
The moment.

2045
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:58,140
Maybe pay him a fat summit by katie.
Go away,

2046
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,230
but let's not say anything.
We're not doing a strict.

2047
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:03,650
It was brock lesnar's urine looked like 
gatorade.

2048
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,830
Like gravy.
Yeah,

2049
01:30:07,831 --> 01:30:09,020
I don't.
I.

2050
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:11,760
That's what I would do.
I would just take him out of it,

2051
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:12,594
the equation,
not say anything to the public and then 

2052
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:15,900
all of a sudden you have all the 
monsters back.

2053
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,350
People get to know how are they going to
know.

2054
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,520
We all assume they're gonna know they're
gonna.

2055
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:23,373
Find out people are fans.
If I know the general public will find 

2056
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:26,580
out,
everybody's going to find out.

2057
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,350
You don't think so?
No.

2058
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,420
That's so stupid.
I don't think so.

2059
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:33,450
You think it wouldn't get out if you saw
to left of the ufc?

2060
01:30:33,451 --> 01:30:35,280
Like what about the testing?
No,

2061
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,590
no,
we were still.

2062
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:39,840
We still doing this thing that they do 
before it was still being there.

2063
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,360
We're still testing state athletic 
commission tests,

2064
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:46,080
which would test after the weigh in and 
then maybe after the fight,

2065
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:46,914
depending if you saw it as just a 
surprise testing whenever and the 365 

2066
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:55,560
days a year and they also way more 
thorough tests are very,

2067
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:57,580
very few do blood.
What?

2068
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:58,423
Um,
the other one only does urine victor 

2069
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:01,800
content.
The guy who got busted the balco scandal

2070
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:04,290
when it comes on the blocks.
When he said to me,

2071
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,333
he was like,
if you fail one of those posts weighing 

2072
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,080
tests,
that's an intelligence test.

2073
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,880
You just,
you're just a dummy.

2074
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:12,923
He's like,
anybody knows that they're doing can 

2075
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,200
pass those tests.
Yeah.

2076
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,573
If you have a guy like him,
you're dealing with these high level 

2077
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:20,790
guys.
Like that's an easy test.

2078
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:22,600
You saw her though.
There's no.

2079
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,630
They're keeping your,
your,

2080
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:25,523
your,
your piss in your blood for like seven 

2081
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:28,840
years.

2082
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,820
Freezing that shit.
Keeping it for seven years,

2083
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,870
man.
Too much.

2084
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,780
They're going to test it to strip people
the title.

2085
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,090
No,
the olympics is already done that.

2086
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:39,600
Yeah.
No,

2087
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,440
they busted russians retroactively.
They busted two gold medalists.

2088
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:47,190
I want to say like 2008,
two gold medalists from 2008.

2089
01:31:47,191 --> 01:31:48,024
They're like,
yeah.

2090
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,250
You imagine getting that call.
Who the fuck was that?

2091
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:53,850
The olympic committee from fucking just 
stripped our gold metals.

2092
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,391
Well,
you know,

2093
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:59,220
they came real close to banning Russia 
from combined now in rio.

2094
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:02,710
Did they banned the some of their 
athletes or is that China?

2095
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:05,260
Did they ban like china's a gymnastic 
team?

2096
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:10,420
Do you have to give that back?
The metal is going to go to siberia.

2097
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:15,820
taken heightened mass pike with a knife.
They took like reggie bush.

2098
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,880
Remember that they took his heisman.
You can't find anymore.

2099
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:21,550
And they took their trophies.
He took his heisman.

2100
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:22,690
For what?
For what reason?

2101
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:27,490
Because that year he received benefits 
like you took money from boosters.

2102
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,560
Good lord.
They're like,

2103
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,120
can I see that trophy bitch from my.
They gave him money.

2104
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,110
He gave his parents like a house or 
something like that.

2105
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,033
So they investigate it,
took all the shit and they voided all 

2106
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:39,200
us' wins that year.

2107
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,320
All us seeS wins.
Holy shit.

2108
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:45,154
Because he violated that agreement.
Him and the coach and they had a bunch 

2109
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:51,970
of fuck uPs and ncaa.
That is so bizarre.

2110
01:32:51,971 --> 01:32:54,520
I now just have to act like it never 
happened.

2111
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:56,770
That's so crazy.
How is that possible?

2112
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,220
How can you.
They're saying they've wins everything.

2113
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,530
None of it counts in the record books,
so I could still the record.

2114
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,220
It's out of the record books.
The money money was transpired.

2115
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:08,560
The people watched it on tv.
You know what I mean?

2116
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:10,660
Like the university of.
Well,

2117
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:12,280
it's like jon jones,
daniel cormier.

2118
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,800
You could call that a no contest.
All you want.

2119
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:17,980
We saw jon jones beat daniel asleep.
We saw it.

2120
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:20,830
We saw the ufc.
He made the money off the.

2121
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,360
Yeah,
but they're not thinking that way.

2122
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:23,303
What they're thinking is this is not.
It's a violation of the rules in terms 

2123
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,280
of like someone competing on a 
performance enhancing drug.

2124
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,630
they set up the rules.
The guy violated.

2125
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,483
So this trip,
just title as they're supposed to and 

2126
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:36,550
they reinstated into dc.
I'll do one better.

2127
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,220
How about ufc?
200 were brock lesnar.

2128
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,613
Think about that and then you,
because you get all the bikes for brock 

2129
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:46,390
lesnar didn't realize test hot 
afterwards.

2130
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:47,470
He's like,
fuck them wet.

2131
01:33:47,471 --> 01:33:48,700
Of course.
I was just like,

2132
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:52,420
god damn pro a little,
you know,

2133
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:53,254
brock lesnar independently tested 
himself a shit ton of times leading up 

2134
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,840
to that trial.
Well listen,

2135
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:00,220
let me listen to me.
Listen to me.

2136
01:34:00,221 --> 01:34:03,700
Don't get crazy.
When you independently test yourself,

2137
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:06,550
it's because you want to make sure that 
you're showing up clean.

2138
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:07,563
It's not because you think you're clean.
You want to show the world is because 

2139
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,250
you want to make sure like,
hey,

2140
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:14,710
is this showing up?
For sure what was going on?

2141
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:16,450
We okay here,
let's chest out like,

2142
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:21,190
is this really working multiple 
independent test that he did,

2143
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:23,050
which you wouldn't have to do if you 
weren't taking anything.

2144
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,063
He's trying to get whatever it is out of
his system trying to get his body up to 

2145
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:28,930
baseline for sure.
I mean,

2146
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:32,630
when you watched him in the wwe and he's
300 plus pounds,

2147
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,870
he likes to say he's,
he's a giant guy,

2148
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:40,360
you know,
and he's 39 or something like that.

2149
01:34:41,420 --> 01:34:42,970
That,
that was a dirty one.

2150
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:45,650
That was the most dirtiest one.
That's another Mark Hunt beating.

2151
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,340
No slurred speech.
Yeah.

2152
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,200
Alistair overeem.
That was the worst one that needed.

2153
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:54,730
Took to the face of flatland,
straight up,

2154
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,860
flat line right in front of us.
Man.

2155
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:57,763
He was doing a toe curl.
You know when they get killed and get 

2156
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:02,960
that toe curl show.
Do you like the shocker with their feet?

2157
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,860
Is that toe curls hard to watch because 
you know that,

2158
01:35:05,861 --> 01:35:09,440
that that's the whole body going.
It's weird.

2159
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:12,470
People enjoy seeing that.
They don't enjoy seeing that.

2160
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,100
They enjoy seeing the kick lending 
because it's so difficult and you know,

2161
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:21,101
the consequences are so great because I 
like the way we're made up you.

2162
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,053
You almost want to flInch when you see 
that someone's brain shuts off like 

2163
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:28,130
that.
You should be genetically.

2164
01:35:28,131 --> 01:35:29,210
You go,
oh my god.

2165
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,940
You know,
you know,

2166
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:35,720
I just don't think the people that 
suffer the most start,

2167
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,990
they don't come out about it.
It just kind of go away.

2168
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:41,330
What do you mean?
Like guys like don fry,

2169
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:45,840
you don't see don fry all the tIme being
interviewed on tv.

2170
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:46,674
You don't think about like his fight 
with takiyama when they both stood in 

2171
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:51,160
front of each other and blast each other
in the face over and over and over.

2172
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,013
The older generation,
not in their nature to do that and 

2173
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:54,734
they're not,
they're not very good on camera and 

2174
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:56,000
stuff like that.

2175
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,740
I think as you go on.
So what I mean,

2176
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,890
you're going to see guys coming out 
though maybe I hope,

2177
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,140
but it just because people don't see 
them,

2178
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:03,974
they fade away.
So you're saying I do not in the 

2179
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:06,511
spotlight.
Yeah,

2180
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:08,360
they're not as poly.
So people don't think about that.

2181
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:10,220
When you think of fighting,
you think of,

2182
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:11,283
you know,
watching tyron woodley right now in his 

2183
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:15,710
prime.
Now you know he's doing damage,

2184
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:16,250
you know that,
you know,

2185
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,290
he's had some good fights but he's okay.
He's fine.

2186
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:21,410
Yep.
You think of it as one knockout last gen

2187
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,373
two,
um,

2188
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,130
nate marquardt in strikeforce.
That's like the only,

2189
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:27,620
like real bad loss that he has the other
losses,

2190
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:28,910
you know,
it's just,

2191
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:31,250
doesn't,
doesn't seem like he's in a bad place,

2192
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:32,640
but then,
you know,

2193
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:36,110
you don't see guys that were in the ufc 
15,

2194
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:37,550
20 years ago,
you know,

2195
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:39,470
that took crazy debt.

2196
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,303
Like gary goodrich,
big daddy goodrich who went over to k 

2197
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:46,310
one and he's got crazy cte now.
Horrible.

2198
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,170
He talks about it,
right?

2199
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,013
He's trying to,
he talks about it really openly and 

2200
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:50,723
it's,
he's got a great twitter to follow them 

2201
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,533
on here.
No,

2202
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,640
with you for sure.
Yeah.

2203
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:57,350
Talk about that.
I mean,

2204
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:59,900
I'm sure he'd want to talk about that.
You'd want people to know.

2205
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,720
You know,
I just,

2206
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,770
obviously if you're gonna fight brain 
traumas,

2207
01:37:06,771 --> 01:37:11,540
one of the commission,
that's what we do obviously.

2208
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:15,280
So If he were to come on and my brain 
ct,

2209
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,570
I don't feel like most people are like,
god,

2210
01:37:17,571 --> 01:37:18,830
it's terrible.
I'm not watching it.

2211
01:37:18,831 --> 01:37:19,940
But you feel bad.
Like,

2212
01:37:19,941 --> 01:37:21,290
you know,
you see someone slurring their words.

2213
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,910
You'd ever see Joe Frazier before he 
died?

2214
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,200
Yeah.
He was on the opiod.

2215
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:26,330
Anthony show once and I remember 
listening.

2216
01:37:26,331 --> 01:37:27,320
I was like,
wow,

2217
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,154
this is hard to listen to man.
It's just like there's some guys like 

2218
01:37:31,311 --> 01:37:32,610
that in the afc.
Yeah.

2219
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,230
Yes.
I won't mention names of some guys who I

2220
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:36,560
have conversations with them.
Like,

2221
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:37,400
oh my god,
man.

2222
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,960
You see it?
Yeah.

2223
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:42,890
It's like nobody rides for free.
You get hit enough.

2224
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,430
Just it's the weird thing is the number 
is different for everybody.

2225
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,110
like the number for one guy like Mark 
Hunt.

2226
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:49,993
It took years and years and years and 
years and years and years for his chin 

2227
01:37:52,401 --> 01:37:55,070
started failing.
And you think about the fights.

2228
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,460
He had the strike

2229
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,300
for the,
all the,

2230
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,100
the um,
uh,

2231
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:02,130
k one pride,
pride fights.

2232
01:38:02,131 --> 01:38:03,300
He had,
you know,

2233
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:07,500
I think he fought and dream as well.
When dId melvin manhoef knock them out?

2234
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:09,470
Was that in dream?
Uh,

2235
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:10,323
no.
No.

2236
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:14,430
It was a pride.
It just the all the k one bounce man.

2237
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:17,420
I mean he was a k one grumpy caitlyn.
Yeah,

2238
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,680
mean he fought some fucking warrant.
Was it a k one?

2239
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:20,514
Mma fights,
yeah,

2240
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:24,900
I mean just there's only so many of 
those fights you could have.

2241
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,820
it is weird how certain guys get,
you know,

2242
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,610
their capabilities to take punches so 
much longer than the other guys.

2243
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:35,370
We doN't know what it is.
I think it's a structured thing.

2244
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:37,380
The way they're built.
I think the way you're built,

2245
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:39,950
like Mark Hunt is built like a tank.
He's five,

2246
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:42,240
10 to 65.
He's just a tank.

2247
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,640
The other problem is the size of his 
head.

2248
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,430
His body's denseness.
When you see his shins,

2249
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,920
like when mark is standing in front,
his knees are giant,

2250
01:38:49,921 --> 01:38:52,560
his knees are like this big.
His shins are huge.

2251
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,900
He's like a thick bone guy.
Well,

2252
01:38:54,901 --> 01:38:58,850
the other issue is is you have,
especially as a shame mixed martial arts

2253
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,870
called mixed martial arts,
ufc,

2254
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:04,440
but mixed martial arts is so new in the 
grand scheme of things compared to other

2255
01:39:04,441 --> 01:39:07,290
sports.
We don't know the best way to train,

2256
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:09,150
to stay healthy,
to not get in trouble.

2257
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:11,670
We have not been people trying to figure
out there's doctors.

2258
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:15,900
It Just hasn't been around long enough 
like in football and the cfl just passed

2259
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:16,734
this.
They're not allowed to put pads on and 

2260
01:39:17,761 --> 01:39:21,480
practicing where they hitting practice 
and one that is a rule smart and now the

2261
01:39:21,481 --> 01:39:23,310
nfl is going,
we're going to look into that.

2262
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,233
Now.
The nfl only has I think 14 days of pad 

2263
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:27,714
work,
whether they're in pads during the 

2264
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,480
season,
but they want to eliminate that.

2265
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,970
Well,
it's been around for a grip.

2266
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:36,180
The best saving grace for the sport 
would be,

2267
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:40,170
or the best hope for the sport would be 
medical science.

2268
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:44,160
Medical science comes along with some 
sort of stem cell regeneration thing.

2269
01:39:44,620 --> 01:39:48,060
Brain come back to 100 percent,
which god totally possible.

2270
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:49,043
They just have to crack the code.
You just think about what they can do 

2271
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,130
with other parts of your body to where 
they can repair things.

2272
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:57,060
The brain is far more complicated than 
anything we have to deal with,

2273
01:39:57,061 --> 01:40:00,420
but if you could somehow or another rig 
night,

2274
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,313
the body's ability to heal itself and in
fact they have a new chip that they're 

2275
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:06,780
going to,
uh,

2276
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:07,663
that they're working on now where they 
install it in a person's body and it 

2277
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:16,071
reprograms your genes and they think it 
can repair brain trauma injuries,

2278
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,170
tissue damage,
and even the effects of aging.

2279
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:21,090
oh my god.
Oh my god.

2280
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:21,983
Yeah.
It's a chip you put into your body and 

2281
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:24,474
it reprograms your genes.
And I think it's probably at some very 

2282
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:30,840
embryonic stage of development,
a trillion dollars.

2283
01:40:30,841 --> 01:40:31,680
I know.
Who knows,

2284
01:40:31,681 --> 01:40:33,210
but they're true.
They're probably trying to juice up,

2285
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:35,940
you know,
excitement for it by making it this.

2286
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,980
I can't imagine.
I can tell.

2287
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,030
Look dude,
you know,

2288
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:40,861
I've,
you know,

2289
01:40:40,861 --> 01:40:43,320
the store with my shoulder,
my shoulder was fucked.

2290
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,870
I was ready to get shoulder surgery was 
hurting all the time.

2291
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:48,230
It doesn't hurt at all.
Brains for an animal.

2292
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,590
It is.
You're right.

2293
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:51,960
It is like you talk the way more can you
do.

2294
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,170
Yeah.
You listen to the scientists go,

2295
01:40:53,171 --> 01:40:54,010
we can.
You need

2296
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,260
a new heart.
We can make that you had lungs,

2297
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:59,620
muscle bones,
we can make all that can help your brain

2298
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:00,454
right now.
Now stop and think about where we were 

2299
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:03,970
50 years ago,
50 years ago.

2300
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:04,804
None of those things are possible.
So all these ideas that are commonplace 

2301
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:10,930
today,
we're just science fiction.

2302
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:12,700
Fifty years ago,
50 years from now,

2303
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:15,940
they might be able to use this ship.
Have you found that thing that chip?

2304
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:18,910
The one I found isn't even new.
it's from three years ago,

2305
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:19,990
but made by.
no,

2306
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:20,651
no,
no.

2307
01:41:20,651 --> 01:41:21,484
That's not what it is.
It's a new chip installed under skin 

2308
01:41:25,781 --> 01:41:29,410
that reprograms dna and can heal 
injuries.

2309
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,950
Look,
look,

2310
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:33,700
forget about brain injurY.
Just look at that because new chip,

2311
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:38,730
I think it can replicate and restore.
The Idea behind it is it can program the

2312
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:44,210
genes to replicate and restore any sort 
of injury to resolve.

2313
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:47,770
For some,
I think it was live science.com.

2314
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:48,671
It's one of those,
uh,

2315
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:49,504
websites,
science websites I go to the regular 

2316
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,740
hitch about that is by the time that's 
out you.

2317
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:54,810
And I'd probably be dead.
No,

2318
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:56,560
that's not true.
It might be out real soon.

2319
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,633
Breakthrough device heels.
Oregon's with a single touch device 

2320
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,513
instantly delivers new dna or rna into 
living skin cells to change their 

2321
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:05,980
Function.
This is it.

2322
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:07,413
They've developed a device that will 
switch cell function to rescue failing 

2323
01:42:10,781 --> 01:42:15,370
body functions with a single touch.
The technology known as tissue nano.

2324
01:42:15,371 --> 01:42:20,350
Transfection injects genetic code into 
the skin cells,

2325
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:21,184
turning those skin cells into other 
types of sales required for treating 

2326
01:42:24,641 --> 01:42:28,480
disease conditions.
Welcome to the future motherfucker.

2327
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,460
Cte out the window.
FootbAll,

2328
01:42:30,461 --> 01:42:31,294
no helmets don't be a pussy stitching.
They have a bunch of boxes of these 

2329
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:38,763
ships sitting by and you're down.
Your head smashed in like that fucking 

2330
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:42,874
guy.
The mountain from a game of thrones 

2331
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:44,704
crushed.
And they just stick that shit on your 

2332
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:48,510
eyeballs.
Pop right back in place.

2333
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,353
Like,
whoa.

2334
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:52,990
That was.
You know what happens then?

2335
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:55,200
Sword fights.
Yeah.

2336
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:59,080
once they could just grab a hold of you 
and bring you back to light,

2337
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:01,300
it'S going to be a bitch.
If he had stabbed,

2338
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,743
her sword fights would be like,
you're not allowed to cut their head 

2339
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:06,100
off.
Can't fix,

2340
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:06,943
I can't fix that.
It's like elbows to the back of the 

2341
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:10,270
head.
When you got the back mountain,

2342
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,840
two effective.
Within one week,

2343
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:14,674
active Blood vessels appeared in the 
injured leg and by the second week the 

2344
01:43:18,071 --> 01:43:19,540
leg was saved.
Holy shiT.

2345
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:23,170
We researchers studied mice and pigs and
these experiments in the study,

2346
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:24,123
researchers were able to reprogram skin 
cells to become vascular cells in badly 

2347
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,863
injured legs.
That lacked blood flow so amazing 

2348
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:31,954
probably for people that diabetes,
amazing for people that are suffering 

2349
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:38,440
from all sorts of circulatory 
conditions,

2350
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,333
bro.
It takes less than a second and the 

2351
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,550
noninvasive.

2352
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:43,600
Come on,
son.

2353
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:46,030
Welcome to the new world.
It's like that nas song.

2354
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:51,080
The chip doesn't even stay in your body,
I think says they can fixing shit.

2355
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,560
why isn't this bigger news?
Why isn't this on cnn?

2356
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:55,700
all that shit.
That's a good question.

2357
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,510
They're too busy talking about trump or 
flat.

2358
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:00,773
They're talking about whether or not 
trump is a racist and whether or not 

2359
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:06,920
that girl should get fired instead of 
excitement.

2360
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:09,080
woo hoo.
I'm a how's that?

2361
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:11,000
Not exciting as shit.
It's exciting.

2362
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:13,160
It's shit.
I'm going to go bash mY brains in.

2363
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,660
We're in the new world,
man,

2364
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:16,550
and this is just one step,
right?

2365
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,980
What is this going to be like?
$20.

2366
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:20,140
We didn'T see this comment.
What's it going to be like 20 years from

2367
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:22,010
now?
We don't know who's in Austria right now

2368
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:24,110
and some fucking laboratory with white 
gloves on.

2369
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:26,810
Huge brands putting their hand into some
crazy machine.

2370
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:27,643
There's a petri dish and they got all 
these lasers are zap and this thing and 

2371
01:44:30,211 --> 01:44:32,890
they're poodles.
What the fuck they're doing right now?

2372
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,860
What's a bummer?
This is the first I've heard about.

2373
01:44:34,861 --> 01:44:35,694
Do you fucking brought it up?
I'm on the balls on popham stag sent me 

2374
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:41,570
that.
Shout out to matt stacks.

2375
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:43,100
I like that guy.
He's awesome.

2376
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,330
He's a great guy.
This,

2377
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,750
this whole.
What we're experiencing now is this,

2378
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:53,020
you know this I'm escalating sort of 
technological race,

2379
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:58,040
like one invention,
like this is going to allow for the idea

2380
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:58,874
of several other different inventions 
and maybe they'll come up with 

2381
01:45:00,981 --> 01:45:02,600
something.
They add this to crispr.

2382
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,770
Crispr is this new genetic 
reprogramming.

2383
01:45:06,771 --> 01:45:09,080
I don't know if the best way to describe
it,

2384
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:13,970
but it's a tool for altering genetics.
Now they get a hold of that and they use

2385
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:16,880
it with this.
So you use crispr and this.

2386
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:19,670
You got the hulk,
you got John Jones and brock lesnar,

2387
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:21,080
baby.
You got the hulk.

2388
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:23,660
Fuck jon jones and brock lesnar for the 
hulk shows up,

2389
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:24,733
right?
Not if they had a baby crashing through 

2390
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:28,994
the wall.
He leaps through the marine albert 

2391
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:33,740
nonstop,
literally from the dressIng room,

2392
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:38,741
beliefs through the air and boom,
as the center of the octagon it goes and

2393
01:45:40,521 --> 01:45:42,700
brock lesnar just goes,
shit.

2394
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,153
That was the best.
When the hulk grabs that fucking thor's 

2395
01:45:46,671 --> 01:45:49,070
brother and these like,
I'm a god,

2396
01:45:49,071 --> 01:45:53,630
he just grabs one because I'm on the 
ground for the bus up.

2397
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:54,464
The contents.
I fucking love the idea that some 

2398
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:58,693
peaceful mark refollow low character 
who's this brilliant scientist who 

2399
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:07,040
select concerned with helping people.
If you piss this motherfucker off,

2400
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:09,850
he becomes a bulletproof giant is pretty
dope.

2401
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:10,733
NoT only it happened so quick that he 
tried to shoot himself in the mouth and 

2402
01:46:13,881 --> 01:46:16,370
by the time the bullet hit the skin,
he's the hulk.

2403
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:20,240
Spit up a bullet.
Come on son.

2404
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:23,300
ITs greatest fucking super hero 
character of all time.

2405
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:27,260
The whole that yoU think everybody else 
Can suck my dick.

2406
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,660
Every single one of you know why?
Because they all call in the hulk.

2407
01:46:30,661 --> 01:46:32,840
If the shit goes wrong,
if everything goes wrong.

2408
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:34,190
Like what?
Just sending the hulk.

2409
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,530
What's that asshole with a bow and arrow
doing there?

2410
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:40,260
Get the fuck out of there.
What are you going to do?

2411
01:46:40,261 --> 01:46:42,440
A triangle people with your stilettos 
on.

2412
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,483
Shut the fuck up everybody calling the 
green guy and let's just get this over 

2413
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:50,450
with punching spaceships

2414
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:55,380
into oblivion and what are you going to 
shoot arrows at the spaceship.

2415
01:46:55,410 --> 01:46:57,760
Archer the fuck outta here.
I love you.

2416
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:00,760
He's the best.
He's doing one to call.

2417
01:47:00,761 --> 01:47:02,250
If I was captain America,
I'd be like,

2418
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:06,000
listen,
I'm getting the fuck out of my face.

2419
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,333
He wanted to get some shoes.
She's the only one that can calm them 

2420
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:11,590
down.
Calm down hulk.

2421
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:14,100
What?
That looks so fake there.

2422
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:19,320
That looks like my kid drew it.
Literally.

2423
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,580
It looks like it looks like shrek.
There was two hulks though.

2424
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:24,414
Yeah,
it was zero punch and then the mark 

2425
01:47:26,191 --> 01:47:27,070
rubin.
A bunch of them.

2426
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:28,830
Yeah.
At norton was one.

2427
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,680
ErIc bana was the worst.
I want to see that eric banner movie.

2428
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:34,650
Not that he's a bad actor.
He's an amazing actor.

2429
01:47:34,651 --> 01:47:37,230
He was great.
And chopper chopper is ridiculous.

2430
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:38,183
Fucking fanTastic.
But there was something about that hulk 

2431
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:42,810
movie with him and I was like,
this is whack.

2432
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,870
It's not his fault.
I went,

2433
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:48,270
I went to see it's super duper high and 
when I went to see it super duper high,

2434
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,200
I was like,
oh my god,

2435
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:50,034
the acting in this movie.
So bad marijuana is the number one 

2436
01:47:53,431 --> 01:47:56,490
detector of shitty acting like you 
didn't sense it.

2437
01:47:57,390 --> 01:48:02,390
There is go big screen on that one too.
So that's eric bana one.

2438
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:04,373
That's early days.
That's the first whole san francisco 

2439
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:07,440
hulk.
Yeah.

2440
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:08,723
So you see the difference between the ed
norton hawk on the right and actually 

2441
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:14,760
the one on the left looks terrible.
No one on the left obliques.

2442
01:48:14,761 --> 01:48:15,594
Bloated ban a whole clique,
so faked ed norton one is so much 

2443
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:19,380
better.
Which one's this?

2444
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:23,730
That's the bag that looks like shit.
Now go to the most recent.

2445
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:24,960
The mark.
Ruffalo hulk.

2446
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:27,330
Let's see what that one looks like.

2447
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:31,560
Yeah.
The mark refollow hooks of best hoke.

2448
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,240
Yeah,
that's it right there.

2449
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:35,190
Come with more realistic.
A little more,

2450
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:37,290
but I mean it's obviously.
It's still a hulk.

2451
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,520
Woo.
Go fullscreen.

2452
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,490
Jesus christ.
Yeah.

2453
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,590
That's dope.
Yeah.

2454
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:42,780
If that thing hops into the octagon,
brock lesnar,

2455
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:46,620
good luck.
If you're whole thing is that you're big

2456
01:48:46,621 --> 01:48:49,800
and strong and that's a big part of what
brock lesnar's thing is.

2457
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,870
He's big and strong.
It says only thing.

2458
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:52,913
Yeah.
I mean he's like the hulk of ufc 

2459
01:48:54,631 --> 01:48:56,040
fighters.
What are you going to mighty mouse.

2460
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:01,370
I'm going to move around them real well.
That was the ed norton one.

2461
01:49:05,221 --> 01:49:06,780
The opening scene when he fucking.
Whoa.

2462
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,760
Ooh,
that does look good.

2463
01:49:07,761 --> 01:49:10,230
It looks dope.
Teeth are fucked.

2464
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,900
If we could figure if they can figure 
out a way to do that to people.

2465
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:14,730
The world's gonna be a totally different
place.

2466
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,730
It's not that far away.
Look,

2467
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:18,120
let's think of what they could do with 
steroids.

2468
01:49:18,121 --> 01:49:19,560
Like did you ever see that guy who just 
died?

2469
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:22,200
A rich piana.
His name is.

2470
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:26,430
He's a famous internet,
a bodybuilder.

2471
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:28,470
Colts,
a bunch of time.

2472
01:49:28,471 --> 01:49:29,520
Nicest guy.
Ever.

2473
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:34,110
Seemed like a very nice guy.
His arms are as big as my entire torso.

2474
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:35,063
Look at the size of this fucker.
He just died and I think they suspect 

2475
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:40,970
painkillers did a man.
I mean,

2476
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:46,200
I can't imagine stores didn't have some 
sort of play in the death of this man.

2477
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:48,710
Could have very Well have.
But um,

2478
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:51,430
there were suspecting painkillers 
apparently.

2479
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:55,510
All the big cycles that he did wear like
a long time ago and he does it really do

2480
01:49:55,511 --> 01:50:00,511
those big cycles anymore.
But he is josh preposterous.

2481
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:05,200
Look at that photo right there.
That is so preposterous.

2482
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,150
Look at the size of his arm.

2483
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:13,030
It's like he's got a person that's head 
is attached to his shoulder,

2484
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:16,040
his and the person's like holding their 
body like this is,

2485
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,330
are these bicep as a person's body with 
their arms crossed?

2486
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,310
It's like the three of ours put together
in here.

2487
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:24,850
He's enormous or was I should say right 
now,

2488
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:28,150
but yeah,
you go into a coma or something.

2489
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:30,630
I don't know.
Look at that picture there and famine.

2490
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:33,410
This giant dude.
What?

2491
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:36,670
What does that natural bodybuilder what?
What are you saying?

2492
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:39,640
Natural bodybuilder.
Mike o'hearn dates.

2493
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:44,730
Michael opens up steroid whatever is 
bodybuilding.com.

2494
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:50,620
People get super into that shit.
Muscle roast roast that.

2495
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:51,573
If that guy is real,
if that's a real natural bodybuilder or 

2496
01:50:55,411 --> 01:51:00,411
not,
we need to find out what he's eating and

2497
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,920
let's see if it passes the golden snitch
test.

2498
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,933
He's naturally on steroids.
he's just cleaned the day of the 

2499
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,150
competition.
Probably all those fucking guys do it.

2500
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:12,250
WhY would you not?
You're not hurting anybody.

2501
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,300
he shreds city though.
Natural bodybuilder,

2502
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:20,470
but it's got to be possible to get a 
certain size.

2503
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:21,953
Just like the biggest freaks I know are 
genetically like my friend clop bose 

2504
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:28,570
fucking shredded naturally be the those 
guys are,

2505
01:51:28,571 --> 01:51:32,410
but that will get that picture of them 
with the six pack of him.

2506
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:36,310
Go back a little picture of him.
Look at that.

2507
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:39,080
Come on son.
that dude's jack suited.

2508
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:41,350
If that is natural,
100 percent natural,

2509
01:51:41,351 --> 01:51:42,850
that's insane.
Genetics,

2510
01:51:43,570 --> 01:51:44,403
they'd be the most insane genetics I've 
ever seen and I'd be willing to bet my 

2511
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,330
life on it.
He has something run through the system,

2512
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:53,110
but is it possible to be built like that
with nothing else?

2513
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:55,660
Then genetics and hard work.
What do you think,

2514
01:51:55,661 --> 01:51:56,610
joe?
I say no,

2515
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:58,410
no,
not.

2516
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,610
Well,
I want to say no,

2517
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:03,280
but I think that tyron woodley could 
probably look like that.

2518
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,910
Like I six four sir.
I don't mean like the height.

2519
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,373
I mean if tyron,
you'd be looking at like tyrons body 

2520
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,440
checked,
like naturally jack,

2521
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:15,850
like dave's superior genetics.
Look is jack's on the left though.

2522
01:52:16,150 --> 01:52:17,200
That's him.
Yes.

2523
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:20,340
So he wasn't born like that.
You know whaT I'm saying to.

2524
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,950
he's made that partying back then.
But look at any picture of woodley.

2525
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:28,230
Average jack jack it everyday and be in 
Ghana.

2526
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,133
There's another one.
Some people have such weird mentioning 

2527
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,430
all black guys.
Yeah.

2528
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:36,880
Fluff people have crazy narratives and 
positive blah blah blah blah blah blah.

2529
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:40,690
But there's got to be natural 
bodybuilders that are jacked.

2530
01:52:40,691 --> 01:52:41,930
I had a friend,
um,

2531
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:42,913
I know one day Brian Frazier,
a friend of mine from boston who was a 

2532
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:49,040
stand up comedian who was,
it was huge,

2533
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:51,230
thick and tall ass.
No,

2534
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,820
he wasn't that tall.
He was like maybe,

2535
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:55,340
I think he's five,
10 or 5:11,

2536
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:59,270
but like soup at the time,
super jacked like giant muscles.

2537
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,960
And I know for a fact he never did 
anything that he didn't.

2538
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,050
No,
he didn't.

2539
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,940
I'm telling you,
I know the guy very well.

2540
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,610
He didn't do shit,
but like I know in natural bodybuilding,

2541
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:09,380
he's obese.
He trains for doom.

2542
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:10,214
He trains a lot of these guys named some
mix of phi trains out of a anderson 

2543
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:16,970
silva's jim are used to it.
I think he's straighten out training out

2544
01:53:16,971 --> 01:53:17,804
of a header,
gracie's gym and he's a natural 

2545
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:20,954
bodybuilder.
He competes and he is fucking shredded 

2546
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:25,880
these big.
No,

2547
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:27,410
he's just,
he's like thin,

2548
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,300
like strong.
Yeah.

2549
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:30,100
There it is.
Yeah.

2550
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,090
That's shredded now.
That's totally possible to do.

2551
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:32,924
Naturally he's on.
I know for a fact it can totally be 

2552
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:36,540
done.
His whole family,

2553
01:53:36,970 --> 01:53:38,320
his brothers,
his sister,

2554
01:53:38,321 --> 01:53:40,880
like they're all built that same way.
Totally can be done.

2555
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,250
The question is can you do what the 
other guy looks like?

2556
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,450
No,
that's different.

2557
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:48,530
I shouldn't say no because my clock,
my buddy clop,

2558
01:53:48,531 --> 01:53:49,364
he's 66 to 70.
If he and he eats like shit and he's 

2559
01:53:52,401 --> 01:53:55,400
jacked and shredded.
If he got on like a regular diet,

2560
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:57,200
like a strict,
like quito,

2561
01:53:57,450 --> 01:54:00,830
I'm sure you'd leni out even more and if
you've got obsessed with lifting,

2562
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:04,130
like he was lifting every day.
She is several times a day.

2563
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:05,390
Yeah,
like it was his job.

2564
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,870
Yeah.
Like these guys,

2565
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:07,713
maybe this possible can just.
You'd have to have be a freak of all 

2566
01:54:09,951 --> 01:54:13,010
freaks.
It's like girls with giant natural tits.

2567
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:13,820
Like,
whoa.

2568
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,920
Where'd that Come from?
Like there they do exist.

2569
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:16,840
God bless them.
Yeah.

2570
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:19,640
Guys were huge hogs.
They exist.

2571
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:25,070
Do they ever do people big noses?
Am I right?

2572
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,180
Am I right?
Am I right?

2573
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,690
Yeah.
Those love a guy with a big nose.

2574
01:54:31,691 --> 01:54:34,790
Sleep and eat either pussy from behind.
Some chicks love a big nose.

2575
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:39,600
That's why it's very strange.
I want to back the knows they want knows

2576
01:54:39,601 --> 01:54:42,620
in the ass mouth on the pussy.
That's what they want it.

2577
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:45,590
That's why they love a big doc.
Used to have a bit about it.

2578
01:54:45,591 --> 01:54:46,850
It's called doing the pigeon.

2579
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:55,820
I think that's what it is.
I don't know for sure,

2580
01:54:56,030 --> 01:54:57,200
but as a girl,
as a girl,

2581
01:54:57,201 --> 01:54:59,030
you can't have a huge nose.
No,

2582
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,290
that doesn't help.
It doesn't help.

2583
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:01,880
No.
Like cyrano de bergerac.

2584
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:04,520
It would help if she was lying on her 
back with her head,

2585
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:08,930
like leaning over backwards.
That knows could be like a taint rub.

2586
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,870
Right?
That bird.

2587
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,900
That bird is horrible to see that video 
that I put on my instagram,

2588
01:55:14,901 --> 01:55:15,734
but this bird fucking up.
This chick a woodpecker finds these 

2589
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:21,860
chicks in this bird nest and Just 
starts,

2590
01:55:21,861 --> 01:55:24,580
jack and horrifying.
Is that a.

2591
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:28,210
Is that a woodpecker woodpecker crime or
is that like a pitch and he's fucking.

2592
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:30,730
It's just aNother bird.
Some other kinds of birds.

2593
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,953
He ate his brain.
See if he could figure it out and that 

2594
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,433
fucking chick can't do anything.
It's just getting literally stabbed in 

2595
01:55:38,931 --> 01:55:41,270
the head repeatedly by a woodpecker.

2596
01:55:41,330 --> 01:55:44,850
OH my god.
Fuck woodpeckers on people.

2597
01:55:44,851 --> 01:55:48,150
we have a weird idea what nature is and 
you need to see things like that,

2598
01:55:48,151 --> 01:55:51,120
like there's a great website,
instagram page.

2599
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,330
Nature is metal.
Is that the one that I was at?

2600
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:55,990
What I retweeted.
Nature is melted as nature's metal.

2601
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:57,600
One of my favorite.
I go to that everyday.

2602
01:55:57,950 --> 01:56:01,860
Nature of metal is crazy.
It's all clips of shit getting jacked.

2603
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:04,660
Everything is crocodiles,
jackin,

2604
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,550
gazelles and hippos.
Jack and crocodiles and crocodiles,

2605
01:56:08,551 --> 01:56:11,700
jack and other crops are going ham on a 
cruck.

2606
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,950
That's an alligator,
but yeah,

2607
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:15,330
otters.
Ruthless bro.

2608
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,253
If an audit things that a look at that 
thing that's a fucking hawk tearing 

2609
01:56:18,751 --> 01:56:19,740
apart.
Another other bird.

2610
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:23,250
Holy fuck.
Nature is metal.

2611
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,380
Let me see.
I'm not sold yet.

2612
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,770
There's one of a lion.
Oh,

2613
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:28,890
that had.
Oh yeah.

2614
01:56:28,891 --> 01:56:31,320
Look at that crocodile.
Oh jesus christ.

2615
01:56:31,321 --> 01:56:32,154
Look at that one.

2616
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:35,960
Crocodile with another crocodile in its 
mouth doing a crocodile role.

2617
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:39,570
Winging it through the air by its head 
and ripping his face off.

2618
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:41,670
Just date.
They are fucking ruthless.

2619
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:45,810
Go take noted friends.
Friends,

2620
01:56:46,210 --> 01:56:47,190
disagree.
As I say,

2621
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,510
nobody.
Look at that.

2622
01:56:48,511 --> 01:56:51,660
Fucking look at the teeth on that thing.
Do you see that?

2623
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:52,723
A reporter,
he was surfing with his friends in sir 

2624
01:56:54,661 --> 01:56:57,780
lanka last night,
got eaten alive by a crocodile.

2625
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:58,703
Oh great.
He went to go wash his hair and I was 

2626
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:00,391
like,
oh,

2627
01:57:00,391 --> 01:57:02,690
cool story reporter.
Got them.

2628
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:03,793
Blow the reporter.
You know the guy who his job was a 

2629
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:07,350
reporter.
He was out in certain lonca,

2630
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:08,790
just vacationing.
Surf boarding,

2631
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:13,350
saltwater croc dot his ass.
God damn saltwater crocs was terrifying.

2632
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:16,020
Look at that one up top.
We've got the one up top with the deer.

2633
01:57:16,021 --> 01:57:18,060
Got jacked by a tree.
Look at that.

2634
01:57:18,150 --> 01:57:20,100
Palm tree dropped on his head.

2635
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,430
The tree just fell on his head.
What are the odds are not good.

2636
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:26,130
It's a terrible way to go.
Terrible way to go.

2637
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:27,923
Just landed right on his head.
How the fuck does that only have 159 

2638
01:57:30,811 --> 01:57:31,644
likes?
Because now we will talk about it and 

2639
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:35,070
get more likes despite the blow up 
properly.

2640
01:57:35,071 --> 01:57:37,710
So we got 17,000.
Are you just going to blow?

2641
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:40,800
It should nature is metal and then 
underscore.

2642
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:42,000
But go,
uh,

2643
01:57:42,030 --> 01:57:42,863
go further down.
There's some fucking crazy ones on that 

2644
01:57:44,401 --> 01:57:46,290
page.
I go to this shit everyday.

2645
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:48,380
I'm going to follow it now.
Yeah,

2646
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:50,640
there's a lot of my that about the fuck 
up.

2647
01:57:50,641 --> 01:57:52,530
That snake there.
Look at that one.

2648
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:53,600
Yeah,
go,

2649
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:54,433
go back.
Please look at this one with this 

2650
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:56,994
crocodile right here.
The mouth open with a zebra head in his 

2651
01:57:59,881 --> 01:58:01,080
mouth.
look at that.

2652
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,300
Oh,
you know what people send zebra head.

2653
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:06,090
He sent me these all times because when 
I was leaving hots,

2654
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:09,960
I sent them a zebra and I'll let you 
ever seen anyone a fucking ride.

2655
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:11,010
a zebra.
You can't.

2656
01:58:11,011 --> 01:58:12,450
I'm a zebra.
People are like,

2657
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:14,970
really?
Then they send me these all the time.

2658
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:18,810
Look at the mouth on that thing.
That is a fucking dinosaur.

2659
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,780
That's a dinosaur.
That zebra is fucking.

2660
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,030
I'm not mad at his set of his teeth 
either in that,

2661
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,130
but um,
he's obviously older,

2662
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:26,641
right?
Like,

2663
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:30,180
that's an old fuck their teeth up pretty
quick.

2664
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:32,400
They probably don't live that long.
I mean,

2665
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:37,200
I woUld assume that zebras much like any
other animal that lives in the wild,

2666
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:39,410
you know,
they,

2667
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:40,061
iF you,
you know,

2668
01:58:40,061 --> 01:58:42,100
if you Can get to 10,
congratulations,

2669
01:58:42,101 --> 01:58:43,870
you did something amazing.
You're killing tHe game,

2670
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,850
but those zebras,
if you're like looking at their,

2671
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:49,684
um,
look at that.

2672
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,190
How about the jack?
That mouse?

2673
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,010
that's a metaphor for life.
Look,

2674
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:54,613
picture the zebra stripes.
Those are designed so that align has a 

2675
01:58:57,971 --> 01:59:00,580
hard time picking out one individual 
animal.

2676
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:03,150
Is that why they do it?
They're always together and to hurt.

2677
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:04,003
You can't tell if you look at him.
I always wondered that because to me 

2678
01:59:05,531 --> 01:59:08,080
they would stick out being black and 
white and the goddamn desert,

2679
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,930
no africa,
this is one of the things they did.

2680
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:15,550
They put a collar on a zebra to track 
them and every tIme they would do it,

2681
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:19,420
that was zero get killed because they 
could see it because they could see it.

2682
01:59:19,421 --> 01:59:21,070
It would stand out.
I can see that color.

2683
01:59:21,071 --> 01:59:24,580
Like that's the one.
See that there's a pattern that they use

2684
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:29,530
for cammo that I'm like,
there's a company called firstlight.

2685
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:32,530
They make like the,
if not the best,

2686
01:59:32,531 --> 01:59:33,420
one of the best,
uh,

2687
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,380
hunting gears in the world.

2688
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,243
It's like they make this really fine 
merino wool clothes that they put 

2689
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:42,670
camomile patterns on and they.
When you sweat and merino wool,

2690
01:59:42,671 --> 01:59:44,380
it's like really good because you never 
get cold.

2691
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:46,360
It keeps your body says it's a natural 
fiber,

2692
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:50,890
but anyway they have this a one,
a pattern they use called asap,

2693
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,140
a s,
a t all season,

2694
01:59:53,141 --> 01:59:57,970
all terrain and in a way it kind of 
mimics what you see in a zebra.

2695
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:59,043
So like what a zebra is like.
You can't make out the outline now 

2696
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:03,130
because there's the blacks and the 
whites.

2697
02:00:03,131 --> 02:00:03,964
The contrast.
It's like you have a hard time for an 

2698
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:06,844
animal in this camp was black and white.
This campbell's got a few different 

2699
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:10,084
shades in it,
but the idea behind the invention of 

2700
02:00:11,741 --> 02:00:12,574
this camp I was working one of the first
cameras like most camel's back in the 

2701
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,533
day used to be either like army shit 
like vagina or they would be like 

2702
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,030
leaves,
like actual leaves.

2703
02:00:22,130 --> 02:00:22,963
A lot of companies started making like 
where it looks like photo realistic 

2704
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:26,703
trees and patterns and stuff,
which kind of works kind of the whole 

2705
02:00:29,651 --> 02:00:30,700
idea.
That's asap.

2706
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,450
So see,
see how that is like it breaks up,

2707
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:38,530
looks like you go up right up there to 
the jacket.

2708
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,000
Jamie.
The jacket right there.

2709
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:42,640
Yeah,
that's a kind of a ghillie suit.

2710
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,033
What has all this extra phrase to it 
that you would use that if you were 

2711
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:48,880
hunting turkeys?
Because turkeys can see real good.

2712
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:53,140
But when you're wearing that,
the idea is that all those stripes break

2713
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:58,190
up your outline that say the exact same 
reason why a zebra has that shit.

2714
02:00:58,301 --> 02:00:59,800
I did not know that.
I always wanted that.

2715
02:00:59,830 --> 02:01:03,040
I always wanted it to that.
So have you seen the new uh,

2716
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,680
uh,
body suits doing the water for sharks?

2717
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,850
So they have the suits?

2718
02:01:06,910 --> 02:01:07,820
Yeah.
Have you seen those?

2719
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:09,543
The,
you're saying so there's sharks can't 

2720
02:01:10,631 --> 02:01:13,630
see your electrical signal.
So we know it's for sharks that.

2721
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:16,450
So they don't think you're a seal.
Oh,

2722
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:20,200
what does it do as a different color?
Some of her black and white.

2723
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:21,034
If you look at him,
there's this thing called hex hecs and 

2724
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:29,120
they're these suits that people were in 
particular when they go to it.

2725
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:30,700
And jamie,
what is this?

2726
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:33,820
Carbon full sleeve wetsuit.
No,

2727
02:01:33,821 --> 02:01:36,970
that's just pretty.
If you go to like a fish,

2728
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:38,210
I'd fuck you up if you're like,
yeah,

2729
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:40,160
you look like a sweet,
delicious tuna.

2730
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:42,830
Oda heck suit h e,
c s.

2731
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:46,850
So I don't know if this is real.
So this is one of the things that I want

2732
02:01:46,851 --> 02:01:47,684
to,
uh,

2733
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:48,471
just right.
Heck,

2734
02:01:48,471 --> 02:01:49,970
suit,
hecs suit.

2735
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:53,150
Um,
I would love people.

2736
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:55,520
Yeah.
Hex suit.

2737
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:56,743
I would love people to tell me whether 
or not this really works because 

2738
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:00,673
apparently your body is supposed to 
admit some sort of electric electrical 

2739
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:04,814
signal.

2740
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,480
And if you run your body over thiS 
thing,

2741
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:09,763
it doesn't,
it registers your body's electrical 

2742
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:14,780
signal.
But if you put this heck suit on and run

2743
02:02:14,781 --> 02:02:16,760
your body over this thing,
it doesn't register.

2744
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,100
So that prove that it's really working 
with you guys.

2745
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:20,000
Chilling.
Turkeys.

2746
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:22,380
I don't know that guys in shape.
I mean,

2747
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:26,600
but it works apparently like noticeably 
works in the water.

2748
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:28,460
Like this guys,
what he's doing here,

2749
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,880
he's just fucking day run.
No,

2750
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:32,541
no,
no.

2751
02:02:32,541 --> 02:02:33,374
You can't.
They try to get the fuck away from you 

2752
02:02:34,820 --> 02:02:35,653
with this heck suit on.
They've shown the difference between 

2753
02:02:36,771 --> 02:02:41,030
wearing it and not wearing it and it 
seems to see this I'm not impressed with

2754
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,880
because he's about to shoot this animal 
and that animal can't see them.

2755
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,313
Anybody can do that.
I could do that with like clothes on if 

2756
02:02:47,001 --> 02:02:49,130
the animal can't see it.
Doesn't matter.

2757
02:02:49,190 --> 02:02:50,600
Yeah,
but the animal doesn't see you.

2758
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:52,610
It doesn't matter.
But if the animal sees you,

2759
02:02:52,611 --> 02:02:53,444
the idea is that this heck suit is 
supposed to somehow or another to 

2760
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:55,963
protect you.
They shouldn't have shown that one 

2761
02:02:57,990 --> 02:02:58,823
because that video didn't mean anything.
It's like you couldn't see that the 

2762
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:03,710
animal was looking his way.
So it's interesting though.

2763
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:07,340
See the shows like see,
go back a little bit.

2764
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:10,420
So watch it shows when they walk in.
No,

2765
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,600
you just had it.
Just leave it alone.

2766
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:15,930
Go back there.
Kinda watch.

2767
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:21,020
See he's passing in front of it and 
without hex you see how it registers now

2768
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:21,854
with the heck suit on.
It registers very little and this is 

2769
02:03:25,071 --> 02:03:27,100
somehow or another supposed to be red,
red.

2770
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:32,950
Recognizing the electrical signal that 
your body has to so bad because you get,

2771
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:35,540
you get your piss on,
so I'm pissed off.

2772
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,070
See,
this doesn't impress me.

2773
02:03:37,071 --> 02:03:39,500
There's a fucking armadillo.
Husqvarna romberg's test.

2774
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,940
Anyone.
Do you know anyone that has one?

2775
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:43,850
John dudley.
He believes in it.

2776
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:44,684
That's why I'm curious about it because 
I don't know how much there's John 

2777
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,620
Dudley right now.
Heck's testimonial.

2778
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:52,130
I just don't know how much science is 
behind it.

2779
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:57,970
I mean a lot of times you want to 
believe that things work and I think you

2780
02:03:57,971 --> 02:04:00,200
kind of.
It works with coyotes too.

2781
02:04:00,201 --> 02:04:01,034
That's the weird one.
Comedies like walk right up to people 

2782
02:04:02,571 --> 02:04:03,404
that are wearing it.
The idea is that animals might have 

2783
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:10,460
certain sensors and the ability to 
detect signals that you give off that we

2784
02:04:10,461 --> 02:04:13,130
just don't possess.
So because we don't possess those,

2785
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:15,830
those abilities to recognize those 
signals,

2786
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:16,723
we don't recognize that these animals do
because we don't think of it as an 

2787
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:22,910
option and what they're saying is it's 
entirely possible,

2788
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,013
especially with predators,
apparently entirely possible that 

2789
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:31,310
animals emit some sort of an electrical 
signal that animals are attracted to.

2790
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:35,630
And then when they see this person 
wearing this heck suit,

2791
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:38,280
those signals don't come through and 
they don't know what the fuck you are,

2792
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:42,660
which is really fascinating.
See electromagnetic signal,

2793
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:43,500
right?
Is that what it's saying?

2794
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:44,393
Yeah.
I don't know how much of it is real 

2795
02:04:47,281 --> 02:04:49,230
though.
Like I've never,

2796
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:52,230
I've never seen a study on it.
They have studies on this.

2797
02:04:52,670 --> 02:04:53,820
I do that.
When you go up there,

2798
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,010
when it says proof,
do they have a proof thing?

2799
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:58,260
If you go to the top.
I like how it works.

2800
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,160
Yeah.
How does it work?

2801
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:01,260
That's where I'm looking at it.
There's no like,

2802
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,153
oh yeah.
See I feel like hex blocks you 

2803
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:07,760
electrical signal.
Okay.

2804
02:05:08,730 --> 02:05:12,870
Seems to block that.
They think the real question to me is do

2805
02:05:12,871 --> 02:05:15,930
the animal see it?
They've done an extensive,

2806
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:20,790
extensive studies on what animals do and
don't see as far as camouflage.

2807
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,450
And I think one of the ways they've done
that and what kind of light they see.

2808
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,433
One of the ways they've done that is 
through like they have like deer farms 

2809
02:05:27,781 --> 02:05:28,614
where they have undulates in captivity 
and they feed them and they only feed 

2810
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:35,370
them if they can see certain things so 
they show them certain things and that's

2811
02:05:35,371 --> 02:05:36,204
how they measure whether or not they're 
actually able to recognize patterns 

2812
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:45,450
because some patterns are really good,
like some patterns just completely break

2813
02:05:45,451 --> 02:05:46,284
up the outline of a person to an animal 
and the animal just see some weird shit 

2814
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:54,780
that looks like a bush size of the mesh 
is crucial to effectively blogging,

2815
02:05:54,781 --> 02:05:56,160
humility,
faraday cages,

2816
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:56,994
what it's explaining,
which is the part I was just kind of 

2817
02:05:58,581 --> 02:06:02,190
look looking at this as the science 
invented in 1836,

2818
02:06:02,191 --> 02:06:07,191
so just before a dude invented 
chiropractor by an english scientist,

2819
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:08,580
michael faraday.

2820
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:09,573
A faraday cage is an enclosure made out 
of a conductive mesh material that 

2821
02:06:12,841 --> 02:06:13,674
blocks electrical fields by channeling 
the electricity through the mesh to use 

2822
02:06:17,311 --> 02:06:19,260
to protect electronic equipment from 
lighting,

2823
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:24,180
lightening strikes or in screen rooms,
which allows for environments to be free

2824
02:06:24,181 --> 02:06:26,520
of electromagnetic interference.
That makes sense.

2825
02:06:27,370 --> 02:06:29,910
What I don't know is whether or not an 
animal can see that.

2826
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:31,580
I'd like to know.
Yeah,

2827
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:33,450
couldn't look.
Why don't you google?

2828
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:38,690
CAn animals detect electrical?
I'm pretty sure that energy,

2829
02:06:39,381 --> 02:06:42,900
that's why it shows those flocks of 
birds floating around.

2830
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:48,140
From what I've read science things.
That's how they're communicating through

2831
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:50,490
electric schools of fish or magnetism.
Magnets,

2832
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:53,140
magnetic waves.
Electromagnetic waves is what?

2833
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,113
Yeah,
I mean it only makes sense if you watch 

2834
02:06:55,021 --> 02:06:59,190
those giant flocks of birds all flowing 
together,

2835
02:06:59,191 --> 02:07:00,024
that they have some sort of way of 
interacting with each other that we 

2836
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:03,690
don't understand.
Like what is it?

2837
02:07:03,810 --> 02:07:05,580
I don't know,
but there's something going on.

2838
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:09,840
I mean there's no way you could ever get
people to fly through the air like that.

2839
02:07:09,841 --> 02:07:10,674
I mean,
I've heard people that said they've 

2840
02:07:11,790 --> 02:07:12,623
taken like the god dose mushrooms can 
see it when they're like all fucked up 

2841
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,053
on the beach.
They can see magnetic waves coming in 

2842
02:07:17,461 --> 02:07:20,430
off waves and I've never been there.

2843
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,090
Hi.
I apologize.

2844
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:22,891
I took.
No worries.

2845
02:07:22,891 --> 02:07:24,940
That was brutal.
That was not a piss,

2846
02:07:24,941 --> 02:07:25,550
bro.
Listen,

2847
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:27,010
this.
I was trying to be cool.

2848
02:07:27,011 --> 02:07:28,680
I don't know if.
Could tell thAt this shit sweats.

2849
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:29,590
no,
listen to this.

2850
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:32,260
What happened?
I haven't eaten anything all day.

2851
02:07:32,261 --> 02:07:33,410
And then went to starbucks.
I went,

2852
02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:34,263
you know what,
give me one of those nitrile I need a 

2853
02:07:36,041 --> 02:07:37,000
venti.
And she goes,

2854
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:38,590
we don't do vanities.
It's dangerous.

2855
02:07:38,591 --> 02:07:39,424
Only grind down that bitch bro.
It's like a crazy kind of like a pink a 

2856
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:45,970
guinness coffee that comes out of like 
attack.

2857
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:48,450
Oh.
It's like,

2858
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:52,590
it's Just like caveman nitrile came in.
Nitrile is super strong,

2859
02:07:52,591 --> 02:07:55,300
but give me a venti no,
I get some shit to display.

2860
02:07:55,380 --> 02:07:56,950
nitrogenated coffee.
Yeah.

2861
02:07:56,951 --> 02:07:58,240
Super strong.
She goes,

2862
02:07:58,241 --> 02:07:59,074
I can't give it to you on the ground.
And went I find Just put two shots in 

2863
02:08:01,601 --> 02:08:01,690
it.

2864
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:02,523
She goes,
we don't recommend that I could put two 

2865
02:08:03,491 --> 02:08:05,710
shots in it.
So that's what I got.

2866
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:07,263
Two shots in it.
You see that slingshot bitch would do 

2867
02:08:09,761 --> 02:08:14,110
shots in it.
She did that and halfway through talking

2868
02:08:14,111 --> 02:08:15,190
about camouflage,
I went,

2869
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:20,050
oh shit.
Ms dot starbucks was right.

2870
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:21,640
Yeah.
That horn the bozos.

2871
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:24,370
Shit my pants.
I swerved out the closest I've ever come

2872
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:26,890
to shit my pants on.
Fucking on a podcast,

2873
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:30,730
on anything.
I shit my pants hands ever.

2874
02:08:30,850 --> 02:08:31,610
No,
no one.

2875
02:08:31,610 --> 02:08:34,120
Brian lyons says shit.
His pants because he was later mr.

2876
02:08:34,230 --> 02:08:35,530
Shell.
Yeah.

2877
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:38,740
Hilarious.
Don't men don't shit their pants.

2878
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:41,840
Spare pair of pants.
Trunk and just changed them.

2879
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:44,280
What'd you do?
Oh,

2880
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,280
you did.
How'd you clean up?

2881
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:47,290
I just went to a gas station.
Oh sure he did.

2882
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:50,110
He's still tony's guy.
Ever makes total sense.

2883
02:08:51,230 --> 02:08:52,063
Do.
I was trying to be cool and it's 

2884
02:08:52,701 --> 02:08:54,760
probably a good idea to keep a pair of 
pants.

2885
02:08:54,850 --> 02:08:56,110
Underwear,
socks,

2886
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:56,973
shoes.
Why don't piquet tape one small change 

2887
02:08:59,201 --> 02:09:01,540
of clothes and your trunk?
Always a smart move.

2888
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:05,050
I never do it right,
but it seems like if you have a trunk,

2889
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:07,060
what the fuck you karen.
What's in your truck?

2890
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,073
You have rome.
I mean it's not like it's going to cost 

2891
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:11,560
you gas mileage.
Just a little baG.

2892
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:14,020
It makes sense.
That makes sense for that.

2893
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:16,470
Did you bring a whole upstairs?
Yeah,

2894
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:19,720
bring a whole outfit and extra outfit.
So if soMething terrible happens.

2895
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:20,920
Well,
I'll tell you right now,

2896
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:22,680
something terrible will hAppen when I'm 
on the four.

2897
02:09:22,681 --> 02:09:24,580
Oh,
five night goddamn slingshot with no ac.

2898
02:09:24,590 --> 02:09:27,010
Seeing my stomach is on the fritz.
like why did you get that thing?

2899
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:29,710
like what was what was going on and gave
it to me for free?

2900
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,000
yes.
That's ridiculous.

2901
02:09:31,001 --> 02:09:32,320
I'm not,
I'm not that stupid.

2902
02:09:32,321 --> 02:09:33,880
I'm going to have this.

2903
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:34,863
They went,
yeah,

2904
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:35,980
have it.
Yeah.

2905
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:38,620
So you just have to tell people how 
ridiculous it is.

2906
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:40,130
They.
They didn't even say that.

2907
02:09:40,131 --> 02:09:41,540
I said,
if you want to post by whatever you want

2908
02:09:41,541 --> 02:09:42,041
to do,
man,

2909
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:44,380
we want you to take this spin around for
me.

2910
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,393
Cool.
RighT.

2911
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,950
Might as well.
It's amazing.

2912
02:09:47,951 --> 02:09:49,630
I love the fact that it's got a stick 
shift.

2913
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:54,610
You need it for a spin off.
A weird one.

2914
02:09:54,611 --> 02:09:57,490
I drive that corvette.
The corvette convertible.

2915
02:09:57,550 --> 02:09:58,000
Yeah.
No,

2916
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,833
no roof will flake a raw when I'm behind
a truck and got a foot rock spits up 

2917
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:05,680
when you go behind the truck and I,
I'd always get out of the way.

2918
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:06,663
Yeah,
you got to be clever about how you 

2919
02:10:08,141 --> 02:10:12,190
approach like large groups of cars when 
you have a convertible for a motorcycle.

2920
02:10:12,191 --> 02:10:15,370
I guess that's why I liked it because 
I'm more in tuned with what's going on.

2921
02:10:15,371 --> 02:10:16,204
Like fuck it,
I'm on it where it went off on my car 

2922
02:10:17,771 --> 02:10:22,771
and so comfortable the pdk I can have a 
case shit and jacking off whatever.

2923
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:25,540
Yeah,
It's interesting.

2924
02:10:25,541 --> 02:10:26,374
Like does your car have the car play 
thing where you can talk to it and tell 

2925
02:10:28,721 --> 02:10:31,450
what jakks people amazing.
Is that ridiculous?

2926
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,220
It reads the text

2927
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:38,180
for you and it tells you a like,
would you like to reply?

2928
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:39,171
And you're like,
yes,

2929
02:10:39,171 --> 02:10:40,490
I would.
bitch takes them back.

2930
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:41,630
Whatever you want,
whatever.

2931
02:10:41,631 --> 02:10:43,850
You don't need to get texts anymore.
Texts him.

2932
02:10:43,851 --> 02:10:45,710
John,
I wonder if you could program siri where

2933
02:10:45,711 --> 02:10:48,560
you say bitch after everything.
Of course bitch.

2934
02:10:49,190 --> 02:10:50,060
Yes I do.
Bitch.

2935
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:52,520
And if you don't say bitcH,
siri doesn't recognize.

2936
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:54,350
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

2937
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,440
bitch?
You hurt me.

2938
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:00,380
You that new life phone drops next 
month.

2939
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:01,790
I'm stoked.
Sort.

2940
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:05,190
Have you seen it?
There's a lifelong.

2941
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:06,890
Finally,
there's two new ones.

2942
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:07,843
Finally,
I only tried a google phone for like a 

2943
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:10,303
month.
I feel like you're on that google trip 

2944
02:11:11,841 --> 02:11:12,920
for a second though.
I did.

2945
02:11:12,921 --> 02:11:13,754
Well,
I tried to get off the apple tit and I 

2946
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:15,733
went with a mac lab,
windows laptop and I went with an 

2947
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:18,644
android phone,
kept abandoned boulder and the 

2948
02:11:21,110 --> 02:11:21,943
announcement for it,
they said something when they were 

2949
02:11:23,301 --> 02:11:24,380
showing the face id.

2950
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,080
That kinda was alarming to me that I 
didn't know.

2951
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:29,930
Oh yeah,
the touch id one in 50,000

2952
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:33,110
chance that someone just unlocks your 
phone without your fingerprint.

2953
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:37,370
Doesn't seem like that secure one in 
50,000.

2954
02:11:37,371 --> 02:11:38,900
It's pretty goddamn security.
Jamie.

2955
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,490
Pretty secure,
but I'll take my chances.

2956
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:46,640
How many dick pics you can.
They can easily get on my.

2957
02:11:46,641 --> 02:11:49,280
I have a apple pay put on my phone so 
like you can get.

2958
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,443
You can start using my card right away.
Start paying for shit if you did my 

2959
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:54,200
phone.
The new ones.

2960
02:11:54,201 --> 02:11:56,360
It's face recognition and that's the 
next one.

2961
02:11:56,361 --> 02:12:00,110
It says it's one of the problem with 
that is well one of them.

2962
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:02,720
I want my worried about that.
I'm worried about you being next to your

2963
02:12:02,721 --> 02:12:05,120
girl and you grill sticks your phone 
right on your face.

2964
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:08,620
That starts it up and then.
Oh look at this motherfucker.

2965
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:10,670
Jamie vernon with a bunch of dick pics.
Oh,

2966
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:13,400
once and then that one.
It's the same.

2967
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:15,600
Fall asleep when she puts her thumb on 
there and unlocks.

2968
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,723
That's true.
She tries to get my face to touch me 

2969
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:19,243
when I'm asleep.
I will wake up immediately and choke 

2970
02:12:20,601 --> 02:12:22,880
you.
Just for this one.

2971
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:25,070
You said you were looking at it.
You have to like,

2972
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:27,920
you have to have your eyes open so then 
she drugs.

2973
02:12:27,921 --> 02:12:30,740
You need your fingers.
Pose your eyelids back.

2974
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,350
She can do it.
Figure it out.

2975
02:12:33,630 --> 02:12:38,430
I'll just do is paint fake eyeballs on 
your eyelids shut.

2976
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,580
You're asleep.
But she's got white paint.

2977
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:41,833
It just be crazy.
And then she puts like a little black 

2978
02:12:44,901 --> 02:12:45,734
sharpie mark,
but it's like the most expensive phone 

2979
02:12:48,171 --> 02:12:49,800
ever.
No,

2980
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:51,140
I don't know.
It's like 1200 bucks.

2981
02:12:51,141 --> 02:12:55,070
I think if you're buying it outright,
that's spiderman.

2982
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:55,730
Look at my phone.

2983
02:12:55,730 --> 02:12:58,730
My son broke the fuck.
I refused to get a new one.

2984
02:12:58,820 --> 02:13:00,630
Why?
I'm waiting for the coming out,

2985
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:03,620
but it's interesting that they're coming
out with the iphone eight,

2986
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:06,170
eight plus and the 10 all together at 
the same time.

2987
02:13:06,171 --> 02:13:06,621
It's like,
look,

2988
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:08,820
you can go packs.
You can go po it.

2989
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:12,590
Skip the nine.
It's just the 10 year anniversary.

2990
02:13:12,820 --> 02:13:15,890
What jamie?
It says iphone 10,

2991
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:20,360
how to pronounce the new iphone.
Then you have tim cook saying we call it

2992
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:22,010
iphone 10.
Boom.

2993
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,940
Correct me if you're wrong.
I didn't know that.

2994
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:27,690
So there's a nine and a nine.
They skipped it.

2995
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:29,540
Hold on.
So here's the thing,

2996
02:13:29,541 --> 02:13:30,374
you get these bullshit ass like dead 
spots where you don't have a screen on 

2997
02:13:34,610 --> 02:13:35,443
it,
so you could fear all poor next to that 

2998
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:41,160
person that has the 10 that has no 
wireless charging.

2999
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,533
Let's start with eight as where I was 
charging two and it's waterproof now 

3000
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:49,900
like you can go in the ocean with it.
Can you know wHere the phone?

3001
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,350
Yeah,
now its water resistance.

3002
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:54,930
That one's just what little bit 
waterproof.

3003
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,940
The new one,
but the new new shit.

3004
02:13:57,030 --> 02:14:02,030
Water resistant swim.
Swimming underwater picks.

3005
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:03,720
The new one is three,
right?

3006
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,910
Iphone three.
watched the watches,

3007
02:14:05,911 --> 02:14:06,744
the cellular added to It.
I like it so you don't even have to 

3008
02:14:10,831 --> 02:14:11,664
bring your phone.
You can go running and then you girls 

3009
02:14:13,051 --> 02:14:14,040
back at home.
She's like,

3010
02:14:14,041 --> 02:14:14,874
I use your face to find your phone and 
now I'm carrying from your own phone to 

3011
02:14:16,951 --> 02:14:17,701
say,
fuck you.

3012
02:14:17,701 --> 02:14:19,020
I'm in your house on fire

3013
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:21,050
dick pics,
saddened,

3014
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:23,100
son of a bitch.
dude,

3015
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:25,830
I don't get down with iphone watches.
Not my cup of tea,

3016
02:14:25,831 --> 02:14:26,664
but the phone call,
like three seconds later you're 

3017
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:32,460
receiving dead pigs to you taking it to 
andy.

3018
02:14:32,461 --> 02:14:36,720
Jake wants to suck your dick and you 
didn't block his number.

3019
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:39,600
You said to your.
That's what I would say.

3020
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:41,070
If I wanted a second guys,
dick,

3021
02:14:41,071 --> 02:14:44,500
I'd say hello.
Come on over and suck my dick.

3022
02:14:45,380 --> 02:14:48,420
Honest.
You just cut it out.

3023
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:49,500
You're being so silly.

3024
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:52,670
That's what they say.
If they know they're gonna,

3025
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,510
sock it,
lol.

3026
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:57,970
Yeah.
If you say and then they call you up and

3027
02:14:57,971 --> 02:14:58,360
go,
hey,

3028
02:14:58,360 --> 02:15:00,760
don't ever fucking texted me.
Something like that again.

3029
02:15:00,761 --> 02:15:02,180
I'm sorry.
Just joking.

3030
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:03,940
That was like normal,
but if they go,

3031
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:07,090
lol,
lol.

3032
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:09,880
I was like,
she's like getting wet,

3033
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:11,260
just freaking out,
lol.

3034
02:15:11,261 --> 02:15:13,960
You're silly.
If people say,

3035
02:15:13,961 --> 02:15:15,700
lol,
lol,

3036
02:15:15,790 --> 02:15:16,623
you silly goose,
you silly gobble driving over your 

3037
02:15:19,061 --> 02:15:20,360
house,
taking the.

3038
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:27,760
What is it about these new phones like 
what do you really.

3039
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:31,390
How much do you need that new phone?
How much do you need that new screen?

3040
02:15:31,750 --> 02:15:32,583
It's like it's a trap like and that's 
going to be a piece of shit in a year 

3041
02:15:35,081 --> 02:15:36,310
from now,
a year from now,

3042
02:15:36,311 --> 02:15:38,290
it's going to be some new thing.
That's everything though.

3043
02:15:38,420 --> 02:15:41,410
It puts pressure on you to get the new 
phone because that's what's cool.

3044
02:15:41,411 --> 02:15:42,700
That's what's hip,
but they.

3045
02:15:42,830 --> 02:15:45,070
They're adding new stuff to it.
It's like the new car.

3046
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,050
Where's the fingerprint reader?
There isn't one.

3047
02:15:47,051 --> 02:15:49,120
It's just your face where you can go 
fuck yourself.

3048
02:15:49,121 --> 02:15:52,660
That's stupid.
What if I face kids beat up and us.

3049
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,033
It knows it's learning with you and it 
shouldn't because you would have been 

3050
02:15:57,701 --> 02:15:59,260
looking at it earlier that day,
man.

3051
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,300
That's kinda scared as we're learning 
with you.

3052
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:01,781
Yes.
Yeah.

3053
02:16:01,781 --> 02:16:06,070
What does it fucks up and that data is 
all stored somewhere and it's supposedly

3054
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:06,913
encrypted.

3055
02:16:07,120 --> 02:16:09,880
Jesus.
The apple has my face,

3056
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:10,913
I just thought about what are they going
to do three or four or five years down 

3057
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:18,231
the line when they have five years of 
your aging of daily 12,

3058
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:19,660
15,
20,

3059
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:20,850
30,
40 times a day.

3060
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:22,530
Do you thInk it looks at kylie jenner 
and goes,

3061
02:16:22,531 --> 02:16:24,640
who the fuck is that guy?
Yeah,

3062
02:16:24,650 --> 02:16:28,350
it's good to recognize girls.
Fucking give that kylie jenner surgery.

3063
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,980
Is it kylie or clo?
which one's the

3064
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,450
one as the most highly?
What?

3065
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:34,480
What is it?
Where's the rest of your jaw?

3066
02:16:35,050 --> 02:16:38,980
What's going on here?
Get a new iphone every few months.

3067
02:16:39,430 --> 02:16:42,040
Just it.
I don't like that.

3068
02:16:42,070 --> 02:16:43,690
No fingerprint.
I don't.

3069
02:16:43,691 --> 02:16:46,120
I don't think I enjoy that.
I think that seems stupid.

3070
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:49,450
You might love it though,
because we're going to take your face.

3071
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:53,290
Hold it up and they'll pull you over.
They pull you over.

3072
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:55,900
They're just going to take your phone,
put it up to your face.

3073
02:16:55,901 --> 02:16:57,100
All you have to do is give me your 
phone.

3074
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:59,710
I want to know wHat you're doing.
You can't look at my phone.

3075
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:00,544
Oh yeah,
and they do that and then they can just 

3076
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:02,434
do it like people have.
Cops have tried to look in people's 

3077
02:17:04,151 --> 02:17:04,984
phones before.
They've told people to see if they're 

3078
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:07,594
texting.
They're allowed to put your finger on 

3079
02:17:09,761 --> 02:17:10,594
it.
They're not.

3080
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:11,740
Yes,
they are.

3081
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,900
they're not allowed to enter your 
password then.

3082
02:17:13,901 --> 02:17:16,510
Not allowed for you to ask what the 
password is.

3083
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:17,493
That's why they'd say for people you 
should not use the fingerprint part 

3084
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:22,953
because cops can actually actively use 
it because it's not specifically stated 

3085
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:28,400
like you're not allowed.
Yes.

3086
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,373
Lupo not allowed to tell someone you 
want their password because that's an 

3087
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:36,400
invasion of privacy.
You are allowed to take their finger and

3088
02:17:36,401 --> 02:17:39,070
put it on their phone and open their 
phone up.

3089
02:17:39,310 --> 02:17:41,350
What the fuck?
Exactly.

3090
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:46,390
Yeah.
It's like technology moving too fast and

3091
02:17:46,391 --> 02:17:50,050
we don't have the words in the language 
and the,

3092
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:50,943
you know the preparatIons,
they're deal with it yet new system 

3093
02:17:54,161 --> 02:17:58,210
built into the ios 11 which comes out a 
couple of days.

3094
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:02,410
That allows you to bypass that sort of 
quick tap five times.

3095
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:03,483
You can turn off touch id basically is 
what they're calling it as a cop to 

3096
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:13,090
count one,
two.

3097
02:18:13,600 --> 02:18:16,100
What was it?
One shit?

3098
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,830
Yeah.
I just don't think that's the way to go.

3099
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:23,890
The facial recognition thing just seems 
corny.

3100
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:26,890
I gotta do this every time I want to buy
something.

3101
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:28,473
No,
you can't just put my fucking dumb on 

3102
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:31,510
it.
You know what it is.

3103
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:34,120
Here's the problem.
These cons can't fIgure out a way to get

3104
02:18:34,121 --> 02:18:36,790
your fingerprint right off your phone 
yet right off the main screen.

3105
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:38,110
That's what they've been working on 
forever.

3106
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:39,950
Trying to get on the big screen.
Yeah,

3107
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:42,580
so you just touch anywhere on the screen
and it picks up your fingerprint.

3108
02:18:42,610 --> 02:18:44,380
That's what they've been working on 
forever.

3109
02:18:44,410 --> 02:18:47,230
They do not have that yet.
So they went with facial recognition,

3110
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,213
which they've already had for snapchat 
and for instagram filters and all those 

3111
02:18:50,981 --> 02:18:51,814
things.
Really see your face and then turn you 

3112
02:18:53,051 --> 02:18:55,600
into abraham lincoln or some shit way 
better than those,

3113
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:57,820
but it's an acceleration of that.

3114
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:58,653
Would they have been able to do is get 
your whole screen to be a fingerprint 

3115
02:19:01,361 --> 02:19:03,820
sensor and still be able to show images 
and all that stuff.

3116
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:06,010
Got something like six film selfie 
cameras,

3117
02:19:06,011 --> 02:19:10,060
ones like thoughts like the camera was 
doing.

3118
02:19:10,061 --> 02:19:10,894
It's like a little xbox.
Connect with the self is the camera 

3119
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:17,260
industry just doesn't just tell you 
they're useless.

3120
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:19,630
Last time you saw like a straight up 
camera.

3121
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:22,720
Well you'd have to be like a guy was a 
photographer like jamie.

3122
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,960
Then you carry those goofy brIcks 
because you want to impress chicks.

3123
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:27,723
You whAt he's doing is just take a 
picture of the sheriff's autologist 

3124
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:31,460
earlier the lighting.
Let me just fix your hair.

3125
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:35,550
Richard harris.
But even at that they like to pose.

3126
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:39,513
Did they go?
Did you see them all the time that they 

3127
02:19:40,721 --> 02:19:44,870
just go on like little photo shoot dates
with girls too and two,

3128
02:19:44,890 --> 02:19:45,300
three,
four,

3129
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:46,133
five,
10 times and there's taking pictures of 

3130
02:19:46,871 --> 02:19:49,210
each other.
They don't need to hire the photographer

3131
02:19:49,211 --> 02:19:49,630
anymore.
I've

3132
02:19:49,630 --> 02:19:50,463
seen that man.
I was at a restaurant and these two 

3133
02:19:51,341 --> 02:19:53,830
bitches just kept doing that back and 
forth wIth each other.

3134
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,000
I was like,
ladies,

3135
02:19:55,150 --> 02:19:57,370
enjoy your meal cry.
And they were like,

3136
02:19:57,371 --> 02:19:57,911
no,
like this,

3137
02:19:57,911 --> 02:19:59,760
like this.
Hold on Phones.

3138
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:00,760
Yeah.
This is the.

3139
02:20:00,850 --> 02:20:02,530
I'm about to take a selfie face.
ready.

3140
02:20:02,531 --> 02:20:03,364
There's a thing that girls do with their
neck that they only do when they're 

3141
02:20:05,621 --> 02:20:06,850
about to take selfie.
This is it.

3142
02:20:06,851 --> 02:20:11,851
Ready?
Just that weird neck boom.

3143
02:20:13,330 --> 02:20:14,450
It's like,
shit,

3144
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:21,460
this is weird.
Self like you don't ever do thAt.

3145
02:20:21,670 --> 02:20:22,503
And the other time,
except for when you're looking at your 

3146
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:26,010
phone,
you're just trying to sell,

3147
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:27,970
right?
Nothing is.

3148
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:31,510
Nothing is more awkward.
Seeing someone tried to take a selfie.

3149
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:34,450
You ever seen that mom at the playground
with their kids trying to take selfies.

3150
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:35,373
She takes 40 slumping selfies.
You just do like dispatch smile as what 

3151
02:20:38,141 --> 02:20:39,310
you look like.
Okay.

3152
02:20:39,510 --> 02:20:40,960
You just roll with it doesn't always 
look great.

3153
02:20:41,020 --> 02:20:45,580
You don't have tricking people but 
filters.

3154
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:50,090
That's how they do it,
man.

3155
02:20:50,870 --> 02:20:52,020
this is weird.
Chicken,

3156
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:53,570
chicken,
chicken,

3157
02:20:54,670 --> 02:20:55,900
chicken heads.
that's where it comes from.

3158
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:59,260
Chickens be crazy.
It's not where it comes from,

3159
02:20:59,261 --> 02:21:00,760
but it belongs in it.
True.

3160
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:02,200
It's in the same night.
Yeah.

3161
02:21:02,201 --> 02:21:04,240
Umbrella.
But that's a real chicken head.

3162
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:05,800
Yeah,
I mean this is really,

3163
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:07,420
this is,
trust me,

3164
02:21:07,421 --> 02:21:10,530
I've chickens fucking chicken.
This is.

3165
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,160
That's what they do,
man.

3166
02:21:12,190 --> 02:21:13,023
There's nothing more awkward seeing 
someone's trying to take fucking 

3167
02:21:15,611 --> 02:21:16,444
selfies.
It's so embarrassing is definitely more 

3168
02:21:18,881 --> 02:21:19,690
awkward.
Shit.

3169
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:23,050
It's more awkward if your friend is 
taking and you're a guy,

3170
02:21:23,650 --> 02:21:24,840
you're standIng there like,
hold on bro.

3171
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,040
Hold on bro.
Oh my god,

3172
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:27,370
hold on bro.
Hold on bro.

3173
02:21:27,510 --> 02:21:29,290
Like this.
It's so weird.

3174
02:21:29,370 --> 02:21:34,370
Why would he say your guy and you're 
poking your ass out.

3175
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:38,920
Like how many guys take pictures like 
this?

3176
02:21:38,970 --> 02:21:42,030
Hippo.
I'm going to look,

3177
02:21:42,150 --> 02:21:42,983
look,
look,

3178
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:43,943
mysterious.

3179
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:49,200
Thinking about this book.
I'm writing so awkward,

3180
02:21:51,161 --> 02:21:51,994
man.
I saw a story about a dude who died 

3181
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:58,060
because he was getting a dick operation.
What?

3182
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,460
Yeah,
he's getting fat pumped into his dick,

3183
02:22:00,461 --> 02:22:04,960
like kim kardashian's ass,
but he just had a fucking heart attack.

3184
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:10,020
Fat went through his bloodstream somehow
and his body locked up and that's a wrap

3185
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:13,030
and he was like 32 or some shit.
How old is he?

3186
02:22:13,070 --> 02:22:13,990
Thirty,
30,

3187
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,973
30 year old.
Relatively healthy person wanted a 

3188
02:22:17,651 --> 02:22:22,651
penile elongation and girth enhancement.
Surgery hollow,

3189
02:22:23,450 --> 02:22:24,283
but girth,
which includes transferring from one 

3190
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:30,420
area of the body and replaced he see,
he doesn't understand.

3191
02:22:30,421 --> 02:22:32,690
When we talk about having a fat dick.
No,

3192
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:34,770
that doesn't count,
does it?

3193
02:22:34,771 --> 02:22:38,950
It's like you take that literally you 
can like George Foreman fists like,

3194
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:40,600
man,
I wish I had a fish like george farms,

3195
02:22:40,601 --> 02:22:43,800
so pump fat in my mickey mouse gloves.

3196
02:22:46,020 --> 02:22:47,430
Sky fucked up,
man.

3197
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:48,630
He fucked up.
Well,

3198
02:22:48,631 --> 02:22:50,430
he defInitely fucked up.
Now he's dead.

3199
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:55,820
Hit a pulmonary fat embolism.
When fat traveled the bloodstream to his

3200
02:22:56,761 --> 02:22:57,594
lungs and ruptured blood vessels.
Christ first case of a seemingly simple 

3201
02:23:03,481 --> 02:23:04,314
and safe procedure,
a penis enlargement by autologous fat 

3202
02:23:07,741 --> 02:23:11,010
transfer cause of sudden death of a 
healthy young man.

3203
02:23:11,011 --> 02:23:14,160
According to the report,
doctors believed this is the first case.

3204
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,630
First of all,
doctors.

3205
02:23:15,660 --> 02:23:16,493
Fuck you.
Because that sounds like an ad for dick 

3206
02:23:18,781 --> 02:23:20,730
surgery,
which you shouldn't get.

3207
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:21,593
Okay?
Because you don't know what you're 

3208
02:23:21,901 --> 02:23:25,590
doing.
You're just making weird fucked up.

3209
02:23:25,591 --> 02:23:28,160
Dick's.
You're not make a bigger delta.

3210
02:23:28,220 --> 02:23:30,270
It's,
it's completely useless procedure.

3211
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:32,220
Well,
how about If never works in disfigures?

3212
02:23:32,221 --> 02:23:33,001
Man,
what have you.

3213
02:23:33,001 --> 02:23:35,970
Dick got fatter,
but the head was the same size,

3214
02:23:37,070 --> 02:23:40,680
big giant guy with a tiny head.
It is a steroid dude.

3215
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:41,873
There's pictures of him on the internet 
and his head is the size of a softball 

3216
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:48,050
and his body is as wide as this table 
and is the weird.

3217
02:23:48,051 --> 02:23:48,884
It's like beetlejuice.
He looks like the henchmen from myra 

3218
02:23:50,830 --> 02:23:51,441
brothers.
The movie,

3219
02:23:51,441 --> 02:23:53,310
if you remember that.
It might be faked out.

3220
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:57,960
It might be like one of them social.
I love that guy.

3221
02:23:58,950 --> 02:24:02,910
Had not beetle.
Just willy was fucked.

3222
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:06,800
Outstanding.
What a class is fucking phenomenal.

3223
02:24:06,801 --> 02:24:08,690
Move one of those remakes things that 
are happening.

3224
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:09,573
So he's going to be beetlejuice though.
I'm pretty sure it's like a sequel or 

3225
02:24:15,290 --> 02:24:16,370
something.
Oh,

3226
02:24:16,371 --> 02:24:19,730
it'll probably be telling or she's 
creepier looking better.

3227
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:22,610
Do you see it?
I heard it's really good.

3228
02:24:23,020 --> 02:24:25,400
I need to say it.
I love shit like that.

3229
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:28,160
It's exciting to last night people like 
have you seen them?

3230
02:24:28,161 --> 02:24:28,371
Like,
you know,

3231
02:24:28,371 --> 02:24:31,620
like best movie eveR.
I

3232
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:33,190
can't wait man.
I'm in me too.

3233
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:34,470
I'm all in.
If figured out.

3234
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:37,290
I think we need more monster movies.
Didn't you say that?

3235
02:24:37,291 --> 02:24:38,124
John landis,
his sons remaking american werewolf in 

3236
02:24:39,691 --> 02:24:40,524
london,

3237
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:43,180
they're redoing some like,
uh,

3238
02:24:43,450 --> 02:24:46,030
so in the same vein that the avengers 
exists now,

3239
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:46,923
they're doing the monster world where 
the money is coming from the 

3240
02:24:50,801 --> 02:24:51,634
frankenstein and the mummy.
You're goIng to hang out together and 

3241
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:54,293
we're going to get together.
like they're going to be a fucking 

3242
02:24:55,301 --> 02:24:59,620
fighting team.
I love origin stories first and I'm sure

3243
02:24:59,621 --> 02:25:01,240
there's going to be a monster mash 
fighters

3244
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:02,220
now.
They drop,

3245
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:03,740
drop the best.
Not what I asked though.

3246
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,510
I'm pretty sure.
John landis,

3247
02:25:05,511 --> 02:25:07,280
his son,
john landis,

3248
02:25:07,281 --> 02:25:09,530
the original director of an american 
werewolf in london.

3249
02:25:09,531 --> 02:25:14,120
My favorite movie of all time to watch 
to this day.

3250
02:25:14,210 --> 02:25:15,043
Wow.
Which,

3251
02:25:15,110 --> 02:25:16,640
which one?
First one?

3252
02:25:16,641 --> 02:25:17,780
The real one.
The only one.

3253
02:25:19,640 --> 02:25:20,420
NIneteen.
10.

3254
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:23,640
I don't know.
It was.

3255
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:24,100
I

3256
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,933
think I might have been like right out 
of high school because they didn't like 

3257
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:31,950
85 or we're often.
So he's made comments against the remake

3258
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:35,440
that his son is making is what?
Oh,

3259
02:25:35,441 --> 02:25:39,670
john landis is made comments against his
sons now work dick six hours ago.

3260
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:42,760
The clarification of these comments,
how about you keep your mouth shut?

3261
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:45,910
Pops just let your sunshine.
It won't do a damn thing is.

3262
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,113
Yeah,
but what if your son was like eddie van 

3263
02:25:49,331 --> 02:25:51,820
halen son,
and he just takes over van halen.

3264
02:25:52,140 --> 02:25:53,070
Oh,
that'd be a buddy.

3265
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:53,980
Hey,
fuck face.

3266
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:55,600
It'd be a superhero.
He starts singing.

3267
02:25:56,020 --> 02:25:57,310
He's like,
I'm van halen to.

3268
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:58,160
No,
no,

3269
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:59,860
no.
we'll check my last name.

3270
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:02,993
I can't use the van halen name.
How about I'm mike van halen mike the 

3271
02:26:06,610 --> 02:26:09,050
mike van halen band.
That's my.

3272
02:26:09,070 --> 02:26:10,740
Can I use that?
I'm gonna sink.

3273
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:11,650
Panama.
Is that okay?

3274
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:18,740
That hot for teacher kind of just had 
the script process right now.

3275
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:22,360
He's writing the script and it might get
made.

3276
02:26:22,361 --> 02:26:24,260
So it's not even.
Oh,

3277
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:28,270
because his dad tweaking.
Someone probably asked him and there's a

3278
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:32,140
ways to go blog about it and I spread.
Um,

3279
02:26:32,170 --> 02:26:33,490
what year was american werewolf in 
london?

3280
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:34,570
Made?
Let's guess.

3281
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:37,840
I want to say 90.
I'll say 90.

3282
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,000
No,
87.

3283
02:26:40,190 --> 02:26:45,190
We'll say 92 77 one way off.
But then that's great.

3284
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,670
Another one,
like a more current one,

3285
02:26:48,671 --> 02:26:49,361
right?
Oh yeah.

3286
02:26:49,361 --> 02:26:51,630
American world from paris was terrible.
I'm thinking about.

3287
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:55,270
I had that hot french girl oddly hops.
When you said that your favorite movie,

3288
02:26:55,271 --> 02:26:58,570
I completely judge you because I was 
based on that because that's terrible.

3289
02:26:58,570 --> 02:26:59,403
That's so bad.
But that girl was in an amazing movie 

3290
02:27:01,661 --> 02:27:04,150
that nobody's ever heard of called 
killing zoe.

3291
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:05,973
Let me see.
Email right around the time that see 

3292
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:14,560
pulp fiction was made by quentin 
tarantino and Roger Avery.

3293
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:16,450
A lot of people forgot about Roger 
Avery.

3294
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:18,460
Roger avery,
who was a brilliant,

3295
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:20,740
brilliant screenwriter.
Really interesting guy.

3296
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:26,040
And he went to jail for like a drunk 
driving accident on the pch in malibu,

3297
02:27:26,321 --> 02:27:27,154
like serious stuff.
And he was actually tweeting from jail 

3298
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:30,650
for awhile.
Yeah,

3299
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:31,900
it was way,
way,

3300
02:27:31,901 --> 02:27:33,930
way back in the day.
Yeah.

3301
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:34,863
Julie delpy.
But Roger Avery was tweeting from jail 

3302
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:39,513
like really interesting shit.
And one of the things that came out of 

3303
02:27:41,591 --> 02:27:42,424
that was that quintin tarantino,
you used to have this ramp that he did 

3304
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:45,603
about a top gun being like really gay.
And he did some movie but apparently 

3305
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:54,640
stolen straight up from Roger Avery did 
his bit.

3306
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:56,860
Roger avery had mapped it all out.

3307
02:27:56,890 --> 02:27:58,110
Oh fuck.
And you know,

3308
02:27:58,190 --> 02:27:59,440
just ganged.
Hook it.

3309
02:27:59,650 --> 02:28:01,230
Yeah.
And did it in a movie.

3310
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:03,580
Did it in a movie?
Damn.

3311
02:28:03,581 --> 02:28:04,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

3312
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,460
That's the word.
But the roger,

3313
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:10,780
every movie killing zoe is with that 
girl julie delpy and it's excellent.

3314
02:28:10,781 --> 02:28:14,500
It's really good.
It's a crazy like drama drama,

3315
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:17,350
a crime drama movie.
Do you have to quinten tino?

3316
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,290
can't miss.
I'll fucking kills it.

3317
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:21,200
Kills it.
Yeah.

3318
02:28:21,201 --> 02:28:22,034
It's a bummer.
Then when you hear that he stole roger 

3319
02:28:23,241 --> 02:28:24,074
avery's topcon thing.
And what I would like to hear his story 

3320
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:26,713
like maybe Roger Avery says he stole up 
be him and clinton and Roger Avery came 

3321
02:28:30,261 --> 02:28:31,940
up with it together.
Maybe they're drunk.

3322
02:28:31,941 --> 02:28:33,680
LIke going back and forth.
Yeah.

3323
02:28:33,710 --> 02:28:35,820
Yeah.
And then maybe quintin just wrapped.

3324
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:38,310
But I know people have done that before.
Doug stanhope is,

3325
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:39,153
had a problem with that.
Has guys opening with him and he'll be 

3326
02:28:41,931 --> 02:28:42,440
on the road.

3327
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:46,670
They'll go to a diner and he dug a be 
riffing about something and they will do

3328
02:28:46,671 --> 02:28:49,640
it on stage the next day because they 
don't think it's a bit.

3329
02:28:49,670 --> 02:28:50,503
It's like they're getting in under the 
wire terantin here and screenwriter 

3330
02:28:53,631 --> 02:28:56,500
Roger Avery with tumi pen pall fish.
And that's what I said.

3331
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:59,660
It says this was originally written.
Yeah,

3332
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:01,093
this,
but let's see if he says that for a 

3333
02:29:03,681 --> 02:29:06,440
separate feature while it's compelling.
The theory,

3334
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:07,630
uh,
Arizona one.

3335
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:09,260
Oh,
is this the thing about him stealing it?

3336
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:10,323
This is just about the theory itself.
And then this mentioned is him them 

3337
02:29:13,491 --> 02:29:15,650
together writing it.
While it's compelling,

3338
02:29:15,651 --> 02:29:16,484
the theory airs on one key aspect of duo
argue that top gun is subversion on a 

3339
02:29:21,381 --> 02:29:22,214
mass level,
but tony scott did not set out to make 

3340
02:29:24,561 --> 02:29:25,394
starship troopers.
Much of it's homo eroticism was 

3341
02:29:27,711 --> 02:29:29,600
happenstance.
OkaY.

3342
02:29:31,690 --> 02:29:34,210
I'm just showing you today and said that
they wrote it together here in this.

3343
02:29:34,590 --> 02:29:37,550
Find out of that.
Now that find out if that's true.

3344
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:38,413
Like find out if a Roger Avery says 
quintin tarantino stole that idea from 

3345
02:29:43,011 --> 02:29:43,791
them.
So stay on hold.

3346
02:29:43,791 --> 02:29:46,340
we'll be at a restaurant just hanging 
out.

3347
02:29:46,341 --> 02:29:48,600
Whatever.
Riffing has a couple of cocktails in.

3348
02:29:48,601 --> 02:29:51,410
I'm riffing with his opening acts.
This is a long time ago,

3349
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:52,423
but he had a real issue with it.
And those guys would wind up doing his 

3350
02:29:56,211 --> 02:29:57,044
riffs on stage,
like he was thorough and I don't think 

3351
02:29:59,541 --> 02:30:01,960
you've wanted to say anything to him 
because he was all pissed off.

3352
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:03,050
I was like,
fuck man,

3353
02:30:03,051 --> 02:30:05,090
I can't even ran around you guys.
Damn.

3354
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:09,290
Because that's like unspoken shit.
Not even unspoken.

3355
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:11,360
It's like you can't do that.
That's stealing.

3356
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:14,780
That's still ideas.
Yeah.

3357
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:16,600
And a guy like stan hope rather.
Um,

3358
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,073
that's how he formulates ideas.
He bounces them off friends if he can't 

3359
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:24,050
bounce them off you because you're just 
dealing with shit.

3360
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:26,480
And its concepts does happen though,
you know,

3361
02:30:26,990 --> 02:30:31,760
sometimes even this day and age though 
because you found out so fast.

3362
02:30:31,761 --> 02:30:33,380
Yup.
Just like John Jones,

3363
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,440
people still do it.
People still cheap.

3364
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:38,053
They try,
he caught them comment with comedy 

3365
02:30:40,580 --> 02:30:41,413
hanging out in the back and you say 
something funny and then a week goes by 

3366
02:30:44,751 --> 02:30:47,030
and some guy goes up and does the same 
thing that you said.

3367
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:51,950
Comedy comedy Is way easier to do that 
with and say cheating with steroids.

3368
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:53,780
One hundred percent because what 
steroids.

3369
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:56,240
The thing with steroids is you could 
test it,

3370
02:30:56,241 --> 02:30:57,680
but the thing with comedy is you could 
say,

3371
02:30:57,681 --> 02:30:58,880
I thought of it too,
and you're like,

3372
02:30:58,881 --> 02:31:01,190
okay,
well top gun does seem gay.

3373
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,990
Think about it.
You know,

3374
02:31:02,991 --> 02:31:05,990
I mean val kilmer's faces all sweaty and
shaven.

3375
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:07,093
He's goT this like gay fuck boy haircut 
and him and tom cruise looking at each 

3376
02:31:10,071 --> 02:31:10,904
other.
Tom cruise gets mad rides off when it's 

3377
02:31:12,130 --> 02:31:13,550
motorbike because he's dangerous.

3378
02:31:13,730 --> 02:31:15,110
Dangerous people.
Buttfuck.

3379
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:16,280
OkaY.
Yeah they do,

3380
02:31:16,370 --> 02:31:19,380
but fuck crazy care.
It was kind of slippery,

3381
02:31:19,381 --> 02:31:20,640
shiny,
smooth face.

3382
02:31:20,641 --> 02:31:22,500
It comes out of the shower with a towel 
on,

3383
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:25,190
looking at each other's eyes.
Play volleyball and yeah,

3384
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:26,363
I mean it's not out of the possibilities
that you could come up with that too if 

3385
02:31:31,351 --> 02:31:32,430
you just watch it.
You like,

3386
02:31:32,431 --> 02:31:35,550
yo dude,
is it me or is this a gay movie?

3387
02:31:35,850 --> 02:31:40,230
You can totally see you saying that.
That seems like a total credit shaoguan.

3388
02:31:41,130 --> 02:31:44,580
It'd be like it is book the woman.
What the fuck of woods?

3389
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:45,414
A woman's name.
I forget the woman who plays is a girl 

3390
02:31:47,221 --> 02:31:48,054
kelly something.
Press plays places a female love 

3391
02:31:50,401 --> 02:31:52,350
interest.
She was probably like,

3392
02:31:52,351 --> 02:31:54,500
what is going on?
Fuck me,

3393
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:57,060
goddamn sexy.
Who wrote it?

3394
02:31:57,390 --> 02:31:57,991
It's like,
oh,

3395
02:31:57,991 --> 02:32:00,030
the gay boy in the corner of the.
Literally like,

3396
02:32:00,031 --> 02:32:00,690
that's what it is.

3397
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:02,370
Like he's struggling with his true 
nature.

3398
02:32:02,371 --> 02:32:04,470
I mean that's something that anybody 
could come up with.

3399
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:05,633
But the question is,
did roger ever come up with it and did 

3400
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:10,380
quintin tenant terentino's steal it 
because you don't.

3401
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:11,214
Quintin tarantino has been accused 
before of using the plotlines from a 

3402
02:32:14,701 --> 02:32:17,610
bunch of real classic japanese movies 
for his films.

3403
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:18,660
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3404
02:32:18,661 --> 02:32:19,710
Like,
um,

3405
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:22,410
the hateful eight and sheet.
I don't know about that one,

3406
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:27,530
but I think that was the thing with a 
reservoir dogs.

3407
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:28,663
I think reservoir dogs was essentially 
almost like a tribute of a classic 

3408
02:32:32,191 --> 02:32:34,020
japanese gangster moving.
Oh,

3409
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:35,200
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

3410
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:36,433
See if that's true when you would like 
to other people googling concepts for 

3411
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:40,493
that.
He takes a lot of whatever influences 

3412
02:32:42,271 --> 02:32:44,970
he'll call it,
but it's like direct steam scene,

3413
02:32:44,971 --> 02:32:45,804
stealing or whatever.
Which is why someone would probably 

3414
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:49,610
accuse him of doing this with the roger 
everything online.

3415
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:50,783
Do you ever see rodrick go to see?
If you could find Roger Avery tweets 

3416
02:32:53,461 --> 02:32:54,294
from prison.
It was fascinating because he was in 

3417
02:32:56,161 --> 02:32:57,870
jail and somehow or another he was able 
to tweet.

3418
02:32:57,871 --> 02:32:58,704
I don't know how he's pulling it off,
but theY found out about it after 

3419
02:33:00,811 --> 02:33:01,211
awhile.
And they,

3420
02:33:01,211 --> 02:33:02,310
candice,
candice,

3421
02:33:02,311 --> 02:33:04,220
shit will.
Twitter's been around how long?

3422
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:05,300
Not that long.
Seven years.

3423
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:07,890
Six years.
Eleven years.

3424
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:09,030
Shit.

3425
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:15,010
And this was at the beginning days of 
twitter when hardly anybody was using 20

3426
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:17,670
pulp fiction writer tweets on life in 
prison.

3427
02:33:17,671 --> 02:33:22,380
Look at his face there.
January.

3428
02:33:22,381 --> 02:33:25,230
Was that say 2008 for drunk driving?
Yeah.

3429
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:27,690
So he was quite a few years after it 
started.

3430
02:33:29,240 --> 02:33:30,073
Um,
sickness spreads throughout the 

3431
02:33:31,411 --> 02:33:33,000
facility,
like bush fires.

3432
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:36,270
It was great stuff,
man.

3433
02:33:36,330 --> 02:33:39,330
I remember reading it is really 
interesting stuff.

3434
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:42,690
So you can find it that you wouldn't 
even think about that,

3435
02:33:42,691 --> 02:33:43,524
like,
right,

3436
02:33:43,590 --> 02:33:46,080
like a sickness spreading through the 
place.

3437
02:33:46,081 --> 02:33:50,930
Like a bushfire man.
Amazing poet with his word.

3438
02:33:50,990 --> 02:33:51,823
Well,
he's a brilliant writer and that's why 

3439
02:33:53,221 --> 02:33:55,230
that movie killings zoe,
which is his movie,

3440
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:57,053
did he.
What else did he make or underrated 

3441
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:00,180
starship troopers and said,
no,

3442
02:34:00,270 --> 02:34:02,460
I don't think that was him.
I think that was someone else.

3443
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:03,294
They were just talking about the 
homeowner versus quentin tarantino's of 

3444
02:34:06,541 --> 02:34:07,374
attraction,
I think was the one big one he made to 

3445
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:09,240
do.

3446
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,110
remember that?
Yeah.

3447
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:11,850
A bunch of fucked up shit happening in 
that movie.

3448
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:17,180
He's got a weird mind for sure.
Going to have to be beowulf.

3449
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:20,890
Beowulf.
That was a crazy movie,

3450
02:34:20,891 --> 02:34:21,724
man.
It was like a.

3451
02:34:22,010 --> 02:34:24,160
You're watching a live video game.
Oh yeah.

3452
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:25,130
Bailiff is weird.
Oh,

3453
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:26,440
silent hill.
Alright.

3454
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:29,830
Yeah.
Beowulf is like they did at cgi,

3455
02:34:29,831 --> 02:34:31,690
but not realistic.
You remember that?

3456
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:33,670
Well,
it started off as a video game,

3457
02:34:33,671 --> 02:34:35,080
right?
No,

3458
02:34:35,630 --> 02:34:37,840
this is a fable.
It's a.

3459
02:34:37,841 --> 02:34:39,130
It's an old,
old,

3460
02:34:39,131 --> 02:34:44,131
old story and they used a back when 
angelina Jolie,

3461
02:34:47,050 --> 02:34:52,030
when she hypnotized brad pitt,
got him to stop drinking.

3462
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:55,270
AdoptIng random it.
She cracked that dude.

3463
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:58,000
She cracks them all.
That's a black widow right there.

3464
02:34:58,001 --> 02:34:59,440
Boy,
billy bob thornton,

3465
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:03,340
maxim.
Maxim had billy bob thornton lower blood

3466
02:35:03,341 --> 02:35:05,140
around her.
They both were in each other's blood.

3467
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,101
Crazy.
Yeah.

3468
02:35:06,101 --> 02:35:07,480
She was reading them back then.

3469
02:35:07,510 --> 02:35:10,320
It was just too powerful and attraction.
Those lips too.

3470
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:13,120
Yeah.
That world out of the world.

3471
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:14,950
That movie.
It was weird.

3472
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:17,500
I didn't know that she was the tiger and
panda.

3473
02:35:18,270 --> 02:35:19,510
No,
killing the game.

3474
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:21,750
Yeah.
But it's um,

3475
02:35:22,420 --> 02:35:25,480
the beowulf movie was fun because it was
like animated,

3476
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:28,420
but like they used people's faces so it 
was like kind of close.

3477
02:35:28,421 --> 02:35:30,250
But you knew it wasn't real.
It's real weird.

3478
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:31,900
I don't know if you could pull that off 
today.

3479
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:33,300
You could.
It was,

3480
02:35:33,780 --> 02:35:34,990
yeah.
It was a fun movie.

3481
02:35:35,010 --> 02:35:36,550
It was good.
Like that movie.

3482
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:39,460
Oh yes.
Avatars a little bit of that now because

3483
02:35:39,461 --> 02:35:41,350
avatar,
the people look like people.

3484
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,010
And this will be.
Nobody looks like a person.

3485
02:35:43,011 --> 02:35:44,470
Yeah.
But the avatars look,

3486
02:35:44,471 --> 02:35:48,400
they do look like aliens,
but they still have the same kind of cci

3487
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:49,270
quality.
Yeah.

3488
02:35:49,271 --> 02:35:50,980
Like you can tell it's the actor.

3489
02:35:51,730 --> 02:35:52,870
Yeah,
that's true.

3490
02:35:53,140 --> 02:35:54,880
But it looks a lot better than this shit
way.

3491
02:35:54,930 --> 02:35:56,840
That's also because it's not a person.
See,

3492
02:35:56,860 --> 02:35:57,693
that's the sneaky trick about cgi is 
that cgi works best on something that's 

3493
02:36:01,841 --> 02:36:04,210
not real because we have nothing to base
it off.

3494
02:36:04,220 --> 02:36:07,900
Exactly.
That's why cgi so bad witH animals,

3495
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:10,360
like when you see like those wolves in 
the game of thrones,

3496
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:11,620
I'm like,
that's not really.

3497
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:14,890
Although jungle book said what up?
It's not bad.

3498
02:36:15,130 --> 02:36:16,090
Pretty good.
Pretty good.

3499
02:36:16,240 --> 02:36:17,770
Pretty fast.
Getting way better for sure.

3500
02:36:17,771 --> 02:36:18,604
I better.
It's like it's at the edge of what they 

3501
02:36:20,201 --> 02:36:21,034
called the uncanny valley.
The uncanny valley is so like the gap 

3502
02:36:24,161 --> 02:36:24,994
between something that looks hyper 
realistic and something that looks 

3503
02:36:27,551 --> 02:36:28,570
totally fake.
Yeah.

3504
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:30,190
It's like you get to this point where 
like,

3505
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:31,420
wow,
almost.

3506
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:34,060
It's real close,
but then he can't tell.

3507
02:36:36,130 --> 02:36:38,790
Wish I could stop clearIng my throat.
Try not to focus.

3508
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,790
Fucked up.
You getting mad?

3509
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:41,440
No,
it's the weed smoked weed.

3510
02:36:41,441 --> 02:36:45,160
Before this podcast,
I'll take over shitting my pants.

3511
02:36:46,270 --> 02:36:51,270
I'm worried for that slingshot.
We'll just let that bathroom up one more

3512
02:36:51,431 --> 02:36:54,720
time.
You don't want to get on that pch.

3513
02:36:54,770 --> 02:36:58,150
Start spraying people behind you.
When that ocean wind hits you.

3514
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:01,423
Okay.

3515
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:11,300
You're driving in your car and just shit
splatters on your windshield.

3516
02:37:11,500 --> 02:37:15,260
You should call you shit on my fucking 
porsche.

3517
02:37:15,261 --> 02:37:16,960
We haven't problems.
If you are,

3518
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:17,833
we're in that slingshot and use diarrhea
just flying out of your ass and you 

3519
02:37:21,950 --> 02:37:26,950
maybe have beaver fever.
Fever is when people drink water.

3520
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,410
They get out of the ground like a creek.
Water.

3521
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:36,950
You get giardia.
It's from beavers shitting in the water.

3522
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:41,390
like literally you're getting bacteria.
Giardia literally comes from animal shit

3523
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,480
got be receiving from this,
but when you get it,

3524
02:37:44,481 --> 02:37:49,481
you're like hurting.
You got to put on my happy face.

3525
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:51,570
LIke you have plenty of energy.
Yeah,

3526
02:37:51,590 --> 02:37:52,730
dot.
All right.

3527
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:56,680
I'm going to get to any given blankets.
Shit,

3528
02:37:56,700 --> 02:37:57,533
man.
I just can't believe you haven't shared 

3529
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:01,340
your parents before ever.
I've even when I was a kid,

3530
02:38:01,730 --> 02:38:03,980
man,
one time made coming here just now.

3531
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:09,440
I was coming home from fear factor once 
filled my pants up like,

3532
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:11,420
like uh,
one of them glad.

3533
02:38:11,421 --> 02:38:13,460
Hefty bag.
Like a construction worker.

3534
02:38:13,461 --> 02:38:17,180
Would you throw some benton there or 
something?

3535
02:38:17,480 --> 02:38:19,310
I just couldn't hold it in.
I was like,

3536
02:38:19,311 --> 02:38:20,720
jesus.
Jesus.

3537
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:26,890
Oh no.
It was just pick up a car.

3538
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:32,090
Were you in a.
I don't remember.

3539
02:38:32,270 --> 02:38:34,000
Did you shit your supra?
No,

3540
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,451
no,
no.

3541
02:38:34,451 --> 02:38:39,451
That was passed that in 95 or something 
and he says let these logs.

3542
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:45,800
I didn't want to.
I don't remember the exact specifics,

3543
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,920
but I do absolutely remember failing my 
underwear was shit in my car going,

3544
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:54,580
fuck.
I just couldn't.

3545
02:38:54,581 --> 02:38:57,950
I maybe I'll stuck at traffic.
I don't remember the specifics,

3546
02:38:58,300 --> 02:39:02,930
but I for sure shit my pants.
It must be so bad for you to go,

3547
02:39:02,990 --> 02:39:04,770
fuck it.
He tried.

3548
02:39:05,070 --> 02:39:05,810
It was.
No,

3549
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:08,660
I didn't have a bar.
There was no argument on my part.

3550
02:39:08,930 --> 02:39:09,763
I really didn't have the willpower.
There was nothing there that could stop 

3551
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:15,350
this date in place.
It was just going to take place.

3552
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:17,090
This levels to everything,
bro.

3553
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:21,860
This levels to diarrhea.
Grievance is certain levels of diarrhea.

3554
02:39:21,870 --> 02:39:22,703
Well listen,
I don't care how much fainter workouts 

3555
02:39:25,101 --> 02:39:29,930
you've been doing,
things coming do you think?

3556
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:34,400
I would imagine like,
but it's probably like,

3557
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:36,620
you know,
girls do like cagle exercises,

3558
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:38,630
exercises to me it's like,
man,

3559
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:41,390
who's got that?
Is that muscle even devoutly you're at a

3560
02:39:41,391 --> 02:39:43,290
long road ahead of you.
Tiny man,

3561
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:48,320
that bad bitch russian chicks and carry 
weights.

3562
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:53,820
There's a woman from Russia that has.
She has the world record,

3563
02:39:53,821 --> 02:39:56,930
it's like 70 kilos with her pussy.
She clamps down,

3564
02:39:56,931 --> 02:39:59,960
they put like a golf ball at the end of 
a rope attached to a kettlebell,

3565
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:03,330
or there's some boys that golf ball or 
posting ads,

3566
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:08,030
clamps it down,
carries that weight around.

3567
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:10,133
I don't want that,
but your butt wiLl be way easier to 

3568
02:40:11,811 --> 02:40:14,520
clamp down,
but I don't care who you are.

3569
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:17,250
If you had the diary I had that day,
it's coming out.

3570
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:21,270
I'm telling you right now because if you
get a metro brew with extra shots,

3571
02:40:21,300 --> 02:40:23,400
you go and sizzler in your pants.
How to do,

3572
02:40:23,401 --> 02:40:25,410
but key goals.
Here we go.

3573
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:28,070
Here you go to this.
Uh,

3574
02:40:28,230 --> 02:40:29,063
what is the way,
what's the website we're dealing with 

3575
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:32,130
here?
Luxury spa.

3576
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:35,950
Is it a grow website?
But kiehl's candles.

3577
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:38,940
So what they are and how to do them get 
larger.

3578
02:40:38,941 --> 02:40:40,080
Please.
Let me read this.

3579
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:40,691
What?
No,

3580
02:40:40,691 --> 02:40:41,580
no.
Larger.

3581
02:40:41,910 --> 02:40:42,720
Yeah,
there we go.

3582
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,940
Why do,
but key goals,

3583
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:47,280
key goals are designed to tighten the.
Wow.

3584
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:52,790
Look at this word.
P u b o c o c c cocky j.

3585
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:58,640
G,
e u s who's foe?

3586
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:00,860
Cock?
Gs.

3587
02:41:00,930 --> 02:41:02,940
Muscles,
your asshole.

3588
02:41:03,300 --> 02:41:04,133
The pec muscles are used for two things.
Clenching your anus and controlling the 

3589
02:41:08,341 --> 02:41:09,174
flow of urine.
Anytime you stop yourself midstream at 

3590
02:41:12,901 --> 02:41:15,450
the urinal,
these are the pec muscles at work.

3591
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:16,021
Hmm.
Well,

3592
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:17,880
my shifts working overtime right now.
My,

3593
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:20,040
my,
my anus clench,

3594
02:41:20,041 --> 02:41:23,760
and I'm like cain velasquez.
I've stamina.

3595
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:27,360
Women was strong.
Pec muscles tend to have tighter,

3596
02:41:27,361 --> 02:41:28,194
stronger vaginas,
which often means stronger contractions 

3597
02:41:31,261 --> 02:41:34,500
during orgasms.
If you know anything about orgasms,

3598
02:41:34,501 --> 02:41:37,740
you know that stronger is always better 
says in all caps.

3599
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:39,833
If you know anything about orgasms,
that's not a very technical way to 

3600
02:41:41,641 --> 02:41:43,380
write.
Men on the other hand,

3601
02:41:44,570 --> 02:41:48,090
use the pc muscles to stop their urine,
mid flow,

3602
02:41:48,210 --> 02:41:49,043
but also to stop urine from coming out 
in the first place when you feel the 

3603
02:41:51,901 --> 02:41:52,734
need to use the bathroom,
but have to hold it thanks to a long 

3604
02:41:56,011 --> 02:41:56,460
line.

3605
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:58,290
Those are the pec muscles doIng the 
work,

3606
02:41:58,530 --> 02:41:59,363
so you're crunching your pec muscles so 
you can stop your flow of pis or you're 

3607
02:42:04,321 --> 02:42:06,510
tightening up your asshole.
Oh,

3608
02:42:06,511 --> 02:42:07,344
you will be able to clench,
to stop gas from passing through your 

3609
02:42:09,451 --> 02:42:10,284
anus to hold your waste until you reach 
the toilet and even to eliminate waste 

3610
02:42:14,371 --> 02:42:15,204
more efficiently,
be supposed to be better at getting 

3611
02:42:17,191 --> 02:42:19,510
buttfuck.
Is that too tied down?

3612
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,980
Why did he leave that out of there must 
have.

3613
02:42:22,860 --> 02:42:23,693
But key goals is an exercise that they 
use for tightening your vagina to 

3614
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:27,654
enhance intercourse.
So you're calling it key goals and 

3615
02:42:29,911 --> 02:42:31,080
you're saying,
I'm doing it.

3616
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:33,750
Stop shitting myself.
How often is this taking place?

3617
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:35,600
Maybe you should reconsider your diet 
for you.

3618
02:42:35,601 --> 02:42:37,890
Sit around like an asshole.
just clench your butt all day.

3619
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:40,950
Well,
I wish I did those exercises last night.

3620
02:42:40,951 --> 02:42:41,810
Oh,
well no.

3621
02:42:41,900 --> 02:42:43,710
Then he would be fatigued.
You want to do them?

3622
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,880
Like two weeks ago,
friend started out.

3623
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:52,180
Expect this though to build up.
I did my run today and uh,

3624
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:53,033
uh,
went harder and stronger than I've ever 

3625
02:42:54,991 --> 02:42:56,610
done it before.
I still suck at it.

3626
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:58,880
But instance,
it's all hills.

3627
02:42:58,910 --> 02:43:01,220
You know,
I'm doing this doing two miles and these

3628
02:43:01,370 --> 02:43:04,590
very steep hills,
but I'm can do it longer.

3629
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:05,543
Just I know I suck at it still,
but when you know that you make it just 

3630
02:43:07,681 --> 02:43:10,380
like a little bit of progress,
just a little bit of progress,

3631
02:43:10,530 --> 02:43:12,130
you know?
That's

3632
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:14,110
the same thing with buck eagles.
You can't just.

3633
02:43:14,140 --> 02:43:17,800
I've been doing this,
are running for a long time.

3634
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:19,450
Right.
I've been in london for a long time.

3635
02:43:19,460 --> 02:43:21,880
Still running shoes.
Not today.

3636
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:24,850
Today I didn't because I've been.
I've been hunting with these things.

3637
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:27,650
He's solomon's don't have laces on them.
No.

3638
02:43:27,970 --> 02:43:28,803
Like for kids,
they pulled tight with like a cord and 

3639
02:43:31,271 --> 02:43:33,620
then slides down.
The court tucks into the mouth.

3640
02:43:33,621 --> 02:43:34,454
Your shoe.
very easy to tighten up when you're in 

3641
02:43:35,261 --> 02:43:38,360
the field out there in the field.
Enough time to issue,

3642
02:43:38,410 --> 02:43:41,140
but I liked the vibram five fingers 
better,

3643
02:43:41,170 --> 02:43:42,003
but I've wanted to get a real hard 
running today and I have to be more 

3644
02:43:46,421 --> 02:43:47,254
careful where I step when I wear those 
five fingers shows I can just go 

3645
02:43:50,441 --> 02:43:51,850
reckless,
hard,

3646
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:53,890
full out with these things on.
I'll step anywhere.

3647
02:43:53,891 --> 02:43:55,510
It doesn't matter so he can get a better
workout.

3648
02:43:55,630 --> 02:43:56,730
Yeah,
because with the vibrams,

3649
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:59,200
if I hit a sharp rock,
I'm kind of fucked with this.

3650
02:43:59,201 --> 02:44:01,300
I'm not even feeling that shit with 
these things.

3651
02:44:01,301 --> 02:44:03,970
I can run over pretty much anything,
but I think for,

3652
02:44:04,570 --> 02:44:09,570
for controlling what's up,
so close to it,

3653
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:16,780
but it's almost 2:00
I want to fuck with my speedster muscles

3654
02:44:17,701 --> 02:44:19,720
or whatever it is.
Keep it together.

3655
02:44:20,010 --> 02:44:25,010
It's your face,
your face ready as you like jesus,

3656
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:31,030
you know he liked,
you know what your face looks like.

3657
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:31,973
A teacup ride at disney when you do the 
thing is spinning and kind of going too 

3658
02:44:35,411 --> 02:44:40,360
fast.
Like oh me,

3659
02:44:40,480 --> 02:44:42,190
I don't be the first to get his shit,
his pants,

3660
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:43,833
me and campaigns and our kids got in one
of them tea cup things and with me and 

3661
02:44:48,311 --> 02:44:52,390
him going full clip.
I mean full clip.

3662
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:53,340
I don't know how.
I don't.

3663
02:44:53,410 --> 02:44:55,540
There's a limitation on how fast those 
things go,

3664
02:44:55,780 --> 02:44:57,320
but it ain't getting anY faster.

3665
02:44:57,550 --> 02:44:59,380
We got it.
It was so ridiculous.

3666
02:44:59,530 --> 02:45:01,560
We were spinning so fast.
Sick.

3667
02:45:01,630 --> 02:45:04,330
Oh totally sick.
My youngest,

3668
02:45:04,331 --> 02:45:09,331
my seven year old is fucking nuts.
She loves to go on those things fast.

3669
02:45:09,401 --> 02:45:10,234
Like there's a carousel at the mall.
It's actually way faster than one at 

3670
02:45:12,711 --> 02:45:13,600
disneyland.
Really?

3671
02:45:13,601 --> 02:45:14,434
Yeah.
They have a tea cup thing on there and 

3672
02:45:15,431 --> 02:45:17,590
you write down the street that the panga
mall,

3673
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:19,810
you grabbed that fucking steering 
wheels.

3674
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:23,050
Just whipping around.
It goes so fast.

3675
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:26,350
Your head is like you're holding your.
You have to use all your muscles to keep

3676
02:45:26,351 --> 02:45:29,590
your head from just bending over.
That's what you look like right here.

3677
02:45:29,591 --> 02:45:30,510
You like to say?
Yeah,

3678
02:45:30,511 --> 02:45:31,344
I'm a.
It's the same thing as like you're on a 

3679
02:45:32,291 --> 02:45:32,930
teacup.
Like,

3680
02:45:32,930 --> 02:45:36,930
ooh,
I really do.

3681
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:41,020
Just stick your ass hole up with the air
when you get on the highway.

3682
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:43,690
When you come over the crest of the 
four.

3683
02:45:43,691 --> 02:45:45,550
Oh five.
And you get that big long hill.

3684
02:45:45,940 --> 02:45:48,760
just pull your pants down,
lift your ass in the air.

3685
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:53,990
I'll take you to paint your canvas.
No one sees me.

3686
02:45:53,991 --> 02:45:54,824
Shit that slingshot out.
Cowan has a great story about being 

3687
02:45:57,411 --> 02:45:59,300
another girl once,
like many,

3688
02:45:59,301 --> 02:46:00,134
many moons ago,
and he was going on a hike with her and 

3689
02:46:03,531 --> 02:46:06,310
he had a shit and so he came up with 
something.

3690
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:07,263
Hold on,
I hear something and he like made a out 

3691
02:46:09,411 --> 02:46:13,070
of it that he ran and shit and she 
thought it was really funny,

3692
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:14,390
you know,
and she's like,

3693
02:46:14,391 --> 02:46:15,390
what are you doing?
Nothing.

3694
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:17,290
I heard something.
I thought no big deal.

3695
02:46:17,350 --> 02:46:18,183
It's just making sure that we're safe.
And then there were kept hiking and 

3696
02:46:21,171 --> 02:46:21,801
things like,
oh my god,

3697
02:46:21,801 --> 02:46:25,160
I have to shit again.
And they ran away again and she's like,

3698
02:46:25,161 --> 02:46:26,630
what are you doing that she realized he 
was shitting.

3699
02:46:26,970 --> 02:46:30,460
oh no,
no,

3700
02:46:30,850 --> 02:46:33,830
sorry.
This is out there in the woods.

3701
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:40,840
Shitting himself is just nothing you can
do is life.

3702
02:46:42,670 --> 02:46:43,850
It is a weird thing,
man.

3703
02:46:44,370 --> 02:46:45,203
Like inefficiency of the body,
like breaking everything down but not 

3704
02:46:49,161 --> 02:46:50,370
this stuff.
Get it out of here.

3705
02:46:50,660 --> 02:46:52,280
Your body's like this.
not good man.

3706
02:46:52,281 --> 02:46:55,670
Get it out here.
I wonder if like hot lava.

3707
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:56,603
That's a good.
Is that a good design like fishing 

3708
02:47:00,050 --> 02:47:03,200
animal?
Is there any animal or plant is a plant.

3709
02:47:03,201 --> 02:47:05,060
do that.
Like the plant takes things in,

3710
02:47:05,061 --> 02:47:06,860
but the plant doesn't shit anything out.
Right.

3711
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:10,310
Putting it through the waist does it.
It gets rid of,

3712
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:11,833
gets rid of oxygeN.
It processes carbon carbon dioxide and 

3713
02:47:14,511 --> 02:47:17,180
turns it into oxygen,
but it's not waste.

3714
02:47:17,210 --> 02:47:19,370
That's like us.
We breathe out carbon dioxide.

3715
02:47:19,371 --> 02:47:22,160
I wouldn't necessarily say it's waste,
it's just we're transferring.

3716
02:47:22,510 --> 02:47:25,730
We're quite a few.
If that carbon dioxide was in your body,

3717
02:47:25,731 --> 02:47:26,564
you die.
Right.

3718
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:27,380
So we're getting rid of it.

3719
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:28,071
No,
no,

3720
02:47:28,071 --> 02:47:30,050
it doesn't kill you.
You obviously you're making it.

3721
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:32,600
You're pushing it out.
You just don't want to have too much.

3722
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:38,450
But do you know that the,
the air is not really mostly oxygen.

3723
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:41,900
do you know what most of the areas?
Nitrogen,

3724
02:47:42,410 --> 02:47:44,330
nitrogen,
like a massive percentage of it.

3725
02:47:44,331 --> 02:47:46,010
I think it's in the high eighties,
right?

3726
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:48,830
Want to say 68 percent.
Something like that.

3727
02:47:48,860 --> 02:47:51,860
Let's find out what the plants.
Just to turns it into carbon dioxide.

3728
02:47:51,861 --> 02:47:52,694
That's there.
That's it.

3729
02:47:52,850 --> 02:47:54,000
That's all they do.
That's amazing.

3730
02:47:54,010 --> 02:47:57,260
They can do it.
So what they're getting out of the water

3731
02:47:57,261 --> 02:47:59,810
and out of the soil.
They figured out a way to use.

3732
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:03,590
But what percentage of the air is 
nitrogen?

3733
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:05,210
I really want to say it's in the 
eighties,

3734
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:07,520
but I don't know.
I'm just making it up.

3735
02:48:08,790 --> 02:48:09,623
You know,
they pull nitrogen out of the air and 

3736
02:48:11,241 --> 02:48:13,310
use it for fertilizer 78.

3737
02:48:13,370 --> 02:48:14,240
Goddamn,
that's high.

3738
02:48:14,270 --> 02:48:16,190
It's a lot.
It's mostly nitrogen.

3739
02:48:16,350 --> 02:48:18,020
Twenty one percent oxygen.
That's crazy.

3740
02:48:18,090 --> 02:48:21,130
You would think of the air is mostly 
oxygen and carbon dioxide.

3741
02:48:21,510 --> 02:48:25,100
That's what I've been taught in school.
But all the other animals,

3742
02:48:25,101 --> 02:48:25,934
living organisms may besides plants 
released the ways we do every other 

3743
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,150
mammal fish.
They all do it.

3744
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:34,680
You know what's crazy is that um,
the,

3745
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:35,613
there's nitrogen around us all the time 
and the dude figured out how to extract 

3746
02:48:39,411 --> 02:48:42,920
that nitrogen out of the air and use it 
for fertilizer.

3747
02:48:42,921 --> 02:48:43,754
And that's why there's so many people on
the earth today because a guy named 

3748
02:48:45,771 --> 02:48:46,604
fritz harbor and he made something 
called the harbor method of extracting 

3749
02:48:49,251 --> 02:48:50,084
nitrogen.
Did iT like in world war one to genius 

3750
02:48:53,010 --> 02:48:56,630
also created [inaudible] a,
which is the shit that they used.

3751
02:48:56,631 --> 02:48:57,780
They changed,
you know,

3752
02:48:57,800 --> 02:48:58,633
the stuff that they,
they gassed the jews with fucking he 

3753
02:49:02,301 --> 02:49:03,650
didn't mean camps.

3754
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:04,693
No.
He made his icon a which had a scent to 

3755
02:49:07,321 --> 02:49:09,600
it.
And then they re because.

3756
02:49:09,601 --> 02:49:10,434
So you could tell what is there to get 
away from it and they removed the sent 

3757
02:49:12,901 --> 02:49:15,150
and created zyklon b and that's what 
they use,

3758
02:49:15,151 --> 02:49:16,830
the gas,
the jews and the gas chambers.

3759
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:17,820
Man.
Crazy.

3760
02:49:17,821 --> 02:49:20,220
And he was jewish,
he said more fucked up.

3761
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:24,900
So he was there during world war one.
And then when world war was happening,

3762
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:28,680
that's when he had to leave Germany and 
one of dying of a heart attack.

3763
02:49:28,681 --> 02:49:29,550
Yeah,
It was crazy shit,

3764
02:49:29,551 --> 02:49:30,670
man.
He was a,

3765
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:34,470
he was also,
this was the nuttiest thing about harbor

3766
02:49:35,370 --> 02:49:36,203
at the time.
He was receiving the nobel prize for 

3767
02:49:39,511 --> 02:49:42,570
creating the harbor method of extracting
nitrogen out of the atmosphere.

3768
02:49:42,571 --> 02:49:43,404
Rightfully so.
He also was wanted for crimes against 

3769
02:49:46,441 --> 02:49:51,441
humanity because he was gassing the uh,
the british and canadian,

3770
02:49:52,831 --> 02:49:54,750
I think it was troops,
like when they first started,

3771
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:57,780
he was waiting for the first guy that 
initiated a gas attack.

3772
02:49:57,780 --> 02:49:59,640
Jesus christ.
Crazy.

3773
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:00,653
So this guy that's responsible,
the nitrogen from the harbor method is 

3774
02:50:03,991 --> 02:50:04,824
responsible for some insane percentage 
of the nitrogen that's in people's 

3775
02:50:09,211 --> 02:50:11,220
bodies that comes from food.
Like the thing,

3776
02:50:11,230 --> 02:50:12,063
it's something around like half,
like half of the nitrogen that you have 

3777
02:50:15,151 --> 02:50:15,984
in your body from food.
It was a direct result of them 

3778
02:50:18,301 --> 02:50:20,640
extracting it out of the air with the 
hopper method,

3779
02:50:20,910 --> 02:50:21,743
which is like what?
And this is the same guy that was 

3780
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:29,540
gassing allied forces and this is the 
same guy that created this icon,

3781
02:50:29,790 --> 02:50:32,400
a which eventually became zyklon b used 
to gas.

3782
02:50:32,401 --> 02:50:34,620
The jews.
Really brilliant dude,

3783
02:50:34,621 --> 02:50:35,454
but nuts.
His wife apparently shot herself in 

3784
02:50:38,071 --> 02:50:38,904
front of him because she liked.
She disagreed with who knows what The 

3785
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,953
whole thing was,
but what he was doing and he was off to 

3786
02:50:44,611 --> 02:50:47,790
war and all those things.
So in front of him he shot himself.

3787
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:51,780
He left his dying wife with his 13 year 
old son,

3788
02:50:51,781 --> 02:50:52,614
said,
see I got to go to war is a terrible 

3789
02:50:53,731 --> 02:50:55,140
person.
Who knows.

3790
02:50:55,330 --> 02:50:56,163
I mean,
who knows what the actual circumstances 

3791
02:50:58,471 --> 02:50:59,310
where,
you know,

3792
02:50:59,311 --> 02:51:02,180
like I guess you'd have to get like all 
the variables are what,

3793
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:04,950
why he left the sun.
Might have had other people to watch out

3794
02:51:04,951 --> 02:51:05,620
for him.
He couldn't.

3795
02:51:05,620 --> 02:51:06,453
He had no option other than to leave.
Have they killed the drop them off at a 

3796
02:51:09,661 --> 02:51:10,494
friend's house for god's sakes.
I don't know if the kid was with 

3797
02:51:12,241 --> 02:51:13,074
somebody or not is my point,
but that's the story behind it is this 

3798
02:51:17,281 --> 02:51:20,400
one brilliant guy figured out a way to 
extract nitrogen,

3799
02:51:20,760 --> 02:51:24,210
became this a fucking monster.
A monster.

3800
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:26,010
Yeah,
but also the reason why.

3801
02:51:26,040 --> 02:51:28,230
I mean maybe somebody would've figured 
it out eventually,

3802
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:31,800
but he's the reason why they were able 
to do that during world war.

3803
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,110
I think someone eventually came along 
and figure it out.

3804
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:35,363
Yeah.
Does she post that stuck with most 

3805
02:51:37,501 --> 02:51:38,334
things with most things.
I think that was the case with the 

3806
02:51:40,051 --> 02:51:41,910
invention of the light bulb.
I think there was a bunch of people that

3807
02:51:41,911 --> 02:51:44,880
are working on at the same time and the 
invention of a.

3808
02:51:45,230 --> 02:51:46,680
I think the telephone was the same 
thing.

3809
02:51:46,681 --> 02:51:51,030
Radio is the same thing.
There's always like almost inventions.

3810
02:51:51,031 --> 02:51:54,150
Like we were talking about that chip 
that sort of rewires your dna.

3811
02:51:54,510 --> 02:51:55,343
There's always these inventions that 
opened up the possibility of other 

3812
02:51:57,361 --> 02:51:58,194
inventions and the technology that 
allows for an invention like that gets 

3813
02:52:01,950 --> 02:52:04,680
analyzed by a bunch of different people.
So there's,

3814
02:52:04,890 --> 02:52:06,130
you know,
it's always one of those things

3815
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:10,600
where anytime something happens today 
there's a network,

3816
02:52:10,601 --> 02:52:11,434
it's very rare that one person figures 
one thing out that nobody ever saw 

3817
02:52:13,541 --> 02:52:14,374
before.
It's like there's a network of 

3818
02:52:15,701 --> 02:52:18,100
inventions and innovations at all.
Yeah.

3819
02:52:18,130 --> 02:52:18,963
Because you need machines and computers 
and all these different things that 

3820
02:52:21,641 --> 02:52:22,474
other people have created that allow you
to do the calculations to invent 

3821
02:52:24,461 --> 02:52:27,040
something new.
So all it feeds off of all of it.

3822
02:52:27,090 --> 02:52:30,340
Then isn't it the best kind of.
Sometimes the best marketer,

3823
02:52:30,341 --> 02:52:32,470
best talker,
they get the notoriety for it.

3824
02:52:32,471 --> 02:52:36,010
So sometimes yeah,
sometimes just like fighting right?

3825
02:52:38,620 --> 02:52:39,453
Full circle.
So before we end this canelo or gennady 

3826
02:52:44,060 --> 02:52:46,780
golovkin oh my god,
what a fucking fight.

3827
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:49,420
What you lady is mexican.
So you've got to root for canelo.

3828
02:52:49,450 --> 02:52:52,090
Otherwise from the central,
downtown guadalajara,

3829
02:52:52,180 --> 02:52:56,380
they'll kick you the fuck out.
I'm rooting for a canelo.

3830
02:52:56,950 --> 02:53:00,550
I'm rooting for a good performance 
brennan shop because that's what I do.

3831
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:01,810
That's what you do.
I do.

3832
02:53:01,870 --> 02:53:04,490
I have to know about this case.
Yup.

3833
02:53:04,840 --> 02:53:06,520
Why?
Because I want to see what happens.

3834
02:53:07,150 --> 02:53:10,060
I want to see what happens.
I don't have like a guy I want to win.

3835
02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:12,460
Like if Virginia triple g wins,
I'm not going to be bummed out.

3836
02:53:12,490 --> 02:53:13,900
No.
I want to get fight.

3837
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:16,170
exactly.
I want to see what happens when I'm that

3838
02:53:16,171 --> 02:53:17,590
guy.
I don't see either guy lose.

3839
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:21,900
Like I like both of them.
I got to lose.

3840
02:53:21,910 --> 02:53:24,820
I don't want anyone to have that l today
too.

3841
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:27,190
Oh yeah.
With that little kid punched that guy in

3842
02:53:27,191 --> 02:53:28,024
the deck.
That's his son punched that guy in the 

3843
02:53:29,111 --> 02:53:31,600
dick.
BIlly Joe Saunders.

3844
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:32,583
He's a great following.
This little kid on the fucking like he 

3845
02:53:36,251 --> 02:53:39,190
gets on the scale.
He gets on the scale and the guy's like,

3846
02:53:39,191 --> 02:53:39,941
no,
don't do that.

3847
02:53:39,941 --> 02:53:41,230
Dude said,
look at this.

3848
02:53:41,740 --> 02:53:45,310
He's flexing kids on a scale and he just
like,

3849
02:53:45,311 --> 02:53:48,820
what's up man?
And he punched him and he kicked him.

3850
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:52,200
That's so fucked up.

3851
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:55,760
That's such a bad look.
Well,

3852
02:53:55,770 --> 02:53:58,680
it's so stupid that they let that little
kid be there.

3853
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:00,660
What if he punched that kid right in the
face?

3854
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:02,890
Shut the fuck up.
Please slap him.

3855
02:54:02,990 --> 02:54:05,250
If he kicked him,
be good to go.

3856
02:54:05,970 --> 02:54:07,240
Thai boxing,
right?

3857
02:54:07,310 --> 02:54:10,190
I'm about to throw up really going on.
Yeah.

3858
02:54:11,460 --> 02:54:15,600
the lady aT starbucks says shots.
She's fucking right.

3859
02:54:15,601 --> 02:54:17,540
Yeah.
You can't add extra shots to a caveman.

3860
02:54:17,590 --> 02:54:19,590
Nitric lasers.
Tate tate.

3861
02:54:19,591 --> 02:54:20,424
Fletcher can consume.
He can throw that caveman nitrile down 

3862
02:54:23,161 --> 02:54:23,994
like it's water.
Let's just wrap this up before you shut 

3863
02:54:24,781 --> 02:54:26,790
yourself in.
Shit myself.

3864
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:29,720
What do you think's going on here?
Not good at this.

3865
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:32,040
My prediction.
I think if triple g doesn't stop him,

3866
02:54:32,220 --> 02:54:33,053
canelo wins in a decision.
The public's piss because you got To 

3867
02:54:35,011 --> 02:54:36,720
look at the politics of it.
Golden boy.

3868
02:54:37,340 --> 02:54:38,820
Canelo is the woodland.
Wait a minute.

3869
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:39,090
You.

3870
02:54:39,090 --> 02:54:41,400
You're saying if triple g hold the music
place.

3871
02:54:41,610 --> 02:54:44,400
He's saying if triple g outboxes and we 
won't get the decision.

3872
02:54:44,430 --> 02:54:47,040
Nope.
Box him for you.

3873
02:54:48,110 --> 02:54:50,490
I think you would because I think it 
sets up the rematch.

3874
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:52,320
I think you'd get a rematch no matter 
what.

3875
02:54:52,321 --> 02:54:54,420
Even if it goes decision,
as long as no one gets stopped.

3876
02:54:54,690 --> 02:54:55,523
So you really think that if triple g he 
puts on a show and outbox for like 10 

3877
02:55:00,511 --> 02:55:01,740
rounds,
which I don't think you will.

3878
02:55:01,741 --> 02:55:05,330
I think it's even close.
Like let's say it's like seven to six,

3879
02:55:05,331 --> 02:55:06,890
something like some crazy,
you know?

3880
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:07,873
Yeah.
My concern with caneLo is that he might 

3881
02:55:12,951 --> 02:55:13,784
not have the endurance for a prolonged 
firefight and you think triple g does 

3882
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:22,680
because he done against jacobs a pretty 
tight against jacobs now.

3883
02:55:22,750 --> 02:55:23,583
That was a goddamn firefight as well.
And come on that fight because it was 

3884
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:29,800
close.

3885
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:30,980
Oh,
I thought he won the fight.

3886
02:55:31,010 --> 02:55:32,940
I'll give it to.
It was a very fucking clothes.

3887
02:55:33,280 --> 02:55:34,980
Jacob's completely different fighting in
the canal.

3888
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,100
Jacob has watched that the other day.
Great fight.

3889
02:55:37,130 --> 02:55:37,963
I forgot how good it was.
Jacob's is a motherfucker clear some 

3890
02:55:39,711 --> 02:55:40,544
space on my dvr.
So I was deleting some boxing matches 

3891
02:55:42,690 --> 02:55:43,523
like us goes to a certain thing like why
do I have 100 ted nugent spirit of the 

3892
02:55:47,391 --> 02:55:52,391
wild safe to ship.
So I got to that fight and I said,

3893
02:55:54,740 --> 02:55:57,560
well let me wash this again because it's
triple g fights coming up this weekend.

3894
02:55:57,561 --> 02:56:01,220
That was jacob's can fight his ass off.
That was a great fight.

3895
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:03,910
Toughest fight for triple g go.
He's over the hill,

3896
02:56:03,930 --> 02:56:04,763
you know,
jacob's just legit and completely 

3897
02:56:07,881 --> 02:56:08,930
different.
Funneling canelo,

3898
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:11,580
his footwork,
it makes me wish terence crawford,

3899
02:56:11,581 --> 02:56:12,414
but just a little bigger.
I know because he's about 45 now who go 

3900
02:56:16,241 --> 02:56:17,120
up to 47.

3901
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:18,100
He was the flight pack.
Yo.

3902
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:23,150
Yeah.
I wish she was like one 62 thin fella,

3903
02:56:23,590 --> 02:56:24,650
you know,
but I just tell them all.

3904
02:56:24,710 --> 02:56:29,150
I think pArt of his style is like he's 
built perfect for the way he fights.

3905
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,370
Yeah,
no perfect endurance.

3906
02:56:32,120 --> 02:56:32,953
If you put more weight on him,
he'd probably be weighed down a little 

3907
02:56:34,701 --> 02:56:38,560
bit of slowing down like that.
He's definitely in a zone 40,

3908
02:56:38,580 --> 02:56:40,190
47.
That's the right way.

3909
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:42,050
Class.
A killer year man,

3910
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:42,913
because now they have anthony joshua,
he's fighting and then you have legit 

3911
02:56:46,100 --> 02:56:48,830
goliath heavyweight champion.
Built like a statue.

3912
02:56:48,890 --> 02:56:53,300
It looks like a greek god.
Like really well spoken.

3913
02:56:53,480 --> 02:56:56,120
Super polite.
Under around british guy.

3914
02:56:56,280 --> 02:56:57,113
Yeah.
And then you got a wild or deontay 

3915
02:56:59,301 --> 02:57:02,000
wilder fighting a fucking.
What's the name?

3916
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:05,240
Uh,
the fucking cuban killer.

3917
02:57:05,450 --> 02:57:06,770
Oh yeah.
King kong.

3918
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:08,150
Yes.
It's fighting him.

3919
02:57:08,240 --> 02:57:10,130
Yeah.
I think it's a rough flight for.

3920
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:11,990
Yes.
I think it's a bad idea.

3921
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:17,150
The winners of each of those will fight.
It's good time for boxing,

3922
02:57:17,151 --> 02:57:19,370
but tomorrow's the big one.
Tomorrow is the big one.

3923
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:20,810
Tomorrow.
Can't wait.

3924
02:57:20,811 --> 02:57:21,644
Shows who the superstar of boxing is.
[inaudible] loma chanko I think is like 

3925
02:57:24,650 --> 02:57:27,440
one of the most skillful guys ever.
But he's not being challenged.

3926
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,240
there's not a lot of drawl.
Well,

3927
02:57:29,241 --> 02:57:32,480
there's also not a guy in his division 
that stands out as being the guy who has

3928
02:57:32,481 --> 02:57:33,680
to fight.
He's like mighty mouse.

3929
02:57:33,710 --> 02:57:34,543
Yeah.
Whereas like canelo and triple g is the 

3930
02:57:37,131 --> 02:57:38,740
fight that everybody's wanting to see 
for awhile.

3931
02:57:38,770 --> 02:57:41,180
I think you'll get a trilogy anello up.
Who knows?

3932
02:57:41,390 --> 02:57:43,550
Who knows how it plays out.
I can't wait though.

3933
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:44,973
Yeah.
I wonder.

3934
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:46,550
I'm really wondering what's going to 
happen.

3935
02:57:46,551 --> 02:57:48,290
I'm super fascinated.
Me too.

3936
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:50,003
And then you also have,
what do you think about David Branch 

3937
02:57:51,171 --> 02:57:54,460
versus luke rockhold tomorrow?
He's somebody.

3938
02:57:54,470 --> 02:57:55,970
I haven't seen it myself.
People are like,

3939
02:57:55,971 --> 02:57:56,804
hey,
have you seen rockhold at wayne's 

3940
02:57:57,591 --> 02:58:01,200
doesn't look the same to what wins they 
had.

3941
02:58:01,201 --> 02:58:02,190
Wayne's I yesterday.

3942
02:58:02,700 --> 02:58:03,800
Oh,
yesterday at williams.

3943
02:58:03,930 --> 02:58:06,660
So I thouGht wheN you're saying at 
wagons,

3944
02:58:06,661 --> 02:58:08,220
I was thinking like other ways.
Like what?

3945
02:58:08,221 --> 02:58:10,380
Wayne's a here.
I forgot that it's today.

3946
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:11,433
Yeah,
today was the fights tomorrow they'll 

3947
02:58:12,841 --> 02:58:13,561
wayne's.
We're today.

3948
02:58:13,561 --> 02:58:14,280
Yeah.
Yeah,

3949
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:15,113
and people were Complaining about it.
Let's to get a pIcture of luke rockhold 

3950
02:58:18,691 --> 02:58:21,270
from today's.
When looks at it,

3951
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:24,060
you could argue is the best middleweight
in the world.

3952
02:58:24,061 --> 02:58:24,321
He,
you know,

3953
02:58:24,321 --> 02:58:25,830
he had that rough.
Can you argue with that?

3954
02:58:26,310 --> 02:58:27,143
Michael bisping knocked him out.
We hear me out and then you could say 

3955
02:58:30,900 --> 02:58:33,150
he's not because michael cubism is the 
real champ,

3956
02:58:33,151 --> 02:58:34,810
but he got caught by busy.
Right?

3957
02:58:34,860 --> 02:58:37,650
But before that,
luke rockhold is a motherfucker.

3958
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:40,860
Hector lombard's back.
Did you hear that?

3959
02:58:40,861 --> 02:58:41,694
A tiago alvarez had a back out they guy.
Was that what it is because of a 

3960
02:58:47,431 --> 02:58:49,590
hurricane.
There's nothing wrong with rockhold.

3961
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:51,983
He looks fine.
The fitness I've ever seen him talking 

3962
02:58:54,511 --> 02:58:59,260
shit to each other.
Rockhold should want to hear what he was

3963
02:58:59,270 --> 02:59:00,103
saying,
man.

3964
02:59:00,450 --> 02:59:01,890
Oh listen,
David Branch.

3965
02:59:01,891 --> 02:59:02,724
No joke,
dude.

3966
02:59:03,420 --> 02:59:06,720
Don't get confused.
If rockhold fucks up and gets clipped by

3967
02:59:06,721 --> 02:59:07,860
branch,
what is it?

3968
02:59:07,890 --> 02:59:10,320
What are they saying to each other?
They volume branch.

3969
02:59:10,321 --> 02:59:15,180
Been talking shit for a while and yeah,
see if you can hear it.

3970
02:59:17,510 --> 02:59:18,343
Former ufc middleweight champion.
Luke rockhold versus the ninth ranked 

3971
02:59:21,690 --> 02:59:24,210
david anik,
we hear this

3972
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:29,470
break,
break you up.

3973
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:40,590
ShIt talking.
What does that mean?

3974
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:42,000
I'm going to break you off,
son.

3975
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:44,230
That'd be funny.
If you get all up in that area.

3976
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:45,870
what does that mean?
What does that mean?

3977
02:59:45,871 --> 02:59:47,550
What exactly does that mean?
You're going to want to fight,

3978
02:59:47,551 --> 02:59:48,950
right?
You know the swIng.

3979
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:50,520
Do you break me out?
You're going to pray.

3980
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:51,553
I mean,
does that mean luke's been gone for 

3981
02:59:52,921 --> 02:59:53,754
awhile?
Branch is a tough customer and he's a 

3982
02:59:55,320 --> 02:59:56,153
former world champion at world series of
fighting at light heavyweight 

3983
02:59:57,991 --> 03:00:00,270
middleweight,
but if you're not in the ufc,

3984
03:00:00,271 --> 03:00:02,910
I don't give a fuck.
You're not fighting the same guys.

3985
03:00:02,911 --> 03:00:03,940
Luke rockhold thought,
well,

3986
03:00:03,950 --> 03:00:08,380
he fought rumble.
Anyone went to a decision and a decision

3987
03:00:08,381 --> 03:00:10,200
to rumble in world series?
I light heavyweight.

3988
03:00:10,250 --> 03:00:11,790
Yeah.
That's rumbling world series.

3989
03:00:11,791 --> 03:00:12,624
He was a world beater.
It wasn't that long ago because it 

3990
03:00:15,391 --> 03:00:16,890
wasn't the rumble in the ufc.

3991
03:00:17,070 --> 03:00:17,903
Also dave branch.
How does running the ufc before world 

3992
03:00:19,471 --> 03:00:20,780
series?
Not good thing.

3993
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:23,340
It was a world series of fighting does 
work well.

3994
03:00:23,341 --> 03:00:24,174
Gerald harris kao at him with a slam and
his first fight was a great thing to 

3995
03:00:28,561 --> 03:00:29,394
see.
Yeah.

3996
03:00:29,710 --> 03:00:30,543
Yeah.
And then he lost to somebody he'd say 

3997
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:34,470
like it depends.
Like how focused,

3998
03:00:34,471 --> 03:00:36,570
motivated,
very skillful,

3999
03:00:36,810 --> 03:00:37,643
very skillful is ground gives very good.
Talking about branch branch I think on 

4000
03:00:40,710 --> 03:00:41,281
the ground.
Right.

4001
03:00:41,281 --> 03:00:42,114
It may see he can't say underrated 
because he's under because he was 

4002
03:00:46,051 --> 03:00:46,884
fighting,
playing grab ass and world series of 

4003
03:00:47,671 --> 03:00:49,170
fighting.
It's not even close to.

4004
03:00:49,210 --> 03:00:51,420
I mean you're talking about wmb compared
to mba.

4005
03:00:51,510 --> 03:00:53,120
I Just think he's very talented and 
have.

4006
03:00:53,130 --> 03:00:55,050
Rocco doesn't take them seriously the 
same way.

4007
03:00:55,051 --> 03:00:58,410
It didn't take Bisping's seriously.
He get fucked up 100 percent,

4008
03:00:58,490 --> 03:00:59,323
bro.
There's a lot of pressure on rockhold 

4009
03:01:00,390 --> 03:01:02,200
because he's been gone for awhIle.

4010
03:01:02,350 --> 03:01:03,111
You know,
he needs that.

4011
03:01:03,111 --> 03:01:03,944
He needs this when my.
The only way I think rockhold gets 

4012
03:01:06,461 --> 03:01:07,690
fucked up is again,
yeah,

4013
03:01:07,691 --> 03:01:11,620
if you don't take him serious and if you
know if his heart's not in it,

4014
03:01:12,020 --> 03:01:15,170
but if a game rockhold shows up a game 
day,

4015
03:01:15,171 --> 03:01:17,170
brand shows up,
rockhold destroys them.

4016
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:18,593
You know what rocklIn could see 
recording even submitting them 

4017
03:01:19,901 --> 03:01:20,734
underrated with his top position,
because the top game is like having a 

4018
03:01:23,500 --> 03:01:25,230
fucking tree on you.
[inaudible].

4019
03:01:25,330 --> 03:01:26,800
Ridiculous,
ridiculous.

4020
03:01:26,801 --> 03:01:27,634
You look at the.
The leo machida fight beat the shit out 

4021
03:01:29,961 --> 03:01:30,794
of them from the top position.
He looked like when he fought weidman 

4022
03:01:33,820 --> 03:01:35,320
down.
When he got weidman down,

4023
03:01:35,321 --> 03:01:37,010
you could see like why moves like 
shocked.

4024
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:40,030
He submitted bisbing with one arm after 
a head kick,

4025
03:01:40,031 --> 03:01:43,290
but still I think.
I think if rock called stand up is gonna

4026
03:01:43,310 --> 03:01:46,930
be the difference maker and he's got a 
long reach man.

4027
03:01:47,030 --> 03:01:47,863
It's huge.
It's got to make sure that he doesn't 

4028
03:01:48,701 --> 03:01:49,534
fuck up and get clipped again.
But I want to see what happens because 

4029
03:01:51,191 --> 03:01:56,191
when a guy like rockhold who has a lot 
to lose but not a lot to gain fights,

4030
03:01:57,131 --> 03:02:00,550
a guy like branch who has the golden 
opportunity in front of them.

4031
03:02:00,551 --> 03:02:04,110
I mean if branch can beat rockhold,
just gigantic elevator.

4032
03:02:04,460 --> 03:02:07,300
I mean huge and I've been watching this 
training footage.

4033
03:02:07,540 --> 03:02:10,720
he sees training fucking hard.
Just the question is,

4034
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:12,870
is it hard enough?
Has he been.

4035
03:02:12,940 --> 03:02:16,120
Is he in that kind of shape?
Is he at world class level?

4036
03:02:16,300 --> 03:02:17,133
He's really never fought anybody like 
rockhold other than rumble in the world 

4037
03:02:19,031 --> 03:02:21,400
series.
But also with branch it's like,

4038
03:02:21,401 --> 03:02:22,234
are you gonna?
Take the fucking governor off and go 

4039
03:02:24,521 --> 03:02:27,520
after it because it's his last night.
Maybe it's just a dance partner.

4040
03:02:27,750 --> 03:02:30,250
Even the world citi is findings out 
murking guys.

4041
03:02:30,251 --> 03:02:33,640
So it's like in the ufc,
he's never been that guy.

4042
03:02:33,641 --> 03:02:34,474
Everyone was afraid of luke rockhold 
take the governor off and kick in the 

4043
03:02:36,821 --> 03:02:37,654
fucking face.
It's a very interesting fight because 

4044
03:02:39,281 --> 03:02:41,110
it's supposed to be.
If you looked at it on paper,

4045
03:02:41,111 --> 03:02:43,360
it would be more of a showcase fight for
rockhold.

4046
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:44,343
Rockhold was the former champion.
I don't think David Branch is ranked in 

4047
03:02:47,321 --> 03:02:49,060
the top five.
I think he's nine.

4048
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:49,960
Yeah.
Yeah,

4049
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:53,500
that makes sense.
So it's a big opportunity for branch.

4050
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:55,960
You know,
how old is branch?

4051
03:02:57,510 --> 03:02:59,630
I want to say he's like 30 seconds till 
the black death.

4052
03:02:59,910 --> 03:03:02,280
How dare you,
you suffer good thing.

4053
03:03:02,290 --> 03:03:03,620
Sure.
Thirty five.

4054
03:03:03,990 --> 03:03:06,090
Yeah.
So it's not too old.

4055
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:08,520
It's going to be interesting.
And then brock hold is like what?

4056
03:03:08,521 --> 03:03:10,740
Thirty?
Rocco was still pretty young.

4057
03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:13,253
I think that the thing about rockhold,
he needs this fight because out of 

4058
03:03:15,961 --> 03:03:18,240
sight,
out of mind fund a grip.

4059
03:03:18,241 --> 03:03:19,110
So everyone's like,
all right,

4060
03:03:19,111 --> 03:03:21,330
let's see it now that everybody 
remembers.

4061
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:22,193
Bisping clipping them,
knocking them out and then talking mad 

4062
03:03:24,181 --> 03:03:26,430
shit to him inside the cage after he 
knocked him out.

4063
03:03:27,450 --> 03:03:29,760
Is this fight tonight or saturday night?
Tomorrow night.

4064
03:03:29,850 --> 03:03:32,250
Is it for sure tomorrow night?
Or do you want fight campaign?

4065
03:03:32,270 --> 03:03:34,410
Yen.
But you're not going to be here.

4066
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:37,090
You guys do a fight campaign instead of 
a wash.

4067
03:03:37,110 --> 03:03:37,920
Atlanta,
triple g.

4068
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:38,753
I can't miss it.
I gotta see I gotta go watch a little 

4069
03:03:40,711 --> 03:03:45,450
bit of lag.
Little bullshit fucking screens here.

4070
03:03:45,570 --> 03:03:45,961
Yeah.
Oh,

4071
03:03:45,961 --> 03:03:46,794
we'll watch both.
Do you want to put one of them on 

4072
03:03:49,411 --> 03:03:52,800
youtube as well?
Bravo playlist.

4073
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:54,840
The background.
You see tower seven collapsing.

4074
03:03:55,270 --> 03:03:56,930
We'll put a k one on one of the.

4075
03:03:59,540 --> 03:04:01,250
Can't miss it man.
Yeah.

4076
03:04:01,251 --> 03:04:02,890
This car is not that bad.
You know?

4077
03:04:02,891 --> 03:04:05,180
It would have been a lot better with 
thiago alves and Mike Perry.

4078
03:04:05,181 --> 03:04:09,620
that would be a crazy fucking fight.
A monster to both american top team too.

4079
03:04:09,680 --> 03:04:10,730
That's right.
Yeah.

4080
03:04:10,750 --> 03:04:14,270
Perry's a monster,
but tiago is just very skillful.

4081
03:04:14,271 --> 03:04:15,660
There's a big difference.
Okay.

4082
03:04:15,661 --> 03:04:17,780
It's fine.
Alex rayez stepped up.

4083
03:04:18,840 --> 03:04:20,570
Alex rodriguez is no joke,
man.

4084
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:26,060
13 to who's Alex Ray as short notice 
I've seen him fight.

4085
03:04:26,540 --> 03:04:27,380
Yeah.
Right.

4086
03:04:27,381 --> 03:04:29,810
Like what kind of shape is he in?
Kenny?

4087
03:04:29,811 --> 03:04:34,811
Make the wait.
Was thIs say no record there?

4088
03:04:36,831 --> 03:04:38,120
It's not.
While they have to update it.

4089
03:04:38,660 --> 03:04:40,790
Fight history.
All right,

4090
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:42,020
let's wrap this fucker up.

And the great and powerful ian edwards 
who is,

4100
03:05:09,211 --> 03:05:10,044

one of the funniest fucking comedians
