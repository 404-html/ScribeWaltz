1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,530
So I was looking at this video today of a,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,460
this dude jumping this cliff and
his bike like Jamie was showing.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,390
Uh, this one guy who does this on,
on buildings, he does it like he,

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,930
he rides his bike on the
ledges of buildings and shit
and jumps from building to

5
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,500
building and I was watching this other
guy jumped as cliff with his bike,

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,770
like literally jumps over one side of
the cliff and lands onto the other.

7
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,620
It's fucking like you're watching the
whole thing. You Go, Jesus Christ,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,120
if he falls, he's daddy's fucking
debt. That shit's totally legal,

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,430
right?

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,340
It's like we were talking about people
thinking that MMA is barbaric and it

11
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:44,280
should be illegal. Like where should
be, you'd be allowed to take your risks.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,880
Look at this fucking guy.
This guy's crazy dude.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,120
Look at this shit hopping from
building the building. I mean,

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,140
he's riding a bike on the edges of
these buildings. This is fucking insane.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,830
And this guy's got just ridiculous
control with his bicycle. I mean,

16
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,190
should this be legal? I know it seems
like he's doing okay. He was fine.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,260
But if he fucks up like you know about
that Chinese dude that just died? No,

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,460
he was a one of those youtube guys
who would take videos of him. Oh,

19
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,920
I heard top of skyscrapers and shit and
he fell. He fell to his death down. Yeah.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,580
Dude,
it looks ugly to look scary.

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,360
Like he was trying to call
himself up and he could,

22
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:26,320
and then you see his hands slip
and you realize that's a wrap son.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,450
Oh 600 feet.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,900
I had a friend who was training to be a
base jumper and there's things you gotta

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,070
do. You know, so many regular
skydiving jumps. You gotta,

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,890
you gotta master skydiving and
just that before you get into,

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,700
and then there's things you have to do.
There's like a less than halfway through,

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,300
too many people died in the scene.

29
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,690
Or this person just stepped back and said,
you know what?

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,720
Maybe because it's not that uncommon
where these crazy base jumpers die or

31
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,610
almost die, right? Yeah.

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,110
There's a lot of videos. There's
one, I saw that it was awful.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,530
This Russian guy jumps off the top of
this building and this parachute doesn't

34
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:09,730
open up in time and he bounces off the
ground and you, you hear him screaming,

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,760
Oh, you just go, how about that
one guys? What do they call that?

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,100
They don't call it base jumping, but
they're like flying squirrels. Yeah.

37
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,030
Does that my friend Andy's
the world record holder.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,710
Andy stumps the world record holder.
He flew, what was it, 18 miles?

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,700
I think he covered 18 miles. Is
it? It's a flying wing suit. Yeah.

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,170
But there's one guy that's super famous
for doing it too and he was supposed to

41
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:34,651
go through,

42
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,760
you know they go down cans and he went
between two rocks and like his leg,

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,470
one of the yeah. And then like fucked
him. He didn't die though, which is crazy.

44
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,050
Well you know the one guy that did
died on the golden gate bridge,

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,250
do you ever see that one?

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,530
He slammed right into the bridge
while people were watching him.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,150
He was supposed to go between the wires.
Oh,

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,160
hit the bridge and she jumped
off the plane. Crazier. Like

49
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,440
he hit it like,
like a bullet.

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,350
Nobody jumped off a plane and then when
flying down and try to go through that,

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,940
I don't know where it jumped off of.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,090
I don't know if he jumped off of a
plane or jumped off of another bridge.

53
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,310
I don't know what he did,
but when he was trying to do it,

54
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:16,780
he literally slammed right into the
bridge and it sounds like a crazy car

55
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,920
accident. Like Bang. How long ago
was that? No, a few years back.

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,070
This is all short hair. It give
us some volume, Jamie. Yeah,

57
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:29,950
it wasn't Golden Gate Bridge San
Francisco, which it's horrible dude.

58
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,070
Oh yeah.

59
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,883
Yeah.

60
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,510
Who's that in that pair of shoes?
It's another guy he was there was,

61
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:45,300
he was flying with another guy.
Oh my God.

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,423
Awesome

63
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,520
dude.
Fuck.

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,570
It sounded like there was a bunch of
people they're watching too. We're too,

65
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,290
but this is that should you
will be allowed to do that.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,650
I don't think you should be able to tell
someone they can't do something right

67
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,260
and the why should you
be able to? Why? What if?

68
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,430
What if they just start influencing so
many young kids to do it and there's all

70
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,910
these kids dying all over the place.
Then do you make any legal?

71
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,510
Oh man,
that's a good question.

72
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,700
Well then do you make war legal?
You can't do that,

73
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,080
right? How are we supposed
to eat? Like what sport?

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,810
When does it become too dangerous?
I go, what? Like soccer people,

75
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:36,840
apparently some of them get brain
damage from heading the ball.

76
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,180
Apparently you're not supposed
to head things like that.

77
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:40,680
And they do it all the time.
At practice.

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,890
They start developing a
traumatic brain injuries.

79
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,130
They get CTE from
headbutting a ball to wheat.

80
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,520
So that may be more dangerous
than wrestling. Yup.

81
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,200
You know, but there's no way, I mean,

82
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,440
people talk about trying to make
it illegal because it's barbaric.

83
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:01,320
There's no way you're going to make
MMA illegal. It's too late for that.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,191
I think so too.

85
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,340
But it's interesting when people
start rallying for more regulation,

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,360
for people's behavior. It's voluntary
behavior. You, what's the latest?

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,830
Is there some new thing?
No,

88
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,810
just read some article or it was
just something on MMA being barbaric.

89
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,530
And I'm like, it's, yeah, it is.
It's a lot of things are, you know,

90
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:21,950
we like a lot of things that
are fucking super dangerous and,

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,810
but there's something about
like agreed upon violence.

92
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,300
Like you train for six weeks,
he trains for six weeks.

93
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:31,590
You both get into a cage together and
we all watch it. Screaming monkeys. Oh,

94
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:36,450
we know that in football. Some guys
get Lou Gehrig's disease, right?

95
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,450
Sure. I mean, Steve Smith
member, the guy from the Raiders,

96
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,130
he was on an HBO special. Uh, I
think it all kinds of brain issues.

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
Has that happened in MMA? Not
like that. I don't think. Not yet.

98
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,760
But you've got to think of the long
history of football. The football.

99
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,850
You're dealing with guys who played in
the fifties and sixties yeah. Right. Yeah.

100
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:57,670
This guy was played on the
Raiders like in the early or

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,450
Steve Smith I think was,

102
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,050
do you guys like that?
Right.

103
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:05,610
We have Gary Goodrich fought in
the UFC in 93 or 94 I remember.

104
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,730
He doesn't have Lou Gehrig's.
Nobody's got some serious CTE.

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,940
He's been real open about it. Does
a lot of interviews. About it.

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,090
It's on bunch of medication he's had
actually the real damage came when he

107
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,110
started doing k one.

108
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,770
Hell yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
Strike kickbox and,

109
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,220
but you know, big can be
surprised though. I mean,

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,270
no big daddy was in super fucking
wars. Yeah. Remember he got headcount.

111
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,140
I don't mean by about Gary Goodrich,
I'm mean about everybody.

112
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,840
Like the fact that you don't have,
you have,

113
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,850
you fight for 10 years and you don't come
out with some significant brain damage.

114
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,530
You're fucking lucky.

115
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,810
You're in a solo where your brain
is the target you're trying to fit.

116
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,080
Everyone's trying to figure out ways.
They're lifting weights.

117
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:53,920
They're doing kettle bells so that
they could hit your brain even harder.

118
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,520
They're learning technique so that
it's perfect so that when it hits your

119
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:01,720
fucking brain, it just knocks you
the fuck out. You know? It's crazy.

120
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,620
That's the sport that is this board.
So no one should be surprised.

121
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,040
You can't be,
but you can't be surprised like,

122
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,910
you know what was that guy's name?
Tony Conigliaro.

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,800
Is that what the guy that
got hit with a baseball?

124
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,120
The Guy got hit with a pitch
when I was in high school.

125
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,010
I think in Boston I was still,

126
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:24,580
I still like baseball like you know I
found taekwondo because of baseball.

127
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,190
Went to a baseball game and a pass by
the taekwondo studio cause the line for

128
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,680
the ti was a really long to get
on the public transportation.

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,450
So he said let's just
go up there and watch.

130
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,530
And so we walked up the stairs and this
Guy John leaves a US national hit light

131
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,470
heavyweight champion was kicking the
back and he was kicking the back so hard.

132
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,930
I was like Holy Shit,
I want to figure out how to do that.

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,780
That's a movie right there, dude. I was
walking up to standards on, I heard plump,

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,280
Chink,
Chink,

135
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,670
chink was the chains of the bag just
chink cause he had this hundred and 50

136
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,200
pound bags flying through the air.
Dude.

137
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,840
I came up and I watched him
kick that thing and I was like,

138
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,660
I got to learn how to do
that. Like that. It's crazy.

139
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,520
How the fuck could he do that?

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,270
But the guy who was famous
in Boston from when,

141
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,370
I remember when I was in high school,
it was this Guy Tony,

142
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:17,290
see Tony Conigliaro when he was hit
with a pitch and became like, you know,

143
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,340
uh,
disabled,

144
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,020
he got hit in the head in 1967 I guess.
There it goes.

145
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,120
Revere native was a rising star with
the red sox. So I'm way later than this.

146
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:31,540
So I must've been just here
and everybody talk about it.

147
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,530
But you know,
that can happen.

148
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,750
Your story about the first time,
you know,

149
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,340
considering how extraordinary
your sidekicks are,

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,680
that story is so strong.
It's like where did that shit come from?

151
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,480
It can be from the instruction for sure.
Tell you that,

152
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,070
that story, how crazy that story.
You're going to a baseball game

153
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,670
and you hear these cluck cluck or you,

154
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,730
you end up going to a taekwondo school
because of why w why didn't you go to the

155
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:07,050
baseball game again while we went to
the baseball game on your way home?

156
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,160
Everybody leaves the Fenway Park. So
the line for the train was fucking huge.

157
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,830
It's everybody's getting on the
t. So we were kids. You know,

158
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,870
it was like just hanging out. I, yeah, I
couldn't drive back then. I was like 14,

159
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,960
almost 50 seats. Taekwondo school.
Yeah, I knew it was there. Cause a,

160
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:26,310
I'd always looked at martial arts schools
because I wanted to go to one for a

161
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,590
long time, but I looked at him
from the yellow pages. It's like,

162
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,760
who has the biggest ad?

163
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,210
Must be a big ad in the
yellow pages. I was like, oh,

164
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:37,920
that must be the spot man. That's going
to be the spa. And I was a kid, um,

165
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,610
right next to our neighborhood.

166
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,260
Mcdonald's was a karate studio and man,

167
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,100
I was as poor as poor can be.
I mean we didn't have any money so,

168
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,750
but on Fridays when my mom would get
paid, we'd go to, we'd go to Mcdonald's.

169
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:55,140
That was our, that was like, we're
celebrating. Thank God it's Friday.

170
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,850
She got $150 check.

171
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,360
She's taking her kids to Mcdonald's
and every time we went to Mcdonald's,

172
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,450
I'd always look over at that karate
studio and just thinking, man,

173
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:08,240
I wish I was rich.
Jesus.

174
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,740
I just wanted to do karate.
I remember one time,

175
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,610
it was just like a scary studio at in
the end. It looked cool. It was right.

176
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:19,140
It was in Santa Ana on
Bristol and 17 right there.

177
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,920
It may still be there. I drove by the
other day. Didn't drive by that. That uh,

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,810
tell the story about how your
instructor pretended he went to China.

179
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,850
I don't want to bust them out. This is a
very, this podcast is too big for that.

180
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,430
Can I do it without saying his
name? Oh yeah. Don't say as,

181
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,440
I didn't want to say his name.
Don't say his name. You know,

182
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:45,180
I don't want to bring it. Okay. Hey
man, back in the day. Does the people,

183
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,360
did you know, there's a lot of guys
that got by with some fake martial arts.

184
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,921
They really did.

185
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:53,460
There was a lot of fake stuff out there
and that's why I think to this day,

186
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,170
like if I hadn't walked up those stairs,

187
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,600
I could have went to some bullshit school.

188
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,020
I took karate for like one lesson or
maybe two at the most before that at Joe

189
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,250
Esposito is karate academy, which is a
really good spot. It was in my city too,

190
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:12,450
but there was no good public
transportation methods.
It was too hard to get to,

191
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,450
hard to get when you're 1314 yeah,

192
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,020
it was 14 so then a year later is when
I wind up walking up those stairs and

193
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,960
here in that bag going could shrink.
That's a movie right there.

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
That's a cartoon that he was
training for the world championships.

195
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:29,910
He was training,
he was a national champion at the time,

196
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,150
so he and he was changing for the
World Cup where he took bronze,

197
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,490
so he was like top of his game. This Guy
John Lee, he taught me a lot of shit too.

198
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,080
He taught me a lot like a black guy,
big tall,

199
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:47,640
thin black guy who wound up,
he wasn't in a substance abuse problem.

200
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,930
He was a national taekwondo champion.
He was a bad motherfucker. Dude,

201
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,070
he kicked so hard,
but he wasn't the head

202
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,370
instructor at the school.
It was a Korean in Korean dude.

203
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,150
Actual career and an American dude named
Michael O'malley who spent the most

204
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,190
time with me.
He spent the most time with,

205
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,680
who was the main instructor
of the create hunt. Kim,

206
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,620
the Korean guy who was trained, he was
trained about General Che Young Yee,

207
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,440
who's the founder of Taekwondo in Korea.

208
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,660
So he was like one of a very
small elite groups like um,

209
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,950
like Henzel Gracie in a way. Yeah.
But what the differences they,

210
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,300
they emphasized a power style.

211
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Whereas as it got more
and more competitive,

212
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,490
guys realized with that chest protector
on the best style for scoring.

213
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:35,440
He's like really quick kicks that don't
have as much power but you score and you

214
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:37,780
win tournaments like that.
And so the,

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,700
the game changed and the kicks changed
because like to throw a kick that's hard,

216
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,750
you have to plant yourself and it
does take a little bit more time.

217
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,340
It takes a little bit more time.

218
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,880
So it's better to spend more time
on just getting points. Yeah. The,

219
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,670
in a lot of the taekwondo tournament's
cause those guys were really good and

220
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,500
they knew how to play that game so well.

221
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,170
They were so fast with their legs
but then would just touch you.

222
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,320
They would just stop, stop. And some
guys we kick harder than others,

223
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,470
but the whole hard style of the early
taekwondo was kinda missing in a lot of

224
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,280
their approaches because
they were just trying to win.

225
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,560
And if you really dug in
and tried to kick hard,

226
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,090
a lot of times those
guys without score you,

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,960
you know you're dealing with like
really fast, really skillful guys.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,660
But then when you apply that to fighting,
fighting the,

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,050
the real problem is like in fighting,
fighting,

230
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:26,860
you have to land hard shit cause people
are not just going to play taekwondo

231
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,810
with you.
They're going to try to take you down.

232
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,310
They're going to try to kick your legs,

233
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,540
they're going to try
to do a bunch of shits.

234
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,210
All that flippy flip he shit
that flippy flip his shit.

235
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:39,160
You got to make a hard transition. Whereas
like Moy, Thai guys, Moy Thai guys,

236
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,780
they'd fucking digging roots.

237
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,950
Everything's digging their
fucking drive in, in everything.

238
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:47,140
Everything they're trying
to blast you with. You know,

239
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:48,190
they're doing it skillfully.

240
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:51,940
But there's emphasis on power through the
whole thing. So when they would fight,

241
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,090
if a taekwondo guy fought a Moy Thai
guy and it's happened many times,

242
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,120
taekwondo guys are fucked.
They're fucked.

243
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,180
They just get their legs kicked
out from under this can't last.

244
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,050
The same thing with leg locks in Jujitsu,
it's the same thing as it is.

245
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:06,510
It's attacking the leg.
Cause when,

246
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,180
when everything is legal and
Jujitsu and everything's legal, man,

247
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:14,080
legs become like the most important
thing because you don't have to sweep,

248
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,820
you know,
if chokes are the most important thing,

249
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,320
you've got to do a lot
of shit before he could.

250
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,850
You've got to pass this guys first.
You've got to sweep them,

251
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,470
then you got to pass the guard.
Then you got to get us back.

252
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,730
You got to do so much shit before he can
get into his neck. A lot of the times,

253
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,310
most of the times we'd leg locks.
You don't need to do any of that shit.

254
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,470
You just need to jump right on them.
They're right there.

255
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:30,910
You don't ever need to sweep anybody.

256
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,890
You don't ever need to
pass anybody's guard.

257
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:37,260
You could just go legs 100% and roll
with a pure Jujitsu guy and wreck them.

258
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,220
You could do that. Yeah. That happens
all the time. The legs, the leg game,

259
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,030
when everything is legal, the
lead game, that's the first fight.

260
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,180
The first fight you have to do,
whether you like it or not,

261
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,260
you have to deal with it.
If you want the neck, okay,

262
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:51,980
you're gonna have to deal with

263
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,720
this leg war right now cause it,

264
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,970
you can't get to the neck
unless you could deal with that.

265
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:57,740
You're going to go around the forest,
the leg locks.

266
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,290
Are you going to go fucking
right through? You know, so,

267
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,680
but you take leg locks out of the game,
make them illegal.

268
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,010
Then it becomes a whole different sport.
It's totally different.

269
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:10,850
So it's exactly what you're talking
about with the power shots and the point

270
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:13,100
shots. Yeah. It's exactly
what we're talking about.

271
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:17,060
Words like the style of MMA now is
almost always attacking the legs.

272
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,390
Everybody attacks the legs. Did you see
those Angeles L'oreal? Yeah. Oh yeah.

273
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,840
That was dos.
Anjos is for real.

274
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,710
It is for real.
Striking is better than ever.

275
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,740
Who the fuck ever did that to Robbie
Lawler who just outclassed Robbie Lawler?

276
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,010
Who the fuck did that? Nobody ever did
that. He's drawn. It's Tommy La la.

277
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,310
They're never really at the end.
He kind of showed that his legs were,

278
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,190
were done right at the very end.
I was kind of wobbling fucking animal.

279
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,420
He took it the whole way.

280
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,780
I mean you could see but there's a
guy could just sailing and he was,

281
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,130
he kind of like seals.

282
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,700
He wasn't moving well and he was
definitely more stationary. Yeah,

283
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,630
he was just taken out his leg and it
that, that low leg kick. Isn't it crazy?

284
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,580
I was just talking to somebody crazy that
did more people down the strategize to

285
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:05,420
use that light to wear down the legs.
You would think in so many fights.

286
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,200
It's never like one of the
main strategies. It's sink.

287
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,940
That low leg kick is changing the game.

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,660
I really do remember when Steve Bay
fought Jr and his leg swole up like a

289
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:19,190
fucking balloon, like almost immediately
Uriah faber, Fahd, Jimmy Rivera,

290
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:23,000
Jimmy Rivera fucked them up so that more
and more people don't focus on that.

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,650
I think they're doing it more and
more now, man. I think, but it's,

292
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,760
it's crazy as it's pretty recent.
I credit it to Benson. Henderson.

293
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,950
Henderson was like the
first guy I ever saw do it.

294
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,340
He started doing it like really
regularly and I was like, hmm.

295
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,580
Like I don't like really high level
guys like world championship liver guys.

296
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,240
Benson Henderson was the first guy to do
it. I was like, oh, I like that. That's a,

297
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,460
it's a fuck. And I talked to
Duke roof is about, he's like,

298
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:48,080
it's just taking the legs out. No lower
leg kicks. Lower like hitting the shins.

299
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,040
Everybody's, they're attacking the
inside of your leg like in your calf,

300
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,580
your lower calf and the outside.
Devastating in flux.

301
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,800
The nerves up like your legs give out.

302
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,590
You see a re Uriah is fight
with with Jimmy Rivera.

303
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,820
Rivera just constantly chopped at that
leg and your rise leg became like almost

304
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,560
useless.
He can't walk on it.

305
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,850
I was just talking about straight leg
kicks to the Oh, that too. For sure.

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,870
Just the regular old kick right above
the knee. Right. Well, you know why?

307
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,010
Here's another thing too, man.
Those Bruce Lee kicks those. Uh,

308
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:21,590
I'm a bleak kicks that a lot of
guys are using. You know those,

309
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:24,050
those are fucking legit man.
They blow your knees out.

310
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,840
I mean they slam into your thigh and they
blow your fucking knees out and he did.

311
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,950
A lot of people don't like it.
They think it's nasty, but look,

312
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:35,690
you're trying to kill each other with your
bones. Pets, getting your naf flowing.

313
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,850
Why that would come up.

314
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
When do they're trying to do like flying
knees like those does Honjo that double

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,400
flying knees or what do you call those?
A skip needs are flying knee. Yeah,

316
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,010
he goes, he uses that first
need to propel that second meet

317
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,180
Pam. He also gets blended twice.
You have to block that first knee.

318
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,690
You've got to react to that first, Nene.
It helps a second knee get in there. Yeah,

319
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,690
you see that knee coming at you,
you're gonna,

320
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,240
you're gonna react and that second knees
and that should be something that you'd

321
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,220
see way more often.
That should be an,

322
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,280
if you're trying to get in the UFC and
you're not adding as many different

323
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,310
weapons con, you can't add them
all at once. So you take the, the,

324
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,720
the most important ones,

325
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,450
your one two and your leg kick and
maybe a head kick and then you slowly,

326
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,080
obviously you wouldn't, you would
just add them, but you should be,

327
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,060
if you're making a living in
the UFC or that's your goal,

328
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,130
you should be always working on adding a
new strike to the mix and use something

329
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:38,070
that u mass or something on the,
and this camp, we're going to focus.

330
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,480
You've got to always be so hard to get
really good at one thing while you're

331
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,270
doing everything.
You know,

332
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,620
you got to kind of do focus on the
basics and then do 20 minutes a week or

333
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:54,500
you're just working on and over
time over time will fly in.

334
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,470
And if you just spend 20 minutes
a week on a new technique,

335
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,821
it's not,

336
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,000
it's going to within six months it's going
to be something that you've mastered.

337
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,760
Maybe a year. If you're consistent with
it, you could just keep doing that.

338
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,860
You can just keep adding
another one at another one.

339
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,290
Especially with all that's
available with striking.

340
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,700
It seems like the days of just going
out there boxing and throwing a leg kick

341
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:18,470
every now and then, like that's only
going to get you so that that's like,

342
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,880
it's not,
um,

343
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,220
it doesn't seem like it would be the
smart thing to do to not constantly add

344
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,054
weapons like right.

345
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,720
I W I 100% agree with you and I,
I always say like boil it down to the,

346
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:35,280
what's the best in each genre. And
arguably one of the best striking arts,

347
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,620
if not the best, is Thai boxing. Right?

348
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:41,250
Moitai and you don't see anybody
just winning Moitai with boxing.

349
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,660
They don't just go over there and just
box. It'll fucking, nobody does that.

350
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,830
They go over there and you you tie box.
Yeah. They kicked each other. They elbow.

351
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,240
They use the clench.
They throw elbows.

352
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,120
They're not trying to like do on Mike
Tyson and there they get their legs

353
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,470
chopped out from under him.
Yeah.

354
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,730
If both guys know how to box the guy
who knows how to box and kick your legs,

355
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,110
it's going to have a big advantage.
Yes. I mean it's just, it's, I don't,

356
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:04,500
I don't think there's hardly anybody does.

357
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:08,230
Going over to Thailand and just trying
to box more tie fighters. It's terrible

358
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,550
and there's so much more
to that is what I'm saying.

359
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,890
Turn inside that that if you're
really good at just really good,

360
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:23,430
it's so good that you're training camp
has to address it and use valuable time

361
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,980
to address and train against that.
You already got 'em off balance.

362
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,420
Like when I was in George Satarah plus
his corner when he fought Dennis Seaver,

363
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,070
that was a part of the training camp.

364
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,280
We had a deal with Dennis
Seavers turning sidekick.

365
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,760
He was laying people out with that
turning side kick. He's done it.

366
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,980
He's still to this day, if he can
still throw it and if he lands it,

367
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,410
you're probably going to get knocked out.
It's probably one of the best,

368
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,030
so that throws,
that draws your opponent's game off.

369
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,960
He's got to constantly worry about that
instead of not having to worry about

370
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,500
that. If, if I, Dennis Cbre
had all the rest of the skills,

371
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,450
but you just deleted that
turn inside sidekick,

372
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,930
then you wouldn't really
have to focus on that much.

373
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,010
You can focus more on yourself and your
game plan and how you're going to impose

374
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,920
your game plan. Like fuck
really what he's, he's doing.

375
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,280
But when you have something real dangerous
like that, like with Edson Barboza,

376
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,330
he's got that turning that that spinning
wheel kick that he's knocked out a few

377
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:25,600
people with. Right. At least to do first.
We'll check knock out ever in the UFC.

378
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,720
How many does he have? At least two
or three, right? A Capo, I don't know.

379
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,230
He's got the first guy ever in the UFC
also. That has to stoppages by leg kicks.

380
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,940
Yeah,
that's you got to watch.

381
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,110
You got that throws your whole game off
when you got to worry about him throwing

382
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:41,260
some Grand Slam strike at
Chez kicks are so scary.

383
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,330
He's the fastest kicker I've ever
seen as far as the switch kick it.

384
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,600
Never seen a guy throw a switch.
Kick. Look, it's in Barboza.

385
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,410
It just gets in there so fast. You're
like, what the fuck man? Yeah, yeah.

386
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,060
That he's fighting their Madoff.
Holy Shit.

387
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Holy Shit.

388
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,790
That's going to be a crazy number 30th
you should just going crazy wanting to

389
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,530
come to that one. Vegas. Come see
that you're alive. It's a tough,

390
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,630
it's a tough one. Tough one. You've got a
family. It's, it's how you can't just go,

391
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:13,520
hey, I'm going to go to Vegas
with my buddies. You know, it's,

392
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:16,750
it's a different life. You
know that fight is, I love it.

393
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,480
If I never go to Vegas ever again, I
wouldn't give up. You don't. I don't.

394
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,190
I've been so much that I'm good for the
rest of my life. Seriously. I really am.

395
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,620
I think you'd want to go
back every now and again,

396
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:32,830
just going to do when you feel that
we're going to do an Ebi in Vegas, uh,

397
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:37,450
May 5th in Vegas and is it may
fit before the UFC? Uh, no,

398
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,160
it's on a Saturday night. I Dunno if
there's not a UFC on the same day, but um,

399
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,880
yeah. Uh, it's gonna be,
um, we're going to have, uh,

400
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,530
a combat Jujitsu match between
Gordon Ryan and Vinny. Micah last,

401
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,940
Holy Shit. Oh my God, that's crazy. Yeah,

402
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,690
we don't,

403
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:00,690
we don't normally do super fights and
Ebi Cause I take all the purse money that

404
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,240
we have available in our budget
and we put it towards the winner.

405
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
The winner take all in the tournament.

406
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,650
We don't have extra money for
x additional super fights,

407
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,830
but this one we had to figure
out a way to make it happen.

408
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,520
It's going to be nuts to Gordon Ryan
against Vinny Maga last two combat g g g g

409
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,350
two might be the next big thing.

410
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,460
It really could be the next big thing
because it's as far as like preparation,

411
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:28,540
Jujitsu, preparation for MMA without
kicking, punching and Nina standing up.

412
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,940
It's the best preparation for sure.

413
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,390
There's a bunch of different
ways to look at it. Uh, um,

414
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,780
an MMA purists might say, what the
fuck is this combat Jujitsu? It slaps,

415
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:43,270
we'll just watch MMA. Like
what's the point? You know,
people can say that easily,

416
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,530
but the way I look at it,
it's,

417
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,150
it's nothing is as good as the
UFC. The UFC, that's the past.

418
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,100
There's nothing better than the UFC,

419
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
but there are Jujitsu fanatics that they
just want to see Jujitsu in the UFC.

420
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,620
They're really not that
into a kickboxing match.

421
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,760
If you know junior dos Santos fights Cain
Velasquez and it's a kickboxing match,

422
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
great. That'd be an all time great
match to watch. But there's a,

423
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,250
there's a group of Jujitsu fanatics
that they're just, that's right.

424
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,310
They just want to watch the Jujitsu,

425
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,500
but with the strikes and that's the old
in MMA is the only place where you could

426
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:21,950
watch and a major Jitsu.
It's a totally different style.

427
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,480
When you watch just pure Jujitsu,
that's not, I'm a manage it.

428
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:26,120
So there's nothing to do with them.
And my teacher,

429
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,680
well I understand is, is if people that
don't do Jujitsu to listen to this,

430
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,680
like what are they talking about?

431
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,140
There's places where you're
gone for a submission,

432
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:36,860
but someone could easily hit you in
your face and it makes the move kind of

433
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:37,694
unrealistic.

434
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,120
There's a lot of times had
guys do unrealistic things
and really you could just

435
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:44,030
be smacking him in the face and they
would have to stop and protect themselves.

436
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,630
When you're doing Jujitsu without strikes,
it's just pure Jujitsu.

437
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,010
You get into a lot of positions that,
uh,

438
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,660
that would be dangerous in if
strikes were allowed. So, uh,

439
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,630
which is fine, you know, Jujitsu, I'd
love submission. Alejandra too. I need to,

440
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,580
and it's just a different thing. It's
just, you need to understand what it is.

441
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:03,800
I mean, it doesn't mean that you
shouldn't do that move if it's,

442
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:06,590
that's the most effective
move in though that rule set.

443
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,470
But there's a beautiful place for combat.
Jujitsu

444
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,940
luck is now. We could, we
could watch Jujitsu fanatics.

445
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:16,670
It's just for Jujitsu freaks.
We could watch MMA,

446
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,230
Jujitsu and it's just pure MMA,
Jujitsu. We don't have to sit there.

447
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,260
The striking because we and Anna Mae,

448
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,510
if the fight gets boring on the ground,

449
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,870
we have standups in combat Jujitsu after
two minute standing we have get down,

450
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,150
we get them down. Just like in
wrestling. Yeah, you get them down.

451
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:35,890
It's like after two minutes,
no one,

452
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,530
cause if we had a 10
minute or 15 minute combat,

453
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:42,070
you get to match and they were just
standing in wrestling the whole time.

454
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,780
That matches shit. It's garbage that
match. Nobody wants to see that.

455
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,690
Nobody was just wrestling trying
to wrestle for for 10 minutes.

456
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,750
So after two minutes as horn sounds,

457
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,770
a coin gets tossed and if you lose,
if you won the coin toss,

458
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,380
you get to decide top or
bottom and we start and sit up.

459
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,290
Garlic Butterfly Guard
would double under hooks.

460
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,050
You get top or bottom in that person and
then we start right there and then if

461
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:08,550
they stand up again, two
minute clock, that's a new
thing to me to get down cloud.

462
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,180
Yeah. When did that start?
Uh, we did that. I like it.

463
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,680
We did that right at the combat digital
worlds about a month ago because that

464
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:22,030
would ruin the shot. I just, I constantly
am thinking of ways to, to ruin the show.

465
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,110
Like how can I ruin it?

466
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,620
Of course if they just stand up and
wrestle the whole time and that's going to

467
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:29,740
happen in combat you'd get so they're
not going to pull guard as much as in sub

468
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,230
only people are pulling guard
like all over the place.

469
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:35,860
It's like people are just tumbling and
then there's no strikes and they're all

470
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:36,041
over.

471
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,850
They're all read each other's legs and
they're just pulling guard and flipping

472
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:43,920
and I'll do an all this stuff that
when their strikes, when strikes, boom.

473
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,630
It just, we get into
full garden now. Yeah.

474
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,650
And we get out of the mouth becomes very
important mountain as you could win a

475
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,280
million EBS and never mount a guy.
You know,

476
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,830
you could just be a leg lock
financing. Um, you could um,

477
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,630
uh,

478
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,370
you don't have like full guard
is the Wagner Rocia and um,

479
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,410
uh, Nathan Orchard. Yes. Yes. That
was combat digit two worlds. One,

480
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,670
the winner of the lightweight
bracket was Vagner Rocha.

481
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:19,560
He beat Nathan Orchard in the finals.
Was he the only guy to stop somebody?

482
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,090
That was the first TKL yes,
he mounted Nathan Orchard and,

483
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,940
and a referee,
Mike Bell Trans Stop the action.

484
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,510
It was a good stoppage to Wagner's
a very accomplished MMA fighter. So,

485
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,320
so again, my point with them
in Jujitsu without strikes,

486
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,300
full guard,
totally unnecessary.

487
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:43,020
You could win Abu Dhabi 10 years in a
row and never put anybody in your full

488
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:43,710
guard.

489
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,400
If you never want to play full guard
ever in regular Jujitsu without strikes,

490
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,970
you never have to play full.

491
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,650
You just open up your legs and you're
just get into some z or some kind of

492
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:57,510
spiraled Delahey eve or whatever. You
never, it's totally optional. You don't,

493
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:01,200
most people don't even bother
with it. Chrome Gracie, he
does. He loves full guard.

494
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,920
You know, whether their strikes or
not, that's why it's full guard.

495
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:08,921
And MMA is a very effective because he
always played full guard and his regular

496
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,830
Jujitsu without grappling.

497
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,220
So what happens with Jujitsu as you add
strikes in an NDA match or in a combat,

498
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:20,610
you get to match. It's the same
thing when strikes are added.

499
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,600
Now full guard becomes
the most important guard.

500
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,720
It was the least important
guard in grappling.

501
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,030
Now it becomes the most important guard.

502
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,600
So if you weren't playing full guard
when you were doing Jujitsu without the

503
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:37,590
strikes, and now you're doing Jujitsu
with the strikes, guess what? That's,

504
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,900
that's the guard's going to
be the most important one.

505
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:44,400
When a guy could smack your head. Yeah.
Control posture. Pull guard. Yes. Yeah.

506
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:49,260
So control posture. And again, in sub
only, you don't ever have to mount ever.

507
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,430
You never have to pass the guard.

508
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,470
But in combat Jujitsu now the mount
becomes super powerful because now you can

509
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:59,540
mountain strike in sub only a few
mountain. You can't strike. You know, you,

510
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,270
I like mounting and sub all
that, but you don't have to, uh,

511
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:07,200
you can get cotton leg locks if the guy
has a good mount escape right into leg

512
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:08,850
locks.
That's what usually happens.

513
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,910
Most leg lock masters are very good at
letting dude's mount them and then they

514
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,470
buck. I'm often right when they
escape, they're already on the legs.

515
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:24,780
A lot of leg lockers do that and you know,
but when their strikes,

516
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,240
you're going to let a dude mountain
you now, now that he could,

517
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,870
he gets in a strike.
You now it's a big difference.

518
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Now the mount from Jujitsu with no
strikes to Jujitsu would strikes calm Ed

519
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,780
Jujitsu. The mount just turns
into this monster. Well it does,

520
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:42,280
but what's really interesting
is only allowing slaps.

521
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,810
Think about how much more of
a monster palms darn slapping,

522
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,240
hitting. I tell her, but her
hitting hard. Right. Striking.

523
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,500
What else going to say is you're
not allowing your elbows. No.

524
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,530
Like if you allowed elbows, yeah.
Then it's exactly how. Yeah,

525
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,010
pretty much I refer a lot.
Depends on,

526
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:01,780
depends on what kind of
garden we're dealing with.

527
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,700
It depends on who's in the guard.
I mean,

528
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,260
but like if you allowed the back to
be taken and you allow the elbows,

529
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
would you go to what we've always said,

530
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,710
you said this a long time
ago that if you had elbows,

531
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,870
elbows are allowed to
the back of the head.

532
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,790
They would change the whole back mouth.

533
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,710
You ain't nobody going
for real nick and jobs.

534
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,430
You would just get the back and
just elbow the shit out of there.

535
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,170
The back of their head
and the fights over.

536
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,770
That's what was happening early in
annonay before they outlawed those elbows.

537
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,610
They used to be legal for like a
couple of years. You remember? Um,

538
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,840
the world combat, whatever the fuck it
was where Henzel Gracie fought that guy.

539
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,200
What is his name? The judo guy,
I want to say spiker. Yes. Yes.

540
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,020
Something's spiking.

541
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,440
Spiker judo guy had called him in his
hotel room all through the middle of the

542
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,730
night, fucked with him, and, and he got
so pissed that when he choked the guy out,

543
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,270
he a smashed him in the back of the
head and then stepped on his neck as he

544
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,030
walked off. He took it. He didn't
choke him out. He took his back. Right.

545
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,480
He tapped him with strikes, didn't he?
Or did he choke him? I don't remember.

546
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,700
We smashed him.
I'm not sure how he finished them,

547
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:07,540
but I do remember him standing up and
stepping on his neck. It's stomped on it.

548
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,440
See if you can find that video. You got
the video of the stoppage is horrific.

549
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,580
But this is the perfect example of how
effective elbows to the back of the head

550
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:20,350
are once you take the back mount.
So like part of me, I said, yeah,

551
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,800
quick Jan's. I was a
bad mother fucker, dude.

552
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,070
People forget he's still down and throw
down. Fuck yeah. You guys look at that.

553
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,720
Look at this back mount and then boom,

554
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,590
oh yeah. Oh, send any choke.
So he did get the choke,

555
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,020
those fucking shots where those elbows,

556
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,910
that's he's tapping
right there in Hensville.

557
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,700
Keeps holding onto him even after
he checked in with the Geek. Yeah.

558
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,350
And they'll watch it, gets off of
them and steps on his neck. And so

559
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,520
that guy is fucked up. And
that's from those elbows, man.

560
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:57,820
That position changes radically look
and he's trying to pick them up.

561
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,590
It's Angelo just rolls them over
onto her back. Oh, that is hilarious,

562
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,370
man. That was a big mistake
when an ag, oh, huge mistake.

563
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,920
We're in a g with a guy like Hanzo,
you know,

564
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,630
control thing and you don't have
it and he doesn't ever get on. Why?

565
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,390
Silly idea becomes even more.

566
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,910
It's easier to get rear naked choke
says we're allowing, you know,

567
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,250
you got gotta guys back. He could
palm side of their head. Well,

568
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:26,080
it's all sorts of the CIATTI. Like if you
have elbows to the body, remember when,

569
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:29,400
um, rampage stopped chocolate
dealt with l elbows to the body.

570
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,500
People forget about that and pride that
most of the body it got really knows how

571
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:36,540
to throw an elbow that's nasty. You
know what I mean? Combat Jujitsu,

572
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,100
you're opening up the door, what you're
doing, it's like you're up this door

573
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,120
to letting Jujitsu guys understand like
the where the positions were there.

574
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,080
Be Vulnerable.
Yeah,

575
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,500
but that's going to take the kind of
damage that they would in an MMA fight.

576
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:52,130
Exactly. Exactly. A great, great pathway.

577
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,710
It's a few things on, on a
few different levels. It's,

578
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,730
it's great for grapplers whether they're
wrestlers or Jujitsu players to get

579
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:04,480
into if they're aspiring
to be an MMA fighter. Yeah.

580
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,640
Also guys that have done 30 40
fights and they're like, dude,

581
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:11,450
this is just too brutal
guys coming out of MMA.

582
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,170
It's a great place for them
because generally the, you know,

583
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,640
before combat Jujitsu,

584
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,930
all a MMA fighter had to retire too
if you want her to keep competing in

585
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,300
grappling is like sub
only or the points game.

586
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,320
And if you're not working on
that every day, you know the,

587
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,470
the last 10 years that we're working
on striking most of their time and,

588
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:30,620
and the purest,

589
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,430
like the pure sub only guy's leg lock
guys and the pure points players,

590
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,690
they're working on that every
day to win those styles, whether,

591
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,330
whether it's to win the points
tournaments or the sub only tournaments,

592
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,070
those that the athletes that
are winning those titles,

593
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,970
they'll work on everyday.
So when an MMA fighter retires,

594
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,640
he's not going to really want to go
into sub bawling. He's like, dude,

595
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:56,900
I'm just so far behind. They don't want
to do it. But now with combat Jujitsu,

596
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,480
99.9% of the people that flooded me with,

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,330
I got a long list of people that
want to be in combat Jujitsu.

598
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,050
They're all MMA fighters,
I'm sure. No walking,

599
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,660
no pure Jujitsu guys. Only
one, only one, only one.

600
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,160
And as Benetti, he's my brown belt from
a 10 plan of San Diego. He's, he was,

601
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,540
he trained with Denny at first,

602
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,810
then he started training with
Gio and boogie down in San Diego.

603
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,010
He's a brown belt. He, he had a combat
Jujitsu match with Wilson Hayes,

604
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,070
combat Jujitsu world,
and Ben at,

605
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,690
he probably has that top two
guards in the world. Wow.

606
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,260
Or the enzyme if you end up in, ended
up in his full guard. It's a wrap.

607
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:43,220
He does a Hindu low need plays,
rubber guard way different than me.

608
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,590
We have totally different
styles of rubber guard.

609
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,610
It all starts off with either like
a meat hook or a mission control,

610
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:51,230
but from there everyone's going,

611
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:56,231
it's so vast now and he does
a leg in guillotine here.

612
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,430
The,
and I've seen it in do low team.

613
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,260
It's the craziest.
There's only like two grabbing.

614
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,710
They were like four guys on the planet
that could do this. It's, it's incredible.

615
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,620
It's like it's a s.
How was he grabbing it?

616
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,520
That's a good question. You know
what I mean? I've never done it.

617
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,620
I know how to do it,
but I've never actually,

618
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:18,710
I don't have the flexibility for
people think that I'm hilarious.

619
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,950
People think that I'm super flexible.
I'm like, I'm not being flexible. I just,

620
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,580
I'm pretty flexible, but I'm not
that flexible. I just use it a lot.

621
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,510
So it appears that I'm really
flexible because I'm always using it,

622
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,880
but a lot of people can do what I
do in way, in way beyond as well.

623
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,960
And Bennati his
flexibility's insane and he,

624
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,100
he had a single match with them.

625
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,240
Wilson Hayes put him in his guard and
he tapped him with the dead orchard.

626
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,710
You know,

627
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:47,020
I have a PR problem with people when
it comes to the subject of flexibility

628
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,530
because I feel like there's
this conversation that
people have when it comes to

629
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:52,600
flexibility.
They say you could only get so flexible.

630
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,290
Like some people just don't take
it. So, but that's not true.

631
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,300
I don't agree with it either.
I think there's, there's,

632
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,500
there's like attention and focus to
stretching and some people just don't want

633
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:03,160
to give.

634
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,390
What I want to know though is to
get to the contortionists level.

635
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,980
Can anybody get to the contortion style?
Can you train someone to do those crazy?

636
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,820
You know when people like they bend
their back all the way back and they get

637
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:18,010
into like a scorpion trying
to suck your own Dick

638
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,133
maybe.

639
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,023
Well,
you got to bring up,

640
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,240
I saw a video whatsoever.
I did that.

641
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,930
But you don't want to talking about
working towards your host, can you,

642
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,840
can anybody trained to be a contortionist?
That's what I want to know.

643
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:40,700
I'd like to see like before and after
type like vlogs but get Joey Diaz on it.

644
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,270
I don't know about being a contortion is,

645
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,970
I don't know that
everyone can go that far,

646
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
but all you need to play rubber guard is
to get into full lotus and anybody can

647
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,120
do that unless you have like metal
plates in your hips or something.

648
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,410
Uh,
contortionists are skilled at scratch,

649
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,940
stretching their bodies
in a different shape.

650
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:00,390
It's mostly due to their spinal
flexibility and strength.

651
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:03,210
You may think that you need to be born
flexible or double jointed to become a

652
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:06,480
good, it's, but in fact with
enough practice and stretching,

653
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,720
you can learn basic contortion movements.

654
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,350
I feel like stretching is one of those
things where people just aren't willing

655
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:16,920
to dig in and really like feel that,

656
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,930
that ah, that like borderline edge
every day. They don't like that feeling.

657
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:26,100
It hurts. It's uncomfortable. Like certain
stretches, like it's hard to breathe.

658
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:29,830
Like we knew hamstring stretches. It's
like it's hard to breathe, you know,

659
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,550
but you know, some, I think

660
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,480
that everyone is born flexible,

661
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,110
like at the all babies
can get into full artist.

662
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,410
I just think that some people keep
using it and some people don't.

663
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,610
I always start because people would ask
me why he flexible and I just thought,

664
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,160
I thought it was because, uh, you know,

665
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,280
I was super insecure as
a child and I still am,

666
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:57,330
but I would put my legs behind my head
to like, you know, like this is my trick.

667
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,320
Right. You know what I mean? So I
thought that's why I'm flexible.

668
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,230
Cause I was always trying to show off
by putting my legs behind my head.

669
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,760
Maybe it is, but when you think about
it, I didn't show off like all the time.

670
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:12,720
He was at times, but then, but then, um,

671
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,310
my mom came over to the house once and
saw my son biting his own toenails. He,

672
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,230
oh look, just like you when you were a
kid. He's owed. And then I thought, oh,

673
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:27,070
that's right. I used to trim
my, even like at 10, 11,

674
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,620
12 I used to trim my
toenails with my mouth.

675
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,150
Yeah, he did two. Jamie did I
do a couple of free tow? That's

676
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,670
anymore. But as a kid I did it all the
time. Even with dirt. I would like,

677
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:44,410
you know when you bite,
you bite the toenail off,

678
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:49,210
but it has dirt and you could
feel the crunch crunchy.
Yeah. Always. It's my foot.

679
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,080
It's just dirt. That's
true. That's your fun. Yeah.

680
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,930
I've done it with my finger nail. I was
like, why am I so prejudice about my toes?

681
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,300
My feet are clean, but to do the Hindu
low team like Bennati you have to,

682
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,240
I mean when I come back after my surgery,
I'm going to have knee surgery. Um,

683
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,670
I'm going to come, you going to get your
knee surgery with, um, you have a doctor.

684
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,560
Um, we'll talk. We'll talk
about it afterwards. I got
some options for you. Okay.

685
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,920
I do have a doctor's note. Okay,
cool. Doctor Ron in Beverly Hills.

686
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:22,730
He's a Brazilian jujitsu black
belt. He or Dr. Rob. Is it

687
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,280
fair to go to the right door? Let me see.
Is this the Hindu Lutein? Here it is.

688
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,900
Yeah. It's a check. Check.

689
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,470
Check out what he's doing
around the back of the head.

690
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:41,450
Yeah. Swing it around. Oh Wow.

691
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:45,800
See? He goes like right over
his ankle. That's Hindu control.

692
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,730
He just listened and he's got his leg
wrapped over the back of his opponents

693
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:54,260
head and then he's wrapped his arm around
the ankle area and he's going all the

694
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,180
way around.
The Dude's heading under the chin.

695
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,930
My little t rex arms couldn't do that.
Dude. I don't have enough real estate.

696
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,960
I don't think I could get in there.
I'd have to like really compress it.

697
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,080
Go through it yet.
He's doing it right now.

698
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,380
This is something I think
that people should watch
though. Look at that. This is,

699
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,370
he does it. He's done it twice
and an Ebi. Wow. In one show.

700
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,710
That's crazy.
Watch looking at more.

701
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,190
So we're watching him set this exact
thing up that he was just talking about.

702
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,370
Wow. That's awesome. But yeah,

703
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,660
he's going to fight for the belt at Ebi
Combat Jujitsu Belt that is currently

704
00:40:30,741 --> 00:40:32,650
held by Nick Hahn stain.

705
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,880
He's fighting Ben Eddy at the next Ebi
it at the muscle farm HQ in Burbank.

706
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,350
You hear about that? Yeah, I heard some
muscle farm moved to Burbank. Right.

707
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,640
When did it, why they decided
to do that? The CEO is from La.

708
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,050
He just wanted it here too.

709
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:52,340
They were in 5,500 feet above
sea level before in a city.

710
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,110
That's a pretty rare thing to have like
to be at a mile like Denver's a very

711
00:40:57,111 --> 00:41:00,590
unusual and that you are at high
altitude but you have a bad ass city.

712
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,330
You know they chose date.
He's fucked up kids,

713
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,170
but it's awesome.
Do the facilities awesome.

714
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:11,540
Throw a fuck load of money at that stuff.
So far.

715
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,750
They had a fight to win show
there and that was awesome.

716
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,030
That was like maybe three
weeks ago was it was,

717
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,120
it was awesome to places is spectacular.

718
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,620
So we're doing a show there Saturday,
February 17th Ebi,

719
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:26,450
15 gos in it.

720
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,310
Eddie Cummings is in Eddie companies as
the champion Gos in it. And um, to Eddie,

721
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,800
he came back from a bunch of surgeries.
Didn't he have

722
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,900
some shit go wrong? A bunch of injuries.
Uh, he's been hired a couple of times.

723
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,670
It's normal though. Yeah.
Especially his style. Right.

724
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,490
And you get to think he's constantly
training with all of those Donaher a death

725
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:50,750
squad leg lock masters are going
after each other every day. Yeah.

726
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,110
Testing their meniscus. Yeah. Yikes. Yeah.

727
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:59,990
Leg Lock scare the shit out of people.
Hell yeah. Hell yeah. But back to that,

728
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,460
a heartfelt dos Anjos fight.

729
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,300
I just can't believe how good that dude
looks at 170 pounds. He looks like,

730
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,330
like top 10 pound for
pound the world for sure.

731
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,520
Like did the combinations he was
laying on Robbie Lawler. Fuck man,

732
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,760
he looks so goddamn
good. Yeah, it's crazy.

733
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,480
And it think this guy was making one 50

734
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,630
making one 54,

735
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,520
you know,

736
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,990
he still 55 like a small
welterweight though.

737
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,150
He could add some more muscle,
I think.

738
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:35,990
Cause some of those guys that one 70
monsters like Darren till huge shit.

739
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,630
But he kicked so hard.
I think the kicks are gonna always.

740
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,420
He's always going to be in the game.
Even then, even if the smaller,

741
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,010
he's kicked her so hard,

742
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,180
as fast as shit to men
and it's combinations are
beautiful and he's just super

743
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:53,650
dedicated. I heartfelt dos Anjos is
very, very disciplined, very driven.

744
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:58,060
You'll see some of his, a plyometric
workouts that he does. No,

745
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,420
he was with nick curse
on from speed of sport.

746
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,400
I know he's done some work
with other people too,

747
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:07,810
but he did a lot of it with nick curse
on and uh, nick curse ons from that. Um,

748
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:12,480
um, the Marinovich camp, you know,
where the, like with Marilyn,

749
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,610
Bj Penn was trained by the Marinovich his,

750
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,910
so he's doing like this kind of shit
like pushing up on all these, uh, bars,

751
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:23,210
a lot of foot strength drills, a lot
of stuff where they're doing, um, uh,

752
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,950
jumps over hurdles and you know,
those horses,

753
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,620
what are those called?
Hurdles, right? Yeah.

754
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,720
He just does a lot of plant
right there as hardcore. Yeah.

755
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,080
That's working. Your abs,
your work and your feet.

756
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,260
He's lying on his back and he's
kicking up on these things.

757
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,060
It would give you like
the ultimate upkick too,

758
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,770
but the idea is just that you're putting
in these compromising positions off

759
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:51,880
balance all the time and you're doing
a lot of different plyometric drills.

760
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,940
He doesn't believe too much in like
regular weight lifting type activity.

761
00:43:54,941 --> 00:43:59,080
Everything is like sports specific
plyometric type shit. But what,

762
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,040
what I'm always super impressed
with is his endurance duty.

763
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:08,041
He fought at a crazy pace and like
the commentated Cormier and Jon Anik,

764
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:11,770
we're going, man, I wonder if he's
going to burn himself out. You know,

765
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:15,010
I already knew the result before I watched
it. I got to watch it after the fact.

766
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:18,400
I didn't watch it live but
watching it I was like, man,

767
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,760
I see why they would think that he might
have burnt himself out cause it's crazy.

768
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:25,660
The volume, just dig into it.
You're so skillful to men.

769
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,300
It was like he was picking
his shots, you know, he'd go
head, head, body, body, head,

770
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,980
head, body, body, head. It was

771
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,620
all like creative and
constantly attacking it.

772
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,510
Robbie Lawler's just rolling with it.
It's like defensively and authentically.

773
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:43,230
It's a very impressive scene
because Robbie Lawler's hurt.

774
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,290
He can't move his leg good.
His legs been chopped up,

775
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:50,850
so he's kind of stationary and dos
Anjos is just moving in for the kill and

776
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:54,900
throwing bombs on them. And Robbie
Lawler is just raw wound with everything.

777
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,950
He's taken a lot of them in the body,
but he's rolling with everything.

778
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:01,170
It's hard to hit him clean
and he's right in front of,

779
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:05,370
in the middle of the fight, in the middle
of exchange. Robbie Lawler smiling. Yeah.

780
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,650
Crazy, right? Yup. Can't
walk like barely can move.

781
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:12,210
He's get his leg kicked
out from under him.

782
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,870
He's fighting a guy who
was just like a wolverine.

783
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,780
I mean just on him attacking
and Robbie Lawler smiling.

784
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,840
But he did pull out, pull it out of
his ass against Melvin man. Who fucks.

785
00:45:23,841 --> 00:45:27,850
I did. Whoa. Can we see that?
Yeah. He was getting, it was, um,

786
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,240
elite ECC. Oh, was Strikeforce.

787
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,820
He was getting beat down by Melvin
man who and then one shot. Boom.

788
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,670
Yeah. He always had that chance. Right
to the very end. He had that chance. Yup.

789
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,330
Yeah.
The Melvin Manhoef.

790
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:48,331
One two was at one 85 there was a
bigger Robbie remembering he fought Tim

791
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,640
Kennedy and one any five.
You fought a couple of good guys.

792
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:56,641
That one 85 he fought Jake shields member
Jake shields tapped him at one 85 oh

793
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:59,950
boom. Go back a little so
we could see the beginning.

794
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,530
He's getting his leg kick all over it.

795
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:05,950
Look how much bigger he looks back then
and Melvin moves in for the kill and

796
00:46:05,951 --> 00:46:10,600
Robbie hits him with a fucking,
I mean boom.

797
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,660
And then follows up with a
left hand at stiffened up.

798
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,620
I mean that's like one of the
all time Strikeforce chaos.

799
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,980
Maybe one of the all time MMA chaos
cause he's getting his ass kicked.

800
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,000
He's moving away

801
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,540
and then he steps in
and here it is. Ed, Jim,

802
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:29,690
Dan,

803
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,150
he's getting his legs kicked out
from under them. Here it is. Bam.

804
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,520
Crazy. And you see Melvin's body
just shut off. Is he still fighting?

805
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,380
Yeah, it's still fuck recently now.
No, he's had a lot of chaos, man.

806
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,070
He's fighting. I think he's fighting
for Bella right now. He's, he's been,

807
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,010
he's been chaotic like quite a
few times where he said, well,

808
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,000
it's one of those guys that never got
into the UFC. No, almost mad at me.

809
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:59,540
Maybe he could put some wins together and
get back in the UFC and get in the UFC

810
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:03,650
for the first time. But he's, you
know, I got to think he's like 37 now.

811
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,650
How old is Melvin Manhoef?
It's going to be a,

812
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,760
I dunno man. I got, I,

813
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:15,280
I think he's gotta be 36 37 41 yeah.

814
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,320
What's his biggest MMA?
Mark Hunt One punch down.

815
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,080
He CalEd Mark Hunt with one punch.
Mark Hunt charged at a mark on,

816
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,090
it was like two 60 net and I don't think
anybody ever stopped mark like that

817
00:47:28,091 --> 00:47:30,040
before.
And Melvin clipped him with

818
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,570
an uppercut coming in. He's
like one 90 maybe. Yeah, maybe,

819
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:37,900
maybe 200.
So he was at the very least,

820
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:41,380
he was like 60 pounds
lighter at the very least.

821
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,970
FOC knocked him out with one punch.
Remember when he fought soccer?

822
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:47,830
Rabo soccer kick soccer.

823
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,400
Robert was one of the Sakharov was most
terrifying losses. Most terrifying.

824
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:56,260
Melvin fucked him up, dude.
I don't know what happened,

825
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,880
but I don't remember it. Pull that pull
up. Melvin Manhoef versus soccer, rob.

826
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,710
But this was hard for me to
watch because it was soccer.

827
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:07,970
Robert who had fought Vandelay twice.
He'd been KOD by Vandelay.

828
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,230
He fought a lot of guys and he
had gotten beat up quite a bit.

829
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,130
You were seeing like the demise of,
in my opinion,

830
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,530
one of the most charismatic
guys from that generation.

831
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,390
I didn't know a word that guy said,
never,

832
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:23,380
never heard him speak English
in like any long sentences,

833
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:28,090
but I knew he had charisma just by the
way, fought the way he handled himself.

834
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,000
Remember when he wore diapers,
because he's crazy. Oh my God.

835
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:34,860
Look how big Melvin is. He's
on all the steroids. This is,

836
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,430
they did not give a fuck back then,
man. They let these guys look out.

837
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,820
Jack Dhea is holy Shit.

838
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:47,020
Melvin Manhoef had one of the scariest
bodies of all time for sure. Right?

839
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,840
Hell yeah. Look at him. I mean, dude,

840
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,620
he's jacked and he was so fucking fast.

841
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,740
You know,
it's just like any old warrior.

842
00:48:56,741 --> 00:49:00,460
He's just had a lot of fights and
you know, this is where he's at now.

843
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,720
But God high, his hands are tied. Robin
never held hands high like that before.

844
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:09,040
Very dangerous. And Look Melvin just
waiting hands low. Remember that? Yup.

845
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,390
Not Against Melbourne.

846
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:13,670
Met especially not at this point
in his career and her about soccer.

847
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:16,360
Rob Is fucking knees, man.
That wasn't just for show.

848
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,980
His knees were basically like fallen apart
on him so he had to like wrap them up

849
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:25,981
in the most insane mummy like way later
on in his career when people forget

850
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:31,060
soccer. I would beat Vietor soccer.
I went broke hens those arm.

851
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:35,350
Remember that dude? I commentated
that fight. That's right.

852
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:39,400
You worked for pride back
then. Yeah. Look at this shit.

853
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,740
Look at the size of Melvin. He
just looks like a coil. Head kick.

854
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,723
Right hand,

855
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:50,520
boom. Oh my God. Boom. Passes the guard.

856
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:54,910
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
This is, this is one of one of

857
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,880
the hardest ones to watch.
Here's the knee needed ahead.

858
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,650
Now he's going to move them to the side
and try with the soccer co right hand

859
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,930
did not stop this fight. Right.
How they not stop this fight.

860
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,520
Boom. Cause it was soccer rob. And
you wanted to give him a chance.

861
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:14,380
That leg drag to the right hand
is Bam Bam. So I thought it was,

862
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,480
I thought he soccer kicked
him in the head on the ground.

863
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,620
I had erroneous memories. I could have
swore he soccer kicked him in the head.

864
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:23,260
But really he was kneeing him in the head.

865
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:28,010
Somebody soccer kicked him in the head.
He had another, I think that's Vander. I

866
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,910
think you might be right. Vandal.
He definitely did it to, to Maura,

867
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:35,060
right memory held the rope at,
stomped him. Remember that one?

868
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,730
He came out, he dropped him to Maura,
went down. He grabs her. She'll guns.

869
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,340
Stomps his head. It's
rough. It's rough to watch.

870
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:48,550
I remember Vandelay was mounting Dan
Henderson and then just stood up and tried

871
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:53,840
to stop on his face. Oh, that's right
away. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah.

872
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,270
I don't know if he landed though.
Cfu Five Vandelay. Kaos Tamara,

873
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,143
did you get it?

874
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,700
Oh,
flagstone

875
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,660
Oh, this is, yeah. No,

876
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,160
that's just Sakharova trying to do that.
That was to veto, right? Yeah. Yeah.

877
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:16,870
That was that. Vito is a veto. That
was in rough shape though. He, uh,

878
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,680
that was after his, his sister had
gotten kidnapped and murdered, I believe.

879
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:25,750
Remember Vito was like a shell of himself
for a long time after that. Remember?

880
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,950
I think he was in the UFC at that point.
I don't think so.

881
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,180
You might be right though.
When he fought Sakharova in Japan,

882
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:36,760
is that what you're talking about when
he ever hate through at turning sidekick

883
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,820
and dropped him? Yeah. I turned
side kicking with the body. Yeah,

884
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:42,850
right to the body and that
dropped Vitorin he just basically,

885
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:47,020
but school most of the match. What's
interesting too about soccer, robbers, he,

886
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,870
he had a catch wrestling base,
you know,

887
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:54,520
like he had some real submission skills
and people didn't know in the beginning,

888
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,880
remember his first fight in the UFC,
he gets dropped by Colin Soviet era.

889
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,691
Refereed,

890
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:01,720
big John McCarthy stops the fight and
then realize that it was an error because

891
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:05,070
he had dropped down for a neat, so
they fight again. Remember that? Yeah.

892
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:09,670
What the fuck? First Time you have to
with in Japan, right dude, it was like,

893
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,800
this is hoc, rob, you need to fight again.

894
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,450
This shit go one more and then
he catches him in that arm bar.

895
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,560
He tapped him with an arm
bar and everybody was like,
what? I Brazilian Jujitsu.

896
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:23,530
Black belt got tapped.
We didn't even think it was possible.

897
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,910
We didn't think anybody,

898
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:27,160
some guy who doesn't even have
a black belt is going to tap.

899
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,960
When Mario Sperry got tapped by
egos and Elvia rumor that that was,

900
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:34,390
we didn't know what to fucking thing.
How can this be?

901
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,980
And that was devastating for me.
How can this be? How can this be?

902
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,520
There it is. Yeah. He reversed.

903
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,910
He reversed the Camorra on him
and took the arm bar. Yeah man.

904
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,090
He got it right there, man. Crazy.

905
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,540
Look how Jack Sakharova was back then.
He was in great shape.

906
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:58,790
He's such a fucking awesome grappler and
so important to like the history of MMA.

907
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,810
A guy was in some wild fights
and some of them with people,

908
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:05,950
you had no business being in there
with just the wrong people. Like,

909
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,980
like Vandelay, like that was just
terrible match. How rare that is.

910
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:14,510
Like there's a lot of bad calls and a
lot of fighters that get fucked from bad

911
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:18,520
ref calls. They, you can't
ever do the fight over.

912
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,640
You can't do the fight. That was
one of the only times it happened.

913
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,220
Another time too.
It happened when commentated for

914
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,440
too hot to handle and Amsterdam.
I don't know if you remember that.

915
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,750
I do remember back in 2001 it was um,
uh,

916
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,080
Gilbert ival against,

917
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,340
fuck,

918
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,110
I dunno who,
I don't remember who it was,

919
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:44,000
but Gilbert live on Knox to sky out or,

920
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:49,090
or standing Tko they stopped the fight
and then the guy's complaining to the ref

921
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,150
like, why didn't you stop it? He's like,
why didn't you stop it? I was fine,

922
00:53:52,151 --> 00:53:56,740
but clearly he wasn't fine. But you gotta
at least, you know, plead your case.

923
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,750
Right.
And make it look like you're fine like I,

924
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:01,210
why did you stop and why did you stop it
then the rough just said, you know what?

925
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,380
You ready to go get back? We're going to
go again. He put Gilbert in one corner,

926
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:05,980
the other dude,

927
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,980
and then once that guy he's seen in his
face once he realizes the raft restarted

928
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:16,070
the fight. He said he sinks
back into the corn goes, oh,

929
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,510
what's going on? But it gets
knocked out again. What do you,

930
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,770
what'd you put on here, Jamie? It was
a kind. It's don fry. Which one? Oh,

931
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,760
Gilbert ival.
Yeah.

932
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,250
Okay.

933
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:31,190
Well maybe this is another one. No, wait
a minute. Which fight you talking about?

934
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,620
No, the restart. No, no,
no, no, no, no. This was,

935
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:38,320
that to us was a put Gilbert ival too hot
to handle what happened at Don Friday.

936
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,040
Get poked in the eye or something.
Do you have a cut?

937
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,150
Like why were they checking on them?

938
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,830
I don't remember what happened
earlier in that fight.

939
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:47,860
I don't even remember what happened
in that time versus don fry. That's,

940
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,170
that sounds awesome.
Do you ever,

941
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:54,050
when you got a big daddy Goodridge
Kao dawn frier that head kick, big,

942
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,460
uh, Gilbert ival Caleb
big daddy Goodrich. Yeah.

943
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,360
Big Daddy Goodrich k owed Don
Frye with a head kick. This is,

944
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:06,110
uh, this is Don Frye and Gilbert
Ibel. See if you could find a,

945
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,050
Don Frye are a big daddy Goodrich Kaos.

946
00:55:10,051 --> 00:55:13,480
Don Frye on that car with a beautiful
head kick on that car. Died.

947
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,400
Commentators pride turn of soccer.
Robin Henson. That was a main event,

948
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,930
but also it was Gilbert ival versus a Gary
Goodrich. And that was that one. Yeah.

949
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,090
If you could find a Gary Goodridge
against Gilbert Ival, that's a,

950
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,420
it's a ten second match and it's one
kick. Boom. He clips him, shuts him off.

951
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,240
Here's the Gary Goodrich.
Don Fry one

952
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,540
you hit on when you a leg kicks.

953
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,940
Big Daddy had one of the most brutal
Kaos ever in the history of the UFC two.

954
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:45,790
And I remember that, um,
from the fireman's carry oh
shit. Against Paula Herrera.

955
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:50,080
Yup. That was the most brutal knockout
probably in history is one of them.

956
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:55,660
I mean, come on. That's a beautiful
head kick over the shoulder.

957
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,160
He got one back. Yeah, that one,
that one that happened a against him.

958
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,170
He was out for like five minutes.
It was one of those. And then, uh,

959
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,180
he told me that when he woke up,
he was standing in the ring.

960
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,700
He thought he was in a rave and
Toronto because that's where he's from.

961
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:15,821
He was,

962
00:56:15,821 --> 00:56:20,350
what if we were all living in parallel
dimensions all around us all the time and

963
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:24,070
one move left or right.
One dream action

964
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,900
propels you into the next door.

965
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,560
What if he was on death's door
and they'd decided, look, he's,

966
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:30,970
he's gone from this dimension.

967
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,430
We're going to put them in a nightclub
in Toronto and let his consciousness

968
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,210
right out this experience from here.
And he was with his back.

969
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,650
His sister was always with him. She
was like, um, she was a fitness chick.

970
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,900
She's jacked,
crazy braids.

971
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,300
And he said when he woke up he
thought it was at a rave. Any,

972
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,960
he thought his sister was some chick. He
was mcing on God. That's so crazy. Yeah,

973
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,950
no idea what the sister,
that's so crazy. Yeah. It's um,

974
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,350
that that guy was taken,

975
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,360
he had a long career man
taking a lot of crazy fights.

976
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:03,260
Okay.

977
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,840
So, uh, do you think Dosantos
can I get a shot at Woodley now?

978
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,100
You would know better than I would. I
don't though. I would think you would.

979
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,070
You don't get one side tubes anymore.
I do. I'd have to ask though.

980
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,420
I feel like I shouldn't ask. I want to
time sometimes I get in some inside info,

981
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,970
but if for the inside Info I get,
I can never talk about anyway.

982
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,950
But this one's a weird one man because a,
he was a lightweight champion, you know,

983
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:29,951
loses the belt and then has looked insane
as a welterweight and just beats the

984
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:31,760
former champion like Al Classism.

985
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:36,260
I think he stands out as the number one
guy in terms of like a guy's getting

986
00:57:36,261 --> 00:57:37,460
another shot at the title,

987
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:41,750
but Woodley apparently is going to
get some sort of surgery now you need

988
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,030
shoulder surgery, Scott,
like a torn labrum.

989
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,290
So if Tyron Woodley goes out and then they
have to put an interim title fight in,

990
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,620
I would like to see him versus
somebody in an interim title fight.

991
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,890
Like how bout Hofeld Los
Angeles versus Colby Covington.

992
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,713
Hmm.

993
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,660
All the Anti Brazilian hate all, all
the shit that he said. That'd be nice.

994
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,370
Be Crazy.
That would be crazy.

995
00:58:05,371 --> 00:58:09,020
And it would be a big fight, you know,
because of all the Shit Colby talked.

996
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,420
Okay.

997
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,500
You don't,
the only fined for doing like 500 bucks.

998
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:15,290
We're hitting him in the
head with a boomerang 600,

999
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,650
600 for ratio is probably
like that is so worth it.

1000
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,590
You get to hit somebody in the
head with a boomerang on TV. Yeah.

1001
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,850
Yeah. You know, the opposite
of a fight like that,

1002
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:33,240
which would be have a lot of hatred is
uh, in Orlando, the UFC in the Lord land.

1003
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:37,910
No. Um, it's going to be Ben Saunders
versus Alan Jobe on. Yeah. Wow.

1004
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,400
That's hard. That's a hard,
I'm staying away from that one.

1005
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,540
That's going to be a hard one for me too.
And I told them about not to take it,

1006
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:49,541
but the problem is they're on losing
streaks and they can't be chosen and they

1007
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:55,880
did reach out and say, hey man,
we're both 10 planet, you know,

1008
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,120
can find the other opponents.
And they said no.

1009
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,950
So they both agreed to do it and
I'm staying out of that one. Yeah.

1010
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:07,140
Yeah. You can't corner anybody,
right? Yeah. There you go. On walk.

1011
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:10,980
Actually two friends fighting.
Are you going to go to watch? Um,

1012
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,920
no watch on TV.

1013
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,960
You know what?
I'm going stay completely out of it.

1014
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,840
I was just going to tell you like,
I like being there live,

1015
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:21,050
but I have the most fun when it's us.
When we do fight companions,

1016
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:25,560
we're all here drinking and smoking
weed, talking crazy shit. I been in,

1017
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,960
I've been to enough EFCs man. I'm
like, you know, you've been to a lot,

1018
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:34,190
that's for sure. I'd rather watch it on
my phone. I know what you mean. Well,

1019
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:36,590
I don't like watching on my phone,
but I do like watching it at home.

1020
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,470
I like watching boxing at
home too, man. You know,

1021
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:42,680
it's like you get all the angles,
you get to hear the commentary.

1022
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:48,370
Roy Jones Jr had some fucking amazing
commentary this weekend on a boxing.

1023
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:53,960
It's so interesting here in sear new guy
like Roy Jones who like points shit out.

1024
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,200
He was a, I forget the two dudes
that were fighting. There's a,

1025
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,830
there's an Irish guy, there were two,
two guys that I'd never heard of.

1026
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,120
I think one of them was Williams,

1027
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:03,920
the other one was oh Sullivan
or something like that.

1028
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,270
And I didn't know who they were.
And um,

1029
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,160
I was waiting for the main event
and I was watching this dude, um,

1030
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,050
and Roy Jones was pointing out all
the shit that he's doing with his jab.

1031
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:17,060
He's like, he's staying right
there after he throws a jab,

1032
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,130
he's going to get hit with counters
and then you see poon the counter start

1033
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,060
dropping on him. And the guy was
getting hit was the guy who was favored.

1034
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:24,920
He was like,
it's really hot prospect.

1035
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,380
And Roy just starts pointing out
all the shit he's doing. He's like,

1036
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:29,930
he's playing tough guy now. He goes, I
don't want to see you play tough guy.

1037
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,820
He was, I want to see a boxing. He goes,

1038
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:33,800
you don't want to find who's
the toughest guy is. He goes,

1039
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,160
you want to find out who the best boxers.

1040
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,590
These guys are just trying
to break each other.

1041
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,280
Now he totally called it and you see the
guy who's starting to wilt shots to the

1042
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:44,010
body. It was really interesting
to watch like a world champion,

1043
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:48,800
top of the food chain where the greatest
of all time boxers see some shit that

1044
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:50,450
you're not going to see.
You know,

1045
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,300
like he sees vulnerabilities
that you don't see.

1046
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,420
Are the Amy high level boxers that are
openly talking about transitioning to

1047
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:02,180
MMA? Do you know? Not that I know of.

1048
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:06,080
I think Andy Jacobs has joked about it,
you know,

1049
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:08,900
the heavyweight champion and
our Joshua Anthony Joshua,

1050
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,760
why to call him Anthony Jacobs. Anthony
Joshua was his name, right? Jesus Christ.

1051
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,440
Um, you know, clinical used
to be a kickboxer, you know
that it was his brother.

1052
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,160
Especially I think his brother was
like a world champion Pka karate style.

1053
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:27,080
Kickboxer but um, no,
none that I know of. Man.

1054
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,710
Floyd talked about it apparently date,
this is one thing I can tell you.

1055
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:35,540
Dana told me that Floyd wants to make a
deal in the UFC like legitimately and I

1056
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,220
go, did he? I could.
So I texted him, I go,

1057
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:40,760
this Floyd really talking about fighting
MMA. He goes, yeah, he's fucking crazy.

1058
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:45,350
I told him to get killed, but he's
still talking about doing it. Whoa.

1059
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,120
For us, a hobby teases GSP versus
Mayweather or McGregor as next fight.

1060
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,810
We need a mega fight. Okay, let me
just stop this nonsense right there.

1061
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,590
CSP just fought it 185 pounds.

1062
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:02,591
If you fucking really think that Floyd
Mayweather is going to fight GSP kit,

1063
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:07,130
shut the fuck up. Just stop. Just stop it.

1064
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:12,790
Floyd Mayweather is going to be
like a pass. That guy's huge GSP.

1065
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,110
So big. You'd have to
be like, like Jones Day.

1066
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:20,100
You'd have to get GSP to die it
down to one 55 and he would be so

1067
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,840
depleted and making one 55 Floyd would
light them up like a Christmas tree if

1068
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,520
Floyd in light him up like a
Christmas tree anyway. I mean,

1069
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:30,630
they're going to fight in MMA.
He gets smushed 100% there's no way.

1070
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,060
Stop the fight. One 85 GSP. No, no,

1071
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,170
but they might fight at one 70
if the money was right. If, if,

1072
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,110
if Mcgregor won't take it.
I don't know about that man.

1073
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,560
That could be a mega mega fine.
That could be a $20 million fight.

1074
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,370
Conor might want an extra 20
spent a lot of money on Versace.

1075
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:51,240
He's always wearing furs and shit.
Flying around in private jets.

1076
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,840
That shit's pricey,
man.

1077
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,320
Is the latest of Mcgregor like
what's going on like today?

1078
01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:00,150
Hashtag Bollen that's what's going on.
He's on top of the world,

1079
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,600
man. Look that guy. Let him enjoy this.

1080
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:08,400
He's got plenty of time to come back
to fighting. Just have fun, man.

1081
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:12,600
Stare at your watch is take Instagram
pictures of your Dick. Who Cares?

1082
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,420
You're the fucking man.
You made $100 million.

1083
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:19,200
You're not even 30 relax,
do whatever the fuck you want.

1084
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,480
That no need to force him
to come back and fight.

1085
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:24,360
But if he does come back and fight,
if he,

1086
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:28,080
if he thinks an MMA fight
with GSP is a good idea,

1087
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,440
like that's a big guy.
He's very big.

1088
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,320
George Saint Pierre is one of
the best fighters of all time.

1089
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,840
He's so fucking good at grappling. But
Connor might go fucking now, fuck it.

1090
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,730
Give me a couple of months
to put some weight on.

1091
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,350
That's not a good fight for them. But if
that's where all the money is, who knows?

1092
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:50,490
I think Tony Ferguson is the fight.
That's the fight I want to see now,

1093
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,020
in worse until I see what happens with
Barboza and Neuroma Grumet off. Right?

1094
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:00,170
The problem is if Barboza and near
mcmeadow fight and Durga Medoff smashes

1095
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,490
Barboza, he's gotta be next
in line for the title fight,

1096
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,140
right? No, you don't think so.
It's not fighting. Tony is the,

1097
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,490
oh, but counters out fighting.
Well then he has to vacate, right?

1098
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,810
What does it say here? Sodid
rounds tonight. It SGB BG,

1099
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,670
Ireland.
He's trained.

1100
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,270
I mean, he's definitely not fat. You look
at him there, he's in shape for sure.

1101
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,280
I mean, but he might just be working
on his skills. He's got $100 million.

1102
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,910
I would not be mad at a world fight if
they decided to like strip him of his

1103
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:42,690
belt and have Tony Versus
Cubby for the undisputed title.

1104
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,510
I wouldn't be mad at that.
Yeah, that will probably happen.

1105
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:49,140
I would not be mad at that. I
like that fight. Tony. So fun.

1106
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,670
He's so wild to watch, man. You know,
like when he was fighting Kevin Lean,

1107
01:04:53,671 --> 01:04:57,630
he's walking towards him when his hands
down and just pot shot him and slowly

1108
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:01,560
wearing, I'm slowly chipping them away
and then the finish him off his back.

1109
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,710
Come on man. Sweet. How many
people get finished off their back?

1110
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,460
There's a lot of sweet things that, um,
that he came up with, right? They're like,

1111
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,080
uh, working, you know,

1112
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:14,520
there's different ways you can get
up off your back with the cage.

1113
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,680
Like basic,
whoa walking and stuff like that.

1114
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,490
But you can't wall walk on everybody.

1115
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,050
Right. It all depends on where
your level of wall walking is.

1116
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,190
And how good is your
opponent at countering that?

1117
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,610
What did you think when Kevin Lee walked
in with Javier staph infection on his

1118
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:34,840
chest? Did you notice it? I was
like, cool. I hope he's weak.

1119
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:42,850
He forced Tony. He said Tony Has Tony,
did you notice as the staff goes? Yeah,

1120
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:43,720
I was trying to punch it

1121
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,150
but with what tone?

1122
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,090
The Way Tony got up off the cage when,

1123
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,290
when Kevin Lee put them
up against the cage,

1124
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,150
he actually can opener Kim from
the bottom and full guard. So yeah,

1125
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,900
Tony was head was against the cage
and Kevin Lee's head was right here.

1126
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:04,600
So he basically did like a
Muay Thai clinch, like um,

1127
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,290
can open it up right at the bottom so
he couldn't get hit. And then he had,

1128
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,940
he had, um, his left foot on the hip and
his right leg was just around us as ribs.

1129
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,940
And then at the right time,
Kevin was naturally trying to push,

1130
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,670
pull out cause he was holding him in.
He couldn't hit him.

1131
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:23,850
He was safe against the cage and
then Tony put both feet on the hips,

1132
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,830
pushed him up, kicked up, and then says,
stood up and was bra. It's like, wow,

1133
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,800
we're going to be doing that one.
Yeah, I'm going to be, I mean he,

1134
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:32,860
Kevin Lee couldn't do anything.

1135
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,870
He had him exactly where he wanted
them against the cage on his back.

1136
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,850
Head pressed against the fence,

1137
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,450
but he couldn't do anything cause
Tony did a can opener on no one,

1138
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,180
no one does that. I know he's,
he's an interesting guy, man.

1139
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,730
That was the first time you ever
did that and it worked crazy. Yeah,

1140
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,710
it was perfect.
What did you think,

1141
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:52,260
what do you think about Francis
and Ghana and Alistair Overeem?

1142
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:56,230
How ridiculous was that? Yeah,
I'll fuck is carried out.

1143
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:58,870
How many times is Allister been chaotic?
We,

1144
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:01,350
we did it on a podcast
where you get broke it down.

1145
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,370
It was like something like 13 chaos
and MMA and then another three in

1146
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:07,590
kickboxing.
Ooh.

1147
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:12,840
The ones in kickbox and seems so
much more brutal. I don't know.

1148
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,490
Not more brutal than that last one.

1149
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,580
That last one is just brutal
as anything I've ever seen.

1150
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:22,320
He got launched into another dimension
that I, I'm not a giant kickboxing fan.

1151
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,330
I mean really,
I never watched kickboxing.

1152
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,670
But if it's on I'll watch it and if it's,
you know,

1153
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:31,200
makes someone else see glory in la
though. That was the shit. Yeah. Yeah.

1154
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,050
But I'm not lying. I'm not
following it. You know what I mean?

1155
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:38,520
I don't know who the hell is
winning. No idea. Zero idea.

1156
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,430
But when I do watch it, when every
now and then I'll watch a k one.

1157
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:45,360
You do notice that they hit
a lot motherfucking harder.

1158
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:49,260
You the leg kicks into Oh shit man.
Like fuck,

1159
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:51,510
this is some other kind of shit.
I'm not,

1160
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:56,240
you could visibly see it after watching
so much MMA and then go watch them kick

1161
01:07:56,241 --> 01:08:00,150
box and you'll see how hard they fucking
kick some serious kicking going on.

1162
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:04,140
Well you see it now with like go con
Saki now the go kart sockies in the EOC.

1163
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:09,210
You know, I like, I was watching
him. So from Turkey, Turkish,

1164
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:12,690
Tyson, he's ridiculous. I mean,

1165
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:16,160
he's a brutal knockout
artists and k one and glory

1166
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,000
to see that dude fight in the UFC.
You see these crazy kicks,

1167
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:25,120
you see rediculus power kickboxers
transitioning to MMA. Yeah, but you don't,

1168
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:29,780
you don't see professional
boxers transition down too
hard without the leg kicks

1169
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:32,870
your, it's your whole striking
thing is so different.

1170
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,880
You've got to think about
those God damn leg kicks.

1171
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:37,490
I mean some guys are going to be
able to make it. It's not impossible.

1172
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,640
All they have to do is be super dedicated
at, but they have to have a motivation.

1173
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:44,600
And right now the motivation and
boxing is, if you get to a high level,

1174
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:45,560
you can be a world champion.

1175
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:49,070
You make a shitload of money and there's
a lot of money at the highest levels of

1176
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:53,000
boxing.
But even at the highest levels of boxing,

1177
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:57,320
like you have to have some name
value. Like they did a, uh,

1178
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:01,790
Gennady Golovkin paper view
and it got like 150,000 buys.

1179
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,270
And didn't they say that Ward
Kovalev was like really low as well?

1180
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:09,080
One of the best fights ever.
Ward Kovalev to Andre Ward's stopped.

1181
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,800
Andre Kovalev fucking amazing fight.
Sergey Kovalev rather.

1182
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:16,250
And I think it only
got like 160 something,

1183
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,940
525,000 pay per view buys.
That's crazy.

1184
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,080
So those guys aren't making shitloads
of money for that way or whether it's

1185
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:27,170
crazy. Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah.

1186
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:31,190
But to do your sport like this is what
you've, if you're a really good boxer,

1187
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,300
you probably have more of a chance
of making it as a, you know,

1188
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:36,620
a top flight boxer,

1189
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:40,550
then you do have learning all that other
shit while you're already 29 you're

1190
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,820
going to learn how to check leg kicks now.
Okay. You've gotta change your stance.

1191
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,550
Do you know how to take people down?
You don't. You got to learn that.

1192
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,470
You gotta learn how to get taken down.
Okay?

1193
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,850
You got to learn how to stand back up.

1194
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:51,110
You got to learn how
to defend submissions.

1195
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:53,390
You gotta learn that executes
submissions by the time.

1196
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,630
That means that basically that could
take seven years. It can take forever.

1197
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:01,810
Whereas a a kickboxer so a little
different if you get Mirko Cro cop,

1198
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,170
when he fought Vandelay Silva,

1199
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,670
he was fighting like one of the top guys
like almost right away because he was

1200
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,620
so scary and the feet and
they made some crazy rules.

1201
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:12,500
Remember those crazy rules like you can
only be on the ground for 30 seconds.

1202
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:17,480
I told remember those rules. They had a
crazy rule with Vandelay versus cro cop.

1203
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,920
The first one, first Vandelay versus
cro cop was bunch of wacky rules,

1204
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:24,470
man like you, you, you go to the ground,

1205
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:27,560
you can only go to the ground for
like 30 seconds. And if the fight,

1206
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:31,880
if no one wanted the end of the fight,
it was a draw. So it was real weird man.

1207
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:32,871
It's like Cro.

1208
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:36,950
Cop didn't know really how to stop take
downs as well back then and you know,

1209
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:39,860
he's just trying to get off his kicks
and he got off a bunch of kicks but then

1210
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:43,310
they fought again and they fought again
later when cro cop had figured out the

1211
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:47,540
take down defense game and it was one of
the worst Kaos of vandelays career. Cro,

1212
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:51,680
cop fucking climbed them upside the head
with that left Shin. Remember that one?

1213
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:53,810
He'll bit of a giant
Gash on van Billy's head.

1214
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:57,650
So Vandelay goes down like
literally a was the ax murderer.

1215
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,550
That was his nickname.

1216
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:03,110
The ax murder literally went down like
he got hit in the head with an axe blood

1217
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:07,310
pouring down his head and was, that was
one of the all time. Great. Mirko Cro,

1218
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,870
COP head kick knockouts. Was it Mirko
Cro cop? I'm pretty sure it was.

1219
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,250
Who fought that guy in who wore

1220
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,510
a wrestling mask? Any Kairos? Yes.

1221
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:20,460
He clipped him on the head and you just
see the blood pouring out of his eye.

1222
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,150
The eye socket dude.
Dude.

1223
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,640
The eyeopening wasn't that when
he was fighting with shoes on too.

1224
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:28,530
He fought a bunch of those
with wrestling shoes.

1225
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:32,820
Are they led Mirko head kick people
with red wrestling shoes on? Yeah,

1226
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:37,680
I know he fought mark home
with wrestling shoes on.

1227
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,400
He had kicked Mark Hunt
with wrestling shoes.

1228
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,220
Pete Williams had kicked a Mark Coleman
with wrestling shows. He did. Yes he did.

1229
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,270
Yeah. That's crazy. A lot of people
were wrestling shoes back then.

1230
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,500
It's an interesting argument.

1231
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:53,940
Like what's worse to getting your eye
a toe in your are are fucking wrestling

1232
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:58,080
shoes. Wrestling shoes are so much better
for traction now. Look at them there.

1233
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:01,050
Boom with fucking tape on his shit.

1234
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,770
Nobody took a punch or kick
ever as good as Mark Hunt,

1235
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,990
which is why it's even crazier
that Melvin knocked him out.

1236
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,810
He'll get that boom right over
the top and Mark Hunt still in it.

1237
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,060
Throwing bombs.
What a savage.

1238
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:20,190
So what in Ghana now has got fights?
DPA. What do you think of that?

1239
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,480
That's a tough one to call. That's an
interesting fight though, isn't it?

1240
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,440
Steve Bill was on your podcast. What did
he say? Oh Wow. He's pretty confident.

1241
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,890
It's what he says. But I
would say that too. But uh,

1242
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,340
that dude in Ghana is like a
character from a fucking Conan book.

1243
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:45,440
You know, like somebody brought this
up online that like how cone Anne,

1244
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:46,850
when he was young,

1245
01:12:46,851 --> 01:12:50,120
they made them push that wheel
and that's how he got so strong.

1246
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,780
Frances and Ghana was like
working in like a sand mine.

1247
01:12:53,781 --> 01:12:58,781
He was digging sand when he was like a
young guy like that literally might have

1248
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,600
had an effect on how fucking
powerful and strong he is.

1249
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:07,430
It really might be like an epic
fantasy novel. Like he's, he's like,

1250
01:13:07,431 --> 01:13:11,540
if you were going to go into a lab
and design a perfect heavyweight,

1251
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,070
he'd say one,
I'm about 64 to 65 maybe a little heavier.

1252
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:21,071
I was to cut a little bit maybe to 69
cuts down to 65 crazy freak athleticism

1253
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,850
fast as shit for heavyweight knock.
Anybody dead with one punch?

1254
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,150
Okay.

1255
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,360
I feel like you're asking for too much.
Yeah, heavyweights don't move that fast.

1256
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:31,680
They get tired real quick.

1257
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,210
Not everyone can knock you out with one
punch from France. He was originally from

1258
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,690
Cameroon I think. Is that right? Yeah,
and then France after that did he was,

1259
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,060
we get this,
it was grueling and dangerous work.

1260
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:48,480
Spending hour shoveling sand into the
backs of trucks so it could be shipped to

1261
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:50,160
big cities for using construction.

1262
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,810
Sometimes we'd stand all
day and water up to Shin,

1263
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:57,240
scooping sand out of the river bed are
the days we spent at the bottom of a

1264
01:13:57,241 --> 01:14:01,170
steep quarry where large chunks of earth
often broke free from the high cliffs

1265
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:06,030
and tumbled down onto workers.
Fuck man. It's a movie that's like,

1266
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,390
that's like the beginning
of a movie right there.

1267
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,320
You want to talk about that Drake song
started around the bottom that way? Hey,

1268
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,120
yeah.

1269
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:17,050
I mean, I mean he really started from
the bottom. Yeah. I mean he was there.

1270
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:20,710
He was homeless in France just
like six years ago, five years ago.

1271
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:25,400
Did you know that dude?
He was homeless in story.

1272
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,610
Like how did he get into
heaven that he was in?

1273
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,970
He was in Africa and he had decided that
he was going to take a trip to Europe

1274
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,480
and uh,

1275
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,310
he wanted to get away from where
he was and he decides to, uh,

1276
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,400
go there. It doesn't exactly know what
he's doing. And somehow or another,

1277
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:46,240
he makes his way into a gym because he
wanted to learn how to box and he made

1278
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:49,090
his way into an MMA gym. And the
coach was like, look, you should,

1279
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,840
you should try him in May. Like, you know,
like you could really get good at this.

1280
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:56,800
And he realizes that the guy's a sponge.
Learn Shit ridiculously quick.

1281
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:01,000
You look at him in his first UFC fight
versus now with Curtis blades where it's

1282
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:05,110
the Curtis plates fight and then watch
them. Now. That's only two years ago, man.

1283
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,230
So like two years ago and, but
it's improvement. It's insane.

1284
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,630
He just knocked out with one punch,

1285
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,530
one of the greatest
heavyweight kickboxers ever.

1286
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,850
Allister Overeem was a k
one grom Prix champion,

1287
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,470
Strikeforce heavyweight champion,
dream heavyweight champion.

1288
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,490
You don't get any more experience than
Alistair Overeem fought for the title.

1289
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:30,910
Right. One Punch. First round. Boom.

1290
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:35,860
It is a little late in his career though.
It is. Good point. But still is a,

1291
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,590
has anybody got gone the distance
with them or is he knocking everybody?

1292
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,860
I know he's, he, he lost one fight. Um,

1293
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:44,020
I think he got lots of decision,

1294
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:49,480
I think like an early fight in his career.
And then,

1295
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:53,440
um, I think Anthony Hamilton,
he submitted him with a Kimora.

1296
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:57,850
He submitted someone with a Komora, I
think it was Hamilton. Is that correct?

1297
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,760
Let's see. Anthony Hamilton. Yeah,

1298
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:03,040
he submitted Anthony Hamilton
was with the Camorra.

1299
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,100
Kayla Orlowski CalEd Overeem coyote,
the coyote of a bowl. Yom me,

1300
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,940
Mia hove, which was a crazy one, man.
He was just dropping bombs on them.

1301
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,220
Curtis blades was before that.

1302
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:19,540
He TK owed him doctor stoppage
Lewis and Rick was before that.

1303
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:23,860
That was the first time I ever saw
him and I was like, choose us. But uh,

1304
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:29,340
it looks like decision unanimous against
a dude named Zoom Mana [inaudible],

1305
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,840
c I. S. S. E. C s Zumaya
cease. What a great name dude.

1306
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:38,530
He's got his first fight. He won
by Armbar. Yeah, straight armbar.

1307
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,450
He's got an arm Crangle choke.

1308
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,900
He's got a standing guillotine chokes
admission and he's got one submission in

1309
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:48,100
the UFC by Kimora. He's working
with Vinny Magallanes, you know,

1310
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:51,670
I didn't know that. Yeah. If any
macrolides says he's so fucking strong.

1311
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:54,750
So this is the strongest guy that
rolled with, I did not know that. Yeah,

1312
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,520
he's in Vegas now. Yup. He's
at the UFC training institute.

1313
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:00,520
Do they got him over there
like rocky four it's crazy.

1314
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:05,620
Damn performance institute. Yeah,
he's at, he's like literally, I mean,

1315
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,700
think about this,
right?

1316
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:11,730
You got a guy who was arguably one of
the best physical specimens we've ever

1317
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:14,590
seen in the heavyweight
division. Like, right? Like it's,

1318
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,250
you can't think of someone who's more
impressive than in physically. Right?

1319
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,300
Then you have a guy who just
gives up his whole life for this.

1320
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:25,820
Like he just moved from France to Vegas.

1321
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:31,060
Then the UFC puts him in this
fucking state of the art laboratory,

1322
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:34,940
this performance institute where they've
got all kinds of crazy shit in there.

1323
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:37,490
I mean,
they have therapists and food.

1324
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,740
They have all these strength and
conditioning coaches. I mean,

1325
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,470
they're these guys that are starting
to do their camps down there.

1326
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:46,490
They're going there and they were like,
Holy Shit. Like this place is insane. No,

1327
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:46,661
no.

1328
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:49,310
Wicki was telling me all the different
services they offer and all the different

1329
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:52,880
things they do for the athletes.
For them, it's fucking amazing.

1330
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,610
All these top flight coaches
and their training with them,

1331
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,940
so you got this amazing facility opens,
right?

1332
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:00,920
He's like one of the first guys there.
He's like,

1333
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:05,690
one of the first guys to do is camps
there, moves from France to Vegas,

1334
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:06,930
brings his coat coach

1335
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:12,030
and he's just trying to smash the
world. Dude. It's like a movie. Yeah.

1336
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,430
Homeless homeless guy walks
into a gym six years later,

1337
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:20,430
UFC. Hopefully it doesn't top of
the food chain fight for the title.

1338
01:18:20,431 --> 01:18:25,200
Hopefully it doesn't start doing
ecstasy and I started going to raves.

1339
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:31,050
I know, right? You've got to
keep them from getting too
crazy. I mean, because um,

1340
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:34,440
well first of all he's got to get past
DPA and Steve Bay is gonna be the first

1341
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:38,190
real wrestler that he's ever
faced. It's a big deal. You know,

1342
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,610
it's whether or not Steve Bay can take
him to the ground. That's a big question.

1343
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:44,490
Curtis blades actually very good wrestler.
Too Steep.

1344
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:45,480
I was going to try to take them down.

1345
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:48,270
Anything I would imagine there's
going to be a lot of everything.

1346
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,760
I was gonna I'm gonna imagine that fight.

1347
01:18:50,761 --> 01:18:53,220
You're not going to be able to really
dictate entirely where everything takes

1348
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:55,860
place. I don't know too much about
steep hill on the ground. He's,

1349
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:58,530
he's not usually on the ground,
right. He just usually on the ground,

1350
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:03,300
but he's a very good wrestler in college.
Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think he's,

1351
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:07,840
um, 20 plus pounds lighter
though. Like he's about to 40.

1352
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,620
Have submission wins on his record.
It's a good question.

1353
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,120
I've never seen him win by submission.

1354
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:16,590
I've only seen a win by knockout or
decision. CV can go to a steep A's.

1355
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,580
A record. Yeah. I mean,

1356
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,940
he's got to know everything.
It's the question is,

1357
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,720
does he know,
is he strong enough?

1358
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:31,200
Is as a wrestling good enough to close
the distance? What does he got here?

1359
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:36,180
Any submissions? Tko Keio Keio Tko
tea. It's mostly TK was in chaos,

1360
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,980
dude. He is fucked a lot of people up one
submission by leg kicks though. That's,

1361
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:44,910
he doesn't need to got tapped out from
like kicks Stefan Struve beat him.

1362
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:49,980
[inaudible] him. Kiyota yeah. Tko
Dumb. Uh, somewhere in Europe.

1363
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:54,750
I think it was Nottingham,
Nottingham, England. Hey, um,

1364
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,970
yeah man.
Beat mark.

1365
01:19:56,971 --> 01:20:00,380
Hunt by Tko or Lawsky by TKL for resale,

1366
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:03,780
for doing buy Kale Overeem.
Kao Junior Dosantos.

1367
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:08,640
Tko that's a fucking hell of a
wind streak, right man. Fuck yeah.

1368
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:13,320
He's no joke, man. The Fabio Maldonado
one was scary. Remember that fight? Fabio,

1369
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:17,400
um, took that he was supposed to
be fighting someone else and uh,

1370
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:22,200
Fabio took that fight in Brazil is a
heavyweight. And how did it go down?

1371
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:26,430
I don't remember. Smashed him steep. It
was just way too big. Just way too big.

1372
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:31,690
Just smashed him, knocked him out. Same
Way. Knocked areas. Boom. That's him.

1373
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,650
[inaudible] here's her, him and
Maldonado. Yeah, let that go.

1374
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:39,870
This was it mean Stevie right now is in
its prime for sure. But this was, uh,

1375
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,430
a good example that, oh, it's
just a lot of his fights.

1376
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:49,560
He's a tough guy, man. He
takes a good shot and he's a
good wrestler. He's strong.

1377
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:52,230
He likes to ground and pound.
Yeah.

1378
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:57,030
He's just going to have to figure out
a way to deal with the extreme physical

1379
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:00,540
advantages that Francis and gone.
Who has one? Is that if I go down,

1380
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:03,810
that is Boston January 20th.
Oh Shit.

1381
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:07,540
Oh Shit.
Don't come down.

1382
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:12,150
That's also a volt con [inaudible]
and Daniel Cormier on that car too.

1383
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:16,410
That's interesting. Owes Demir is Kale
two really good guys in a row and Meesha,

1384
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:21,060
so Chernoff in one round and then he
just Kale Jimmy Manoa in one round.

1385
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,770
That was a,
he hits fucking hard Russian.

1386
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:31,070
I don't think so. It'll say Switzerland.
Yeah. Vulcan sounds like like a,

1387
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:35,440
like a Vulcan. Uh, but that's
an interesting fight too. It,

1388
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,990
that's a good fucking card man.

1389
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,660
Steve Bay and Francis and Ghana was so
scary. What's the latest of John Jones?

1390
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,680
Ooh, I don't know man. I don't think
they've reached any sort of conclusion.

1391
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,970
I don't know if, um, they
have some sort of an excuse.

1392
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:54,000
I don't know when the
trial is. I think it's, uh,

1393
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,760
it's gotta be some time coming up soon,
but it hasn't been in the news.

1394
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:58,140
See if you can find out when the trial is.

1395
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,630
It's going to be interesting to see what,

1396
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:03,590
what they say or what they
think it could be. Hmm.

1397
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,680
I tell you the craziest rumor about it,
talking about it on the podcast before,

1398
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,980
the craziest rumor was everybody
knows John Likes to party.

1399
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:13,450
I'm not throwing him under the bus.
I mean, he's even joked around,

1400
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,290
he said a to d c when DC was talking shit.
He's like,

1401
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,180
I beat you after I did cocaine. I
mean, we're just fucking hilarious.

1402
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:26,210
But the craziest rumor was that
they cut Korea teen with cocaine.

1403
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,410
It's one of the things they cut cocaine
with and that they use some cheap

1404
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:35,970
Chinese creatine team that was steroid
tainted, which is apparently very common.

1405
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,890
Apparently there's a lot of uh,
Korea teens and different things he takes,

1406
01:22:39,891 --> 01:22:41,520
they have trace amounts of steroids.

1407
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:45,060
It'll show up in the test because the
same Vat. So they make that shit in,

1408
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:48,180
they make steroids in and
they make everything in.
They're making them in China,

1409
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:51,900
these really shitty bulk places and you'll
occasionally get tainted supplements

1410
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:55,380
happens all the time. Maybe they were
purposely tainted. That could happen too.

1411
01:22:55,410 --> 01:23:00,210
We talked about that. The
greatest creotine ever. Yeah.
This should yokes me out.

1412
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,010
Yeah, right. Yeah, probably.
Maybe. Is that, that's just the way

1413
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,430
to sell steroids. You just sell
creatine. But what's interesting,

1414
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:12,820
it says California State
Athletic Commission, right?
Because it was in California.

1415
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:17,710
So who gets to decide?
California gets to decide.

1416
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,860
Is that how it works? Cause it's the
California State Athletic Commission.

1417
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:23,230
So they apparently get to decide
what happens in his future.

1418
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,020
Oh, you Sada, you if
found guilty this time,

1419
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:33,700
he faces up to a four year ban.
Holy Shit. What's the minimum now?

1420
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,350
I don't know.

1421
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:37,750
I mean it really depends on whether
or not he's got an actual excuse.

1422
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,900
If he could get that fucking deal or
to get them some coke and it's got the

1423
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:41,734
steroids in it,

1424
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,510
I bet you'd never, the problem is
you would only have a decent excuse.

1425
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:53,500
You wouldn't, you wouldn't have,
you wouldn't be exonerated.

1426
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,500
It would still be some sort of a penalty.
Wait a minute.

1427
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,190
Did you say they're cutting in China?
That cutting creatine with coke or what?

1428
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Steroids? No, using
creatine to cut cocaine.

1429
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,560
So if you buy cocaine,

1430
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:08,210
see if you've got a kilo of cocaine
while stretch that shit out, man.

1431
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:12,040
And a quarter. Oh, I got the
thing brow super fucking muscle.

1432
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:16,810
Dick creatine and super muscle did
create team has some steroids in it.

1433
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:22,170
And so when they're cutting this cocaine
with this Korea team that has steroids

1434
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:26,410
in it, he's snorting the coat. This
is he not meaning John Jones a person.

1435
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:30,040
I'm making this up, right? This is, I
don't know what not sure cabin, no, no,

1436
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:30,731
this is the room.

1437
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:35,410
Could be the rumor is that this has been
shown to task positive that he did coke

1438
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:38,410
and it had creating in it and
the creatine had steroids in it.

1439
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:43,590
The rumor is that is what people think
could be a possibility because if John

1440
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:46,120
Likes to party and we
know John Likes to party,

1441
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:50,980
it is entirely possible that he might
have partied and that he might've just had

1442
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:51,850
a little bit of that.

1443
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:56,440
And in that was this creating cause like
if you think about their cottony with

1444
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:58,810
all kinds of different stuff,
right. They cut it with,

1445
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,100
I mean I'm not a cocaine doctor, but I
gotta imagine they take some white shit.

1446
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:06,730
It looks like coke and he can make more
coke. Right. That's what the cutting is.

1447
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:10,870
Right. But to cut it with Korea
team, apparently it's comic.

1448
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,240
We looked it up. We actually
googled it. Yeah. Damn.

1449
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:17,740
I thought you were saying that he
was taking Korea team and it had,

1450
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,830
it was tainted with steroids. That's, no,

1451
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,660
that would be better for
him if that was the case.

1452
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:27,160
That will be good because that way you
could take that creatine to Usada and

1453
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:29,260
you'd have to have it on a list of
shit you were taking. He said, look,

1454
01:25:29,261 --> 01:25:32,260
it's just says it's Korean team. It's
all I took and they tested. They're like,

1455
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,390
oh shit,
this does have steroids in it.

1456
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:38,440
And then they'll go and find another one
that's like from the same that they can

1457
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:41,290
find like the VAT numbers.
I guess they'll find one independently,

1458
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:43,650
hopefully from a store.
And if they test that,

1459
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:47,680
if they find a trace amount of steroids
and that, and that's what God, um,

1460
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,210
a dirty bird to means he got off of that.
That's how he got off.

1461
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,040
He didn't take any steroids.

1462
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,860
Just took some fucking over the counter
normal supplement that wasn't supposed

1463
01:25:56,861 --> 01:26:01,600
to have steroids in it. And then, um,
he tested positive, he was stunned.

1464
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,920
And you've look at Tim,
he doesn't even lifts weights.

1465
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,590
He doesn't even remotely look like a guy.
He's just steroids.

1466
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:10,640
And they tested the stuff that they
found just randomly in the store and that

1467
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:15,050
tested positive. So he only got a short
amount of a suspension. Hmm. Yeah,

1468
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:18,320
it was pretty quick. Like six months
or something like that. But even then,

1469
01:26:18,321 --> 01:26:20,600
if you didn't do anything wrong,
why would you get six months?

1470
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:25,550
And so you're saying that the steroids
are in Korea team on accident,

1471
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:29,000
not like they're not doing it on purpose,
right? No. Well, here's the thing.

1472
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:32,360
This is just speculation, right? All
I'm here, I'm hearing a rumor, right?

1473
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:37,630
But the speculation is that these
labs where they make creatine,

1474
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,020
they also make a gang of other things,
right?

1475
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,200
They'll cook up some steroids for ya or
whatever the fuck the order is, right?

1476
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,480
And they're not cleaning those vats out,
right?

1477
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,640
So if they're just pouring and other bag,

1478
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,390
they pour out the steroids and they pour
a bag creatine in there for the next

1479
01:26:53,391 --> 01:26:54,980
batch and they're mixing everything up.

1480
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:59,540
It's entirely possible to trace amounts
of those steroids are getting into that

1481
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:04,040
stuff. When we first started
doing alpha brain, we had um,

1482
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:09,430
some of the early versions tested and
when we got the stuff mixed from a place,

1483
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:14,120
the place didn't do a very good job of
cleaning out their equipment and we had

1484
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:17,000
vitamins in our alpha brain
that weren't in there.

1485
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,980
We had some stuff that's
not supposed to be in there.

1486
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,160
So when we tested and we
found trace amounts, we had
to switch what we're doing.

1487
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:25,220
We had it changed how we,
how we have the things manufactured.

1488
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,270
That's a super common thing when you're
dealing with these overseas laboratories

1489
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:33,860
that are making all your shit together.
So that's one possibility.

1490
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:35,430
Another possibility that
I've said before the,

1491
01:27:35,431 --> 01:27:38,510
a lot of people say I'm fucking crazy.
Somebody could have given him something,

1492
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,400
somebody could have given him
something to fuck with him.

1493
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,580
Somebody could have not liked him.
Somebody could have done that too.

1494
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:45,080
I'm not saying that's what happened,

1495
01:27:45,081 --> 01:27:48,560
but I'm saying you have to take into
consideration all the possibilities.

1496
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,550
If John is telling the truth and
he's totally stunned by this,

1497
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:56,360
there's a lot of different possibilities
and one of them could easily be

1498
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:59,690
somebody giving it to them.
It also could be that he took steroids.

1499
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,870
That's plausible too. I don't know.
If you owned a creating company,

1500
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:05,210
you'd kind of want, you're
creating to be, can you,

1501
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:09,350
you guys are making steroids there too.
Right? Okay, cool. Can we use the same,

1502
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:13,730
that six, that shit. And then
you could always just say,
hey, you know, and I didn't,

1503
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,060
I don't know that what's
true. Yeah. You know,

1504
01:28:17,061 --> 01:28:20,840
they took a tour with those Dick Pills.
Apparently those gas station Dick Pills,

1505
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:25,010
they have like a generic Viagra in them.
That's why they work so well.

1506
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,270
I know that. He's just used to say
that's your honor, your honor. We, they,

1507
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,630
we didn't know that they use the
same. That's yeah, they do that.

1508
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:34,580
And they also put steroids
in those things too.

1509
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,300
Do you know Brian Red Band was the first
one to call that Jon Jones had take a

1510
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:41,440
dick pills.
That's why he tested positive red ban.

1511
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:44,140
Put it together in his head because he
does coke. He's like, look, you do cookie.

1512
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,040
Dick doesn't work, dude.
Your Dick doesn't work.

1513
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:48,470
You take those gas station Dick Pills.
He probably took one of those pills.

1514
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,320
He goes, I take those pills and feel
like a fucking animal. He's like,

1515
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:54,320
I feel like I've got steroids in
me. I'm like, really? He goes, yeah,

1516
01:28:54,321 --> 01:28:58,370
you get really aggressive. Tick is hard
as a fucking piece of metal. I'm like,

1517
01:28:58,371 --> 01:29:02,280
okay, all right. Turned out
who's right. Hmm. That's crazy.

1518
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:04,920
And it was the same thing
with Anderson Silva.

1519
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,840
When Anderson Silva tested positive,

1520
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:11,550
it was from some sort of Chinese dick
pill stuff and they found it and they

1521
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:16,290
tested it. Grab that does go look, he's
done it. He doesn't do it all the time,

1522
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,680
but he's done it so he knows what it's
like to party and that's what he was

1523
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:22,080
saying. He's like, I know what it's
like. If you're partying and he's like,

1524
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:24,210
your Dick doesn't work. He's
like, he parties, right? Well,

1525
01:29:24,211 --> 01:29:26,850
he probably did because he tested
positive for coke. He's like,

1526
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:30,540
you probably does that red band totally
nailed it. Or maybe he was doing ecstasy.

1527
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:35,220
People Take my ag Ron Ecstasy, you
know? Yeah. It could be that too. Yeah.

1528
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:39,870
Look, he's a wild motherfucker and
he likes to party. The question is,

1529
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,410
did he actually take a steroid
with the intention to cheat?

1530
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,050
That's what we don't know.
He says he didn't.

1531
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:49,350
I wished there was a way that you a
hundred play a hundred percent could tell

1532
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:53,670
someone's lying 100% you're watched that
black mirror episode where everything's

1533
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:56,250
being videotaped with contact lenses.
Yes.

1534
01:29:56,251 --> 01:30:00,030
So they just like reviewing everything
they've said. Yeah, that freaked me out.

1535
01:30:00,031 --> 01:30:00,864
That's coming.

1536
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:04,770
If we don't have a artificial intelligence
that takes over the world before then

1537
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,740
that's common that they're going to be,
you're going to be able to record.

1538
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,800
You're going to have some fucking chip
do you put in the back of your head and

1539
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:14,040
it's going to store all the stuff
directly from your nervous system.

1540
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:18,270
You're gonna be able to review it in HD
to the moment.

1541
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:21,930
They can give you eyes that work
better than your eyes and you have an

1542
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:24,920
artificial disc. Right?
Think of that. I saw dude,

1543
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:27,840
he got attacked by a shark
and he had no arm and no legs.

1544
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,260
But here he was with a carbon
fiber arm and a carbon fiber leg.

1545
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:34,200
And he's walking around. If you
didn't know, you would never know.

1546
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,800
Like from the knee down, he was
missing his leg. And from, uh,

1547
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:42,170
the middle of his bicep area,
he had a fake arm,

1548
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:45,750
may just knocked the fuck out
of people who might kill people.

1549
01:30:45,751 --> 01:30:48,660
Just punch holes right through their
chest. You could leg lock them.

1550
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,260
Would that be okay with the
California Athletic Commission?

1551
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:55,470
Let someone fight with,
um, a cyborg arm? No.

1552
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,640
No chance they'd have to start another
league with Justin amputees with Cyborg

1553
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:02,640
arms. Will you met with that dude? What's
his name? Nick Newell. He used to fight.

1554
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:05,070
He had one arm number. No, he had like a,

1555
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,000
he was born with like a stump on one side
and you put a glove on the stump. Yeah.

1556
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:12,870
I think that a man,
there's,

1557
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,840
it's entirely possible that
in our lifetime they're
going to have better parts.

1558
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:19,950
For sure. For sure. Then what we have
and once girls start preferring that,

1559
01:31:19,951 --> 01:31:23,240
like they only date dids with like
Cyborg legs, you know what I mean?

1560
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:24,120
And they like that machine.

1561
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:26,040
Did it take going to start
chopping off their fucking legs?

1562
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:29,310
The first guy that cuts his
own eyes out for robot eyes.

1563
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:32,760
That's going to be crazy shit. It's
going to happen. Yeah, there's nick.

1564
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,030
Yeah.
It's going to be,

1565
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:41,470
is going to be no chance that anybody's
going to want to be normal. Look, yeah,

1566
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:43,710
I'd just rather fade away and get fat and

1567
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,380
Cyborg legs and you could run
like 40 miles an hour. Yeah,

1568
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:49,500
you could jump over buildings.

1569
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:54,330
People chop your fucking
legs off shirt cause drink.

1570
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,340
Imagine you got some iron man legs.

1571
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:59,860
Like literally you could
jump over a building. Like

1572
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,023
first of all,

1573
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:06,180
just stop and think about living
in the year 1500 and someone,

1574
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:11,430
someone somehow or another takes you
to a place and shows you a high abuse,

1575
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:16,120
a motorcycle. He'd be like, what the
fuck is that? Oh this thing is just,

1576
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:20,920
you lie on that. It goes
zero to 60 in less than two
seconds. He just fucking with

1577
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,210
you would you would never
believe that could be real.

1578
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:29,400
You could took someone from the 17
hundreds 18 hundreds even the 19 hundreds

1579
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,350
like maybe the 1900 and they would
kind of get it cause they had bicycles,

1580
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,760
but if you go back like a thousand
years ago and show someone a motorcycle,

1581
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:40,960
they'd be absolutely convinced there's no
way that could exist. It can't be real.

1582
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:45,220
It doesn't make any sense. I think
if you go a thousand years from now,

1583
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,110
it's going to be the same
shit with our bodies.

1584
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:51,160
We're going to have ridiculous
capabilities and it'll
look just like a regular

1585
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:51,994
body.

1586
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:56,920
They'll do some sort of like bulletproof
carbon fiber skin that will look just

1587
01:32:56,921 --> 01:33:01,750
like regular skin. You'll be able to
jump over the fucking buildings. 100%

1588
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,770
this iron fists. Yeah. It was kind
of, I'm just going to lose my hand.

1589
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,320
Well you know what bro? My hands been
shrinking. I don't know what it is.

1590
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,300
People are just powerful.
Jamie,

1591
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:12,790
with the phone on this last
time you had your phone on.

1592
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,513
It's weird.

1593
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:20,500
Yeah. There's gonna be times
where there's no need to like,

1594
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:24,020
like oh you broke your arm. Here's the
good news. The recovery times. Even last,

1595
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:26,240
if we give you a fake arm,
he'd be like, really? Yeah.

1596
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:30,230
What do you want to wait six weeks while
you're fucking arm heals and then your

1597
01:33:30,231 --> 01:33:33,000
arm can what? Break again?
We'll give you a fake arm. Wow.

1598
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:36,470
Am I don't know what to do. Get
a fake arm. I love my take arms.

1599
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:39,560
Everyone's going to be just
a robot like Steve Austin.

1600
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,520
Remember that $6 million man. Yup. Bionic
legs. Remember the big foot episode?

1601
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:50,050
The best episode ever.
TV shows back then were s

1602
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,510
oh my God. Just thinking about
all the TV shows from the 70s

1603
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:01,960
garbage.
Compare that to like a Netflix show.

1604
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:06,550
Compare lack like game of Thrones.
Yeah. Or Black Mirror. That's black.

1605
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:10,400
They did have one shitty episode.
They were just knocking.

1606
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,150
It was just like they were hitting,
pitching a shutout.

1607
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,660
I've only seen three
episodes. The one where, um,

1608
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:20,350
cause it's all based on what life is
going to be like in 10 years or something.

1609
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,030
Like a little bit in the future,
you know,

1610
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:27,540
and that one episode where everyone's
just rating each other all the time.

1611
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:30,670
You know what I'm talking about?
They're just, it's happening now though.

1612
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,500
It's called nose dive. Yeah. I get
it. I get into what's happening.

1613
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:38,230
But that was,
that episode is kind of like that.

1614
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,730
I mean compared to the other episodes,

1615
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:41,950
like you see the one with
the video game where the guy,

1616
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:44,430
they put a little thing in
the back of his head. Yes.

1617
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,760
And he does know when the game's on
and when it's off. It's a tough one.

1618
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:54,160
How about the one where the, the
dude, the dude catches his, his wife,

1619
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,430
he figures out that she's cheating on him,
his acting,

1620
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:02,450
whoever that actor is. Yeah.
His Act. That was, that was, uh,

1621
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,270
an amazing episode, Matt. Yeah.
Did their intense man there's,

1622
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:10,220
and the writing was so good like to do
with the husband. Hold on a second though.

1623
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:15,200
Social credit APP scene in black mirror
is becoming a reality in China. Whoa.

1624
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:16,970
Yeah. It makes sense. It makes sense.

1625
01:35:16,971 --> 01:35:19,280
You're going to have augmented reality
and people are going to have like your

1626
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:22,820
Facebook score hovering over your head.
Like this is Mike. He's a super swell guy.

1627
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:27,170
He's got four and a half stars from
everybody meets. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1628
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:31,780
It's kind of like that with
followers. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um,

1629
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:36,380
man, it's going to be a weird
world when our kids are our age.

1630
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:40,490
It's going to be a weird,
weird world. Yes. I mean,

1631
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,680
I don't even think we could
begin to comprehend it.

1632
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,750
I think we'd be totally guessing.

1633
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,930
Think there's some shit that's
coming around the corner.

1634
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:52,310
Do you see that NASA,
Tom Delonge thing?

1635
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:55,280
Everybody keeps harassing
me about, um, the, uh,

1636
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:58,580
the video of the Ufo. I here,
I'm here, I'm reading her,

1637
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:02,710
turning up more videos all day long. I'll
be like, not just one. I called him out.

1638
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,980
Let's see.
Let me see.

1639
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:06,890
One of them videos is Tom delonge
putting out videos and know his,

1640
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,580
his organization is putting out
videos. Have you fos? Yeah. And it's,

1641
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:13,730
I'm a fighter pilot and f a 18,

1642
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,760
I believe is chasing this thing and it's
a showing all the details of like the

1643
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:24,530
Lao, the altitude, how fast it's going,
what pitch it's out and all that jazz.

1644
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:27,890
I don't know what that means, what pitches
hat, but they're watching this thing,

1645
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,110
they're trying to figure out what it is.
One of the guys is like, it's a drone.

1646
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:33,190
It's got to be some kind of a drone.
They see something and it turns,

1647
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:37,370
it was going very fast.
So basically it's like all the other Ufo,

1648
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:40,670
but it should say no
worries. Yeah, it's blurry.

1649
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:44,450
It's in like a gun sites or like,
you know,

1650
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:46,730
some sort of a infrared site rather.
Um,

1651
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:50,480
so you're looking at it through this
weird infrared video where it doesn't

1652
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:55,520
necessarily look, you know,
it's weird. It's weird. You're
looking at it like, okay,

1653
01:36:55,521 --> 01:36:57,620
what am I looking at? I'm
looking at it. A little object.

1654
01:36:58,270 --> 01:36:59,210
Do you remember that quote?

1655
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:03,310
It could be a total bullshit quote
from Warner von Braun. He, uh,

1656
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:08,350
that he said right before he died that
beware of the fake alien invasion.

1657
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:11,910
Did he say that in so many words?
I hope he did. I hope he did it.

1658
01:37:11,911 --> 01:37:15,350
He did it just to fuck with people.
It's amazing flying around.

1659
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,020
There's a whole fleet of,
I'm looking at my asa

1660
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:23,110
gotcha. Oh, going against the
wind. The wind, the hustle.

1661
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:35,240
So they're following it for a
while and then it changes direction

1662
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:38,903
it.

1663
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:48,050
So whatever that is,
whatever that is.

1664
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,570
Is Vr fucking super interesting.
And uh,

1665
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:55,260
I heard the now going to shoo fly Travis
Barker to Washington DC to talk to

1666
01:37:55,261 --> 01:37:59,310
people and give him some
information as well. No neck.

1667
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:01,170
They're going to fly a Kanye West.
He,

1668
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:05,040
they're going to fly him out and show
him the secret lab for real. No. Oh,

1669
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:09,390
I'm making this up because I think
it's crazy flying Tom delonge. I know.

1670
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:12,470
It might not be fake. It might be
real. It could be looked for it.

1671
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:16,560
Here's the thing about aliens, right? How
often do you think they'd have to visit?

1672
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:20,910
I think they could get it done once
in the 70s and be done with us.

1673
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:24,630
They'd check us out and they'd be
going to look at these crazy ass holes.

1674
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,110
This is what we're gonna
do. We're gonna fucking, uh,

1675
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,030
we're going to install some cameras
on the moon. These stupid fuckers,

1676
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:31,110
they won't even be able to see it.

1677
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:34,920
We'll just put some big ass cameras to
film them from the distance and let's get

1678
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:37,220
out of here.
These people are crazy like this.

1679
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:40,770
They're going to have nuclear power
with these assholes and they just would

1680
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:44,400
never see them again.
So like if that really is a Ufo,

1681
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,170
if it really is from another planet,
rather,

1682
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:50,700
how many times they have to come here,
you don't, I mean, if, if they are real,

1683
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:52,860
how much evidence would
you really see of him?

1684
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,170
Would you see it once every 10 years?
How, how often would they come about?

1685
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:01,200
Was it you, maybe someone had a joke that
like, maybe this is like the Tijuana,

1686
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:04,470
the University of outer space.

1687
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:07,140
It really come down here where they're
fucked up and they want to see a show.

1688
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:11,550
Was that part of your yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's super old.

1689
01:39:11,551 --> 01:39:14,850
It's 2000 early. Two
thousands yeah. I think it's,

1690
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:19,230
I'm not a nonbeliever, that's for fucking
sure. I think it's entirely possible.

1691
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:22,800
Like if, if I looked up in the
sky and an alien ship flew by,

1692
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:27,090
I would never think there's no way that
can't be real. It can't be possible.

1693
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,850
I would think. Wow, they
fucking, they visited us.

1694
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:33,090
I mean I'm sure there's something out
there that's smart. I'm sure there is.

1695
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,320
It's a matter of what it would look like.
You know?

1696
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:39,850
Would it even be in a physical form
anymore? I mean why do we assume,

1697
01:39:39,851 --> 01:39:43,410
we assume that everything has to be in a
physical form. What are you looking at?

1698
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:47,380
Kendrick Lamar says he saw a
Ufo but nobody believes them.

1699
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:55,910
What is that thing in his ear man,
which I think that's fraud and stage year.

1700
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:00,330
It's a stage photo. It's a huge thing
in his ear in ear monitors or Boston,

1701
01:40:00,331 --> 01:40:03,900
but they're also the best headphones
you can get those dude that is like some

1702
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:08,810
fucking Borg Shit that it's like he's
already been co opted by technology kind

1703
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:13,080
of stuff. Just for like regular listening,
like seven different speakers in there.

1704
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:17,620
Really bad ass. Yeah. Send me a link son.
I didn't know about the inside of it.

1705
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:19,680
You're in area. That's another good, um,

1706
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,390
have good case for a fucking
phone of the headphone Jack. Huh?

1707
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:28,530
Like that's a really annoying to me
that they've decided to eliminate the

1708
01:40:28,531 --> 01:40:32,460
headphone jacks from phones. Just lost my
second pair of air pods. You did? Yeah.

1709
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,480
It fell out of my pocket. So what are you
talking about? The edge headphone jacks.

1710
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,480
Man's cell phones. Now they don't
have a headphone Jack Anymore.

1711
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:43,140
They have this little lightening thing
on the iPhones and the only ones that

1712
01:40:43,141 --> 01:40:46,770
have headphone jacks are,
you can get them off of, um,

1713
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,360
Samsung Hasum, uh, the new Google
phones, they don't have many more either.

1714
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:56,170
Um, so it's all wireless now. A lot of
wireless. Yeah. Or you have a Dongle,

1715
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,900
they have to connect at the bottom and
then it connects to an audio thing at the

1716
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:02,450
bottom of that. So basically they're,
they're adapters still. Yeah. Yeah.

1717
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:05,470
There's adapter still, but you don't
want to carry a fucking adapter around,

1718
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:08,140
you know, but if you want to
listen to really good music,

1719
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:11,890
I find that it's just sounds better
when you have a good headphone.

1720
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,390
Just sounds better. It just doesn't sound
as good. I mean those airpods are great.

1721
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:20,830
They're fine, they're good enough. But if
you want to like really hear the music,

1722
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:25,660
like the, the best quality can be. They
say the LG phone is the best for that.

1723
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:30,540
The LG v 30, it actually has something
called a quad deck, uh, like a,

1724
01:41:30,541 --> 01:41:35,530
like a little amplifier built into the
um, uh, where the Jack is for the audio.

1725
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,870
So they actually have amplified sound.

1726
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:42,070
They said it's supposed to be by
far the best sound for a cell phone.

1727
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,480
Like they just decided to like
push that like its own speaker.

1728
01:41:46,481 --> 01:41:47,620
Like you don't need headphones.
No,

1729
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:49,720
it's not that you don't need to speak
or you definitely need a speaker,

1730
01:41:49,721 --> 01:41:51,970
but the headphone Jack
is like super powered.

1731
01:41:51,971 --> 01:41:55,960
It's got some somehow processor in there.
You see that thing?

1732
01:41:56,120 --> 01:42:00,370
I'm looking it up and just hearing you
describe it, I'm wondering like why? What,

1733
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:01,760
what they could have that's so cool.

1734
01:42:01,761 --> 01:42:05,120
And then like the article I found on the
verge says it's the best audio on the

1735
01:42:05,121 --> 01:42:08,360
phone ever. And then quote like it
doesn't, it just doesn't matter.

1736
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,270
Like they have some crazy thing
and then it might be awesome,

1737
01:42:11,271 --> 01:42:14,310
but it also doesn't matter. Doesn't matter
yet. Yeah. But if it's awesome, if it's,

1738
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,810
if you like sound like you like
you're a musician, you like sound.

1739
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,900
Wouldn't that be like get in my car.
I have my little ox cable.

1740
01:42:20,990 --> 01:42:22,460
I even when you have an ox cable,

1741
01:42:22,461 --> 01:42:27,200
see the thing is if you do an ox cable
through the headphone Jack with the Quad

1742
01:42:27,201 --> 01:42:29,270
Dac thing,
it'll make us sound better in your car.

1743
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:34,220
Do you remember bass boost on CD players
back in the day? Yeah, everyone had that.

1744
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:35,990
That was the coolest
thing and now it's gone.

1745
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:38,930
But it's just built into all
the headphones, like beats.

1746
01:42:38,931 --> 01:42:42,470
It's kind of built into it. Well, do
you remember when people's car stereos,

1747
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:43,940
like the car stereo you would get?

1748
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,310
There were always the shittiest
fucking sounding things ever.

1749
01:42:46,311 --> 01:42:49,580
And then you have to buy
a stereo afterwards if you
wanted something good edit

1750
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:53,860
equalizers to him. Yeah. Yeah. And then
dealerships like what are we doing?

1751
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:57,190
Why are we letting these people
make money off our fucking cars?

1752
01:42:57,191 --> 01:42:57,911
Cause it was like they had,

1753
01:42:57,911 --> 01:43:00,310
there was a whole industry that
was spawned so they're like,

1754
01:43:00,311 --> 01:43:04,030
why don't we just put our own good merinos
in the fuck are we doing was now like

1755
01:43:04,031 --> 01:43:05,980
if you buy like,
like a new car,

1756
01:43:05,981 --> 01:43:09,610
like a safety by Cadillac escalades or
something like that. The sound is insane.

1757
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:13,750
I'm getting those things like, God,
it sounds perfect. It's incredible.

1758
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:18,730
Just rings true. The cabin, you know,
I don't know how we got onto that.

1759
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:23,560
Trying to talk about fights. Oh Holly
Holm, Cyborg. We think of that shit.

1760
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,670
That's going to be insane.
That's really interesting, right?

1761
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:29,620
Holly's probably the only one
that has a shot against her.

1762
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:34,720
But people forget that cyborgs are
really good strikers. Like people think,

1763
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:39,721
oh Holly is going to outclass or with
her boxing skills and her foot and all

1764
01:43:40,141 --> 01:43:43,960
that.
But cyborg striking is she she,

1765
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:46,690
she's like a refreshing aroma
when we tie fighter. She is.

1766
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:49,180
And now here's another thing
to think about cyborgs.

1767
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:53,540
Jujitsu Cyborg is a way better grappler.
She,

1768
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,050
people forget how good her grappling
is because of the fact that she went so

1769
01:43:57,051 --> 01:43:59,870
many fights by Kale,
but she's competed in grappling.

1770
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,060
I know she was a brown
belt just a few years ago.

1771
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:04,010
I don't know if she's
advanced past that now,

1772
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:09,400
but she's the gin on the ground and if
you look at what Holly's weakness in the

1773
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,340
Misha Tate fight, I'm sure she's gotten
better since the Misha Tate fight,

1774
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:16,730
but Meesha controlled or on the ground
in one round, I think it was around two,

1775
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:20,570
took her down control there and then
took her down with just a little bit left

1776
01:44:20,571 --> 01:44:24,110
in the round in the fifth round and choked
her unconscious. So that ground game,

1777
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:27,170
although I'm sure she got
better at it and she even,

1778
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:31,580
she's got such a good personality
and she says she's such a good sport.

1779
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:35,510
After that she showed a picture of
her with a white belt on training.

1780
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:37,350
She's like trying to get better,
like,

1781
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:40,400
like put a picture on Instagram after
she got choked out and lost her title.

1782
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,800
That's she's got some serious character.

1783
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:46,540
Yeah. Some, some strikers they
just don't like training Jiu Jitsu.

1784
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:48,250
They're just not into it.
Yeah.

1785
01:44:48,251 --> 01:44:51,520
I don't know if she's into it or not into
it or you know for a while that people

1786
01:44:51,521 --> 01:44:55,330
were saying that she just wasn't that
into and there's like a rampage was never

1787
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:57,480
into training. Jujitsu. Yeah.

1788
01:44:57,610 --> 01:45:00,880
There's just some guys that
are so confident on their feet.

1789
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:05,110
They think that why will let, would ever
want to learn this stuff on the ground.

1790
01:45:05,111 --> 01:45:07,330
Let's just keep it up on our feet.
She's hard to take down.

1791
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,400
She works on that for sure.

1792
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:14,440
Holly's heartache down and she likes to
stand and I don't think that fight is

1793
01:45:14,441 --> 01:45:15,350
going to end up on the grind.

1794
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:18,370
I don't think cyborgs and I tried to
take Holly down at big cyborgs going go

1795
01:45:18,371 --> 01:45:21,450
right at her.
Whew.

1796
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,480
So that's the same card is number Grumet
often Barboza this is the December 30th

1797
01:45:27,481 --> 01:45:31,030
card and then Jimmy Rivera
and John Linacre. Woo.

1798
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:34,200
That's something that people are
sleeping on. That is a good fucking,

1799
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:37,560
I don't know too much about Jimmy
Rivera to, he's very good. Who,

1800
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:39,420
he'd be very good.
He beat Uriah favor.

1801
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:42,960
He was a one of your eyes last fights.

1802
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:47,250
The second last fight she
cook on Jimmy's record. Um,

1803
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,750
but he's only got one loss in his career.

1804
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,050
Um,
was he got oh yeah,

1805
01:45:55,051 --> 01:45:59,910
he beat Thomas Almeda beat up Thomas
Almeda. It was a really good fight too.

1806
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,930
Before that. Uriah Faber, he beats
him. Uri Alcantara beats him.

1807
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:09,080
Pedro Munoz be Tim and he knocked
out Marcus [inaudible] in I think is,

1808
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:12,390
I think that was his debut. Is
that right? Does it say that?

1809
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:16,800
It's just that history? It says
a full history. Yeah. So he uh,

1810
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:21,750
knocked out Marcus and his UFC debut.
He's very good man. Very, very tough.

1811
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:25,320
It's interesting cause he comes from
a chain to, he's from Tiger Shulman's.

1812
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:30,630
Tiger Shulman's is, um, a really
respected name in MMA right now. Um,

1813
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:33,240
they're really good, really
good, real good trainers,

1814
01:46:33,241 --> 01:46:36,630
real good fighters coming out of there.
But it's, um, it was always like, uh,

1815
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:39,660
did you, you have chains
out here and the west coast.

1816
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:41,280
Did you guys have like karate chains?

1817
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:46,440
Like you're one gyns Tiger Shulman had
quite a few gyms. East Coast. Yeah,

1818
01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:50,290
but a lot of gyms, man, I don't know how
many he's got, but I want to say it's,

1819
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:55,200
it's definitely more than one. And it was
like a known name in the karate world,

1820
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:59,370
you know? And then when MMA
came around, they adapted,

1821
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,690
they adapted and they put out some
real good fighters. Remember Louis,

1822
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:07,560
God know the kid, but they were the
green hair. He fought out of there too.

1823
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:12,540
I don't remember him. This is a good
fight. The green hair didn't work well.

1824
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:17,250
You know Carlos condit returning against
Neil Magni. That's very interesting.

1825
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:19,380
But I'll tell you what,
man,

1826
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:22,760
Neil Magni was the first fight where I
realized how God damn good Hofeld dos

1827
01:47:22,761 --> 01:47:26,400
Anjos says it. Welterweight window sign
just kicked his legs out from under him,

1828
01:47:26,401 --> 01:47:29,910
got him to the ground and smashed them
and submitted them. I was like, Holy Shit.

1829
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:35,160
Some guys, that weight cut is
just too much. And dose on.

1830
01:47:35,161 --> 01:47:38,040
Joe said definitely crossed over
into the too much territory.

1831
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:44,270
I mean, in my mind, he's one
of the best right now for sure.

1832
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:48,560
At 170 pounds to so many
good match ups at one 70 men.

1833
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:52,490
So many, not too many fighters go
up in weight and dominate like that.

1834
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,650
Not like that.
Not just dominate,

1835
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:59,450
but dominate a former world champion who
just came off of a convincing victory

1836
01:47:59,451 --> 01:48:02,360
over Donald Serone.
You know, Robbie's not,

1837
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:05,930
he's not shot by any stretch of the
imagination. It's not what it was.

1838
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:09,740
This was what was most impressive about
of Robbie was in there to the very end.

1839
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,310
I mean, he was bobbing and weaving when
he was getting hit with those shots.

1840
01:48:13,311 --> 01:48:16,640
He never gave up. He gave it his
all and he wasn't diminished.

1841
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:20,780
He just got out fought. He got out
leg kicked, he got out, worked.

1842
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,080
That fucking dude's got some crazy cardio.

1843
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,830
I mean Hofeld dose on just
for the barrage that he put.

1844
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:32,090
See if you could find like some highlights
like Hofeld dos Anjos versus Robbie

1845
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:32,923
Lawler highlights.

1846
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:38,950
He was just ripping him to the body
with ridiculous a quantity of strikes.

1847
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:42,440
Carlos condit hasn't fought
in a while. Right? Long time.

1848
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:44,320
How long has it been
Damien Maia choked him out.

1849
01:48:44,321 --> 01:48:46,940
I think that was his last fight a couple
of years ago. A couple of years ago.

1850
01:48:47,210 --> 01:48:51,020
Pretty sure. Did he get hurt
and have surgery or something?
No, man, I think he was.

1851
01:48:51,110 --> 01:48:52,490
I think he needed a break.

1852
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:58,790
Let's put it right in the middle there.
It's not loading up.

1853
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:05,530
God Damn it. Youtube. Get
your shit together anyway.

1854
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:10,370
It doesn't matter. Just as a
lot of, a lot of good talent.

1855
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:11,900
That 170 pound division now.

1856
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:15,800
It's very interesting Darren till I want
to see him get a second fight in the

1857
01:49:15,801 --> 01:49:17,750
UFC.
After that cowboy fight,

1858
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:19,850
I was hoping that he was going
to fight Wonderboy Thompson,

1859
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:24,130
but Wonderboy apparently fucked his
hands up in that Jorge Mosfet all fight.

1860
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:29,060
He heard his thumbs, so it's kind
of rest up. Maybe get surgery.

1861
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,640
I don't know what's going on here.

1862
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:34,100
Darren till won't rule
out fight with Mike Perry,

1863
01:49:34,101 --> 01:49:36,980
but has Wonderboy as
main priority? Hmm. Well,

1864
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:39,920
Mike Perry just lost and a great fight.

1865
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:43,610
But Pons and Tibio um,
Fanta,

1866
01:49:43,730 --> 01:49:46,880
a brilliant fight against Peri Peri
is a fucking animal though, man.

1867
01:49:46,881 --> 01:49:50,500
That of never stops coming. Do you
see that fight? I did, but not,

1868
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:54,910
I didn't see it consistently. I was like,
just looking over on it. Oh, a good fight.

1869
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,010
Mike Perry. He's the guy
who fought Alan, right?

1870
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:59,530
Giovan Giovan was the
first guy to beat him.

1871
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:02,030
Joe Bomb beaten by decision
and then he's on a,

1872
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:06,670
he's been on a win streak since he lost
this fight. And I think he, what did he,

1873
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,980
I feel like,
I feel like he won one in between there.

1874
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:15,550
The J Kellenberger fight was
after Alan Jobe on, wasn't it?

1875
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:20,470
I don't remember. He's
dangerous. Very dangerous.

1876
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:23,860
If he catches anybody, knocks him out.
I mean, he just got to catch it clean.

1877
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:24,910
If he catches you clean,

1878
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:28,900
he throws fucking haymakers
super aggressive guy.

1879
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:31,750
Like all dudes with writing
above their eyebrows.

1880
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,530
Whenever you get tattooed
above your eyebrow, usually
probably a little reckless.

1881
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:41,740
Probably a little crazy. Yeah.
Yeah. So we'll see here. Yeah.

1882
01:50:41,741 --> 01:50:45,700
The Jake Ellenberger Kao was right
after Alan Joe Ban. That was crazy.

1883
01:50:45,701 --> 01:50:50,320
The Alex Reyes can win streak he had
before Allen. Yup. Yup. Young. Who? Lynn,

1884
01:50:50,321 --> 01:50:54,640
who's a bad motherfucker.
He uh, got him by Tko.

1885
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:57,400
Danny Robert's got him by Kao.

1886
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:01,240
Serious fucking striker man.
That guy throws bombs.

1887
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:06,570
I mean he lost but he lost to a really
good guy and ponds in Libya was fucking

1888
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:08,380
very good and he put that guy in trouble.

1889
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,420
But ponds and Libya had an awesome
strategy. Okay. Workload, great cardio.

1890
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:16,180
There was a fight where like both
those guys were like on the edge a lot.

1891
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:20,950
They were both very tired. There was
like some serious back and forth action.

1892
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:25,370
What do you think said what's happening
next for rose? And I'm a Joomla's.

1893
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:29,750
That's a good question. Just bringing
still on cloud nine man rematch with, uh,

1894
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:32,770
maybe, but here's the gun. I don't know
if your honor can make that weight.

1895
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:38,200
I think Joanna is a struggling, real
bad to make that way. When she said,

1896
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:42,430
when she lost no, I mean she gave it
all up to two rows and rows caught her.

1897
01:51:42,431 --> 01:51:45,970
But she said she had a real struggle to
make that way and she's thinking maybe

1898
01:51:45,971 --> 01:51:49,330
one 25 we better for who knows.
Um,

1899
01:51:49,331 --> 01:51:53,860
she fired her a nutrition company though
that was taking care of her people that

1900
01:51:53,861 --> 01:51:55,590
were cut and getting her
to cut weight for that.

1901
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,200
She said it was her hardest weight cut
when it comes to people that know how to

1902
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:01,540
do that. Boy, there's like,

1903
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:06,100
there's like four or five different
people right now that are like prominent

1904
01:52:06,101 --> 01:52:09,970
people. Whose the best
cutting weight? You here?

1905
01:52:09,971 --> 01:52:14,260
Two guys consistently.
You hear Dolce and Lockhart.

1906
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:17,860
That's who you hear consistently.
You hear Mike Dolce and George Lockhart.

1907
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:21,850
Don't chase got a little bit more
experience. Who's Delta got right now?

1908
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,870
That's a good question. It's got a lot of
people, but he's got a real good record.

1909
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:29,530
You know, you look at his record
for getting guys on wait for fights.

1910
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:32,620
He's got a real good record. You
know, who has the worst record?

1911
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:39,190
Whoever. Calvin has Calvin's lost.
How many times does Calvin missed?

1912
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:42,850
He's missed weight wise. Yeah, but
didn't he make it when he was with dolce?

1913
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,560
He made when he was an
adult. A though, right?

1914
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:46,940
I think so.

1915
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:49,850
Yeah. Just needs to be
super regimented. You know,

1916
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:55,730
he's so fucking talented. Calvin is
so god damn talented. Hell yeah. Yes.

1917
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,390
That one too that he landed on
our Bisping was like holy shit.

1918
01:52:59,890 --> 01:53:00,950
Dedicated with the left hook.

1919
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:05,180
He caught him with a right jab and then
he caught him with a straight left. Oh,

1920
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:10,070
that's snapped his head back. It was
like, but it was, he snaps his punches,

1921
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,540
man punches there.

1922
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:15,770
Snap like he's got a very
interesting punching style.

1923
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:20,210
Like he catches guys like at
the very end of his shots. Man.

1924
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:24,740
I mean it's, it's really interesting to
coming from that South Pole position,

1925
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:29,140
paying look at that.
Come on man. Powerful PR.

1926
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,430
Fucking super powerful
and a good wrestler too.

1927
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:32,750
That's what a lot of people forget.

1928
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,380
One of the reasons why he could strikes
so good as he's so fucking hard to take

1929
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:39,500
down. Remember when he won
against your rival hall?

1930
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:44,590
Yeah. He's been working with Marvin,
my blackbelt Marvin cast down.

1931
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:48,610
He's been doing some serious training
with them. The cerebral [inaudible]. Yeah,

1932
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:53,050
the syllabus. The syllabus is a bad
month. Tries you remember that? Oh,

1933
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:56,650
I know that guy is,
he's got a nasty MNR your role at all.

1934
01:53:56,651 --> 01:54:00,700
He's got that like 12 million views
or whatever on flow grappling.

1935
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:05,130
He's not all the time. He's, Marvin is uh,

1936
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:10,030
probably at headquarters. The
hardest trainer. I mean, he,

1937
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:15,030
he's always drilling,
always teach in teaching privates,

1938
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:16,600
drilling his boys.
He's got his own crew.

1939
01:54:16,601 --> 01:54:21,010
The break squad came in
about seven guys and man,

1940
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:25,100
that's a training on Sundays doing
doubles on Sundays every day. He, Lou,

1941
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:26,201
that's amazing.

1942
01:54:26,201 --> 01:54:31,201
He lives it like that's a girl and
he's hustling to putting out seminars,

1943
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:36,190
training camps. He's got his dark arts,
uh, seminars. When he teaches a class,

1944
01:54:36,191 --> 01:54:40,000
it's dark arts just because he's,
you know,

1945
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:43,930
he's got all kinds of game,
but he does specialize in his own.

1946
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:47,460
He's got his own special leg lock
game that no one else is doing it.

1947
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:50,680
It's pretty extraordinary.
And he's the best at it.

1948
01:54:50,681 --> 01:54:53,440
And he's teaching and he's got all his,
his crew that he's teaching.

1949
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,510
And I've actually implemented
that into the curriculum. We,

1950
01:54:56,530 --> 01:55:00,130
we practice his best stuff. I put
it up, I put it right in directly

1951
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:02,340
crazy how Jujitsu has no end.

1952
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:07,890
This is like new waves and new
techniques and new variations and new

1953
01:55:07,981 --> 01:55:10,620
improvements and new
defenses and it has no end.

1954
01:55:11,390 --> 01:55:16,390
The the amount of ways you can intertwine
and entangle two human beings and in

1955
01:55:16,751 --> 01:55:20,540
different angles. It's, it really
is endless. I know there's,

1956
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:25,170
I mean there's so many different
styles of just leg locks,

1957
01:55:25,171 --> 01:55:30,171
just leg locks alone as its take
a lifetime to master it so much.

1958
01:55:30,411 --> 01:55:34,610
And over the last four
years it's just exploded.

1959
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:39,670
I mean since since Ebi one
when the Danaher debt squad
came in and just started

1960
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:44,700
dominating boom, that's when
the leg lock came, exploded.

1961
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,740
It was always around cars
in Abu Dhabi and our dean,

1962
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:48,660
Lester was crushing people with heel hook.

1963
01:55:48,661 --> 01:55:52,890
And so as Vinny Michael as they've always
been around, but I think maybe, uh,

1964
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:56,460
people thought, okay, dean lister,

1965
01:55:56,461 --> 01:56:00,420
his leg lock and dudes because he's
so strong and so big and Paul Horace,

1966
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:02,970
his leg lock and everybody,
because he's so big and strong,

1967
01:56:02,971 --> 01:56:06,900
just ripping legs apart.
Um, you know that,

1968
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:11,070
and I think people looked at that
like maybe it's on a small man sport,

1969
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:15,080
leg locks and even early in MMA,
like big dudes are going for hill.

1970
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:18,990
Cause you know, outside the
look. But when you see guys,

1971
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:23,970
I get e Cummings and you know, he's
not big at all. He cuts down at one 35.

1972
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:25,920
He's the one 45 champ.

1973
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:30,840
But what does he mark around the leg locks
dudes that are 250 pounds a leg lock.

1974
01:56:30,841 --> 01:56:35,490
Anybody that's criticism. People are
afraid of him. They're afraid of it.

1975
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:40,020
He's so good at leg locks. People
are fucking, they run from him.

1976
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:44,610
They have such a good system.
The Donna her system. Do
you ever, do you know Donna,

1977
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:46,200
her system?
Do you talk to him about it?

1978
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:48,940
He's very secretive about it
and it's a good mood. You know,

1979
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:53,370
that's part of the reason they're
dominating the sub. Only seen, you know,

1980
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,830
they're very secretive. But you know, we,

1981
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:59,790
we take what they do and we added to
the game and we dissect their game.

1982
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:04,560
We dissect a, you know, Marcella Garcia
is gang. We dissect anybody's game. Who's,

1983
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:08,510
who's legit. Donna has got a great
a Instagram page to break it down.

1984
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:12,300
Stuff breaking down his technique. He's
a genius. I mean, look at all his guys.

1985
01:57:12,690 --> 01:57:16,470
You got Eddie Cummings,
uh, Gordon, Ryan, um,

1986
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:20,410
Bryan Garey tone and Nicky Ryan and
then the guys from Tristar with,

1987
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:21,480
you're affiliated with them too.

1988
01:57:21,481 --> 01:57:25,860
Like Ethan Corellas and Sten I was
messaging just peed a lot of training with

1989
01:57:25,861 --> 01:57:30,210
them. Yup. Yup. And I'm all
over Taza. He's awesome.

1990
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:34,440
They got a lot, their crew, they're deep
and they're not just good a leg locks.

1991
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:37,620
They're going to everything. They're
good at passing. Uh, you know,

1992
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:40,740
they're passing people's guards
and Abu Dhabi. Well, look at it.

1993
01:57:40,741 --> 01:57:42,540
Look at when George choked
out. Bisping. I mean,

1994
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:46,800
when's the last time you saw a rear naked
choke? That tight. Yeah, that was tight.

1995
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:50,130
Yeah. Right away in a world title fight
the way he slapped it on. And it was like,

1996
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:51,520
you know,
sometimes you,

1997
01:57:51,521 --> 01:57:55,080
you'll see like a lot all like hand to
the back of the head type shit that was

1998
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:59,960
just super sunk in and tight.
Yeah. Uh, the, you know, um,

1999
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:04,290
our rival rivalry with them 10
planet and DDS is only be, you know,

2000
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:06,240
it's only because they're so goddamn good,
you know,

2001
01:58:06,241 --> 01:58:09,000
and we're trying to catch him
right now and the sub only game,

2002
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:12,660
no doubt they are the best and
we're trying to catch them.

2003
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:16,500
So if we catch him or not, you know,
if we're, if we surpass them or not,

2004
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:19,620
it regardless,
we're going to be as good as we can get.

2005
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:23,130
We're getting better and better every
year. You need someone like that,

2006
01:58:23,131 --> 01:58:26,400
that the sport needs someone like that.
To have a team that's that dominant,

2007
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:29,250
it's great for the whole game
because then you realize like, wow,

2008
01:58:29,251 --> 01:58:31,660
this is possible and you've got
to take it to the next level.

2009
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:36,930
The elevating everybody's game. And
when Glb Eddie Cummins, that was,

2010
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,190
it was so huge for me and for
everybody attempt. It was so huge.

2011
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:45,110
Only because there were so dominant.
Yeah. You know, it's like, you know,

2012
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:49,540
that it was just incredible. So,
um, the, the rivalry we got going,

2013
01:58:49,541 --> 01:58:52,060
it's just making us all better
and it's just elevating the game.

2014
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,660
It's making us better.
It's making our leg locks better and,

2015
01:58:54,910 --> 01:58:58,240
and we're even taking, you know, some of
their passing and their back attacks too.

2016
01:58:58,241 --> 01:59:01,480
So who is out of Jujitsu at a high level?

2017
01:59:01,481 --> 01:59:06,481
Jujitsu is got like real promise and
MMA right now cause isn't Garrick tonin

2018
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:08,440
about to fight an MMA match?

2019
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:12,130
Gary Tone and who won
Ebi four times I think.

2020
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:18,370
I think. Which is a lot. And
he only has one loss and Ebi,

2021
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:23,260
he's been super dominant.
He's about to fight for one FC.

2022
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,230
He signed a contract with
shattery so that's gone down.

2023
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:30,740
I think his first fight maybe
in March, maybe. Well you know,

2024
01:59:30,790 --> 01:59:33,130
as long as long,
as long as they bring them along slowly,

2025
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:37,130
no doubt he's gonna make some noise and
crone is still fine for rise and right.

2026
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,780
Verizon, he fought for
rise in, in his last fight,

2027
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:44,350
but I don't know what's going on currently
with this contract. I have no idea.

2028
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:47,380
It's been awhile. It's been over
a year maybe since his last fight.

2029
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:49,780
So I don't know.
And when he was on my podcast,

2030
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:53,880
he made it clear that he,

2031
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:58,180
he at at the very least wasn't certain
where he was going to go with MMA.

2032
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:00,960
He talked about how Eh,
the,

2033
02:00:00,980 --> 02:00:04,310
the training and the lifestyle
is just not fun. He goes,

2034
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:08,620
I just beat a guy and I'm
like, this isn't, this wasn't
fun. I mean, so he's not,

2035
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,480
maybe you need time off,
you know,

2036
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:14,680
cause he's had all the pressure of being
Hixon son and there's so much pressure

2037
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:16,890
that come. Can you imagine
the pressure, you know, he's,

2038
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:21,610
he's fighting a managing now he's fighting
and ADCC you know, all that pressure.

2039
02:00:21,611 --> 02:00:24,970
He cannot get stomped.
He gets stomped.

2040
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,300
He's got to deal with like how
his dad feels and you know,

2041
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:30,730
that fucks with people's heads.
So there's so much pressure.

2042
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:33,880
So I want to see that kind of
level of Jujitsu. Like when,

2043
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:38,170
like when Brian Ortega fought cubs
warrants, that guy right there,

2044
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:42,280
Brian Ortega, that guy, he probably,

2045
02:00:42,281 --> 02:00:47,080
he's right up there with all the best
Jujitsu players in the UFC right now

2046
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:49,570
actually. He's right up there
with Damien Maia right there.

2047
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:54,400
I mean that guy is finishing fights with
Jujitsu consistently and he just took,

2048
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:59,260
you know what, what you would he did in
his last fight with that, um, that uh,

2049
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:00,900
against cub cub Swanson when he,

2050
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,000
when he just took just your basic ass
front headlock had an army just takes that

2051
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:09,040
and just closes the show with that.

2052
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:13,450
Now there are many people can do that and
adjusted his hands that he was hanging

2053
02:01:13,451 --> 02:01:15,850
on.
He had an RMN faked,

2054
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:19,630
like he was going all neck [inaudible]
and then went back. Cause as he faked it,

2055
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:21,940
loosened up the guillotine.
So I went back bloom and then he,

2056
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:24,710
it was just a little fake.
Oh that's interesting. Yeah.

2057
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:27,910
Oh he faked and went back into
it because the guy on the bottom,

2058
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:31,930
he knows he's kind of arm and Guillotine
and he knows, okay, I'm safe here,

2059
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:34,990
but look, I, there's a little
opening if he switches really quick,

2060
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:38,650
there's a Marcella team there, so you're
always watching it. So when he went,

2061
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:42,620
he adjusted. But he went back and got
in deep with the arm and that's what,

2062
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:44,660
I haven't talked to him
personally about it,

2063
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:46,100
but to me that's what it looked like.

2064
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:48,140
I watched it over and over
that looked like a little fake.

2065
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,410
He had had an arm fake the Marcella teen
and went back in and deep and then he

2066
02:01:51,411 --> 02:01:56,411
sunk it on the level of squeeze and
clinch that's needed to do to pull that up

2067
02:01:57,501 --> 02:02:01,440
on cub Swanson Cub. Swanson
is high leveled. You did.

2068
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:05,420
He's one of the best Jujitsu guys
in the UFC. He's right up the,

2069
02:02:05,421 --> 02:02:08,720
his Jujitsu is really,
really good. Really good.

2070
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:13,990
And to to pull that guillotine off
on them and standing the super,

2071
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:15,800
there's so much.
There's,

2072
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,610
there's so much technique going on
and when you're almost got that Doris,

2073
02:02:19,611 --> 02:02:22,130
was it a dark Fernanda Condo?
Was it a Japanese necktie?

2074
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:25,190
What did he almost got in the
first round to see that again,

2075
02:02:25,191 --> 02:02:27,870
he was in some weird position where it
looked like he was trying to seal up a

2076
02:02:27,871 --> 02:02:29,990
Doris, but either way he
had, I think it was a,

2077
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:33,620
Darcy had comp Swanson tightened
down quick. You know, like, Whoa,

2078
02:02:33,621 --> 02:02:35,540
this guy is closing the show fast.

2079
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:39,590
Those are all so very simple
chokes to learn. The Darce,

2080
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:44,060
the arm and guillotine, the Marcella
teen, um, Japanese Necktie, they're all,

2081
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:44,923
that's the,

2082
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:48,590
that's the easiest part of the
technique is just learning how to do it.

2083
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:53,030
That's the easiest part. The hard part
is mastering it. That's the hard part.

2084
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:58,040
Easy. You could learn a arm and guillotine
in, in, in three minutes. Anybody can,

2085
02:02:58,041 --> 02:03:01,970
it's really easy to learn is not,
it's not trigonometry,

2086
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:05,120
but mastering it.
That's what's hard.

2087
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:08,360
Like you would think like why isn't there
more guys like Brian or tag out there?

2088
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:10,400
Just taking little simple,
um,

2089
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,860
at front headlocks who had an
arm and then taking it home.

2090
02:03:12,861 --> 02:03:15,740
There ain't that many because the
amount of, it's just like, um, uh,

2091
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,990
[inaudible] plum clinch,
you know, so easy.

2092
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:21,650
You could learn them when we tie plump
clinch in 30 seconds, really, really easy.

2093
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:25,880
But actually manhandling a
professional fighter with it.

2094
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:31,480
The amount of time that you need
to craft that clench and Polish it,

2095
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:36,540
there's so you actually need physical
time. You have to, you have to,

2096
02:03:36,570 --> 02:03:37,910
it's not going to happen on its own.

2097
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:41,180
I remember when Anderson
Grab Rich Franklin and you
could see right away you're

2098
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:45,930
like Whoa, this is a different kind of
Thai clinch. Remember he just yeah, yeah.

2099
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:49,550
Moving them around to every,
yeah.

2100
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:53,510
Every now and then you see a fighter
utilize just the punk clinch and be really

2101
02:03:53,511 --> 02:03:54,380
effective with it.

2102
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:59,090
Someone recently I forgot who was using
it and that the UFC last week I forgot,

2103
02:03:59,091 --> 02:04:02,210
but uh,
who has it wasn't the Los Angeles was it?

2104
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:06,560
You said it was the Sanyo so that's
right. Yeah, it was him and he comes from,

2105
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:08,500
you know Rafael, Cordelia
is, that's more time.

2106
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:14,030
How much time are you spending developing
that plum clench up. Muy Thai clinch.

2107
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:16,070
If you,
if that is not in your curriculum,

2108
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:19,070
that is not going to be something
that people are going to be fearing.

2109
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:22,550
You actually have to put time into it.
It isn't about learning,

2110
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:23,600
it's about mastering it.

2111
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:27,500
So what's about developing strength
in that one particular image?

2112
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:28,550
Just like the same way.

2113
02:04:28,551 --> 02:04:32,300
Like some guys can throw a nasty left
hook to the body cause they just have

2114
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:36,830
ridiculous or is you take the average
athlete and have them throw a left hook.

2115
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:41,100
It's Awkward Punch to throw but
you get a guy like triple g.

2116
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:45,730
He's been doing it so long, that neural
pathway so smooth and car. He just,

2117
02:04:46,190 --> 02:04:49,130
he just digs that thing. It's the same
thing with chokes. You see it with Brian.

2118
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:53,640
Same thing with Brian also with his
triangles man. Yes. It's fucking guard.

2119
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:55,710
That needs special time too.

2120
02:04:55,830 --> 02:05:00,690
It has has nothing to do with the time
you spent on the front headlock and and

2121
02:05:00,691 --> 02:05:04,140
taking that all the way home and closing
the show just from the front headlock.

2122
02:05:04,370 --> 02:05:07,600
Nicole Brina did it against
[inaudible] AG, his arm in,

2123
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:10,860
in Abu Dhabi and um,
age.

2124
02:05:10,900 --> 02:05:14,640
I wrestled in college Cabrina and wrestle
but at this point he is like a college

2125
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:15,120
wrestler.

2126
02:05:15,120 --> 02:05:18,090
Colbert has been wrestling so long he
could wrestle with college wrestlers.

2127
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:23,280
Jay wasn't going to take them down at age
is a college wrestler like the Jit and

2128
02:05:23,281 --> 02:05:26,040
he's not going to take co bringing it
down. [inaudible] is like, you know,

2129
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:30,030
a couple of where I'm asked her.
So uh, Cabrina shot in on a,

2130
02:05:30,031 --> 02:05:34,710
Jane got a single and then dragged
them but, but he had a single,

2131
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:38,910
a j was hopping on one foot and then he
would drag him down like run the pipe

2132
02:05:38,911 --> 02:05:41,220
with it. And Aja such a
professional, he does,

2133
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,650
he gets put to the ground
but then pops right back up.

2134
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:46,950
Now we top it on one leg again. He has
a single and then Corina does it again.

2135
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:50,790
Boom. He drags them down and then
a j like a professional Ninja,

2136
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,390
he pops up again. How the fuck are
they Jay? Even walking after that,

2137
02:05:54,391 --> 02:05:58,810
Gary Tonin about,
I don't know if this really quick,

2138
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,100
this is on that front headlock. So
then cold breana he realized, okay,

2139
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:06,090
he sees what's going on. He knows that
he fucking, he still has the single,

2140
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,720
still has control that clinch
Cabrina has he, he captured him.

2141
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:13,800
It's not just a regular thing. He captured
them age. They can't pull that leg up.

2142
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,620
He can't complete the takedown,
but he ain't pulling the leg out.

2143
02:06:16,621 --> 02:06:21,180
That clinch Cabrina is so strong,
right? So then Cabrina does it again.

2144
02:06:21,181 --> 02:06:24,540
He dragged them down to the ground and
then before he could pop up, he lets go,

2145
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:28,130
lets go and jumps on a front headlock
and he has a cradle on a front headlock

2146
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:30,570
and then boom, and that's it.
He's not letting go of that.

2147
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:34,170
That's really not that much there. But
you know what? It's a starting point.

2148
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:37,920
The actual real starting point was
that single that clinch on the Sydney.

2149
02:06:37,921 --> 02:06:42,790
Submit them. He captured them.
Yeah. Um, he got his back. He's,

2150
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:43,591
he slowly,

2151
02:06:43,591 --> 02:06:46,170
he had the front headlock with the cradle
and then he's sprawled on him for a

2152
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:49,020
while, maybe a couple minutes and
then slowly jumped on his back.

2153
02:06:49,380 --> 02:06:54,380
He took them out like a real anaconda
and that all those positions,

2154
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:58,110
every step, just a little single
holding a leg on a single.

2155
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:01,410
Most people can't even hold it in and a
guy will limp leg out and start again.

2156
02:07:01,411 --> 02:07:02,520
They start fresh and reset.

2157
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:06,060
Most guys get in there and hold
that single for just a little bit.

2158
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:08,850
It's only a little clench, a little
tiny clinches their little second here,

2159
02:07:08,851 --> 02:07:10,680
two seconds here,
or there was little risk control,

2160
02:07:10,681 --> 02:07:12,990
but when Cabrina gets in there
and clinches on that leg,

2161
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:15,810
he couldn't pull it out and then he
jumped on the front headlock and then he

2162
02:07:15,811 --> 02:07:18,270
wasn't going to a lot of dudes,
you put a front headlock on,

2163
02:07:18,271 --> 02:07:22,590
most guys you could peel that shit off
and get off my fucking neck easily.

2164
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,900
But there's levels like we always say,

2165
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:28,590
we always say that because that's what
it's all about. You have to remind people,

2166
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:32,010
there's levels to every movement
is you just keep getting better.

2167
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:35,500
And then levels to chaining the movements.
That's a different, it's different,

2168
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:38,260
you know, and then boom, you
put another movement. Well, how,

2169
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,570
what level are you on this part
that we're going to connect?

2170
02:07:40,571 --> 02:07:43,750
That's a whole different level. That's
a whole different part. Another piece,

2171
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:47,560
everything needs to be every
pathway in Jujitsu there.

2172
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:50,230
It can be super long or short,
but man,

2173
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:53,740
there's some pathways that
like for instance, you can um,

2174
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,770
capture someone in quarter garden.
That's your first one. I'm like,

2175
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:59,110
this is the path that a normal pattern I,
oh,

2176
02:07:59,111 --> 02:08:02,980
I'm trying to do is just capture the guy
and the worst capture his quarter guy.

2177
02:08:02,981 --> 02:08:03,940
It's the worst guard.

2178
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:07,870
Africa's anything worse than quarter
guard where you're just controlling his

2179
02:08:07,871 --> 02:08:11,410
ankle. There's half guard. You control
the leg, full guard, you're controlling.

2180
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:13,930
His whole body is between your legs.
That's full guard.

2181
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:17,560
Half of that is you only have
control of one of his legs.

2182
02:08:17,650 --> 02:08:20,020
And then quarter guard is you're,
you're almost losing that lag.

2183
02:08:20,021 --> 02:08:23,230
You got the ankle, that's the worst
guard. Once you lose control of that,

2184
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:26,800
he passenger car. Oh, you have
nothing. You have nothing. So you,

2185
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:29,320
we capture that uh,
ankle.

2186
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:34,200
You're in court guard and then use a
mini stomp. That's a technique, uh,

2187
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:38,500
a series of techniques to get to the
lockdown, which is a form of half guard.

2188
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:41,260
And then from the lockdown,
how are we going to get to full guard?

2189
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:45,370
So it's a little clamp ankle, full
leg. Now I got your full body,

2190
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:49,000
now we're going to attack. And then from
there it's a whole new sport starts.

2191
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:50,230
You got them in full guard.

2192
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:53,620
Now it's all what you did before has
nothing to do with this is a whole new

2193
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:56,480
level. It's like a video game. Now
I've got them in full guard, man.

2194
02:08:56,481 --> 02:08:59,830
That took a while, but I finally got
him here and that's the whole strategy,

2195
02:08:59,900 --> 02:09:01,090
a strategy in the whole plan.

2196
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:03,550
If anything would've failed
and I didn't get full guard,

2197
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:07,510
then you try to sweep and try to
get on top of them on the bottom.

2198
02:09:07,511 --> 02:09:10,720
Use Half Guard suits. Get the dog
dogfight, electric chair, electric stone,

2199
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:14,410
reverse locked down a lot of
stuff. You could do. Butterfly
sweeps over Hook, boom.

2200
02:09:14,411 --> 02:09:16,990
I couldn't get full guard, but
look, I swept you. Now I'm on top.

2201
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:21,430
Now we pass the guard, set them up,
put them in the truck from the truck.

2202
02:09:21,431 --> 02:09:24,220
It's not working out. Tables back.
Tried to know what you're talking about.

2203
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:28,630
You were trying to say this is a
crazy comprehensive system. There's,

2204
02:09:28,631 --> 02:09:30,370
there's a path,
there's all these steps.

2205
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:33,250
[inaudible] nothing's happened
in the truck. Take the back down.

2206
02:09:33,251 --> 02:09:34,750
I'm not going to spend
that much time on the back.

2207
02:09:34,751 --> 02:09:36,880
I'm going to spider webs well by the web.
That's it.

2208
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,840
We're first and goal on the one.
It's not looking good for you.

2209
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:45,580
And there were so many things that had
you had a chain together for that to

2210
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:49,180
happen. All those moves that
sound crazy. You have a chain.

2211
02:09:49,181 --> 02:09:53,230
All those moves together to make it
happen. You know? That's, that's um,

2212
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:56,230
that takes a long time. They should
teach that shit in high school.

2213
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:01,900
They really should. What? Jujitsu? They
make kids a lot nicer. I believe so.

2214
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:05,410
I think so. It makes him a
lot more humble, more humble,

2215
02:10:05,411 --> 02:10:09,040
but also more realizing that a lot
of the bullshit and insecurity,

2216
02:10:09,041 --> 02:10:13,870
you can get that out of your system train.
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of pressure though.

2217
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:17,530
Yadda pressure. Everybody would be
cooler where the chairs are Jujitsu.

2218
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:21,010
It's competition every night. That's,
that's a different kind of pressure self.

2219
02:10:21,011 --> 02:10:22,570
You can handle that.
If you can handle,

2220
02:10:22,571 --> 02:10:26,050
if your ego can handle the competition
every night, it's Abu Dhabi every night.

2221
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:27,640
If you can handle it and
you go in there like,

2222
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:29,320
I don't care if I get beat by these guys.

2223
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:33,140
I care about the guys that are on the
streets. These guys in this Jujitsu club,

2224
02:10:33,141 --> 02:10:35,720
they're all little computer nerds.
I'm not worried about them.

2225
02:10:35,721 --> 02:10:39,110
I don't think to be nice to you. I don't
care if they tapped me out one day,

2226
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:41,190
I'm going to be able to do that,
uh,

2227
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:45,120
do what they did to me on someone
that just walked in the door. That's,

2228
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:47,540
that's the attitude you need new.
You need that attitude.

2229
02:10:47,541 --> 02:10:52,541
Like people take the tapping when
they go into Jujitsu too seriously.

2230
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,680
And there is that,
that's why it's so much fun.

2231
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:58,360
That's why it's a exhilarating
and exciting cause they
don't want you to do that.

2232
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:01,580
Yeah, exactly. And then when you
tap someone out and makes it,

2233
02:11:01,581 --> 02:11:04,460
makes it so much better.
The fear of getting tapped or whatever.

2234
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:07,070
Maybe you don't call it fear.
Uh, but I guess you could.

2235
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:11,480
But that in itself makes the tat
feel better. So it's worth it.

2236
02:11:11,481 --> 02:11:14,090
You got to have both.
Can't have head and without the hell.

2237
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:19,070
So that's what makes it exciting.
Life itself though. Microcosm. Yeah,

2238
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:22,280
exactly. It's like all the shit that's
going on in the world. It's like,

2239
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:25,040
maybe this is what we're here for.
The pain,

2240
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:28,980
maybe it's opposed to be fucked up and
we're supposed to learn how to survive in

2241
02:11:28,981 --> 02:11:31,540
this a fucked up world, you know,
I don't know if we're supposed to,

2242
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:35,420
but we definitely appreciate good
things more when we see bad things. Yes.

2243
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:40,370
Maybe like struggle. Struggle's
real. Yeah. When you think about,

2244
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:45,540
um, like, uh, you know,
getting, uh, let's says,

2245
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:48,470
let's just say you were a
politician or some or a person that,

2246
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:52,670
that were like a truth or whatever, and
then you're thinking about, man would,

2247
02:11:52,671 --> 02:11:57,200
if I get, uh, suicided,
you know, no, I'm not,

2248
02:11:57,201 --> 02:11:58,310
I'm just saying,
but you brought,

2249
02:11:58,311 --> 02:12:01,670
you brought that up many times
about like Hillary Clinton. Yeah.

2250
02:12:01,671 --> 02:12:03,620
Do you manage how many people
criticize Hillary Clinton?

2251
02:12:03,621 --> 02:12:07,430
Unless you're working for the DNC, you
don't have to worry, but if you like,

2252
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:11,780
but if you're sending some shit to
wikileaks, yeah. People get suicided.

2253
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,040
You know what I mean?
But what's,

2254
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:16,820
what's people fight that
the people are fighting the,

2255
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:20,060
the extreme corruption going
on and there's so many layers,

2256
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:25,061
but what's worse getting suicided by
somebody in the DNC as someone ordered a

2257
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:32,180
suicide hit on you or getting eaten by
a great white shark in South Africa.

2258
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:37,310
I, well, how would you rather go
to, has a really matter? There's, I,

2259
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:40,340
it might suck because they might cut you
in half. Yeah, but you're, you're not,

2260
02:12:40,370 --> 02:12:41,420
there's not people out there.

2261
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:45,480
You're not going out there
fighting to kill all sharks. Right.

2262
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:49,190
You're not trying to end
sharks, you know? So maybe it's,

2263
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:52,760
maybe we're supposed to be in all this
shit and we're supposed to try to figure

2264
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:56,870
it out. You know, maybe the bad
motivates the good, you know?

2265
02:12:56,990 --> 02:13:01,280
I honestly believe that there's gotta be
some opposing forces in this world for

2266
02:13:01,281 --> 02:13:04,580
things to get done. It's not that
I necessarily want to see evil,

2267
02:13:04,581 --> 02:13:06,860
but I think there's a,

2268
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:10,440
there's definitely some sort of an
equation going on. There's good and bad.

2269
02:13:10,460 --> 02:13:14,790
You can look at movies. Movies always
have to have some kind of conflict always.

2270
02:13:14,870 --> 02:13:16,910
Otherwise, you're not going to
watch it. It's almost like we,

2271
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:22,420
that's how this all works is there's
going to be evil motherfuckers here and

2272
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:25,520
there's going to be good people.
Like what side do you want to play?

2273
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:28,670
And maybe you're not supposed
to try to fight the evil.

2274
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:32,130
Just try to survive around it. You know,
I gotta pee so bad. We have to end this.

2275
02:13:33,110 --> 02:13:37,980
Uh, but uh, tell me when again, as
the next Ebi so people can get it on.

2276
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:42,450
It's on UFC fight pass now. Yup. UFC
fight pass. The next you can watch, uh,

2277
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:45,870
the last, you know, Ebi one through 14.

2278
02:13:46,230 --> 02:13:50,010
I'm on the e a UFC fight
pass the next one. Ebi 15,

2279
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:54,900
the featherweights February 17th at
the muscle farm headquarters here in

2280
02:13:54,901 --> 02:13:59,870
Burbank. Um, Eddie Cummings, Geo
Martinez and also the combat Jujitsu.

2281
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:01,170
Uh,
the Ebi combat.

2282
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:05,190
You get to bantamweight title
fight between Nick Cohn's dean,

2283
02:14:05,191 --> 02:14:08,760
who is a current champion
and Ben Eddy Lo tiene master.

2284
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:12,510
The next fight companion we're
going to do is the 14th of January.

2285
02:14:12,511 --> 02:14:15,390
It looks like that looks like
the move 14th of January,

2286
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:18,150
unless another one comes up in between
now and then. Is there any of them,

2287
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,160
but that's a good one, right? Yeah,

2288
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:22,800
I think it's just the one on the 30th
of the next fight, so. All right.

2289
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:27,750
Thanks everybody. Thank you. Thank you,
Edna Bravo. Thank you young. Jamie,

2290
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:30,570
how long did we go.
