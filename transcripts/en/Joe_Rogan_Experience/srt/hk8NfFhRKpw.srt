00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,030
Stop now.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,710

send shit all out through your computer.

They send you a digital scale.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,290
You get to measure everything printed
up on the computer and then put the

19
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,010
stickers on it and leave
it out for the post.

20

Whoever thought it up is a fucking genius.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,480
It's the easiest way to have a business
and send shit to people without African.

Go without having to
go to the post office.

28
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,250
you don't want to do that and
they don't want you there either.

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,150
All right?

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,540
Figure that shit out
on your own bitch case.

31
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,870
Have a little laptop.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,920

Don't be.

37
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,100
Don't be measuring your weed on
it and incriminating yourself.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,820
People scrape and resin off euro.

39
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,000
You little scale there and

I love that.

45
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,040
That's what America loves.

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,030
No risk.

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,020
I want to be able just to shit,

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,213
get away with it.

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,313
Can you fix that?

50
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,320
Once they fixed bodies,

51
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,700
once they figured out how to fix bodies,

52
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,803
we're fucked.

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,711
It's everybody wants,

54
00:01:58,711 --> 00:01:59,730
everybody wants no risk.

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:00,810
Right?

56
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,570
You saw the guy with the two,

57
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,271
the two arms,

58
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,130
the the guy in the marines or whatever.

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,420
It got blown up in Afghanistan
and they put prosthetics.

60
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:09,720
No,

61
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,710
they put other someone else's arms on it.

62
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,330
Oh my God.

63
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:12,581
Wow.

64
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:15,390
And it was on the Chive and
I've just remember like,

65
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,973
wow,

66
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,010
hey,

67
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,831
there really is a god.

68
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,820
He's going to kill us for this.

69
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,380
This is not that we are
playing a fine line here.

70
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,620
I mean,

71
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:25,850
it,

72
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,760
it was awesome.

73
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,210
I mean,

74
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,043
the guy looked,

75
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,710
he was,

76
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,960
it looked like he had lost
his arms and now had new arms.

77
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:31,121
I mean,

78
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,850
he was just to fill the look
on his face was just like,

79
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,901
that's incredible.

80
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,350
Wow.

81
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,250
And they didn't really move.

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
They just twisted a little bit.

83
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,760
It's still not no risk.

84
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,870
It's still a big fucking world.

85
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,210
Everybody wants zero risk.

86
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:44,970
They don't want you to stitch
somebody else's arms on,

87
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,541
oh no,

88
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:45,751

89
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:45,991

90
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,201
no,

91
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:46,381
no,

92
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:46,570
no.

93
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,891
Don't,

94
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:47,071
don't,

95
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,230
don't take my arms off police.

96
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:49,980

of illegal shit online without really

106
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,481

to the lawyers office and
spend a lot of money and wait,

111
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,220
do it on their time.

112
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,180
You can do it in your underwear.

113
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,751
You could do,

114
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:16,991
like,

115
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,880
you could make yourself an LLC.

116
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,990
You can incorporate for
only $99 while naked.

117
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,490
You could do whatever you want.

118
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,040
Like no one can tell
you what the fuck to do.

119
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,730
All right?

120
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,020
You could do it slowly.

121
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,430
You can take your time,

122
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,390
but you can do a lot of shit that you
otherwise would have to go to the lawyers

123
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,050
for.

124
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,883

time and a lot of money.

127
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,310

136
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,873

137
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,970

140
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:56,920
Are you in the middle of one?

141
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,400
Yes.

142
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,641
Okay.

143
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,474
Let's say,

144
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,780
isn't it funny when it
seems like when you're,

145
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,070
when you're not married,

146
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,850
it seems like,

147
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,211
Oh yeah,

148
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,590
legal doom does divorce starting at two
99 got damn Shay who divorced for 299

149
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,300
bucks.

150
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,133
You're listening.

151
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,740
It's going to be easy online.

152
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,311
Yeah,

153
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,850
it's beautiful.

154
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,683
Do it online.

155
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,330
You know,

156
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,610
it's,

157
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,610
it's very unfortunate.

158
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,900
Divorce is very unfortunate,

159
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,990
but what's more unfortunate
is that marriage exists.

160
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,000
That's,

161
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,210
it's more than fortunate
with the more in French.

162
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,760
I for sure.

163
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,594
Don't get me wrong,

164
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,920
you absolutely,

165
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,700
women should be compensated when they
have children and I understand the idea of

166
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:31,271
alimony,

167
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,230
I get what's going on.

168
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,940
No one should suffer and yeah,

169
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,970
I get that totally 100% but at
what time do we just stop and go,

170
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:40,151
hey,

171
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:44,320
maybe it's not the best idea to just
get your finances all fucking tangled up

172
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:48,430
together where you want to break up
and you can't break up because all your

173
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,810
fucking credit cards and bank accounts
are together and your own the house

174
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,830
together or some crazy shit and you
absorb her student loans and now your

175
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,820
credit's fucked.

176
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,410
And she has to deal with the facts.

177
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,910
Your credit shit too because your car got
repossessed and together you're just a

178
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,780
fucking nightmare.

179
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,500
Then you have some,

180
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,080
some sort of lawyers that take
the extra third that they,

181
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,973
you know,

182
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,510
you,

183
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,550
we don't even end up with everything
with a lot less than you expected in the

184
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,001
first place.

185
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,834
Just paying other parties.

186
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,920
I've seen it.

187
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,820
I've seen it happen.

188
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:15,981
I'm,

189
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm happily married parents.

190
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,363
I got lucky.

191
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,293
Perfect example.

192
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,440
Oh it happens with everybody.

193
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:20,730
Yeah,

194
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,520
it's crazy.

195
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,350
People are fucking crazy.

196
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,100
Me included.

197
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,420
We're all fucking crazy.

198
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,290
And the idea that we can get locked
into some nutty contract that says,

199
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:29,471
all right,

200
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,131
I'm not going anywhere.

201
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:30,670
You go anywhere.

202
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,630
No sign here.

203
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,950
Sometimes it works.

204
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,800
But that one third thing is
the thing that Phil Hartman,

205
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,620
you still say,

206
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,370
yeah and this is a guy whose
wife wound up killing him.

207
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,190
This is what he used to
always say is it's not half,

208
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,030
it's,

209
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,700
it's two thirds because the
lawyer gets a fucking third.

210
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,740
Like he was,

211
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,250
he was sweating it hard.

212
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,120
Did she,

213
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,953
did she do that?

214
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,130
Just killed him in his sleep.

215
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:51,730
But I mean,

216
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,290
but I'm saying with the divorced or,

217
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,960
or would they still know they
were still married but you know,

218
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,030
there's all sorts of rumors
as to why she was upset,

219
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,230
but she was obviously,

220
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,610
she was fucked up on some,

221
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,520
she was on Zoloft and cocaine apparently.

222
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,354
Allegedly.

223
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,220
It's quite that mix.

224
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,530
Even I think they got a
payment from Zoloft for that.

225
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,750
I think the family got money for it.

226
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,510
It's the whole thing is so fucking sad.

227
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,150
My point is it's not like
that would have changed it.

228
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,510
That's,

229
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,970
that's a crazy person and drugs
and all sorts of other things.

230
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,140
That's not what I'm saying.

231
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,290
What I'm saying is that I just wish it
didn't have to be that people got crushed

232
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,081
like that.

233
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:31,490
I've watched dudes go down and
take a divorce hit that is like,

234
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,200
it just eats a year of your life
and they were miserable for a year.

235
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,530
Yeah.

236
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,250
It's so,

237
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,000
it's,

238
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,290
it's like any,

239
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,830
any like vicious separation like that.

240
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:44,870
It's hard enough just emotionally.

241
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,640
But then the tag into it,

242
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,930
the fucking battle that
people go through where they,

243
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,171
you know,

244
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:51,951
this fucking bitch,

245
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:52,731
she wants the house.

246
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,890
I'm not gonna fucking give it to you.

247
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:54,711
Ain't even like that house.

248
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,610
I don't give a fuck.

249
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,001
You know,

250
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,290
you see people get crazy.

251
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,281
Yeah.

252
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,120
What did he could've
just go his wife to zoom.

253
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,700
Kobe's wife took all three houses.

254
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,091
Did she?

255
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,710
I thought they got back
together in Newport coast.

256
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:04,090
That's what really,

257
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,551
I'm just saying,

258
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,520
it's just stuff that I've heard.

259
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,850
I don't like to talk about Colby.

260
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,270
Yeah.

261
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,103
Or his wife.

262
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:08,811
Fuck.

263
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,430
Do I know asshole.

264
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,870
Let me just get bullshit.

265
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,704
It's probably not him.

266
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,840
Coby got divorced on legal zoom.com.

267
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,920
Copy the shit.

268
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,660
Figured it out himself.

269
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,201
He's like,

270
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,034
just take,

271
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,553
um,

272
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,770
legal zoom.com,

273
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,370
uh,

274
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,390
can do a lot of shit though.

275
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,080
It's a suite.

276
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,700
It's a suite.

277
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,700
A alternative to going to a lawyer and
spending a lot of money just isn't,

278
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,450
it's not really necessary.

279
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,250
And if you're in over your head,

280
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,510
they'll also provide you a contact
with an independent attorney.

281
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
So if you're in the middle
of it and you're like,

282
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:40,581
you know what,

283
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm plugging panicking.

284
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,380
I think this is illegal.

285
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
I got to stop.

286
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,570
I'm with Ya.

287
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,470
I'm stupid too.

288
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,191
Okay.

289
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,380
If I had to go and do my own taxes,

290
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,480
who knows what the fuck I would have done?

291
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,070
Oh goodness.

292
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:52,850
It would be terrible.

293
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,750
It'd be a disaster.

294
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,310
I'm not designed for that shit.

295
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,460
You the code,

296
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,830
you use the codename Rogan and a in
the referral box and you can get more

297
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:01,370
savings.

298
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:01,971
It's a sweet,

299
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:02,660
sweet,

300
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,230
uh,

301
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,063
website.

302
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,030
If you're a in need of getting something
done and they just want to stress that

303
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,020
they're not a law firm.

304
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,580
They provide self help services
at your specific direction.

305
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,630
He use a codename Rogan.

306
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,670
We're also sponsored by on
at [inaudible] dot come.

307
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:21,500
That's o n n I t a human
optimization website.

308
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,550
We've got to get Ian Mccall,

309
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,301
some supplements.

310
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:23,840
Bitch.

311
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,700
I need some Alpha brain.

312
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,030
Can I get you some Alpha brain sign?

313
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,893
Have you ever tried it?

314
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,710
Ever take four during the show
and people go for what the fuck?

315
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,320
Yeah.

316
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,140
Horn take for don't be a pussy.

317
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,033
You're going to live forever.

318
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,810
Do you have any water for him?

319
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,200
Can we get him a lawn
or something like that?

320
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,890
You got a water stand
if you asked me to take,

321
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,240
I do understand,

322
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,290
but this is good for you.

323
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,124
I'm ready to take it.

324
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,850
We'll get you slides ready.

325
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,650
We'll have some delivered to you.

326
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,550
Um,

327
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,320
we also have a hemp force.

328
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,154
He would love that shit.

329
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Hemp protein powder.

330
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,740
It's fucking delicious.

331
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,920
Mccoffee man bulletproof.

332
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,370
I got,

333
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,203
yeah,

334
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,720
I got it.

335
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,970
I read something saying that
that could be bad for you,

336
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,980
that I could possibly give
you a heart attacks and shit.

337
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,910
Like people are like,

338
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,271
look at it.

339
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,440
All the butter in the,

340
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,131
in the,

341
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:05,520
um,

342
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
in the coffee and they're like,

343
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,231
hey man,

344
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,400
this is probably not so good.

345
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,610
But I think they're probably
discounting the difference.

346
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,620
And I wonder if they are between,

347
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,010
uh,

348
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,030
the body's absorption of grass
fed butter versus regular butter.

349
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,051
If you never,

350
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,520
you don't know what the
fuck we're talking about.

351
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,350
There's a guy named Dave Asprey,

352
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:27,351
this like super eclectic genius dude who
collects all sorts of information about

353
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,520
human optimization.

354
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,750
He's a freak for this stuff.

355
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,770
And uh,

356
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,970
he runs the bulletproof exec.com and he
came up with this idea for bulletproof

357
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:36,400
coffee.

358
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,650
It's fucking genius.

359
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,750
It's grass fed butter,

360
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,160
MCT oil,

361
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,590
which is medium triglyceride oral.

362
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
And is that what it's called?

363
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,363
Is that what is called,

364
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,510
what the fuck was on a blank?

365
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,330
Mct Oil medium something,

366
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,010
whatever the fuck it is.

367
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,963
I don't remember what it call,

368
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,390
look,

369
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,080
it's good for you.

370
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,830
You know what it is?

371
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,840
Mct Oil is coconut oil,

372
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,080
but what they do is they spin it in
a centrifuge and by spinning it in a

373
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:03,871
centrifuge,

374
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,190
they can take out the,

375
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
the most nutritious aspects of it.

376
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,710
Medium chain triglycerides
is what they're called.

377
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,323
And um,

378
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,970
all that together mixed with the coffee.

379
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,560
Somehow or another,

380
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:21,480
it has like a slow release effect
because you have all the calories with it

381
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,690
because you have the calories of the
butter and you cowers of that like really

382
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,840
rich MCT oil and it's a slower release
sort of coffee thing so that you don't

383
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,411
have like,

384
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:32,670
like that massive crash.

385
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,130
If you drink like black coffee
and you have an empty stumper,

386
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,420
do you just go for it?

387
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,040
Four shots before every training session.

388
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,510
Do you force shots?

389
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,800
Holy Shit Man.

390
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,630
Have you ever tried doing
it with bulletproof coffee?

391
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,811
No,

392
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:43,620
I'm just,

393
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,191
I'm literally,

394
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:44,910
it was before,

395
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,990
like when I was sitting in Brazil,

396
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,870
I was on the Internet trying
to buy it off of your,

397
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:49,231
off of,

398
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,970
on it that you would,

399
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,410
I think you would enjoy it man.

400
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,060
This is what we have
some of it right here.

401
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,860
Do we have any shit that,

402
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:57,790
I drink it all the time.

403
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,950
If you want to try it,

404
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,741
I'll try.

405
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:00,900
I say try up here.

406
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,973
I don't have cooties.

407
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,430
Try some of them just
don't stick your tongue.

408
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,950
We sell.

409
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,950
We sell a lot of shit
like that though at on it.

410
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,400
We do sell bulletproof coffee,

411
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,120
but we tried to sell the most nutritious
and interesting things that we can find

412
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,800
like killer bee honey that is delicious.

413
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,461
It's delicious.

414
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:15,690
Stevia to no sugar.

415
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,930
Um,

416
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,240
Himalayan salt,

417
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,190
which is an incredibly rich in minerals.

418
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,980
If you don't know about the
benefits of natural salt.

419
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,480
If you thinking about any of these things,

420
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,890
whether it's the new tropics,

421
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,540
I always urge people to Google it.

422
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,090
It's,

423
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,650
it's a very interesting and fascinating
subject and the subject of supplements

424
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:32,484
themselves.

425
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,720
There's a lot of data,

426
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,200
you know,

427
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,960
from a lot of people that
seem to suggest that people,

428
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,150
it's more important to have diet and that,

429
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:39,280
uh,

430
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,460
your diet is really where you
get all your nutrients from,

431
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,670
which I agree that the
body absorbs nutrients most
certainly better from a rich

432
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,720
diet and a healthy diet,

433
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,550
but it's also really good to supplement.

434
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,750
That's don't be crazy.

435
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,643
They're both good.

436
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,850
Healthy vitamins are good,

437
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,470
healthy nutrients are good
and healthy amounts of,

438
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,801
uh,

439
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,181
of,

440
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:00,550
of,

441
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,361
of vegetables,

442
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,470
green leafy vegetables.

443
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,640
That's shit so important.

444
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,720
Can't stress that enough.

445
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,800
I don't even sell vegetables,

446
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,851
but I always tell people,

447
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,840
you want to make your life better.

448
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,830
Eat more vegetables,

449
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,280
bitch.

450
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,710
You're eating fucking
cheeseburgers and empty food.

451
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,880
She eats perfect.

452
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,630
Yeah,

453
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,590
but no supplements.

454
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,210
And I'm trying to get
the responses by APS.

455
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:16,451
Hey,

456
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,620
as long as you eat perfect,

457
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,610
you don't need supplements.

458
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:19,361
Quite honestly,

459
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,960
I think there's certain supplements
that I would take regardless of my diet,

460
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,760
like shroom tech for uh,

461
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,000
for training or just things give
you extra energy or Melatonin.

462
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,834
If I wanted to sleep,

463
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,130
I would still take those things.

464
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,300
But I think that if you could eat like
just nothing but organic vegetables and

465
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,850
you're like all day and you,

466
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:37,570
you really ate healthy quantities of it,

467
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,950
you'd probably get enough nutrients.

468
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,160
You'll probably do if you really do.

469
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,170
I mean if you know the quantity,

470
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:44,351
yeah,

471
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:45,790
you'd have to eat massive quantities.

472
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,570
That's the thing.

473
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,350
Twice a day with me.

474
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,183
Yeah.

475
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,121
She's young though.

476
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:49,660
Look at her.

477
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,640
You're young and if I'm young,

478
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:52,451
people are vibrant,

479
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:53,320
they heal quicker.

480
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,150
My,

481
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,060
my daughter is three,

482
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:56,170
she's like Wolverine.

483
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,430
She gets a scratch.

484
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,720
It's gone by the end of the day.

485
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,820
They just suck up inside their body.

486
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,540
You know,

487
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,570
they're just growing that she
could eat cheeseburgers all day.

488
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,700
That's how young people
get away with shitty diets.

489
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,900
It's still amazing athletes.

490
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,050
You,

491
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,190
you give a hyper body and my daughter's
almost two and she literally,

492
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,150
I feel like she fall down a flight of
stairs and then five seconds later she's

493
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,170
doing jumping jacks and I'm like,

494
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:17,770
Oh wow,

495
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,603
nice.

496
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,121
Yeah,

497
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,600
totally.

498
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,820
They're going to have some supplements
one day that's going to be able to do

499
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,180
that.

500
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,490
You're going to be able to
rebound just like a little kid.

501
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,440
That's fucking for sure.

502
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:27,130
Common.

503
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,020
There's some crazy assholes right now,

504
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,720
just crack and all sorts of
things about the human body.

505
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,070
Back to Orange County.

506
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,933
Every man,

507
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,240
every 56 year old guys TRT that have is,

508
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,661
oh,

509
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:38,740
I had of his gills.

510
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,480
I saw one guy at out of this place
I eat all the time driving an Ra,

511
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:44,891
you know,

512
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,240
like totally had his head.

513
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,120
He thought he was on
point it at some point.

514
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,330
How sexy was he on a one to 10 for,

515
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,390
for a six year old man,

516
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:52,800
he was,

517
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,950
he was just about a 9.5 I saw a dude on
the beach that had to be 75 years old

518
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,480
and he was yoked.

519
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:58,790
Yeah.

520
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,351
And I should talk.

521
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,700
I'm 45 I'm 46 now.

522
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm on TRT,

523
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm on human growth hormone.

524
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,311
Let's take both of them.

525
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,020
So I take one like a little bit
less than one unit of growth a day.

526
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,831
And a,

527
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,930
I take a shot once a week of testosterone.

528
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,220
I used to do a cream,

529
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,480
but the creams,

530
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,220
like you gotta do it
every day and do a shot.

531
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,440
It's like once a week
and it's just a little,

532
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,480
it's just like too on a syringe,

533
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,380
whatever the fuck that is.

534
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,550
And it's not much for a week.

535
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,840
But if I don't,

536
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,980
I don't feel as good.

537
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,320
I try and get my dad on to
it because I know it'll,

538
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:26,570
it'll,

539
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,960
he's always fucking complaining about,

540
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,980
oh I'm 69 I'm old.

541
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:30,880
And like come on.

542
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,511
That's figured out.

543
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:31,991
He won't do it.

544
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,130
Cause he's an old surfer hippie,

545
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:37,150
but well it's becoming much more popular
and you see it all over the news,

546
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,680
testosterone replacement.

547
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,431
And people were like,

548
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:39,771
well what,

549
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:40,150
what's,

550
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,290
what about the negative benefits?

551
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,311
You know what?

552
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:42,670
The neck,

553
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:42,791
well,

554
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,630
there's a lot of negative benefits
on not using it that are undeniable,

555
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
like getting old.

556
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,261
All right?

557
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,770
So different effect on your body.

558
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,740
The reason why you're good old as your
body's not producing testosterone.

559
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,230
So you can be like proud and say,

560
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:54,430
well,

561
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,960
it's pseudo.

562
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,060
Just fucking go out in the
night like a cowboy or the,

563
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,260
you can just give you a
shot and then you're good.

564
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,520
Don't be stupid.

565
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,970
You know what do you want to not enjoy
your life as much when not have as much

566
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:05,750
energy.

567
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,350
Exactly.

568
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,260
You only have so long to live and
make those leaders those years better.

569
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,280
This is a message to buy on.

570
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,900
It is called get your shit together,

571
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:12,734
bitch.

572
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,810
That's the proposal.

573
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,801
Get your shit together,

574
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,280
bitch.

575
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,600
If you can get your
shit together at on it.

576
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,973
Some kettlebells,

577
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,873
battle ropes.

578
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,830
Just recover your life.

579
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,830
Get it together.

580
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,810
Drink some water fucker.

581
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,873
All right,

582
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,030
eat some good stuff.

583
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
Go to [inaudible] dot
com use the code name,

584
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,280
Rogan.

585
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,130
Save yourself 10% off
any and all supplements.

586
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,880
All right,

587
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,520
Ian Mccall's here we get official

588
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,833
experience.

589
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,203
Power

590
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,673
experience

591
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,260
in McCall.

592
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,031
Dude.

593
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,470
Thank you so much for doing this man.

594
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,320
Much requested by the underground forum.

595
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,100
Yes.

596
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,821
The UGC.

597
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,840
T T my,

598
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,943
my uh,

599
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,000
loyal followers.

600
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,090
Yeah.

601
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,200
What does that stand for?

602
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,600
The undergrad creepy top team

603
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:03,620
and,

604
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,960
and these,

605
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,511
these guys,

606
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,440
I've been there forever.

607
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,680
I've been on the underground
since 2002 or 2001 I think.

608
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,900
But they made this themselves,

609
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,610
they called themselves the UGC.

610
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,750
T t didn't make fun of other,

611
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,140
all the other top teams in the world
that that's why all the shirts have it on

612
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,230
it.

613
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,300
That's why we don't make money
off the shirts like that.

614
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:21,950
It's funny,

615
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,450
we just make it make enough to pay
for it and then we'd give away tons of

616
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:26,721
shirts.

617
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,554
I mean it's,

618
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,141
yeah,

619
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,870
that undergrounds kind
of mine if it's own,

620
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,290
yeah,

621
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,290
they could sway the opinion of,

622
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,561
of yeah,

623
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:34,910
the sport I think itself.

624
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,391
Yeah.

625
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:35,641
And it's,

626
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,660
it's funny how these things
sort of just sort of,

627
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,530
they just come out of nowhere on a forum
and then it becomes like a meme and

628
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,600
then it takes off like a,

629
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,940
like on the underground
it was always beep,

630
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
the homeowner detector like
Ted's and always have beef.

631
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,470
Like someone with some,

632
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,810
someone even this,

633
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,300
you could clearly see that some guys
with troll for beef but still like it's

634
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,130
very common if something happens,

635
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,020
some guy has his shirt off beep.

636
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,033
You know,

637
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,300
I had a long thread on the
underground for a while.

638
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,330
I don't know if you ever saw that.

639
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,460
What was it that the threat,

640
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,160
the threat of the,

641
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,130
the women that ever sleeping with no,

642
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,320
you had a thread with all the
women you were sleeping with.

643
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,810
I didn't go for it too.

644
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,201
Yeah.

645
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,640
That would seem like that
could get you in trouble.

646
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,960
I didn't know new today.

647
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,771
Oh No,

648
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:22,281
not yet.

649
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:22,641
But it was,

650
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:22,851
you know,

651
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:23,211
all the,

652
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:27,330
there was honestly it was a couple off
by a couple of hundred on there and it,

653
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,010
it was like a year long
and it just got ugly.

654
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,370
And then,

655
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,581
you know,

656
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:35,180
some people can be obviously complained
and threatened me and not make it on

657
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:35,301
there.

658
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,700
It's just there's stars over your parts.

659
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,440
And it was,

660
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,680
it was,

661
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,870
I am not that it probably feel like
it was a better idea at the time.

662
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,763
Yeah.

663
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,730
I thought it was,

664
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,270
I,

665
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,800
this was before I was in the UFC.

666
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,740
This is before I was,

667
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,210
it was a while ago.

668
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:51,601
And I just,

669
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:52,560
I just thought I was cool.

670
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,180
So that's really all,

671
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,340
I'm only good at the physical
things and everything else.

672
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,690
I suck cat fighting and,

673
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,440
and women.

674
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm all right at,

675
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,311
well,

676
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:03,510
the underground has produced some of
the most epic threads I've ever seen on

677
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,950
message boards.

678
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,660
Did you ever read the one with the,

679
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,111
the,

680
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,430
the guy who's the
undefeated prison fighter?

681
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,740
Oh my God.

682
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,300
Christian.

683
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,440
I believe his name is Christian Darrow.

684
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,371
And uh,

685
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,600
he went to jail.

686
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,463
Super thick white dude.

687
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:19,711
Yeah,

688
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:20,380
it was a big,

689
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,710
he's quite some of the lots of tattoos.

690
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,521
Yeah.

691
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,090
And he,

692
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,540
he wound up having a,

693
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,300
a fight with this,

694
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,134
um,

695
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,561
fuck.

696
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,660
What is his name change?

697
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,230
Like,

698
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,831
God dammit,

699
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:32,071
I gotta,

700
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:32,700
I gotta,

701
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,990
I gotta look up this guy's name,

702
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,040
the kid who fought them because the kid
who fought them had some skills and just

703
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,930
beat the shit out of this guy.

704
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,620
But it was,

705
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,800
it was weird watching it.

706
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:42,121
It was like,

707
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,680
cause this guy even trained and he
might've not even have ever trained.

708
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,110
He might just be a crazy guy who lied.

709
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,020
And he talked himself into a being
the toughest man on the pizza,

710
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,790
having an MMA fight when he
really had no fucking business.

711
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,990
Do they fight in prison?

712
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,730
James Funaro that's his name.

713
00:18:59,731 --> 00:18:59,851
No,

714
00:18:59,851 --> 00:18:59,911
no,

715
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,030
no.

716
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,110
They fought in a gym.

717
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,640
I have a video of it.

718
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,380
There's a video of it online.

719
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,030
I don't even need to shit on the dude,

720
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:06,864
but,

721
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,380
but sorry,

722
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,200
he's sorry.

723
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,233
Yeah,

724
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,191
come on now.

725
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:13,890
I don't even know how
we got onto the subject.

726
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,700
I'm,

727
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,300
cause I,

728
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
I totally forgot.

729
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:16,380
Oh,

730
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,213
epic threats.

731
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,280
So that's how I found out about this
thread was from the underground.

732
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,210
There's,

733
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,150
did you ever read the grow?

734
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,610
Look tried to lick my pooper.

735
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,930
Jesus Christ.

736
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,690
The thread is like a
billion fucking pages long.

737
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,940
It's like crazy.

738
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,200
There's some threads that I have like
subscribed that I'll check in on every

739
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,440
couple of months.

740
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,741
You know,

741
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,140
like they have a podcast thread and uh,

742
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:37,411
you know,

743
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,200
every now and then I'll,

744
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,290
I'll jump in and they have
a thread about the podcasts.

745
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,124
I'll jump in and said,

746
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,963
just hire.

747
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,710
Those are your people.

748
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,770
They're nice people that look this,

749
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,380
this,

750
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,110
the amount of cuts in the world is,

751
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,130
is pretty high.

752
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:50,850
I love that word.

753
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,360
And when people are free to be
whoever they are anonymously,

754
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:59,010
you're going to get a lot of cons because
that's the root of all animosity is

755
00:19:59,011 --> 00:19:59,850
cunty behavior.

756
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,650
I got trolled in Brazil and I would just
lost it on some guy cause he was just,

757
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,470
he just,

758
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,720
there's only one word he said,

759
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,650
but it just pissed me off.

760
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,203
It's constant,

761
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,601
but it's,

762
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,420
you know what it is that they're just
trying to have fun a lot of times by just

763
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:13,530
getting a rise out of you.

764
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,390
You've got to realize that and,

765
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,500
but it's also just,

766
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,570
it's not a natural way to communicate,

767
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,400
to not be in front of someone.

768
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,230
Like there's a lot of
things that you'd say,

769
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:23,700
an email he would never say in front.

770
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:23,970
Like,

771
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,803
that's my PSA.

772
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,621
I don't want to talk to you.

773
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,570
I'm just going to write your letters,

774
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,510
show you how to feel like bitch,

775
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:27,931
stop.

776
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:28,101
It will,

777
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:28,921
we'll just fucking letter.

778
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,760
Don't make me read.

779
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,450
Don't be a sissy.

780
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,160
Look at me and tell me what's going on.

781
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,650
Like you tell me what's the
problem and let's talk this out.

782
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,170
Because that's the best way to
communicate as looking at each other,

783
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,160
looking at each other and actually
saying what's on your mind.

784
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,480
You can't let things build up.

785
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,314
And yes,

786
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:43,831
she goes,

787
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,940
you're going to explode and end up,

788
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,730
you know,

789
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,680
doing something stupid.

790
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,471
Yeah.

791
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:50,140
And things can swing like left or right,

792
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:51,190
like good or bad,

793
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:55,000
depending on how you react to a moment
while you're in front of someone.

794
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,920
And a lot of times you would apologize,

795
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,431
you'd go,

796
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:57,641
look,

797
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,391
I shouldn't have said that.

798
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:58,511
Look,

799
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,560
I didn't mean it that way.

800
00:20:59,561 --> 00:20:59,981
Or look,

801
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:00,221
let's,

802
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:00,551
let's,

803
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,690
this is where I'm coming from.

804
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,130
I don't,

805
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,850
you know,

806
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,611
when you see that,

807
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:04,510
when you're looking at each other,

808
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,200
yeah.

809
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,580
But you write it down in an email,

810
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:11,581
you can just be completely self
indulgent and just filled with nonsense.

811
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,810
And you think just because someone
wrote it down like it makes it real.

812
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,390
Oh,

813
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,160
respect feelings and this and that,

814
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,270
blah blah blah.

815
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:19,841
Shut up.

816
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:20,674
You fucking,

817
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,611
you've ever posted.

818
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:24,100
Just don't have the balls to
say clickety clickety clack.

819
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:28,060
Clickety could stop talk
stupid text messages.

820
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,670
He broke up with me over text messages.

821
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,570
Well that's horrible,

822
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:34,060
but if you are in a
nightmare relationship,

823
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:35,320
it's probably a good move.

824
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,710
That's true.

825
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,950
Like why be around them anymore than
you'd have to just go watch and just pull

826
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:40,960
cord twoish hey,

827
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,231
I,

828
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:41,681
you know,

829
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,200
I've been thinking I got to
go and you're kind of crazy.

830
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,990
Yeah.

831
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,320
Unfortunately we've all run into crazy
people and they've all run into us,

832
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,023
so there you go.

833
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,810
I attracted crazy for 99% of my life.

834
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,100
She did my friend,

835
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,030
you're,

836
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,320
you're old school man.

837
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,830
We talking about fucking understand that
you're talking about Chris Brennan and

838
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,220
Jeremy Williams and
that's next generation,

839
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:06,580
right?

840
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,413
All those guys.

841
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,160
Old School I started,

842
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,491
they'd like,

843
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,860
oh Roy Mcdonald's started
training MMA and like,

844
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:12,730
so did I.

845
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:13,931
That's,

846
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:15,430
that's what I'm [inaudible] man.

847
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,100
He was like a early pioneer Jujitsu guy.

848
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,880
He was like one of the first guys
around La to get really fucking good.

849
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,480
He was sick and I mean it just,

850
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,850
words were nasty.

851
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,420
Yeah.

852
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,130
He had a gang of setups to,

853
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,640
yeah,

854
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,421
a bunch of it and that,

855
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:28,840
that's that.

856
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,620
That was my,

857
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,580
that's what I took from him.

858
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,620
That was most of my game.

859
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,310
Yeah.

860
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,240
He's a tough dude,

861
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:34,750
man.

862
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,980
Really Good Jujitsu.

863
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,750
A lot of people slept on his Jujitsu
and then he went over to Japan,

864
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,960
but it was almost like on the
tail end of his competing,

865
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,411
you know,

866
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:45,640
when he was over in Japan.

867
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,271
Yeah.

868
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:50,350
He wasn't able to really
showcases how good he really was.

869
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,020
You have a bunch of epic
fights with Pat Miletich.

870
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,490
Um,

871
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:54,850
I know.

872
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,091
I mean,

873
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:56,380
didn't they have two fights?

874
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,430
They have two fights.

875
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,403
A fun,

876
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,501
was it UFC?

877
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:03,760
I remember he slept Joe Stevenson
and UFC when Joe was like 16.

878
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,251
Oh yeah.

879
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:05,050
Any held onto it.

880
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,460
The triangle for too long,

881
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,600
but that's the only kind of
knock out Antonio mucky too.

882
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,770
I was there.

883
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:12,670
That was bad.

884
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,540
Ooh,

885
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,740
that was the national check.

886
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,933
Nasty kick.

887
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,660
Chris Bannon was a bad mother fucker.

888
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:17,910
Yeah,

889
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,070
he's,

890
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,191
well,

891
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,900
he's doing Jujitsu in Dallas down,

892
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,170
right?

893
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:20,620
Yeah,

894
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,011
exactly.

895
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:21,970
He's out living out in Dallas.

896
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:22,091
He,

897
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:22,211
you know,

898
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,380
he just wanted a change of scenery,

899
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:24,810
so he took it off and
that was good for him.

900
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,530
Then I left for him.

901
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,540
That's a beautiful thing about having,

902
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:28,871
you know,

903
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,561
reputation,

904
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,340
having a name.

905
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,481
Yeah.

906
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:30,701
You know,

907
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,110
in martial arts world like he does,

908
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,300
you could just start up a place
places and people would be like,

909
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,740
hey fucking Chris Bray and just
moved into town and that guys,

910
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:37,630
this is awesome man.

911
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:37,931
I mean,

912
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,130
he is a very,

913
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,150
very smart businessman.

914
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,710
Could you Jitsu Guy?

915
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,370
It's nasty fucking ears though.

916
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,690
Okay.

917
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,650
You [inaudible] son,

918
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
he's got some crazy

919
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,330
while lead Ishmael type.

920
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:47,960
He years.

921
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,060
He knows he's not the most
attractive man in the world,

922
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:50,751
but ABC,

923
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,530
his wife,

924
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,820
she's a beautiful creature.

925
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,320
I'm sure he's a tough dude.

926
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,240
I liked that guy too.

927
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,113
It's nice guy.

928
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,590
He was trained with Gerald Street.

929
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:57,741
Ben,

930
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,371
who's a buddy of mine.

931
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:58,640
Yeah,

932
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,473
I know Gerald.

933
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,360
Gerald.

934
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,830
A lot of dudes and just old school people.

935
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:04,041
Man.

936
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,060
How did you start finding,

937
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,403
um,

938
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,850
I liked fist fighting.

939
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,190
I mean that was me and my
boys thing in high school.

940
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,270
We all,

941
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,800
we wanted to fist fight
and it wasn't like,

942
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:13,021
and we,

943
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:13,161
you know,

944
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,010
we were in this stupid little gang
that the cops called this a gang,

945
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:18,050
but we were just a bunch of rich
white kids who like the fist fight.

946
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,320
And I mean we're talking
out of my friends,

947
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:22,430
let's say 20 of us,

948
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,420
18 of us trained and
10 of US had profiles.

949
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,460
We're talking to myself.

950
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:28,761
Shamed.

951
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,600
That was Oreo.

952
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,710
Robert Emerson,

953
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,750
Josh Smith.

954
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,583
Oh my God.

955
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,430
You guys all went out looking for fine.

956
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,420
Justin Levins.

957
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,210
Um,

958
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,043
she said,

959
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,880
imagine,

960
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,300
imagine.

961
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Yeah,

962
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,270
we pulled the parties and
just push over a lantern.

963
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,871
I would,

964
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:43,430
because I was the smallest
one and all right,

965
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:43,701
go,

966
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:43,941
you know,

967
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,070
hit on someone's girlfriend or
to go steal cds or something.

968
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,330
And then some big jock would be like,

969
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:48,164
what's up?

970
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,540
And then of course I'm
not the guy to hide.

971
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,670
I want to jump in front
and talk some shit like,

972
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,533
Hey,

973
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,590
yeah,

974
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,510
and then they just kind of see it,

975
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,810
everybody behind me and kind of go,

976
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:57,770
ah,

977
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,070
no.

978
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,251
Okay.

979
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:00,500
Then all of a sudden I'm getting
what you want to be that guy.

980
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,161
I was,

981
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:01,611
I dunno,

982
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,301
I had something to prove.

983
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,310
I was tiny and I liked fist fighting.

984
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:05,144
It wasn't like I wanted to,

985
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:05,983
you know,

986
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,920
drop somebody.

987
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,640
You weren't even thinking that you were
like disturbing people's private lives

988
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,730
and interfere.

989
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,320
No,

990
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,410
I understood that I was,

991
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,780
that was a dick when I was a kid.

992
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:15,860
I was a horrible child.

993
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,910
I literally was.

994
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,100
I spent most of my life being a
horrible person doing a whore.

995
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,570
What made you realize that you were,

996
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,363
that was a bad person.

997
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,540
20 some odd years of doing bad stuff and
then just just trying to pull out of it

998
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:31,550
and constantly falling back into it.

999
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,390
Trying to pull out of it,

1000
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,290
falling back into it.

1001
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,420
And now I have a kid and now I have a,

1002
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:39,860
for once in my life I have a positive
female influence as far as dating goes.

1003
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,150
And I mean it,

1004
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,200
it helps me,

1005
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,531
you know,

1006
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,150
I don't,

1007
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,150
I've literally done everything possible
I think a fucking psychopath would want

1008
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:49,064
to do,

1009
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,750
but I've done just about everything,

1010
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,171
you know,

1011
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:52,490
I can't really think of besides,

1012
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,030
um,

1013
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,301
you know,

1014
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,440
having a man to enter me.

1015
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,290
I've done it as young.

1016
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:57,591
Yeah.

1017
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,230
You know,

1018
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,063
you did.

1019
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,160
But it,

1020
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm just saying it and I've just,

1021
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,060
you know,

1022
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,990
now I've got a kid in a career and I'm
just trying to settle down and be a good

1023
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:06,440
boy.

1024
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah.

1025
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,520
You're,

1026
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,520
it's kind of a wild past for a dude who's
like a top level professional athlete.

1027
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,710
If people listening to
this on the podcast,

1028
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,520
you know,

1029
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,960
without getting to know you better,

1030
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:18,201
I'm like,

1031
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,250
what the fuck is this guy?

1032
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,290
I was one of the best
flyweights on the planet.

1033
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,060
I mean I'm the best

1034
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,770
look dudes may on any given night in,

1035
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,800
in the world of high level
of mixed martial arts,

1036
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
anybody can beat anybody.

1037
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,840
And I thought you'd be Dj in the
first fight and then you guys,

1038
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,970
well this is I think,

1039
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,160
and correct me if you disagree.

1040
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,290
I think that there has to be,

1041
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,800
uh,

1042
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:43,980
an

1043
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,460
element of the fight where when one
person is like doing something like really

1044
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,610
dominant to the other person
that's got to count for more.

1045
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,061
Yeah.

1046
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:52,740
Like when a guy's got a guy's back,

1047
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,360
like he had his backend pounded on them,

1048
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,950
that's got to count for more
than just winning around all,

1049
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,200
you know,

1050
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,033
barely.

1051
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Like if a guy wins around
with like strikes and 10
more strikes be more strikes

1052
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:08,130
or the next guy gets into
a really good position,

1053
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,450
it does significant damage.

1054
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,050
That's not,

1055
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,310
it's not the same point.

1056
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,360
It's a different,

1057
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,760
it doesn't make sense to
me the way things are now.

1058
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,601
I think that,

1059
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,290
um,

1060
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,600
you do know doc Hamilton's I'd go,

1061
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:18,050
yeah.

1062
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,883
Do you like that idea?

1063
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,990
It's a half point idea.

1064
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:20,090
Yeah.

1065
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,800
I like that.

1066
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,301
Did actually,

1067
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:21,730
it makes,

1068
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,650
I mean it just,

1069
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:22,811
it,

1070
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:23,644
it,

1071
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,630
it sounds nice,

1072
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:27,000
but we have people that
have no business judging,

1073
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:29,160
judging flies and then
like literally let's,

1074
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,740
let's say if I would have won that fight,

1075
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,161
my,

1076
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:37,161
I wouldn't have gone into some just
horrible spiral out of control for the,

1077
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,880
the next year of my UFC career,

1078
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,590
right after written my very first fight,

1079
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,131
you know,

1080
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:43,770
back to just being stupid and
doing horrible things to myself.

1081
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
Do you think you would have done that?

1082
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,080
No.

1083
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,140
No.

1084
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,973
That's what I did.

1085
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,700
How you did after that.

1086
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,180
That's why I DJ kicked
my ass a second time.

1087
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:51,991
That's why Joe,

1088
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,060
I didn't do anything
to Joe when I could've,

1089
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,440
I mean I should have done a lot better.

1090
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,810
Both guys said I could have
finished them and then I just,

1091
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:58,590
I just,

1092
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,170
I had to just a mental bad marriage.

1093
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:01,411
It's all,

1094
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:01,651
it was,

1095
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:04,230
I don't want to get into it
right now just in a bad place.

1096
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,550
It was a really bad place and it wasn't
performing and we are all top level

1097
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,384
athletes,

1098
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,460
but I know I'm better than these guys.

1099
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,230
It's just they were better that night.

1100
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:14,970
They're better performers
at at this point in time.

1101
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:18,690
Mentally it's what it comes down to
is the mental aspect and you know,

1102
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,330
I'll get back now I'm happy and
then I'm finally in a good place.

1103
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,500
I think against Joe,

1104
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:23,340
I was getting there,

1105
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,610
but I wasn't quite there yet.

1106
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,410
I mean physically I'll always be there,

1107
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,250
you know?

1108
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,840
But it's just for me mentally,

1109
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,060
even this last fight I did great,

1110
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:33,871
you know?

1111
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:37,410
But I think I still have steps to
get back to where I know I can't be,

1112
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,610
like when it became world champion,

1113
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,560
it was just,

1114
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,393
it just,

1115
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,443
it was just better.

1116
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,960
You know?

1117
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,290
I was just training harder and
longer and faster and everything.

1118
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,650
I mean,

1119
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,030
now I'm technically better I think,

1120
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,430
but it's just getting my
head betters is still,

1121
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,211
it's still a process,

1122
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:51,840
but I'm,

1123
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,350
I'm,

1124
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,220
I'm almost there,

1125
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:53,670
I guess.

1126
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,231
So you,

1127
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:56,190
you feel like you're a work in progress?

1128
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,700
Of course.

1129
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,240
Always.

1130
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,750
Always.

1131
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,490
Yeah.

1132
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,310
Do you feel like all this
shit that's happened to you?

1133
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:02,600
All this craziness in your life,

1134
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:03,650
the mistakes that you've made,

1135
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,700
like in some ways surviving
as many mistakes as you have,

1136
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,940
like really creates a very fascinating
person because the type of person has as

1137
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:14,510
many experiences as you.

1138
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,260
It's a very,

1139
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,440
uh,

1140
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,771
it's a,

1141
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:19,100
it's a magnetic thing to be around cause
most people haven't had as many crazy

1142
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:21,740
fucked up life experiences and have been,

1143
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:21,921
you know,

1144
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,720
professional cage
fighters at the same time.

1145
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,620
I,

1146
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,410
and now I'm trying to do now
becoming a better person for once.

1147
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:28,670
I'm trying to be that better person.

1148
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm trying to just show people like,

1149
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,301
this is what,

1150
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,081
this is what I've done.

1151
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:37,250
I'm a walking example of what not to do
because most likely you're not going to

1152
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:38,840
get back to where I am.

1153
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,410
You know,

1154
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,951
almost like a,

1155
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:42,010
you're either going to
become just a human being

1156
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,600
or you're going to die,

1157
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,141
you know,

1158
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,180
like calm down.

1159
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,690
Yeah.

1160
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,800
Or you're going to die.

1161
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah.

1162
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,890
And then you figure it out on
your own or you're on a bad path.

1163
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,780
And I think that for some reason I'm,

1164
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:53,614
I'm able to,

1165
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,250
I,

1166
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,560
I've been able to do to do that and make,

1167
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,940
get back to greatness and try and do
something that no one really ever gets to

1168
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:01,121
do.

1169
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,230
And that's fight in the octagon.

1170
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:02,401
You know,

1171
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,360
they're very few percentage of people
in the world that actually kept,

1172
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,171
will ever be able to do this.

1173
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:05,760
Right.

1174
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,250
So especially at your weight class man.

1175
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah.

1176
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,060
You know,

1177
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,170
that's really fucking technical way class.

1178
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,470
That Dj,

1179
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,480
he keeps getting better to everywhere.

1180
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,710
Every time he fights.

1181
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:18,100
Man.

1182
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,700
His uh,

1183
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,530
last fight with Morocco was incredible.

1184
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,220
Yeah.

1185
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,760
He's so good at like changing
where the fight takes place,

1186
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,800
whether it's taking you down,

1187
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,450
kicking you and you think
he's going to punch you,

1188
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:28,930
punch you,

1189
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,800
is going to kick you.

1190
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,023
And he's,

1191
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,050
he is ever evolving.

1192
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,130
I make fun of him a lot.

1193
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,280
I do because he can't help because yeah,

1194
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:35,471
he,

1195
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:35,711
yeah,

1196
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:36,101
exactly.

1197
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,520
I got a,

1198
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,160
I got a chip on my shoulder because I
thought I beat him and then he beat me up

1199
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:40,780
and plus I think he's a nerd.

1200
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,351
But,

1201
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:41,650
um,

1202
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,850
but he's just such a nice guy.

1203
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:44,010
But something wrong with being a nerd.

1204
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,250
No,

1205
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,501
nothing,

1206
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,130
aren't being retired.

1207
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,230
I just can't make fun of him
because he beat me up on time.

1208
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,820
Right.

1209
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Just let me do that.

1210
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,030
But now he,

1211
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,110
he's the guy is,

1212
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,920
he's at first people gave him so much
guff because he just wasn't performing.

1213
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,000
But now he's getting better.

1214
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:58,890
He's getting to the point where he,

1215
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,130
the strides he's making are making
it actually exciting and they,

1216
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,340
the adoring public is actually,

1217
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:03,850
uh,

1218
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,670
not being such a Douche bags that are
learning the sport and realizing that

1219
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:06,860
that's,

1220
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,900
that's art right there.

1221
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,441
You know,

1222
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:08,681
he's,

1223
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,180
he's painting a fucking masterpiece,

1224
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,670
you know,

1225
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,920
especially compared to these big guys.

1226
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,050
Not to say that anything against big guys,

1227
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:16,810
but we're doing a lot more than they are.

1228
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:17,741
Yeah.

1229
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,010
It's,

1230
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,251
well,

1231
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,750
it's definitely a different game.

1232
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,330
The,

1233
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,760
the pace is faster.

1234
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,230
It's more technical.

1235
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,790
There's very little room for error.

1236
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,110
Yeah.

1237
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,390
You know,

1238
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,380
like he called Moraga and that gear team,

1239
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,540
there was no room.

1240
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,374
It's just like,

1241
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,400
just snatched it up.

1242
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,301
You know?

1243
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:31,631
It's,

1244
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:31,860
uh,

1245
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,450
it's really kind of an interesting
difference between watching the,

1246
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,330
the smallest way class and watching the
largest way cross the room for error.

1247
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,350
It's incredible.

1248
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,400
The guy becomes a lot bigger.

1249
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,263
Oh my God.

1250
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,640
I mean if we've never seen a
heavyweight that moves like,

1251
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,160
like a flyweight says it.

1252
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,290
He says it doesn't exist.

1253
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:50,620
No,

1254
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,840
it's a completely different
experience watching the,

1255
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,920
the lighter weight classes.

1256
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,750
It's like you guys are like hummingbirds,

1257
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,700
you're like a moving
at such a faster pace.

1258
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,983
You know,

1259
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,820
it's,

1260
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,200
it's hard.

1261
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,060
I mean even just to fight at that pace.

1262
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,600
I mean you gotta be on point
because if you're one step behind,

1263
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:09,370
I mean it's just a constant pop,

1264
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:09,551
pop,

1265
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:09,701
pop,

1266
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:09,881
pop,

1267
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:10,061
pop,

1268
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:10,350
pop.

1269
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,440
Just like each kid got caught by
my Raga big time that fourth round.

1270
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,670
It's a perfect example of that.

1271
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:18,130
I mean Dj was not getting hit by anything.

1272
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:19,870
He was just moving like a ghost.

1273
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,830
He was in and out.

1274
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:22,390
And when you thought he was coming in,

1275
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:23,051
he was coming out.

1276
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:23,221
I mean,

1277
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:24,310
it was a beautiful performance.

1278
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,240
And then boom,

1279
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,111
he hits hard.

1280
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:26,681
He hits hard,

1281
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:27,130
you know,

1282
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,641
he gets hard.

1283
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:32,140
But even the point is like [inaudible]
anytime it can come anytime a big one

1284
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:32,830
point clip you,

1285
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,220
yeah.

1286
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,690
That's the craziest thing about the sport,

1287
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,200
isn't it?

1288
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,730
Yeah.

1289
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,150
This is really nothing like that.

1290
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,480
It's so rare and boxing for things to
around out of nowhere with one shot.

1291
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,920
It doesn't happen that often.

1292
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,730
Like later,

1293
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,001
you know,

1294
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,280
in a fight when you see it in,

1295
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,061
in MMA,

1296
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:49,460
that it can happen at any
moment with those little gloves.

1297
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:49,971
Yeah.

1298
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:50,721
It just slips right through.

1299
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:50,790
The,

1300
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,300
I of people really don't
get is that defense.

1301
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Even having your defense has to be
perfect because those little gloves fit

1302
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,340
through the smallest holes and they make,

1303
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:01,880
they make,

1304
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,650
they make those holes bigger.

1305
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,920
It's not just like a boxing glove where
it's a blunt object that's just going to

1306
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,000
expand and on impact,

1307
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,450
you know?

1308
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,721
Yeah.

1309
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,330
There's much less give
the slide through things,

1310
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,980
especially in they get all greased up,

1311
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,670
sweaty up like the Todd Duffy,

1312
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,160
Mike Russell fight is a
fight that I always point to.

1313
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,540
If you never saw that fight,

1314
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:24,210
if you've never seen that fight is one
of like it's a historical MMA fight.

1315
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:24,560
Yeah.

1316
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,150
They played that for young fighters.

1317
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,691
They go,

1318
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:27,710
this is what can happen.

1319
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,230
This guy motherfucker looks like superman,

1320
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,064
three rounds,

1321
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,740
three rounds of horrific beating.

1322
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,574
Broke his arm.

1323
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,210
Yeah.

1324
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,210
Russell had a broken arm and then at an
with no hint whatsoever that that it was

1325
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:42,650
going to take place before this.

1326
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,020
It wasn't like he had tagged
them a couple of times.

1327
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,910
It looked like he had them
stagger it a few times.

1328
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:47,810
Like he's coming back,

1329
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,730
he's getting just destroyed and plus
it's Duffy is a physical specimen.

1330
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,190
That guy's huge and and Mike not so much.

1331
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,740
Yeah.

1332
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,320
Mike is,

1333
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
looks like what he has is a Chicago cop.

1334
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,750
Excises a tough fucking guy.

1335
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,521
No doubt about it.

1336
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:04,221
It's super tough.

1337
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,054
Fucking guy.

1338
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,570
But that punch was like
one of the quickest turn.

1339
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,750
It was out of nowhere.

1340
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,020
Yeah.

1341
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,730
It turned the whole fight or out bang.

1342
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:11,450
He had him hurting.

1343
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:11,781
Boom.

1344
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,940
He was out like what the hell?

1345
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,620
Like how is that even possible?

1346
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,263
I mean,

1347
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,580
especially at that weight,

1348
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,420
you know when you have,

1349
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,420
when you have two guys that are 250
pounds hitting each other that hard.

1350
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,111
I mean that,

1351
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:28,520
that is frightening.

1352
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,040
And I see where the heavy weight,

1353
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:31,260
you know,

1354
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,881
my roommate,

1355
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:36,881
she ended up Rosario to see him move and
he's fast and it hasn't been able to,

1356
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:37,550
you know,

1357
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,590
to really show how good he really is.

1358
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,281
But man,

1359
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,300
that guy can move and it's,

1360
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:41,811
I mean it is,

1361
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:42,790
it scares the crap out of him.

1362
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,000
He can hold pads for me.

1363
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,070
That's how fast he is.

1364
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,820
Wow.

1365
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,653
And I mean I,

1366
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,770
I'll go for 30 minutes
straight by la La la La la.

1367
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,540
Yeah.

1368
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,680
He moves really well and he's set that
weight of heavyweight where there's like

1369
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,180
a point of diminishing returns.

1370
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,220
A lot of people believe
there's an argument about it.

1371
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:01,700
It was,

1372
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,100
and that argument is about like two 40
that are like anything bigger than are

1373
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:06,110
like Cain Velasquez.

1374
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,090
You get tired too easy.

1375
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:07,400
Yeah,

1376
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,950
exactly.

1377
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,390
You know,

1378
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,080
but you know,

1379
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,261
then,

1380
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:10,340
but then for a while there,

1381
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:10,821
it was like,

1382
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:14,240
people thought it was like when Brock
Lesnar like first burst on the scene,

1383
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:14,571
people are like,

1384
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,231
Oh shit,

1385
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:16,610
you got to get way bigger mat.

1386
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,050
That's what frank wait,

1387
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,830
Geiger,

1388
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,510
Shane Carwyn got way bigger.

1389
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,010
Those dudes got way bigger.

1390
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:22,310
They're like,

1391
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,340
fuck that dude is,

1392
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,280
that's your game.

1393
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,210
If you're game is,

1394
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,110
you know,

1395
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,720
Tuck your face in between your
shoulders and plow forward.

1396
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,460
If that's your game and
you better be built,

1397
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:32,640
like that guy shines.

1398
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:33,800
Just hulk smash people.

1399
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,753
Yeah.

1400
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,181
I don't know,

1401
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:35,750
man.

1402
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,680
It doesn't work out so well.

1403
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,290
Yeah.

1404
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,350
It's when you watch a fight
like Carwyn versus less than,

1405
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,120
which is at an all time classic fight.

1406
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,400
But you see how quick Carlin gasses out,

1407
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,110
like to the point where he's dead.

1408
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,770
It's like one round within run.

1409
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,660
It's like you,

1410
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:48,841
well,

1411
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:49,250
first of all,

1412
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,620
I think he said it was also that he
was so fired up so much adrenaline.

1413
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:53,310
He couldn't believe.

1414
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,350
He thought he was winning and
thought the fight was over.

1415
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,730
I thought it was gonna
win the fight right there.

1416
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,500
And he was beating on him for a long time.

1417
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:58,891
So I mean,

1418
00:35:58,891 --> 00:35:59,131
that's,

1419
00:35:59,131 --> 00:35:59,360
that's,

1420
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,180
that's going to take,

1421
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,050
not just 10 seconds.

1422
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:01,751
If I thought I wanted,

1423
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:02,584
it was

1424
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,321
a couple of minutes of,

1425
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,040
I thought I won.

1426
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,910
And he was sprinting.

1427
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,570
You mean it was two minutes of sprinting
and literally after it was over,

1428
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,530
Brock survived that.

1429
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,370
He was done.

1430
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,170
Like he couldn't even
get up out of his stool.

1431
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,480
I was like his whole body
like completely shut down.

1432
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,620
It was crazy to watch.

1433
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,340
Yeah,

1434
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,960
but you will watch a body like that.

1435
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,040
That's when you go,

1436
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,210
okay.

1437
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,110
How big is too big?

1438
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,291
Yeah.

1439
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,310
Cause that might be too big.

1440
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,180
Like you got to,

1441
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,500
someone's got to figure this out.

1442
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,030
Like scientifically.

1443
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,181
Yeah.

1444
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:27,811
We got to figure it out.

1445
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,644
What it's,

1446
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,630
I don't know anything about crossfit,

1447
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,523
but my,

1448
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,580
my roommate and he runs RV sport for
Ruca and he went to go sponsors guys and

1449
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:36,690
talked to some people and watch it.

1450
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,160
And I always thought,

1451
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:38,341
Gosh,

1452
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:39,120
you guys are douchebags.

1453
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,140
I don't know.

1454
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,550
I just always hear him
yelling and screaming.

1455
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,210
I hate her.

1456
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,631
He's like,

1457
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:42,790
no,

1458
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,040
did,

1459
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,771
they're really positive.

1460
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:44,604
They're cool guys.

1461
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,241
And the,

1462
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:45,580
the,

1463
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,780
uh,

1464
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,190
apparently like the perfect way for them.

1465
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,510
It's like one 85,

1466
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:50,070
200 pounds for what they do.

1467
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:50,700
And that's,

1468
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,533
which is,

1469
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,500
I don't even really know what they
should do a bit way it was Christ.

1470
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,530
It's just stupid way.

1471
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:55,890
I mean,

1472
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,090
I don't see stupid like dumb.

1473
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:57,910
I mean like,

1474
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,190
like Holy Shit.

1475
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,181
I've seen this,

1476
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:04,080
a little guy who was like 165 pounds
and he was doing cleans with a,

1477
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,490
I think it was cleans with
120 pound kettle bell.

1478
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:09,720
He was still,

1479
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,380
he was not a big guy and he's doing this
clean press over and over again with

1480
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:13,840
this.

1481
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,360
It was more than a
hundred pound kettle bell.

1482
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,141
It's ridiculous.

1483
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:16,951
Whatever the fuck it was.

1484
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:17,250
Yeah.

1485
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,540
And he was doing it for Reps.

1486
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:18,991
I was like,

1487
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,070
this is incredible.

1488
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,943
I can,

1489
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,013
we've got a 200,

1490
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,490
we have multiple stones.

1491
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,920
We got 125 pounds stone at uh,

1492
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,210
at my strength conditioning place.

1493
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:27,960
God Damn,

1494
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,490
you know,

1495
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,120
roll it up on my legs and I can pop pop.

1496
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:30,931
But it's just a stone.

1497
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,291
It's just,

1498
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:31,680
that's something,

1499
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,940
that's where I get my suplexes from.

1500
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,310
But I would think it probably
would help you a lot,

1501
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:35,670
man.

1502
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,271
But I mean I can,

1503
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,400
I can get out the two.

1504
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,190
I think it's two 52 40 I can get
that up and do it maybe five times.

1505
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:41,701
But I mean it's,

1506
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:42,330
it's,

1507
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,570
it's getting it out onto
your lap is the hardest part.

1508
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,640
I can explode probably
400 pounds off my hips.

1509
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,290
I mean that's a professional athlete.

1510
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:53,130
Isn't it fascinating to see like how much
things have changed as far as like the

1511
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:54,630
way they train athletes,

1512
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,430
some of the ideas behind it.

1513
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,601
If you go back,

1514
00:37:57,601 --> 00:38:01,890
like if you're a student of the game and
you go back just like 2030 years like

1515
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,620
these like Angela Dundee's until
fighters and not lift weights.

1516
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah.

1517
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,020
They said tell him that a lot.

1518
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,070
A lot of weights and it
was going to slow you down.

1519
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,520
Yeah,

1520
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:08,740
they,

1521
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:08,911
they,

1522
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:09,330
they couldn't,

1523
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:09,840
they just didn't,

1524
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,470
they just,

1525
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,980
they didn't know.

1526
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,471
They didn't understand.

1527
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:11,940
They didn't know.

1528
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,720
Well it does slow you down in that if
you lift weights and you're sore the next

1529
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,553
day you're going to be slower.

1530
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,590
And then the coach was like,

1531
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,540
God slowing you down.

1532
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,190
But then Mackey shields stone comes along
and trains Evander Holyfield to go up

1533
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:23,701
to heavyweight.

1534
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,180
Yeah.

1535
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,140
And all of a sudden heavy.

1536
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:26,910
He's like a real heavyweight.

1537
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,340
He was like two oh five
or something like that.

1538
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:30,330
Like not too big,

1539
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,280
but he was big enough and he was,

1540
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,680
he got fucking

1541
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,300
Oh,

1542
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,531
oh my God.

1543
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:41,750
Was He Jack 40 holy film.

1544
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,230
How old was he when he
went up to heavyweight?

1545
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,280
He started out as a cruiserweight.

1546
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,541
Right.

1547
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,820
Cause he fought Dwight Kawai.

1548
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,390
That was like a one 95 right.

1549
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,224
That's cruiserweight.

1550
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,030
And then when he went up to heavyweight,

1551
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,940
was it Mackey shields don't work with him?

1552
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:55,271
It did.

1553
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:55,600
Right.

1554
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,470
Cause he worked with,

1555
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,510
he worked with Spinks,

1556
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:58,930
right?

1557
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,320
Yeah.

1558
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,010
He worked with Michael Spinks when he
was bulking Spinks up to be a heavyweight

1559
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,690
to fight Tyson and Larry Holmes.

1560
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,460
That was when he burst into the scene.

1561
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,620
He was like one of those first
guys that was [inaudible].

1562
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,120
They were realizing back in the day,

1563
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,880
like we got to do things a little
different here we can just do curls,

1564
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,260
which yes,

1565
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,840
that guys in San Clemente and I,

1566
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:17,470
and I've never had a run in with him,

1567
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,210
but all my friends have
and all my coaches,

1568
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:19,440
I did,

1569
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,870
he ate.

1570
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,200
Apparently he's just very set
in his ways I guess we'll say.

1571
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,030
But I'm in that he was an originator of,

1572
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,650
of so much crazy stuff.

1573
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:27,484
And we look at the sun.

1574
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,170
I mean that didn't turn
out like it should have.

1575
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,720
Well I was under a tremendous of,

1576
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:33,160
for people who don't know the whole store,

1577
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:35,350
I don't know his son's name
cause I'm not a football fan.

1578
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:36,184
What does this on the name?

1579
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,000
Todd Todd.

1580
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,540
Todd Todd and uh,

1581
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,290
there's a good documentary on it and
Marinovich is like a cow racy strength and

1582
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:44,801
fitness guy.

1583
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,550
And he's the guy who got Bj Penn
in the best shape of his life ever.

1584
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,050
When Bj fan fought Diego Sanchez
and when he fought Sean Penn,

1585
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,290
I think those are the two times Sean Penn,

1586
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,450
Sean to Shirk Jesus Christ.

1587
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,560
Right after I said it.

1588
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,831
I'm like,

1589
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:56,981
yeah,

1590
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:57,814
that's right.

1591
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,770
He Flood Sean Sherk and Diego and I
think that Bj was like one of the best

1592
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,520
fighters I've ever seen in my life.

1593
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,003
Elite beach.

1594
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,980
That's my,

1595
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,260
the guy I've always looked up
to the most because that was,

1596
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,100
he was old school and people fee.

1597
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,980
He made Joe Stevens and cry.

1598
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,250
He beat a man up so bad that he
was crying in the fucking corner.

1599
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,310
Bj Penn was a motherfucker
man for a long time.

1600
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,810
That's the kind of fighter I want to,

1601
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,920
I want to get myself too,

1602
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,020
because when people need to fear people,

1603
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:26,650
you know,

1604
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,440
I want to be fucking
feared because then people,

1605
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,530
you know,

1606
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:32,350
you beat him up and
they cry in the corner.

1607
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:32,740
That,

1608
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:32,960
that,

1609
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,793
that's,

1610
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,630
that makes me feel,

1611
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,130
well,

1612
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,351
I mean,

1613
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:35,591
look,

1614
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:36,040
what do you,

1615
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,610
I mean that's,

1616
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,600
that's the path you're on.

1617
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,630
You're on the path to excellence
and the people fear the scariest,

1618
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,880
most excellent fighters.

1619
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,640
I mean,

1620
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,730
there's no really disguising what's
the sports about exactly that.

1621
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:46,720
Sports about victory.

1622
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,950
It's about beating the other man.

1623
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:51,700
It's about imposing your martial arts
skills and you really can't get great at

1624
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,020
that and not be scary as fuck.

1625
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:53,950
It's part of the program.

1626
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,630
What brings out the most
primal urges in us that,

1627
00:40:57,631 --> 00:40:58,464
that I,

1628
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,021
you know,

1629
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,870
I want to kill something and
eat it with my bare hands.

1630
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:02,680
I wanted to like,

1631
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:02,920
you know,

1632
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,400
I want to just be that,

1633
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:05,650
you know,

1634
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,281
King Stink.

1635
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:07,001
I want to be the,

1636
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:07,601
the head monkey,

1637
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,330
you know,

1638
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,080
I do.

1639
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,180
I want to be able to do that.

1640
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,690
Do you think you have that
extra bad from growing up small?

1641
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,710
Oh yeah.

1642
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,910
Cause I always wanted to prove myself.

1643
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:16,780
My parents,

1644
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,441
especially my mom.

1645
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,400
I think my dad really cared,

1646
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,533
but um,

1647
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,560
cause he always knew I was,

1648
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:20,970
you know,

1649
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,790
I was,

1650
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,330
I could do it.

1651
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,510
My mom wanted to show everybody else
that I do every single sport and you're

1652
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:26,080
good at it.

1653
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,030
Oh Wow.

1654
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,400
Cause I was,

1655
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,181
I was good at everything.

1656
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:28,480
I mean,

1657
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,860
how much did you weigh when
you were in high school?

1658
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,560
I wrestled one oh three
one oh three one 12 one 19.

1659
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,900
But I got into high school
at a hundred pounds.

1660
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:36,890
Wow.

1661
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:37,581
But then again,

1662
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:41,150
I've been doing Kung Fu San Suu my whole
life by the black belt in that which

1663
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:41,930
you don't compete.

1664
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,201
It's,

1665
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,910
I learned how to and I was the big
league and was my scent might my seafood.

1666
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,310
He was,

1667
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:46,790
he just,

1668
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,590
I was his protege and he's like,

1669
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:51,770
I'm going to teach you things
that I don't teach other kids.

1670
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:51,981
Okay.

1671
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:53,840
You have this red zone around you.

1672
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,411
Okay.

1673
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,610
If they would get in within arm's length,

1674
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:56,900
w there a problem,

1675
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,823
you need to hit them.

1676
00:41:59,310 --> 00:41:59,770
I got,

1677
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,090
you know,

1678
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,030
in a threatening manner and I got,

1679
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:02,660
you know,

1680
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,010
I would punch kids in the throat,

1681
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:04,910
elbows,

1682
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,120
you know,

1683
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,620
I would love that.

1684
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,160
I learned arm,

1685
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,460
arm,

1686
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,880
armbar kind of stuff back then,

1687
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,520
kick jump kits in the face or the groin.

1688
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,590
Like I got kicked out of all
of the best private schools.

1689
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:16,370
So it was always people fucking with
you and you defending yourself against

1690
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,740
assholes or it was you
being an asshole sometimes.

1691
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,330
A lot of the time it started out as
me wanting to beat up the bullies.

1692
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,190
That's how it turned into me being like,

1693
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:25,461
you know what?

1694
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,330
Fuck those guys.

1695
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:27,980
I want to beat up every bully I see.

1696
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,301
And I did it,

1697
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:29,481
you know,

1698
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,900
like I got kicked out of what my high
school one year for beating up some Cholo

1699
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,640
for picking on my friends,

1700
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,310
uh,

1701
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,143
um,

1702
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,040
mentally handicapped cousin with down
syndrome and I might beat the shit out of

1703
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:40,100
it.

1704
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,610
What kind of a world is it where you
get in trouble for that and well,

1705
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,760
what happened was I beat him up
and then I felt someone grab me.

1706
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,760
So of course I thought it wasn't one of
his friends and I turned around and like

1707
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,980
swept the person on the ground
and it was one of the proctors,

1708
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,000
one of the female proctors and then,

1709
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,830
oh and I ran away.

1710
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,780
He swept her and it's just,

1711
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:56,961
you know,

1712
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:58,610
just kind of to kids style,

1713
00:42:58,611 --> 00:42:59,430
sweep the leg.

1714
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,200
Yeah.

1715
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,130
It just turned around and like,

1716
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,090
cause I,

1717
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:02,871
she grabbed me from,

1718
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,021
you know,

1719
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:03,910
one side and I put my,

1720
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,340
my arm out on the chest and just swept
the leg and just so dangerous to grab

1721
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:08,300
someone in the middle of a fight.

1722
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:10,580
And she probably wouldn't even think
that because it's probably not a violent

1723
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,120
person.

1724
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,330
Yeah,

1725
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,050
she was super nice.

1726
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,181
She,

1727
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:12,770
she just,

1728
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,270
I had to be pulled out of school.

1729
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:16,820
My coach pulled me out of school three
out of the four years from freshman,

1730
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:17,301
sophomore,

1731
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:21,370
junior year because after
wrestling season I would just la.

1732
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,440
So you needed the discipline of
wrestling to keep you in check?

1733
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:24,860
Oh yeah.

1734
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,531
That's the only that,

1735
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:25,731
that,

1736
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:30,350
that I owe my life to have to have
a small group of people and Reza,

1737
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:30,591
Betty,

1738
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:31,970
my old wrestling coach
was one of them that,

1739
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,990
I mean that guy saved me.

1740
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:33,831
Yeah,

1741
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:34,610
isn't it?

1742
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,050
It's an amazing thing.

1743
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:41,051
How many people have been saved by the
diversity there comes from something like

1744
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:41,500
that,

1745
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,870
whether it's boxing or MMA or wrestling or

1746
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,660
she gets,

1747
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,830
for me it was taekwondo.

1748
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,600
You just knew I needed something.

1749
00:43:48,601 --> 00:43:49,380
I needed some,

1750
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,730
some form of discipline,

1751
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,990
something that can,

1752
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,020
I can like enjoy and I can attack it
and I can get really good at it and it

1753
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:00,480
gives me a calmness because most boys,

1754
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,600
like people who are not
boys don't remember it.

1755
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,710
I guess when they get older or they forget
because they have problems with their

1756
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:07,891
own,

1757
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:08,724
they don't want to deal with it.

1758
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,660
When you're like 15,

1759
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:10,411
16 years old,

1760
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:12,450
you're fucking crazy.

1761
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,370
You're body's bouncing around,

1762
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,260
hormones are flying through your system,

1763
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,260
you're walking around,

1764
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,310
your dick is hard all the time and you're
crazy and you're basically almost a

1765
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:23,800
man.

1766
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:23,971
Yeah.

1767
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:24,810
And you're like thinking,

1768
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:26,340
I'm kind of fucking almost a mat.

1769
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,290
And that was how beating up
guys that were in college.

1770
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,431
So I was,

1771
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:29,791
I was,

1772
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,061
you know,

1773
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:31,860
I thought I was fucking super cool.

1774
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,100
I was out stealing my dad's super as which
we built in a built supra or quarter.

1775
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,610
There were cars and they would steal
those and he knows or whatever.

1776
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,090
Um,

1777
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,240
you know,

1778
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,990
I was living,

1779
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,321
you know,

1780
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,390
living in South Orange County and just,

1781
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,520
just getting away with whatever I wanted.

1782
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:44,941
My parents,

1783
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:45,930
I was too fast for them,

1784
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:46,201
so I,

1785
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:46,441
you know,

1786
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:46,890
that,

1787
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,030
and they were going
through their own stuff,

1788
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,600
you know?

1789
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,381
So of course,

1790
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:49,561
you know,

1791
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,210
like I just was off on my own,

1792
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,470
just being crazy.

1793
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:52,591
And,

1794
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:52,771
I mean,

1795
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:55,020
I started smoking weed
when I was eight years old.

1796
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,160
That's a good to know.

1797
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,730
Start.

1798
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,091
So he was,

1799
00:44:57,091 --> 00:44:57,271
yeah,

1800
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:58,280
it's not sex.

1801
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,493
That's an eight.

1802
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,353
Sounded good.

1803
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,780
And it wasn't like it was a bad influence,

1804
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,190
you know,

1805
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:02,571
it was just,

1806
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:03,160
it just happened.

1807
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,670
And I mean crazy.

1808
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,593
Yeah,

1809
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,890
you're smoking weed.

1810
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,851
God Damn,

1811
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:09,620
that's so crazy.

1812
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,411
They go to school and kids,

1813
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:10,681
you'd be like,

1814
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:11,131
Oh my God,

1815
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:12,330
my dad let me have a sip of beer.

1816
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:12,900
And I was like,

1817
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,890
I drink a 40 and took four
foot bong rips all weekend.

1818
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:16,320
God,

1819
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,153
how old were you?

1820
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:17,380
Uh,

1821
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:17,920
you know,

1822
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,560
going through like middle
school or whatever,

1823
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,480
and kids just didn't understand.

1824
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:21,611
I mean,

1825
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:22,880
that'd be a private school and I wouldn't,

1826
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,783
I never,

1827
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,300
you know,

1828
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,890
I was always,

1829
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,051
you know,

1830
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:25,251
you don't,

1831
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:25,830
you don't,

1832
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,720
you don't talk about stuff like that,

1833
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,040
especially,

1834
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,873
you don't wanna get in trouble.

1835
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,070
Right.

1836
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,390
So of course I always kept my mouth shut,

1837
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,680
but you know,

1838
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:32,400
I was,

1839
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,930
I was a degenerate at a young age,

1840
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,291
you know,

1841
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:34,711
it was just,

1842
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:36,150
it was just in me to just,

1843
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,500
I want it to be the bad guy.

1844
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,460
I wanted to have that fun.

1845
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,131
And where,

1846
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:41,470
where do you think that came from
then when you think about it now,

1847
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:44,450
when you're trying to be a calm
guy and you have a kid and your,

1848
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,750
your triggers on track and you're like,

1849
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:48,940
you reflect back to
like your wildest shit.

1850
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,310
Like what makes you think had,

1851
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:50,620
you know,

1852
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,610
I had a great upbringing.

1853
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,693
Literally,

1854
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,180
I did this all to myself,

1855
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:55,421
right?

1856
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:57,010
My parents are awesome people.

1857
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,150
The sure they went through a divorce,

1858
00:45:58,151 --> 00:45:58,570
but that,

1859
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,410
that doesn't turn.

1860
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,260
Let me stop you right there because I
think it's really difficult to understand

1861
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,700
or underestimate the negative impact
of being bullied can have on a person.

1862
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,150
Yeah.

1863
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,410
It's,

1864
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,530
it's huge.

1865
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,041
You know,

1866
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:13,680
and people say like that it's,

1867
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:17,230
it's not like being molested or abused.

1868
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:18,340
And I say bullshit.

1869
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,920
I say it's probably pretty
close to a lot of guys.

1870
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,190
Yeah.

1871
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,550
For,

1872
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:21,851
I mean,

1873
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:22,331
it's not,

1874
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:25,840
it's might not be the physical humiliation
of someone's forcing you to have sex,

1875
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,671
but the,

1876
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:30,430
the physical intimidation
aspect of it is terrifying.

1877
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:30,820
Can,

1878
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,970
it changes your perception of reality
when you're around that person.

1879
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:34,151
The,

1880
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:35,320
there's constant danger.

1881
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,460
You're going to get swatted,

1882
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,390
you're going to get pushed,

1883
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,770
you're going to get compromised.

1884
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:39,521
It's a terrible,

1885
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:40,354
terrible thing.

1886
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,830
And it can fuck with people and it can
turn people into depressed people who

1887
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:46,570
want to kill themselves because of that,

1888
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:49,060
because they can't take
the pain anymore and it,

1889
00:46:49,061 --> 00:46:50,620
and people don't realize
it when they're doing it.

1890
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:51,400
I don't think,

1891
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:51,821
I think,

1892
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:52,061
you know,

1893
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:53,910
they're probably bullied
at home or you know,

1894
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,660
someone bullied them and you know,

1895
00:46:55,661 --> 00:46:57,790
they're insecure or they're
beaten or whatever the fuck it is.

1896
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,490
So they go to school and they just
conked out on some little kid.

1897
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:00,870
Yeah.

1898
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:01,391
But man,

1899
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:01,560
I've,

1900
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,460
I've seen it have devastating impacts.

1901
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,313
Yeah,

1902
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:04,870
yeah,

1903
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,321
exactly.

1904
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:05,511
I mean,

1905
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:07,250
you just see it in high
school and then what I would,

1906
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,850
I always did it in high school was I
would pick on the bullies or pick on the

1907
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:10,684
cool kids because,

1908
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,501
because you know,

1909
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:11,611
the,

1910
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:12,970
the class president types,

1911
00:47:12,971 --> 00:47:13,240
I would,

1912
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,900
I would just like,

1913
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,010
I just like talking shit to,

1914
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:15,461
it was just,

1915
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:16,294
it was fun.

1916
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:16,691
Yeah.

1917
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,580
I had always had a big mouth.

1918
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,520
I got pretty lucky with
not getting the fuck beat.

1919
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:21,710
Not,

1920
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:22,543
I mean high school.

1921
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:22,840
Yeah,

1922
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,440
we'll see.

1923
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,440
The only time I ever got really beat up
I think in street fights was cause I was

1924
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,651
at picking my battles.

1925
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,010
I know,

1926
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,400
you know,

1927
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,690
I know I can beat that guy up.

1928
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:32,261
I'm just small,

1929
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:32,501
you know.

1930
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:32,900
But like I,

1931
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,150
I would always try and test it,

1932
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:34,841
but I got,

1933
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:34,961
you know,

1934
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:35,860
we used to go as groups,

1935
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:36,521
me and my friends,

1936
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,800
we would go beat up a bunch of
skinheads in the next neighboring town.

1937
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:41,070
Like all the time I got
booted and you know,

1938
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,481
booty boy,

1939
00:47:41,481 --> 00:47:45,160
those guys twice at del Taco
and once at a house party.

1940
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:45,671
But you know,

1941
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:46,120
it's,

1942
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,691
you get beat up.

1943
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,580
I get beat up on national TV
now and it's not that bad.

1944
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,030
But I mean when you're getting beat up,

1945
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:52,241
I mean,

1946
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:54,620
especially as a kid getting beat up by,

1947
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,771
by a bully,

1948
00:47:55,771 --> 00:47:57,540
by someone in front of
other people and that,

1949
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,560
that like Chamilian.

1950
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,561
It's horrible.

1951
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,800
And that's why I would always try
and stick up for the kids getting,

1952
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,723
getting bullied.

1953
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,790
And it's also at a time in your life
when you're the most vulnerable.

1954
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,850
It's really hard for you to really
understand what's going on in life.

1955
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,320
And you know,

1956
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,900
people make a lot of terrible
mistakes at those young ages.

1957
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:16,270
And I think one of them
is actually being a bully.

1958
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,660
Yeah.

1959
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,051
You know,

1960
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:17,440
I mean,

1961
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,161
I think that,

1962
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:18,750
that,

1963
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,580
that kind of Karma like
pushing out in that direction.

1964
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,830
You're a 10 year old asshole.

1965
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,290
Yeah.

1966
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,340
I want to punch you in the face.

1967
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:24,870
You know,

1968
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,700
I started getting into martial
arts just because I was scared.

1969
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,440
I just wanted people to be scared of me.

1970
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,100
I don't want to,

1971
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,150
I didn't want to do anything.

1972
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:31,810
Like I wasn't,

1973
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,970
I didn't want to start fights.

1974
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,840
I just wanted everybody
to be scared of me.

1975
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,190
I want it.

1976
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:36,040
I want it to be Wolverine.

1977
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:36,874
So

1978
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,553
you've got the look.

1979
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,023
Yes.

1980
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,661
It's,

1981
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:41,080
um,

1982
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,801
it's a weird thing,

1983
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:42,401
but the,

1984
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:47,401
the interesting aspect of it is that
I'm a huge MMA fan and I don't think you

1985
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,020
have MMA if you don't have bullies.

1986
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:50,950
It's true.

1987
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,090
It's really kind of fucked up.

1988
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:53,140
But one of the things,

1989
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:53,291
I mean,

1990
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,280
it's not everybody,

1991
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,540
but God damn,

1992
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,040
a lot of them have been bullied.

1993
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:57,221
Like,

1994
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:58,630
I don't know if Jon
Jones had been bullied,

1995
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,990
but I do know that Jon Jones has a bigger
brother and they used to go at it in

1996
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,040
the house all the time.

1997
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:03,981
So like that's,

1998
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:06,100
it's not bullied because
it's not dangerous.

1999
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,450
I mean it's like your brother,

2000
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,520
but it's still like you
got to fight all the time.

2001
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,010
Oh my brother used to
beat the crap out of me.

2002
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,910
My oldest brother Tom,

2003
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:13,840
he was kind of a Dick.

2004
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:14,081
He was,

2005
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:14,291
he was,

2006
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:15,124
he was a bully.

2007
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,521
But he's,

2008
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:15,671
you know,

2009
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:16,810
he's like 15 years older than me.

2010
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,801
My brother Brad,

2011
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:20,260
who fought professionally
before there was anything,

2012
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:20,381
you know,

2013
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:20,831
like I told you,

2014
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:24,580
you funny fan and stuff and he was five
[inaudible] five and one or six in one.

2015
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,040
You said we trained a 10th planet chain
with Eddie at 10th and you attend a,

2016
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,110
but we know we were at
next generation and our,

2017
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,520
when we would get mad at each other,

2018
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,980
I mean we can be at the
gym and I'm sure he,

2019
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:36,311
you know,

2020
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:38,380
he never probably really let me have it,

2021
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:40,570
but he used to beat the
crap out of me and that was,

2022
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:45,340
I was 15 getting beat up by grown men by
the CRISPR and the Adam Lindsay and my

2023
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,600
brother Jeremy.

2024
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:47,880
It's sucked,

2025
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:48,221
man.

2026
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:49,540
But that fucking sucks.

2027
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:49,721
Yeah,

2028
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,171
it was horrible.

2029
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:50,410
It was.

2030
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:50,830
It was,

2031
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,690
but it made me the fighter I am now.

2032
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:52,991
Yeah.

2033
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:53,770
But that's almost,

2034
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:53,980
I mean,

2035
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,560
I mean not encouraging bullies in
any stretch of the imagination,

2036
00:49:56,561 --> 00:50:00,310
but George St Pierre was
bullied the greatest fighter
of all time because one of

2037
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:01,180
the all time greats.

2038
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:01,451
But yeah,

2039
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:01,810
by far,

2040
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,070
I don't know about Anderson Silva,

2041
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,810
but I would like to know,

2042
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:06,370
I want to wonder whether
the voice like that,

2043
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,001
I mean,

2044
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:10,750
he for sure was in a
dangerous area growing up.

2045
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,500
Yeah.

2046
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,700
It seems like those days,

2047
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:13,534
like a,

2048
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,051
it's funny,

2049
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,540
just like watching those
old fights and those guys,

2050
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,901
shoot,

2051
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:18,760
the box guys would all
come in like a gang.

2052
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:19,120
Yeah,

2053
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,790
they were the mother fuckers.

2054
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,980
I mean fighting in like backyards.

2055
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,030
Oh you want some grass?

2056
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:25,611
The concrete,

2057
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:26,650
the STUCCO wall.

2058
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,720
Those were tiny Peter.

2059
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,340
It's like when you go,

2060
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:32,400
like you look at the,

2061
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:37,401
the early days of pride and you see like
Vandelay and Shogun and Ninja like God

2062
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:39,141
damn,

2063
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:40,970
they were the scariest motherfuckers.

2064
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,990
Wild Ass Brazilian dude's
trying to step on your face.

2065
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,640
Oh yeah,

2066
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,570
like trying to Japan.

2067
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,860
There's not a drug test to be had.

2068
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,100
They were pretty open about it back then.

2069
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,461
I mean I've,

2070
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,510
I've heard things from there.

2071
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,011
They were like,

2072
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,000
hey guys,

2073
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:56,810
guess what?

2074
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,200
We don't,

2075
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,460
we don't test for steroids.

2076
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,390
Yeah,

2077
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,250
well they tell you to get on them too.

2078
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,360
I had a friend who he was a hunter and
70 and they wanted him to go to one 85

2079
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:08,030
we'd give you a steroids
that gives you say what?

2080
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,070
They were just like ready to go.

2081
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:11,420
They were just going gangster.

2082
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,290
I mean they,

2083
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:12,591
you know,

2084
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:17,330
and a lot of ways I was really happy
that pride existed and yet it was as wild

2085
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:21,380
as it was because they put together
shit that no one would ever sanction.

2086
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,810
Like a Toro versus Bob Sapp.

2087
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah.

2088
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,200
When Bob Sapp was three 70 plus like
people don't realize that that's real.

2089
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:34,310
He was up 370 fucking pounds
choice like bringing in these,

2090
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:35,890
just these oddities out.

2091
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:36,370
You're just like,

2092
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,540
what was the big fat
black guy from Brazil?

2093
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,070
I'm Zulu Ino or whatever.

2094
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,680
Yeah.

2095
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,840
I mean he could fake it fight,

2096
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:42,250
but he was,

2097
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:42,720
it just,

2098
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,090
they just see these,

2099
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,410
well he was Zulu son.

2100
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,650
They see the Japanese
see things differently.

2101
00:51:48,651 --> 00:51:50,000
They just see as entertainment.

2102
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:50,690
You know,

2103
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,710
they see a black guy and they're like,

2104
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,310
oh hey,

2105
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,540
he's got to be entertaining.

2106
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:54,261
That's why he's here.

2107
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:54,540
You know,

2108
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,373
like you get Quentin,

2109
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,750
like I love him over there.

2110
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,900
Well Clinton also had some fights.

2111
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm just saying they just,

2112
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:02,481
the Japanese,

2113
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:06,020
they have the niche that they like
and they just make it the weirdest,

2114
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,130
craziest shit they can.

2115
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,950
Anybody who complains about
Quentin Rampage Jackson,

2116
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,600
you are not an MMA fan.

2117
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,280
If you complain about rampage,

2118
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,690
I don't care where he's at now.

2119
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:15,141
I don't care.

2120
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,890
Whatever.

2121
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,723
Stop,

2122
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:21,330
go back and watch those pride fights
and shut the fuck up because bad ass,

2123
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,620
his fight with Kevin
Randleman incredible fight.

2124
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,800
His fight with a Rona Ms.
One of the highlight all
times slams in the history of

2125
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,620
MMA.

2126
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,820
That's when he was with my coach.

2127
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:31,930
Oh,

2128
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:32,480
Yama.

2129
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,781
Ah,

2130
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:33,171
yeah,

2131
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:34,004
yeah,

2132
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,251
yeah.

2133
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,390
Rampage was a beast,

2134
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:36,000
man.

2135
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,500
Oh Yamaha.

2136
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,730
Him thrown more leg kicks.

2137
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:39,790
Yet I'm doing a lot of different
things that he's doing it.

2138
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,320
He became like a real
power puncher after awhile,

2139
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,280
just,

2140
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,461
you know,

2141
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:43,611
I'm,

2142
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:43,791
look,

2143
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:46,430
rampage can still knock
out anyone in the world.

2144
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,800
If he catches anyone in the world,

2145
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:49,341
they're fucks.

2146
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:50,000
We're going asleep.

2147
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,390
He has answered hammers.

2148
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,680
That right hook that he
had chocolate dealt with.

2149
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:55,840
I'll never forget that day hunch.

2150
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,660
He just,

2151
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,710
he ducked chuck through a laughed and
he came over the top of the right,

2152
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,300
but whatever it was,

2153
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:04,310
I think Chuck was pawn with his jab.

2154
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:05,930
May Be he's trying to set up the right,

2155
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,950
whatever it was.

2156
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,680
Rampage hit him with either,

2157
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,240
I think it was a counter right hook.

2158
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,560
They the end of they were circling,

2159
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:13,400
I can see the camera.

2160
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:16,340
You're now bear barely remember
Chuck's one of my best friends.

2161
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:19,790
So that's the [inaudible] membrane,

2162
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,031
you know,

2163
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,340
but see I think there are circling left
and then of course you know [inaudible]

2164
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,270
something.

2165
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,830
He threw that right and just boom.

2166
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,210
That was rampage had that ridiculous
one punch power that Vandelay fights.

2167
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:31,200
Another example.

2168
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,130
God Damn he uncorked that
left took on the button.

2169
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,993
You're going nine night.

2170
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,170
Nobody had ever done,

2171
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:38,220
I mean cro,

2172
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:41,980
cop t he hit him a gang at
times for 40 flatline dumb.

2173
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,590
He was a lighting Vandelay up in that
fight because the first time they fought

2174
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,670
it was an incredible fight.

2175
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,580
But Cro cop just really
wasn't good on the ground yet.

2176
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,810
He has takedown defense.

2177
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,350
Was He there?

2178
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,070
Very little.

2179
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:53,903
Very little.

2180
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,130
And they had a strange rules fight.

2181
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,030
Whereas like you can only see on
the ground for a little bit of time.

2182
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,300
There's like a minute or something.

2183
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,200
Just like short periods,

2184
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:01,951
some short period.

2185
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:04,620
So Cro cop would just
lock them up in a guard.

2186
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:04,830
Yeah.

2187
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:05,880
And try to hang on.

2188
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,420
I don't know what rules they had.

2189
00:54:07,421 --> 00:54:08,580
It was a weird rule thing.

2190
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,443
It was private.

2191
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:14,470
But then in the second fight cro cop
had had a few MMA fights and he got his

2192
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:17,160
timing down and that was
when cro cop was cro cop man.

2193
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,233
He was Scott.

2194
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,260
That was a scary man.

2195
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:20,430
I mean he is again,

2196
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:25,410
one of the scariest tools to ever exist
ever an MMA that he knocked out multiple

2197
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:26,160
people with.

2198
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,770
And you did.

2199
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,570
The thing about cro cop
is I feel like UFC fans,

2200
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:34,140
again don't appreciate the
majesty of that was cro.

2201
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,100
Cop now has prime,

2202
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,070
we got 'em after a long career,

2203
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:42,690
a hard career against fatal
or and against Josh Barnett.

2204
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:45,300
I mean he fought some battles.

2205
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,460
So when by the time we
got them in the UFC,

2206
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:49,380
he had been in quite a few like real,

2207
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:49,980
real world.

2208
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,320
And think of all of the heavyweight
kickboxing fights it yet.

2209
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:52,710
Yeah,

2210
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,251
exactly.

2211
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:53,371
Yeah.

2212
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,560
He fought a lot of k one
fights against the top guys.

2213
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:55,980
Yeah,

2214
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,761
high level,

2215
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:01,560
high level guys that Mark Hunt fight
so I can elastic one man classic.

2216
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:03,090
They had some wars in in,

2217
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,080
in k one man.

2218
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:04,890
People had,

2219
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,950
I mean he was a in the mix with some
of the best fighters in the world over

2220
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:08,130
there.

2221
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,431
He got,

2222
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:08,611
you know,

2223
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:11,040
you've got the [inaudible] are small,

2224
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:11,940
small Allister,

2225
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:12,750
um,

2226
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,291
Peter a year.

2227
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:13,651
It's,

2228
00:55:13,651 --> 00:55:14,021
you know,

2229
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:14,230
the,

2230
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,410
the Tyrone Spong is like the,

2231
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,670
the Dutch group of kickboxers.

2232
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,490
The heavyweights are,

2233
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:19,830
I mean,

2234
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,260
and these guys have like a
hundred heavyweight fights,

2235
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,520
200 heavyweight fights.

2236
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,200
I mean this is insane.

2237
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,970
I mean someone lie sides.

2238
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:27,151
Okay.

2239
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:29,040
You have 200 Thai fights in Thailand.

2240
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:31,590
It's still sits still pretty gnarly.

2241
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:31,860
It's,

2242
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,641
it's more than not,

2243
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:33,121
it's crazy,

2244
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,630
but I mean double the size and
almost the same amount of flights.

2245
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:36,961
I mean that's,

2246
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:37,261
that's,

2247
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:38,094
that's just,

2248
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,360
that's completely insane.

2249
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,171
It's incredible.

2250
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:45,171
I mean dude had 29
kickboxing fights on record,

2251
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,080
on record and then 41 MMA fights.

2252
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,000
God Damn.

2253
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,013
Yeah.

2254
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,130
Yeah.

2255
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,370
He had some great
fucking k one fights too,

2256
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:56,970
man.

2257
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,840
Really Fun King.

2258
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,261
He see,

2259
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:01,950
he was one of the best guys to come over
even though he wasn't one of the best k

2260
00:56:01,951 --> 00:56:02,551
one guys.

2261
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:04,050
He was like just below the,

2262
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:05,010
the elite of the elite.

2263
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:07,530
Like it wasn't just below
like the Grand Prix winners.

2264
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:07,951
Exactly.

2265
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,990
Before he did win a ground pre recently.

2266
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,260
Yeah,

2267
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:10,860
right.

2268
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,641
There was in a,

2269
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:13,230
it was the big European men or something,

2270
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:14,371
something like that.

2271
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:14,581
I'll,

2272
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:14,820
I'll,

2273
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,710
I'll find out and give him
the credit he deserves.

2274
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,430
But um,

2275
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:18,061
when he,

2276
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:18,630
uh,

2277
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,890
when he came over he was,

2278
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,190
he had the one thing that a lot of
people didn't have ridiculous speed and

2279
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:26,080
explosion and he had like,

2280
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,520
I think he had a karate background,

2281
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,354
right?

2282
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,010
Correct.

2283
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,130
When we first started it,

2284
00:56:31,131 --> 00:56:32,080
you started like,

2285
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,153
I'm sure that was a long,

2286
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:33,790
long time ago.

2287
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,610
John Claude van Damme movies or something
like that and learn how to kick that

2288
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,800
way and then got
something crazy like that,

2289
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:39,634
I believe.

2290
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,980
I believe that that's
like how it got started.

2291
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,780
I think he liked,

2292
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,150
it was a John Claude van Damme
fan and I know karate from that,

2293
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,930
but his fucking kicks are so unusual.

2294
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:50,950
Like angle.

2295
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,970
Oh speed.

2296
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:55,960
The speed is ridiculous
and he's got horse legs.

2297
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,950
Like those things are huge.

2298
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,030
So of course those,

2299
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:58,601
those,

2300
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:00,970
those kicking you in the face
is going to not feel good.

2301
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,110
And he again,

2302
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,090
I mean it was like he had that weight.

2303
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,571
It was like,

2304
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:04,901
you know,

2305
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:05,830
to 30th,

2306
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,920
two 28 he said yeah to 28 is what he
like the average that he weighed when he

2307
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:16,051
was in his prime and it was just scary
fast when knocked out Bob Sapp Zap was

2308
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,990
three fucking 70 and Mirko Cro cop.

2309
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,090
No he right handed or left handed.

2310
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,470
I'm a straight left to the eye socket.

2311
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,211
Remember on broke.

2312
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:24,671
Is that okay?

2313
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:25,850
And then yeah,

2314
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:27,190
he broke his eye socket bone.

2315
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,390
I think he kicked him before that.

2316
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:29,800
Okay.

2317
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,420
I mean I remember I kick to the body,

2318
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,130
see if you can find that,

2319
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:35,680
see if he could find a
cro cop versus Bob Sapp.

2320
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:37,720
Cause that was one of
cro cop's best fights.

2321
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,141
And he was a,

2322
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:39,460
it was a kickboxing fight too.

2323
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,270
You know,

2324
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:44,540
that was back when this was a guy
Bob Sapp who had beaten Ernesto,

2325
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,820
who's too most people think was the
greatest ever or one of the top 10 guys

2326
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:49,091
ever.

2327
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:49,500
For sure.

2328
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:49,660
Yeah.

2329
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,770
I shouldn't say the greatest ever,

2330
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,150
like even Dutch guy say,

2331
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:57,151
but it's kind of between him when he's
in his prime or like a rob came in or uh,

2332
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,980
or of course Ramon Dekkers deckers gets
the most credit because he fought the

2333
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:03,221
lights.

2334
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:03,750
Guys,

2335
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,970
I read that [inaudible]
look at this shit dude.

2336
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,980
This is Bob Sapp versus Mirko Cro.

2337
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:12,670
Cop Mirko is literally almost
200 pounds lighter than them.

2338
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:18,650
He's actually a hundred.

2339
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,570
He's a probably no bullshit.

2340
00:58:20,571 --> 00:58:22,790
150 pounds lighter than him,

2341
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,200
which is incredible.

2342
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,243
And I mean he's,

2343
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,870
he just sucks man.

2344
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,100
And he's chasing cro cop around and he
gets a hold of him and he like China to

2345
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,110
rabbit punches just
trying to dirty box some.

2346
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,160
He just wants to me to death.

2347
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:34,961
He sees that big.

2348
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:38,720
It just has to lay one on you and your
and your dumb Mirko was strong enough and

2349
00:58:38,721 --> 00:58:40,250
fast enough to keep him off.

2350
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,740
Which is the difference
between his style and Ernesto.

2351
00:58:42,741 --> 00:58:43,660
Who's throwing Ernesto?

2352
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,861
Who?

2353
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:46,760
Who's the better kickboxer
look technically then Mirko.

2354
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:47,090
Oh yeah.

2355
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,090
What makes Mirco so dangerous and MMA
is that he's explosive and it'll dart in

2356
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:53,030
and blast you.

2357
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,220
He'll take a chance and do something wild.

2358
00:58:55,221 --> 00:58:56,630
Where a guy like it was something hard,

2359
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,340
something ridiculous shit.

2360
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,061
Not just a feeler.

2361
00:58:59,061 --> 00:58:59,381
I mean that,

2362
00:58:59,381 --> 00:58:59,601
that's,

2363
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:00,434
he wants to,

2364
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,433
he will go after you.

2365
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:02,901
Oh I forgot.

2366
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:03,261
I forgot.

2367
00:59:03,261 --> 00:59:04,094
He got ball clipped.

2368
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,770
You've got Paul clipped it looks
like or something happen there.

2369
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,130
Very rarely do you get pokes in pride too.

2370
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,700
That was another interesting thing.

2371
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,840
This is actually kickbox
fat fingers on fat fingers.

2372
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:18,000
And apparently the way it's designed,

2373
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:20,790
it makes you a curl your hand more,

2374
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:21,110
uh,

2375
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:21,980
keep it curled.

2376
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,150
Whereas the UFC ones,

2377
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:25,460
do you feel that the UFC ones
make your hands straightened out?

2378
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,351
I never thought about it.

2379
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:28,490
I'll have to check that out next time.

2380
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:28,731
Well,

2381
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,610
they say that the pride
ones were like curved.

2382
00:59:30,611 --> 00:59:32,030
They had like a curve too actually.

2383
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:32,151
Yeah.

2384
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,490
They were actually bent curve
where the UFC ones are straight.

2385
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:34,781
Yeah.

2386
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:35,080
And as,

2387
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:35,913
as you,

2388
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,370
especially as a fight goes on,

2389
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:37,971
you've relaxed,

2390
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:39,410
your hands may be a little bit like,

2391
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:42,080
that would be a time where the pride one
would be better because it would keep

2392
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:42,710
them kind of curved.

2393
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,140
That makes sense.

2394
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,450
Did he hit him with a body shot there?

2395
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:45,681
Backed that up.

2396
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:46,640
I'm talking too much.

2397
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,790
People who are listening to this and
watching this are getting two totally

2398
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,240
different experiences because uh,

2399
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,400
I don't even know who has
the a c there's a body shot,

2400
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,010
boom,

2401
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,520
left kick to the body and
straight left to the face.

2402
00:59:59,360 --> 00:59:59,901
Mirko Cro.

2403
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,880
Cop was a fucking savage back then.

2404
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,181
Man.

2405
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:06,920
He was one of the most dangerous
guys as far as like sniper strikers.

2406
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,113
Yeah.

2407
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,760
And then came into MMA
and fought in pride.

2408
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:11,691
Holy Shit.

2409
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,770
With us some great fights.

2410
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,730
His knockouts and pride are some of the
all time greatest highlight reel head

2411
01:00:16,731 --> 01:00:17,564
kick knockouts,

2412
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,060
series of your ego of,

2413
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:20,894
of change game.

2414
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,330
Uhmm Alexander million ankle boom.

2415
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:25,580
Just blast and dudes with that head kick,

2416
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:27,410
that Russian dude dose Carl's with the,

2417
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,311
he came in with the loop,

2418
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:30,780
delete Libris mask on head kicked Blount.

2419
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,020
He was treating with Marco
who asked for that fight.

2420
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,980
And I remember thinking like,

2421
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:34,161
dude,

2422
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:34,994
this guy's got it.

2423
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,810
Oh,

2424
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:36,141
because you know,

2425
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:36,800
Martha was it on,

2426
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,141
it wasn't,

2427
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:40,610
it was in our area and I had some
friends that trained over there and uh,

2428
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,300
I remember just like I would stop in
there every once in a while and I was just

2429
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:44,421
like,

2430
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:44,691
man,

2431
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:45,201
this guy's,

2432
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:45,650
this guy's,

2433
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,600
this guy might might
actually die in this one.

2434
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,940
Yeah.

2435
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,220
He was amazing man.

2436
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,560
Mirko when at that level,

2437
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,320
that's like when he was at its very best.

2438
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,710
It was either before it was challenging,

2439
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:56,150
fade or ripe right after.

2440
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:56,320
Yeah.

2441
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,740
It was somewhere in that area.

2442
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,400
Where was him chasing after fade
or couldn't quite beat that guy,

2443
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:02,080
you know,

2444
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,070
that guy was the best at that time.

2445
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:04,904
At that time,

2446
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,391
you know,

2447
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:06,980
still one of my all time favorites.

2448
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,280
Especially now like now
that you know you've,

2449
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:13,460
you've had a chance to like look at his
career and a perspective cause you know,

2450
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,080
he decided to step back.

2451
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,730
I've been watching some of his old fights,

2452
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:20,480
like I've watched the best of pride
and watch some of the crazy ones.

2453
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,091
Oh my God.

2454
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:21,740
And he was,

2455
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,230
he was a risk taking motherfucker,

2456
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,810
man as a heavyweight champ
risk taken motherfucker.

2457
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,320
He wanted to go in there and
he wanted to to finish you.

2458
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:31,220
No ma'am.

2459
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,290
No matter what he wanted.

2460
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,040
And he wanted to just violently take,

2461
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:34,880
just crush you.

2462
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,050
And he would do,

2463
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:36,500
I mean it,

2464
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,830
it just seemed like he had that
super killer instinct that,

2465
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,330
I mean it's rare.

2466
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,160
Who was incredible.

2467
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,540
Yeah,

2468
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,090
he was,

2469
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:47,090
he was so aggressive and
explosive and the yet unassuming.

2470
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,450
Yeah.

2471
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,740
It was the weirdest thing.

2472
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,000
230 pounds,

2473
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:50,811
20 pounds,

2474
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:51,410
if not,

2475
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,090
not buff at all.

2476
01:01:53,091 --> 01:01:54,050
Almost like a Chubby kid.

2477
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,550
Not even a little buff.

2478
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,443
And just like,

2479
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:57,411
I mean,

2480
01:01:57,411 --> 01:01:58,244
he could move,

2481
01:01:58,610 --> 01:01:59,750
that guy was fast and he hit,

2482
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:01,020
he hit like a,

2483
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,090
had a break on the end of his hand.

2484
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,750
And it was crazy because he
really started off as a grappler,

2485
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:10,310
but somewhere along the line he became
one of the scariest strikers in MMA.

2486
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,370
And one of the guys who was
the most successful striking,

2487
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,810
like his fight with cro cop was
basically a kickboxing fight.

2488
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,570
They stood the whole time.

2489
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:17,841
Yeah.

2490
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:20,820
I mean there was a few exchanges on the
ground where he was inside a crow cubs

2491
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:21,580
guard,

2492
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,930
but for the most part it was
a kickboxing belt that he won.

2493
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,441
Yeah,

2494
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:25,831
exactly.

2495
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:26,491
You outset cro,

2496
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,260
cop and he just kept cro,

2497
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:29,180
cop backing up.

2498
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:31,590
He kept coming forward
and he's always dangerous,

2499
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,401
you know.

2500
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:35,100
And there was fights where
he had to come back to like,

2501
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:35,730
um,

2502
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:39,290
the fight against Fujita where
he got clipped that fight,

2503
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,010
did the ad and do the chicken dance.

2504
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,281
Yeah.

2505
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:42,840
He did the chicken dance and then,

2506
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:43,320
you know,

2507
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,740
15 seconds later for GTAs
out random and slammed him.

2508
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,890
And then that just swept him and woo.

2509
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,660
That Kamora that reverse a arm bar,

2510
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:52,494
whatever it is.

2511
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,780
That was beautiful and it was like the
seconds after getting slammed on his head

2512
01:02:57,781 --> 01:03:02,160
and the one of the most
ridiculous suplexes ever
attempted in MMA and random and

2513
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:06,720
if you never saw a random and fight
random in was probably the biggest freak

2514
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:08,700
athlete to ever get into MMA.

2515
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,550
And I know that's like
a big statement though,

2516
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:12,031
that guy,

2517
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:13,200
he's a ball of,

2518
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,610
of of Alpha.

2519
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:15,121
Of Alpha.

2520
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:15,331
Yeah,

2521
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:16,290
he is just,

2522
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,370
I mean he could do things
physically like a whole,

2523
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,301
like the whole,

2524
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:22,770
like the hulk to hulk was real.

2525
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:23,250
Yeah,

2526
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:23,790
that's him.

2527
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,690
He would go into the octagon before fights
and do this thing where he would jump

2528
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:31,350
up in the air just to kind of freak you
out and he would literally jump to the

2529
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:32,580
top of the octagon.

2530
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,620
It was one of the weirdest thing
you've ever seen in your life.

2531
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:37,770
Like you couldn't believe a human
could jump that high and he's not,

2532
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,300
not not that tall,

2533
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,190
but wide and just long.

2534
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:41,611
It's probably,

2535
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:43,440
is he five 11 or six feet tall?

2536
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:44,820
Maybe five 11 I'd say.

2537
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,990
And unbelievably muscular in his prime.

2538
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:48,270
Yeah.

2539
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:48,451
I mean,

2540
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:51,990
he was a superhero and a 26 inch
waist and he looks like Wolverine.

2541
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,020
Wolverine was a real person.

2542
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,140
He had that build.

2543
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:55,560
Yeah.

2544
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,780
And God damn that motherfucker could move.

2545
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,130
Randleman would take guys down and take
guys down with these power doubles,

2546
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,810
like launched them through the air,

2547
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:07,230
like it was launching
hundreds of pounds he was.

2548
01:04:07,231 --> 01:04:07,830
And then,

2549
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,071
you know,

2550
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:10,200
the big looping setup
hooks that he would throw,

2551
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:11,160
like you're knocked out cro,

2552
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:11,994
cop picks.

2553
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:15,240
He jumped from halfway across the rings.

2554
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:15,960
Ridiculous,

2555
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:16,920
explosiveness,

2556
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:17,850
athleticism,

2557
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,391
power,

2558
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:19,710
speed off the charts.

2559
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,580
But seemed like there was only bursts
where he really applied himself,

2560
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:23,950
you know?

2561
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,220
Yeah.

2562
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,840
You feel like it's one of the curses it
seems like for like these ultra ultra

2563
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,740
talented guys.

2564
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,731
It's like almost,

2565
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:33,480
it comes too easy and it's
almost like guys that have to,

2566
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,190
I've always said like if
you want to learn technique,

2567
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:35,430
like I mean,

2568
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:36,810
and just like trying to learn Jujitsu,

2569
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:37,920
learn from a light guy.

2570
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:38,370
Yeah.

2571
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,640
Learn from a guy who has struggle and
really learn how to do it correctly.

2572
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,790
You learn from some Kevin Randleman
type cat like that guy can do shit.

2573
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:45,624
You can't do math.

2574
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,330
Like still getting around that.

2575
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,321
He ain't going to do it.

2576
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:51,060
He just get a can opener you all day.

2577
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:51,270
Yeah.

2578
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,870
Just just forget that it's Lou got to
figure out another way to approach this

2579
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,750
because you guys are different with
dealing with two different kinds of

2580
01:04:57,751 --> 01:04:58,584
vehicles.

2581
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,770
That guy's got a fucking Ferrari
and he can do crazy shit.

2582
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:02,490
You can't do that.

2583
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,280
You've got to think for
Das buyer aren't going to,

2584
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,770
it's weird that a lot of those guys
that are like super ultra talented for

2585
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:11,461
whatever reason,

2586
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:16,461
they don't achieve the same results that
a lot of the guys that are like almost

2587
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,620
[inaudible].

2588
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,700
It's an uphill battle,

2589
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:19,451
the entire wag.

2590
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:23,980
But along the way they develop these
incredible skills and like perfect example

2591
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:27,370
of a guy who had very few physical
gifts and didn't even take care of his

2592
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:27,760
health.

2593
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,600
It was Jeremy Horn.

2594
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,320
Yeah.

2595
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,350
You know and Jeremy Horn
would eat shitty ass food.

2596
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,820
It was never yoked in
lift a weight in his life.

2597
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,900
205 damn.

2598
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:40,300
Jeremy Horn had a lot of fights
and he very rarely got hurt.

2599
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:40,660
Yeah.

2600
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,141
Very rare.

2601
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:41,801
He got chucked.

2602
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,930
The chuck fight was like the
only fight where he got hurt.

2603
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,310
That was sad.

2604
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:45,791
It was a blood,

2605
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:46,210
you name it.

2606
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,350
It was a different shock.

2607
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,220
It was a different shock.

2608
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,870
And Jeremy didn't belong
in that weight class.

2609
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,470
There was already a
weight class below that.

2610
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,020
He should have been competing at 85.

2611
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:53,580
It was a,

2612
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:54,490
but I think of money thing.

2613
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:56,230
It was a hype thing,

2614
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:56,530
you know?

2615
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:56,741
Well,

2616
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:56,921
yeah,

2617
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,360
it was like Chuck's first loss.

2618
01:05:58,361 --> 01:05:58,690
Yeah.

2619
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,770
It was a fun fight.

2620
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,260
The first fight was interesting because,

2621
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:03,040
uh,

2622
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,000
Jeremy Caught Chuck with an arm triangle
from the bottom and put him to sleep,

2623
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:08,110
which never happens.

2624
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,161
It's so rare.

2625
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:12,670
And if you know how fucking
strong chocolate Dell is,

2626
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,950
that's when that becomes
really incredible.

2627
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,340
Yeah.

2628
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,940
Because chuck is a fucking savage.

2629
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,050
He is a very big,

2630
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:20,830
very,

2631
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:21,581
very strong man.

2632
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:22,600
People don't know.

2633
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:24,160
I was like in person.

2634
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:25,930
I saw some of his greatest victories,

2635
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:29,920
like the Tito fights and
Bob Ballou fights and um,

2636
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,813
uh,

2637
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,330
just you could think of this
so many of them back to,

2638
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,290
but the random and fight
another great fight.

2639
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,490
Chuck had a way of going
after dudes like the,

2640
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:44,470
the first Tito knock out that
fucking series of hammers he threw.

2641
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,270
He was a terrifying guy,

2642
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:46,840
man.

2643
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,673
Terrifying.

2644
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,380
Especially for Tito that time.

2645
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,250
Cause Tito knew.

2646
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:51,521
Yeah,

2647
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:52,150
it was common.

2648
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,331
Yeah.

2649
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:52,451
It's,

2650
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:53,320
you don't know it was coming.

2651
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,183
He knew that

2652
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,180
it was only going to get
worse with no pads on,

2653
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:58,780
you know,

2654
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,620
and he though doesn't,

2655
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,100
it doesn't like in hit and he,

2656
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,650
he's just that kind of guy who,

2657
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,484
you know,

2658
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,210
I mean he will break under
that kind of pressure.

2659
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:07,901
I think most people will.

2660
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:08,561
But I mean he just,

2661
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:09,700
he wilted pretty bad.

2662
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,820
Well it was just a terrible
matchup for him at that time.

2663
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:15,280
And I think Tito was already
having some back problems.

2664
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:15,700
Yeah.

2665
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,860
Think Tito's back had been
fucking with them for a while.

2666
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:18,280
I mean,

2667
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,400
you got to think he had
a real powerful style.

2668
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:21,731
You know,

2669
01:07:21,731 --> 01:07:25,480
Tito had this really aggressive attacking
style and dealing one fucking feed.

2670
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:26,051
That bitch is,

2671
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:27,490
you got to work it like that in the gym,

2672
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,241
you know,

2673
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:32,110
and I'm sure if he fought
the way he fought and if he,

2674
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,670
if he trained for those kinds of fights,

2675
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,180
I bet his training was every bit as
fucking brutal and that's an incredible

2676
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,350
amount of punishment for your body.

2677
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:41,770
That's not my coach is the one
who had him there and he just,

2678
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,340
I mean that guy trained his ass off
from what my coach has that colony yama.

2679
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:45,610
Yeah.

2680
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:46,443
He uh,

2681
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:48,640
Colin says that Holland's
been around forever.

2682
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:48,850
Yeah.

2683
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:49,810
He's super old school.

2684
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,460
Old School respect call.

2685
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,550
Get Out of my respect.

2686
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:54,580
You've got an old school team,

2687
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:54,970
man.

2688
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:59,290
Fuck that mean to go from
like Tito's early days.

2689
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,243
You know,

2690
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,540
dude went hard man.

2691
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,411
And I'll tell you what,

2692
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:02,621
you know,

2693
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:02,891
people,

2694
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:04,690
I don't think Tito Ortiz
gets enough respect.

2695
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,460
Most people realize that in,

2696
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,540
during his era,

2697
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,070
he was incredibly dominant.

2698
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:14,140
Even if he lost to chocolate
dow or whoever he lost to
during Tito's era when he

2699
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:14,960
was on top.

2700
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,400
When he beat Evan Tanner,

2701
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:16,640
when it,

2702
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,910
when he slammed him and
k owed him rest in peace.

2703
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:20,560
Evan Tanner.

2704
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,020
Yeah.

2705
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,740
When you know,

2706
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,690
when he beat Ken Shamrock,

2707
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:27,020
and granted these are not the best
fighters in the world at the time.

2708
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:30,440
Ken had already had a long
career and had a lot of damage,

2709
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,520
a CLS,

2710
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:32,390
we're fucked up,

2711
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:32,990
you know,

2712
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,210
but it doesn't,

2713
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,044
it doesn't matter.

2714
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,240
Tito was fucking dominate back
when he would get his hands on you.

2715
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:39,130
He was so strong,

2716
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:39,973
strong,

2717
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:40,890
you know,

2718
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,360
with clean wrestling and then hit me like
maybe he didn't punch out hard on the

2719
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:44,810
feet,

2720
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,070
but when he got on top of you,

2721
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:46,520
oh yeah.

2722
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,001
Oh Man.

2723
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:50,170
He was putting all of his weight and
the elbow is all of his weight into the

2724
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:52,850
punches and him and he was
just on point with that.

2725
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,661
In my opinion.

2726
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,980
He's like a pioneer of ground
and pound inside the guard.

2727
01:08:56,981 --> 01:08:59,510
Definitely because he's one of the
best at doing it inside the guard.

2728
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,410
Like everybody,

2729
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:03,410
I say like if I see someone doing a
grounded pound thing and the guard,

2730
01:09:03,411 --> 01:09:04,041
I always think,

2731
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:04,191
well,

2732
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:06,380
this guy would do better if he
would get out of this position.

2733
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:06,650
Yeah.

2734
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:07,483
Not Tito.

2735
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,670
Tito would fucking smash
guys from inside their guard.

2736
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:14,510
And I think we learned a lot
about horsepower and those fights.

2737
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,580
But if you've got that kind of horsepower,

2738
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,510
there's certain,

2739
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,960
there's like most dudes have a 320
horsepower engine and then you know,

2740
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:22,040
if you're in there with a dude like Tito,

2741
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,570
Tito has got a 500 horsepower engine.

2742
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:23,961
Okay.

2743
01:09:23,961 --> 01:09:25,580
And you're not going to
hold on one with your legs.

2744
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,370
You're sweaty ass tired legs.

2745
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:31,760
And I'm not going to keep that animal
fucking slam and elbows in your face.

2746
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,713
But it's just,

2747
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,960
that was his time.

2748
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:37,580
And everybody's time is
very limited in that sport.

2749
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,161
Of course.

2750
01:09:38,161 --> 01:09:38,310
Yeah.

2751
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,860
We all have a very limited shelf life.

2752
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:40,131
I mean we're,

2753
01:09:40,131 --> 01:09:40,291
we're,

2754
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:40,491
we're,

2755
01:09:40,491 --> 01:09:41,324
we're going to go back to,

2756
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,020
even today,

2757
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:42,261
I mean,

2758
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,960
even chuck who was one of
the most durable guys ever,

2759
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,700
there's certain point in
time he had to be like,

2760
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:47,060
you know,

2761
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,520
that's,

2762
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,020
we're gone,

2763
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:48,270
we're done.

2764
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:48,621
I mean that,

2765
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:48,920
that,

2766
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,030
that your body gives out,

2767
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:51,290
that button gets pushed too much,

2768
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,124
whatever it is.

2769
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,180
And it just,

2770
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,481
you know,

2771
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,940
one day it,

2772
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:55,240
you know,

2773
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:55,390
we,

2774
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,320
we and most of us want
to go out and our shield,

2775
01:09:57,321 --> 01:09:57,650
you know,

2776
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,700
so that's just how it ends.

2777
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,750
And it's not that pretty,

2778
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,583
it's not always pretty.

2779
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:00,981
You know,

2780
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:02,360
it's interesting the,

2781
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:06,800
the volume of strikes that you guys
deal with in the flyweight division,

2782
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,720
it's gotta be higher than it
by far than any other division,

2783
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:12,500
right.

2784
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:12,921
If you ever,

2785
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,220
has anybody ever compiled it
and tried to see like what the,

2786
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:16,850
what the volume of strikes is?

2787
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:17,361
That's a good,

2788
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:18,140
uh,

2789
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,970
someone to do that on the Ugi someone,

2790
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:20,240
uh,

2791
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,860
someone figured out that someone probably
already has and crunching numbers like

2792
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:25,610
on the data,

2793
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,430
this is probably dude's out there.

2794
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,050
The remember the rain man of stats.

2795
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,770
I only am jumping on on weekends,

2796
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,640
but just the amount of like
actual beats that actual go on,

2797
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,960
whether it's movement steps,

2798
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:39,561
strikes,

2799
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:43,970
landed and the accelerated aspect of
that in comparison to maybe other weight

2800
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:45,350
classes where they don't move as much.

2801
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,050
I wonder if that has an impact on,

2802
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:48,291
you know,

2803
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,880
your body getting to a certain point.

2804
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,960
It's just saying all right,

2805
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:51,471
we're good.

2806
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:52,070
Yeah.

2807
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,500
I landed the fourth most
late kicks in UFC history.

2808
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,341
Oh my God.

2809
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:56,031
That's a hell on,

2810
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:56,740
he told me.

2811
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,390
And your last fight.

2812
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:57,560
Yeah.

2813
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,280
43.

2814
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,120
Holy Shit.

2815
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:00,440
Goddamn.

2816
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,240
Which Dylan had to kick harder because
if I land 43 kicks should not be walking.

2817
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:09,920
I'm just thinking about 43 kicks and
the body and the guy that was just the

2818
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,221
legs.

2819
01:11:10,221 --> 01:11:11,570
I got a couple of the body
and a couple of the head.

2820
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:12,404
I think

2821
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,120
I come from a Muy Thai.

2822
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:15,330
Jen.

2823
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:16,020
I know you do.

2824
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:16,441
Listen,

2825
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:17,320
I love your footwork too,

2826
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:17,730
man.

2827
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:18,031
You're,

2828
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:19,140
you're a fun guy to watch.

2829
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,540
It's constant excitement and uh,

2830
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:21,841
your,

2831
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:23,460
your last fight was fucking bad ass.

2832
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:24,294
I wish I was there.

2833
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:25,560
There was a lot of fun.

2834
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,590
Did you fight in Brazil?

2835
01:11:27,591 --> 01:11:29,130
Is that where it was once?

2836
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:30,090
What was that like?

2837
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,070
Oh Man.

2838
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:31,250
Uh,

2839
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,750
I love Brazil and I went out of my way to,

2840
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:38,550
to make the fans appreciate
me and not hate me.

2841
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:41,880
I was the only non non Brazilian
that didn't get booed at wins.

2842
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,900
Oh that's beautiful.

2843
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,130
And,

2844
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:43,831
and you know,

2845
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:47,180
and of course I knew I would get booted
in the fight cause there's right,

2846
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:47,611
of course,

2847
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:48,241
15,000,

2848
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:50,070
20,000 angry presented in that they,

2849
01:11:50,071 --> 01:11:50,630
where do they stay?

2850
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:51,510
They chant.

2851
01:11:51,511 --> 01:11:52,344
You're gonna die.

2852
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,400
Ooh Mama.

2853
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:54,211
Ooh,

2854
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:54,601
I'm over it.

2855
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,740
And you'll know what I think though,

2856
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:56,550
man.

2857
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,970
Undeniably you're one of the
best fighters in the world.

2858
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,480
Thank you.

2859
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,670
And undeniably there.

2860
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,140
Mixed martial arts fans,

2861
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,033
those people,

2862
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,260
when they see a top contender,

2863
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,010
his weight class respect,

2864
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,571
they appreciate it.

2865
01:12:09,571 --> 01:12:12,390
And there's a few guys that have said
stupid shit like shell in Charleston and

2866
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:13,243
can't go on.

2867
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,630
Like if chill ever,

2868
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,580
like Charles,

2869
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,660
not the type to come to me for advice.

2870
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,210
But if he ever came to me
for advice and he said,

2871
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:21,571
hey,

2872
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:22,404
a Joe,

2873
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,290
they're offering me a
fight against the Brazil.

2874
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,520
Vito Belfort in Brazil,

2875
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:27,540
do I go fuck no,

2876
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,380
you don't go.

2877
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:28,980
No,

2878
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:29,910
don't eat the food.

2879
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,400
And I'm not saying Brazilian
people would poison,

2880
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:32,521
you know,

2881
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:33,300
don't get me wrong,

2882
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,180
but one of them might shit they,

2883
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:35,420
they,

2884
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,121
they're fucking,

2885
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,080
they have a lot of pride.

2886
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:38,880
They are the most intense fans.

2887
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:39,781
And I like it.

2888
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:40,614
I enjoy it.

2889
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,520
I was chanting,

2890
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:42,720
you're going to die along with them.

2891
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:43,640
What is it,

2892
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,790
the words to that again,

2893
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,590
I think it's,

2894
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,423
it's

2895
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:47,770
a,

2896
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,860
it's m a rrh somewhere.

2897
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,120
Somewhere around there
or something like that.

2898
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:51,541
Yeah.

2899
01:12:51,541 --> 01:12:52,011
And they,

2900
01:12:52,011 --> 01:12:52,441
they just,

2901
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:53,274
I mean,

2902
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,360
even in Australia,

2903
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,231
American fans,

2904
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:56,100
you've got to get your act together.

2905
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:56,430
You guys,

2906
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:59,550
you guys are half half really
knowledgeable but quiet.

2907
01:12:59,551 --> 01:13:02,550
And the other loud half are
douchebags and are just drunk.

2908
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,230
But like other other countries,

2909
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:04,951
they might be Douche bags,

2910
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,270
but they're all doing it at once.

2911
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:06,751
Like,

2912
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:06,931
you know,

2913
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:07,071
they,

2914
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,640
they just become one giant entity of
energy that's just going fucking crazy.

2915
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,330
And it,

2916
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:12,601
God,

2917
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,470
I love that shit man.

2918
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,120
There's nothing like Brazil for that.

2919
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:15,260
No,

2920
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,093
nothing like it.

2921
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:16,371
It's,

2922
01:13:16,371 --> 01:13:18,360
it's a really life changing experience.

2923
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,200
They at,

2924
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:19,591
first of all,

2925
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:21,000
they're there for the first fight,

2926
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,160
an hour early,

2927
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,161
an hour early.

2928
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:26,370
The place is packed to the gills
there singing songs and shit.

2929
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:28,200
I'm not joking right there.

2930
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:28,750
Yeah,

2931
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,441
it's incredible.

2932
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:30,540
You can hear it in the
back and you're like,

2933
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,170
wow,

2934
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,880
they fucking passion.

2935
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:34,890
And there's so successful.

2936
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:37,560
If you look at Brazil and
the international MMA scene,

2937
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:41,250
I mean fucking across the
board from the old days,

2938
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:46,251
the very first one hoists Gracie to go
over just all these different dudes that

2939
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:48,450
are Anderson Shogun.

2940
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,350
You know,

2941
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,730
just all throughout the list.

2942
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:52,410
Fabrizio Verdon everywhere.

2943
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,480
Vandelay Silva of course.

2944
01:13:54,481 --> 01:13:55,770
You know Jesus Christ,

2945
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:57,060
so many Jujitsu guys.

2946
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,010
All dope man.

2947
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,500
I mean,

2948
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,400
you get so many,

2949
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,571
there's so many.

2950
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:01,770
And they're still coming.

2951
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:03,420
They're coming more and more and more.

2952
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:04,950
You see seen these guys from,

2953
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:07,440
whether it's a Nova Uniao or you know,

2954
01:14:07,441 --> 01:14:08,630
all the different teams,

2955
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,980
there's a fucking gang of them over there.

2956
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,141
Yeah.

2957
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:11,771
And then we,

2958
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,040
when we

2959
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,461
were down there,

2960
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:13,360
I didn't get to see it,

2961
01:14:13,361 --> 01:14:14,900
but my coach and,

2962
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:18,180
and a few of the guys went and to go one
of the index gym to watch sparring and

2963
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:19,001
Jeeva got Jeeva.

2964
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,400
My jujitsu coach do
with the arm collector.

2965
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,200
Santana.

2966
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,033
Yeah.

2967
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,830
He got,

2968
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:24,150
you know,

2969
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,140
he like the guy didn't like the guy,

2970
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,250
they just go super hard.

2971
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:27,640
And the guy,

2972
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,670
the guy hit him with like a spinning heel
kick and hit him in the ribs and just

2973
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:32,320
like separate a rib or
something or hurt him.

2974
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,663
And uh,

2975
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,261
and they're like,

2976
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:35,531
man,

2977
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:36,364
those guys,

2978
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,000
they,

2979
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,833
they're fighting.

2980
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:38,860
Like they,

2981
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,730
they are going,

2982
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,840
they're trying to knock each other out.

2983
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:44,440
Like [inaudible] knock some dude out and
woke him up and the guy kept sparring.

2984
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,333
Oh my God.

2985
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,193
You know,

2986
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:47,303
it's like,

2987
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,071
of course,

2988
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,320
if you can survive that and
you're going to survive a fight,

2989
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:50,861
you know,

2990
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,190
I mean,

2991
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:51,670
they're down.

2992
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,503
They're tough.

2993
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,530
They're weight.

2994
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,440
They build a tougher product than
I think anywhere else in the world.

2995
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,400
Do you think it's just the extreme
poverty that's close by the,

2996
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:04,960
you're getting a lot of like real intense
like need to get the fuck out of there

2997
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:09,040
and elevate your position and this is
an opportunity to become Anderson Silva.

2998
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:09,551
Exactly.

2999
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:09,911
To be,

3000
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:10,091
yeah.

3001
01:15:10,091 --> 01:15:10,810
To be,

3002
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:11,471
to be Elvis,

3003
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:11,801
you know,

3004
01:15:11,801 --> 01:15:12,581
continental,

3005
01:15:12,581 --> 01:15:13,330
baller,

3006
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:13,990
you know,

3007
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:17,860
by far I think that then they see
it and they know that that's where,

3008
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,041
you know,

3009
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:21,630
the humble beginnings they started at
so they see it and it just makes sense.

3010
01:15:21,631 --> 01:15:22,570
It's a straight path.

3011
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:22,930
Yeah,

3012
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:23,800
the straight path.

3013
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:24,311
There's no,

3014
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,050
I mean there's there you
just know where to go,

3015
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:26,440
you know,

3016
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,180
such a high level of competition there.

3017
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:29,330
It's really interesting to say,

3018
01:15:29,331 --> 01:15:29,951
but you know what,

3019
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:31,420
in America you can say the same thing.

3020
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,750
There's such a high level of
competition everywhere and MMA there is,

3021
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,040
it's,

3022
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,831
it's amazing.

3023
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,130
It's an amazing time where
you're seeing high level females,

3024
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:39,851
you know,

3025
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:43,470
you're seeing like really high
level MMA fights that are,

3026
01:15:43,471 --> 01:15:46,660
that are happening in female divisions
are going to have to expand female

3027
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:47,630
divisions to the UFC.

3028
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,900
One of my training
partners to grow up my gym.

3029
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:50,980
That's to the INVICTA champ.

3030
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:53,050
Carla Esparza and I mean she is,

3031
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,450
she's fucking bad ass.

3032
01:15:54,451 --> 01:15:55,180
She is.

3033
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,240
I see her beat dude's up
all the time and I mean,

3034
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:00,010
she is fucking mean.

3035
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,161
Yeah,

3036
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:00,770
she's fucking bad.

3037
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:02,500
I mean like in the gym I've had to,

3038
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,780
I've had to crack her
heart and just be like,

3039
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,620
hey,

3040
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:06,310
she's like,

3041
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,120
stop it.

3042
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:07,953
She trying to kill you.

3043
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:08,201
Yeah.

3044
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:09,220
Like I told you once,

3045
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:11,320
I told you twice if you do that again,

3046
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:12,100
I'm going to,

3047
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:12,933
I'm going to drop you.

3048
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,520
Do you feel like you're in a John
Wayne movie when that should happen?

3049
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,480
We got a smack a bitch and go,

3050
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,220
hey,

3051
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:18,791
hey listen.

3052
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,470
I know you've been fucking up some dude's.

3053
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,600
If he ain't fucking with me,

3054
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:22,810
I'm not trying to fuck you up.

3055
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:23,860
I'm just just,

3056
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,250
just [inaudible] we're
trying to go over technique.

3057
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,620
Carla don't hit me that hard pop
and I hit her back and she goes,

3058
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:27,691
oh,

3059
01:16:27,691 --> 01:16:28,170
I'm sorry.

3060
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:28,480
I'm like,

3061
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:28,870
okay,

3062
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,670
well some people get really intense man.

3063
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:31,571
They were really into it.

3064
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:31,901
But that's,

3065
01:16:31,901 --> 01:16:32,171
you know,

3066
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:36,250
obviously it's a style of training
and some people disagree with it.

3067
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:38,410
Like they think that
like to shoot box it up,

3068
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:41,620
you're going to punch your card too many
times before you even get into yeah.

3069
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:43,320
Into a ring or a cage or headgear.

3070
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:44,080
Yes,

3071
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:44,680
that's what I do.

3072
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,860
But does that really make an impact
because they say that head gear,

3073
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,590
even though you don't
get cut as up as much,

3074
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:50,840
you're,

3075
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,371
you're still,

3076
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:52,990
it's the impact on the brain.

3077
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,940
The actual impact doesn't change.

3078
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:56,500
It gets cushioned a bit.

3079
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:56,850
Yeah.

3080
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,690
But it almost rattles you more.

3081
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,500
That could be true.

3082
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,221
I don't know.

3083
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:00,611
I just,

3084
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:01,061
I just,

3085
01:17:01,061 --> 01:17:01,690
you know,

3086
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,523
I'm no scientist.

3087
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:04,520
I don't take my,

3088
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,560
I have no idea.

3089
01:17:05,561 --> 01:17:06,100
I just,

3090
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:06,270
it,

3091
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:06,440
it,

3092
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:06,720
it,

3093
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,280
it keeps,

3094
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,830
it makes me think I'm protected.

3095
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:09,430
Yeah.

3096
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,460
So I'll wear it.

3097
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,120
Well,

3098
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,691
it also,

3099
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,200
do you,

3100
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,140
do you practice a training
with guys that you could trust?

3101
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,890
Do you like do you or do you treat
with anybody and train with anybody?

3102
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:18,120
No,

3103
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,270
we,

3104
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,511
we,

3105
01:17:18,511 --> 01:17:18,830
we,

3106
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:19,340
we've got,

3107
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,360
we've got a tight knit team.

3108
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,920
It's an interesting thing,

3109
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:22,281
isn't it,

3110
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:27,281
that MMA over like maybe the past decade
or so has really developed a way to

3111
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:29,160
professionally approach things.

3112
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,830
Whereas there was a lot of
variation just 10 years ago and,

3113
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:35,480
and training methods and a lot of
people did a lot of stupid shit.

3114
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:36,973
We've got,

3115
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:37,371
you know,

3116
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:38,600
we bring in wrestlers,

3117
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:38,820
you know,

3118
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,201
I have,

3119
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:41,390
we have the wrestling coach that
bring in restaurants to work with me.

3120
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:42,620
I have the guys that are on the team,

3121
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,970
but then I also have
guys that are just moy,

3122
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,810
Tai,

3123
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:46,060
Romeo,

3124
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,551
Don's ice,

3125
01:17:46,551 --> 01:17:47,210
my,

3126
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:47,451
you know,

3127
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,230
he the guys,

3128
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,390
one of the best us kickboxers of all time,

3129
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:50,721
you know,

3130
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:52,010
and then people don't know who he is.

3131
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:53,240
He went to 115 pounds,

3132
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,000
but he'll sleep at any
heavyweight out there.

3133
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:56,811
Prompts here.

3134
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:57,620
He's the guy,

3135
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:57,931
he's,

3136
01:17:57,931 --> 01:17:58,731
he's incredible.

3137
01:17:58,731 --> 01:17:59,421
What is his name again?

3138
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:00,260
Romeo Danza.

3139
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:03,380
And is he going to fight MMA or just he's,

3140
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,380
he's just moy.

3141
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,700
Tai,

3142
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:04,911
you know,

3143
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:05,121
he's,

3144
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:07,160
he said a bad string of luck
the past couple of fights,

3145
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:07,830
but I'm,

3146
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,140
and he's just incredible.

3147
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:09,590
And,

3148
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,801
and,

3149
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:11,370
but like I said that then
a high level more time.

3150
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:12,081
Now he's two,

3151
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:12,410
right?

3152
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:12,591
Yeah.

3153
01:18:12,591 --> 01:18:15,320
I've got the Moitai the rest thing that
Jujitsu and I work at all separate,

3154
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,190
all with guys I trust that are my
size and then we can combine it.

3155
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,800
Who's the mass amount of your camp?

3156
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:21,140
Is it you and Collin?

3157
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:22,110
Do you work it out together?

3158
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:23,123
Colin?

3159
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:26,720
Colin Jeeva for the Jujitsu and then,

3160
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:27,350
um,

3161
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,700
Romi for,

3162
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:29,210
for,

3163
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:29,391
you know,

3164
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:29,760
cause he,

3165
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,860
he holds pads for me,

3166
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,131
you know,

3167
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:33,320
we'll go like literally will go
like an hour straight hold and pads.

3168
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,463
Um,

3169
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,660
and then no rope rope,

3170
01:18:36,661 --> 01:18:37,071
no Romeo,

3171
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:37,301
Don's,

3172
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:37,911
I don't mean to dance.

3173
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:38,330
Yeah.

3174
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:39,450
Romy arms over at Millennia.

3175
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,550
And then you have for
wrestling of Sheldon Kim.

3176
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:44,660
Romy is another old school guy,

3177
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:44,901
right?

3178
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:45,540
Yeah.

3179
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,430
Hobby Vasquez.

3180
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:47,860
Old School.

3181
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,410
Super Old.

3182
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:49,030
I mean,

3183
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,470
he was like motherfuckers right there.

3184
01:18:50,471 --> 01:18:53,930
And he was a black belt that like what
16 and a long ass time ago went to and

3185
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:54,860
there was no black belts.

3186
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,430
Yeah,

3187
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,263
I mean,

3188
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,200
I never rolled with Hobie,

3189
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:58,640
but Hobie a rolled a,

3190
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:02,420
I say awesome role a couple of times at
John Jock in person and watching his Jiu

3191
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:02,870
Jitsu.

3192
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:03,890
She just is incredible.

3193
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,270
He talks to you the whole time.

3194
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:09,170
It's a constrictor and just tells you
what's going to happen and like in like a

3195
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:11,510
super sometimes annoying way.

3196
01:19:11,511 --> 01:19:12,111
So good.

3197
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:13,070
He'll show you after what,

3198
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:13,251
what,

3199
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:13,461
what,

3200
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:14,121
what it did.

3201
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:15,050
But it's like,

3202
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:15,800
Dude,

3203
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,371
oh my God,

3204
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:17,061
you're so good.

3205
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:17,631
It's crazy.

3206
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,550
Eddie Bravo told me a hobby Vasquez story.

3207
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,780
The first time you ever went
to a tournament saw Havi
he saw this dude running

3208
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:24,650
sprints up the stairs and he was like,

3209
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:25,730
what the fuck?

3210
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,100
Who the hell is going to have
to fight this fucking guy?

3211
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,421
Eddie comes in,

3212
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:31,680
they would flip flop side
and you can even do a sit up.

3213
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:31,940
I'll,

3214
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,620
he's watching this fucking
dude run sprints upstairs.

3215
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,543
I think he,

3216
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:38,450
I think he lost a hobby twice,

3217
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:39,021
I want to say.

3218
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:40,820
Almost caught him in a twister wants,

3219
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,830
but him and Havi had some crazy battles.

3220
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,290
Yeah.

3221
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:43,800
Hobbies.

3222
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,470
Uh,

3223
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:44,871
elite,

3224
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:45,920
elite Jujitsu guy.

3225
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,090
It was very,

3226
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:47,840
very rarely do.

3227
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,500
There's,

3228
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:52,940
there's black belts and then there's
the super elite and you know,

3229
01:19:52,941 --> 01:19:53,630
like,

3230
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,220
like the hobbies or the Jeeva is,

3231
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:56,054

3232
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,541
or the,

3233
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:56,781
you know,

3234
01:19:56,781 --> 01:19:56,991
the,

3235
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:57,690
um,

3236
01:19:57,690 --> 01:19:58,180
the,

3237
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:58,460
you know,

3238
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,800
the name off a million
different Gracie's hobbies.

3239
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:04,550
Also a guy that he was a
pretty public about his,

3240
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:04,820
uh,

3241
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,840
his knee injury.

3242
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,100
He had a pretty fucking serious

3243
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,230
knee injury and he lost his title.

3244
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,760
Yeah.

3245
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,593
And um,

3246
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,590
what the fuck was it that he fought?

3247
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,830
Goddamn,

3248
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,920
and I can see him right
in front of me right now.

3249
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,840
He fought in the UFC as well.

3250
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:19,674
That guy.

3251
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,461
God Damn,

3252
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:21,360
I gotta look it up now.

3253
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:21,721
Sorry.

3254
01:20:21,721 --> 01:20:22,770
Hobby Hobby is listening.

3255
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:23,041
He's like,

3256
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:23,580
what the fuck?

3257
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,420
I look you guys.

3258
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,561
How do you not remember?

3259
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:25,920
Bitch?

3260
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,760
I can't remember.

3261
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,870
There's not enough room.

3262
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,440
All right.

3263
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,790
There's a thing called a,

3264
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,140
I know Robert [inaudible],

3265
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,690
Robert and Stephen be at my
theme and I don't know that,

3266
01:20:32,691 --> 01:20:32,771
that,

3267
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:32,871
that,

3268
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:33,470
that was the fight,

3269
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:33,930
don't think.

3270
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:34,231
No,

3271
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:34,561
no.

3272
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:35,394
Um,

3273
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,521
uh,

3274
01:20:35,521 --> 01:20:37,290
Robert just stayed out of his guard.

3275
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:38,070
Yeah.

3276
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,511
Robert,

3277
01:20:38,511 --> 01:20:39,150
uh,

3278
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,550
fought a very smart fine again,

3279
01:20:40,551 --> 01:20:40,850
him.

3280
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,550
Emerson,

3281
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:41,731
right.

3282
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:42,000
Yeah.

3283
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,990
That was another guy who,

3284
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:43,801
who,

3285
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:44,130
uh,

3286
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,460
who had incredible skill and could
have been really good burrito crane.

3287
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:48,573
The wasted it.

3288
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:49,320
Yeah.

3289
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:54,320
He fought Alberto Crane of blew out
his ACL and then kept fucking fighting

3290
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,910
through the rest of the
fight and his shit was gone.

3291
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:01,980
So his leg was buckling every time we
tried to move mangling the inside of his

3292
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:03,090
knee while he did that.

3293
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,730
And he just really always had
problems with it after that.

3294
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:06,810
You know,

3295
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:07,870
he had so many problems with the,

3296
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:08,490
exactly.

3297
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,130
He got mad at me that
I brought it up in a,

3298
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:10,460
uh,

3299
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:10,561
uh,

3300
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,420
telecast once and I didn't meet,

3301
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,171
I mean he was,

3302
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,480
he talked about it in interviews.

3303
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,270
I didn't think that I was like naming
something that people weren't aware of,

3304
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:22,380
but I was saying that someone should kick
his legs cause he's had problems with

3305
01:21:22,381 --> 01:21:23,580
his knees and he was like,

3306
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,600
that's kind of fucked up.

3307
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:25,950
And I see his point.

3308
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:27,060
It is Kinda fucked up.

3309
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:29,700
But it's also true with public knowledge.

3310
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:32,550
It's not like you hide
that and like you told me,

3311
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:33,181
don't tell anybody,

3312
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,014
but I fucked my knee up.

3313
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:35,310
Coaches are already going
to have that thought of,

3314
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,511
and I just,

3315
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:38,220
I hate saying shit like that,

3316
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,110
but it is what you should do.

3317
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:40,650
Yeah.

3318
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:42,090
I mean it's like if you,

3319
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:45,360
if you were fighting in a movie like
game of Thrones and there was like the

3320
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:48,600
noble choice and if it's not
knowable to kick a guy's legs,

3321
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:50,520
if his knees are problematic,

3322
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:53,370
but with a fucking Boa constrictor,

3323
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:53,851
like that,

3324
01:21:53,851 --> 01:21:54,211
dude,

3325
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:56,130
you got to take every
advantage you can get anyway,

3326
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:56,401
right?

3327
01:21:56,401 --> 01:21:56,551
Yeah.

3328
01:21:56,551 --> 01:21:57,350
You got to just,

3329
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:00,580
just try and put a chink in
that armor somewhere so it,

3330
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:00,820
you know,

3331
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,070
the body doesn't move right.

3332
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:03,420
If you can just start to hurt something.

3333
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:03,691
Yeah.

3334
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:04,980
So he got mad that I brought that up,

3335
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:06,450
but it's not that I don't love you buddy.

3336
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,470
Yeah.

3337
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:07,831
I love it.

3338
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:08,580
Hobby.

3339
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,301
I do love that dude.

3340
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,530
I was bummed out that he was mad at me,

3341
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:11,341
but I get it.

3342
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:12,174
I understand it.

3343
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,010
It's one of those weird things where
like people have been upset at me if I've

3344
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,940
done commentary on them losing and like
spectacular fashion that like I sort of

3345
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:25,710
like emphasized it made it suckier than
it even had to be kind of your job.

3346
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,431
I know I don't,

3347
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:30,330
but I don't mean to like
everybody thinks it's you know,

3348
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,360
or they suspect that it's personal.

3349
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,320
It's no way you have,

3350
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,900
you get excited about doing
your job that's apparent.

3351
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:38,880
Yeah.

3352
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,810
It's a weird job though.

3353
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:40,644
You know?

3354
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:41,480
It's a,

3355
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,350
it's an especially weird
job if you haven't done it,

3356
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:43,860
you know,

3357
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,550
cause like that's true.

3358
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:45,990
I'm doing commentary and MMA.

3359
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:48,100
I never had an MMA fight ever come close.

3360
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,140
I wasn't even thinking about it.

3361
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,891
You know,

3362
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:52,530
I almost fought Wesley snipes but I was
pretty sure he didn't know what he was

3363
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,070
doing.

3364
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,580
This thought I was just going to grab him,

3365
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,203
take him down and shut out.

3366
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,421
I felt like,

3367
01:22:57,421 --> 01:22:57,751
I'm like,

3368
01:22:57,751 --> 01:22:59,310
how's I going to keep
me from grabbing him?

3369
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:00,450
Like what are you going to do?

3370
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:02,310
Are you going to be
going to be really slick?

3371
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,170
Yeah.

3372
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:04,070
It takes a long time.

3373
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,830
We have a long time to dance.

3374
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,693
I'll grab you.

3375
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,833
I'm going to grab you.

3376
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:08,771
That's all I thought of.

3377
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:09,820
I didn't think like I'm,

3378
01:23:09,821 --> 01:23:11,140
I'll start fighting MMA,

3379
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:11,830
you know,

3380
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,620
to do commentary on a
guy like Anderson Silva.

3381
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:16,330
Like who the fuck am I
to say what he should do?

3382
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,430
I have zero credibility.

3383
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,620
It's a ridiculous
position for me to begin.

3384
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:21,140
Damn you.

3385
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,300
You're just like the refs man.

3386
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,740
He had no business being there.

3387
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,730
It's true.

3388
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,350
I have no business being there.

3389
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:26,840
And yeah,

3390
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,790
the rest I said the judges,

3391
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,860
the rest happened at the reps actually.

3392
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:30,100
Yeah,

3393
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:30,940
for the most part.

3394
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:32,620
I mean there's some
mistakes like Mazda God,

3395
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,180
he takes a lot of heat I think.

3396
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,610
I think it's a fucking tough,

3397
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:37,463
it's a tough job.

3398
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,620
It's a tough gig.

3399
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:41,920
And I think there's excellent
guys like in my opinion right now,

3400
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:42,850
um,

3401
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,560
big John McCarthy is
always top of the heat.

3402
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:45,520
Always.

3403
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,660
That's the gold standard.

3404
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:48,850
And then there's herb dean
who I think is right up there.

3405
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,400
I think Josh Rosenthal,

3406
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,410
that was Josh Rosenthal is right up there,

3407
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:54,244
man.

3408
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:54,970
Man,

3409
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:57,340
I'm really bummed out
about his legal situation.

3410
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:58,174
He got a,

3411
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,770
I don't want to blow up his spot,

3412
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,460
whatever.

3413
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,750
I don't need to talk
about his legal problems,

3414
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:02,561
but he's a great guy.

3415
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:03,400
We start kind of luck.

3416
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,750
I mean he's a good dude.

3417
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:09,050
He just did something that's only
illegal because the world's run by cunts.

3418
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,320
Yes.

3419
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,061
Lost my answer.

3420
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:12,820
One thing's for sure my dad were firearm,

3421
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,323
whatever.

3422
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,273
Great Dude.

3423
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:17,570
I love the guy and he's
a great referee to yeah,

3424
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:18,041
he,

3425
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:20,650
you can count on him like does a few guys
like you find out they're going to be

3426
01:24:20,651 --> 01:24:21,041
the referee.

3427
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,874
You Go,

3428
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,570
good.

3429
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,710
This is going to be a good fight.

3430
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,710
Do you have say over who
referees your fights?

3431
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,801
I know.

3432
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:29,590
I'm just waiting for the day that Kim
winds up walks in and I can just raise my

3433
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:29,921
hand and go,

3434
01:24:29,921 --> 01:24:30,370
hey,

3435
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,390
this is not happening.

3436
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,450
I think Kim does a pretty good job,

3437
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,313
man.

3438
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:35,830
I think,

3439
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,100
I think she has a real hard
time with big people though.

3440
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:39,791
You know,

3441
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:42,220
like what was her last fight
where this two fucking,

3442
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,720
oh it was gone.

3443
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:45,730
Zaga and peewee Herman.

3444
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,601
I was like,

3445
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:48,400
that is crazy.

3446
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,810
Like that's dangerous.

3447
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:50,750
Yeah.

3448
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,700
And for the fighters.

3449
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,460
She's like 120 pounds maybe.

3450
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,060
Right.

3451
01:24:55,060 --> 01:25:00,060
And Gonzaga is two 16 through to 60
built like a fucking gorilla that someone

3452
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,110
took in a lab and Berge with a human.

3453
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,600
I mean when he like gets in
front of the camera and goes,

3454
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:08,260
wow,

3455
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:09,880
I'm making crazy faces and shit.

3456
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:13,140
I mean he's saga looks like
he's some crazy caveman.

3457
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,630
What's he just bothers me cause she's
made some bad choices and the fact that I

3458
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:19,090
don't want to hear a woman's
voice in the cage there.

3459
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,830
You just pick again,

3460
01:25:20,831 --> 01:25:23,150
just just yapping at
me while I'm fighting.

3461
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:23,950
Trying to fight,

3462
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:27,040
prepare for the feminists to
be coming at you full boar.

3463
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:30,110
Especially feminist MMA fans in the,

3464
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,133
it's a huge,

3465
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:32,740
huge part of the market.

3466
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:36,970
He's going to have to apologize for you
now and I'm probably probably both in

3467
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:37,804
trouble right now.

3468
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:41,540
Shut our phones off the
Dana can't Texas my dad,

3469
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,570
he'll fucking shut the internet down.

3470
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:44,890
Who called Vegas?

3471
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:45,681
I'm getting a string call.

3472
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:46,190
Lorenzo.

3473
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,380
Shut the internet down.

3474
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:50,020
We're all going in.

3475
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:50,291
Ian,

3476
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,280
I'm going to get us in trouble.

3477
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,831
It's funny man.

3478
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:56,170
But I see how you would want.

3479
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,150
Definitely if you have
that opinion about it,

3480
01:25:58,151 --> 01:25:59,410
whether it's a woman or a man,

3481
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,630
if you have an opinion about a
referee that you don't think is good,

3482
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,580
I would think that would be important
to like make sure that that's one less

3483
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:05,570
thing you have to think about.

3484
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,760
Did they give you like
a hard time about that?

3485
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,960
Is that like pretty easy to do?

3486
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:09,801
I don't know.

3487
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:10,371
I've never,

3488
01:26:10,371 --> 01:26:11,710
I've never had a complaint about it.

3489
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,940
So I know that's been in
dispute in boxing matches.

3490
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:17,780
Like there's certain reps that are slower
to break things up and let guys fight

3491
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:18,710
out of clinches,

3492
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,250
you know?

3493
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,900
And then there's other
bar wraps that don't,

3494
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,240
they don't tolerate Nyesha.

3495
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:22,881
I've never,

3496
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:23,300
uh,

3497
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,850
I've never seen it happen and UFC,

3498
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,401
so I don't know.

3499
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:26,061
That's a good question.

3500
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,520
I'm sure it's going to happen or it has
happened and that they've taken care of

3501
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:28,611
her.

3502
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:32,510
I'm sure Bert has has
made it quick work of it.

3503
01:26:32,511 --> 01:26:32,721
You know,

3504
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:33,890
that guy does his job well.

3505
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:34,371
It's really,

3506
01:26:34,371 --> 01:26:37,250
it's an interesting situation and a
lot of people don't even aware of that.

3507
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:37,701
Like people go,

3508
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:39,710
what does UFC fixed your fucking judging?

3509
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,940
They can't do anything.

3510
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:41,260
Yeah,

3511
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:41,540
it's,

3512
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:44,480
it's the state athletic commissions
that control all the judging.

3513
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:44,920
Exactly.

3514
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,610
It's getting better I think sometimes.

3515
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,840
Sometimes I think it's getting better.

3516
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,990
Every now and then a flight
comes along and you're like,

3517
01:26:50,991 --> 01:26:51,351
wait,

3518
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,184
what?

3519
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:52,881
You know,

3520
01:26:52,881 --> 01:26:54,020
come on man.

3521
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:56,810
Like there's some shit you guys are
not taking into consideration here.

3522
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:57,170
Yeah.

3523
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,001
You know there's,

3524
01:26:58,001 --> 01:26:59,390
there's a few fights where he just go,

3525
01:26:59,391 --> 01:26:59,631
man,

3526
01:26:59,631 --> 01:26:59,841
I'm,

3527
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:01,130
I'm missing something here.

3528
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,210
I don't get how that was.

3529
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:04,600
What did you see that I
didn't see or not Sam,

3530
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:05,270
I'm just,

3531
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,540
I really believe this and this
sounds like stupid bullshit,

3532
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:13,750
but I think that they should
consider having a one extra vote.

3533
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,540
One extra judge and that one extra judge.

3534
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,500
So it'd be the Internet.

3535
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,270
That's what I think.

3536
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:25,270
I think you should allow fans to register
and vote and allow them to like you

3537
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:30,440
could rate someone who judges
the way you read a Yelp account.

3538
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,150
Like all this food tastes like ass.

3539
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:32,360
Yeah.

3540
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,890
Like all this guy judges like shit.

3541
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,210
And then you get a few red flags if you
made some questionable decisions and

3542
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:42,110
then you get removed from the queue and
you can't judge anymore or you can't

3543
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:45,320
judge a high level fights where you have
to prove yourself or whatever the fuck

3544
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:46,010
you got to do.

3545
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:49,790
But I think having that as a
fourth judging that May 4th option,

3546
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,110
maybe even coming to it if it's
a a close disputed decision.

3547
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,130
If it's close,

3548
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:56,510
let's go to the Internet judge,

3549
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,700
let's see what that was and then you know,

3550
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,190
take that into consideration or,

3551
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:00,830
or what,

3552
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,041
I mean,

3553
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:02,510
I don't know how you would factor it in.

3554
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:04,160
What would be most valuable,

3555
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:07,610
whether it's the in person judges or the
Internet judge because it's a different

3556
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:09,140
experience not being there as well.

3557
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:10,250
Maybe give him half a point.

3558
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,161
Yeah.

3559
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,140
Like is that,

3560
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:13,070
does that make sense?

3561
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:17,390
That it's a different experience watching
it cage side as it is watching it on

3562
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:21,050
television and it almost wouldn't be
fair if they only watch it on television.

3563
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:22,550
It's completely different.

3564
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:23,960
There's so much,

3565
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,040
there's so much you can't see.

3566
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,840
Your judges have screens in front of them,

3567
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:27,560
don't they?

3568
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:27,771
Yeah.

3569
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:30,920
And you can see they do have screens
if they want to catch angles they do.

3570
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:31,430
Now.

3571
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:35,180
It's something that we complained about
for a long fucking time before they

3572
01:28:35,181 --> 01:28:38,330
finally gave in and started giving them
screens because there's certain angles

3573
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,800
where if someone,

3574
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:43,730
if I'm on one side of the cage and there's
a ground fight going on in the exact

3575
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:44,630
opposite side of the cage,

3576
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:45,980
I can't see what's going on.

3577
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,260
And if a guy has his back
to me and the other guy has,

3578
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,153
I don't know what he's,

3579
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,330
I have to see a monitor is,

3580
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:51,310
that's the only way to see it.

3581
01:28:51,311 --> 01:28:51,860
Exactly.

3582
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,640
So finally judges get to see that
because for the longest time some of the

3583
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:58,910
questionable decisions could
be boiled down to that.

3584
01:28:58,911 --> 01:28:59,190
Like the,

3585
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:02,070
you didn't get a good angle to see
exactly was happening the whole time.

3586
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:03,360
So in a close,

3587
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:06,870
like ten nine sort of a situation
where it could go either way,

3588
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,390
there's a lot of fights where
could kind of go either way.

3589
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:09,750
Yeah.

3590
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,670
Well after the round was over like fuck,

3591
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,380
they got to choose a winner here.

3592
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:13,741
Yeah.

3593
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:14,530
And then would are,

3594
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,950
or how,

3595
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:16,171
I mean,

3596
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:20,130
how much do you do refs or a judges go
off punch that so they know them right

3597
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:20,430
away.

3598
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,500
You think they know them at all?

3599
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,490
That's the kind of thing that
that needs to get figured out.

3600
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,570
Like we have them.

3601
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:24,961
I know,

3602
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:25,794
but I'm saying that,

3603
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,700
that they,

3604
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,280
they should want that
information to judge a fight.

3605
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,210
I don't think they get it.

3606
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,680
I'm pretty sure they don't get it.

3607
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:32,783
So like when we're,

3608
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,320
I think that could influence them,

3609
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,690
but I think that's why they don't get it.

3610
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,310
I need to find that out for sure.

3611
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:39,263
I should ask my dope,

3612
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:39,870
my Kohlberg,

3613
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,501
I'll text him.

3614
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:43,770
That's how strong this is while this is
going on and it might go over and we'll

3615
01:29:43,771 --> 01:29:47,340
be on ancient if they don't
know the numbers and that's
bullshit cause they need

3616
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:48,840
to know they need to see those numbers.

3617
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:49,710
Yeah.

3618
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,160
Yeah.

3619
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:53,400
It seems like that would
be something just like the,

3620
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:53,910
um,

3621
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,780
just like the monitors,

3622
01:29:54,781 --> 01:29:55,830
that would be a no brainer,

3623
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:56,971
but it's hard,

3624
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:57,271
man.

3625
01:29:57,271 --> 01:29:58,650
It's hard to get change.

3626
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:00,450
Change is fucking hard,

3627
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,200
you know,

3628
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,310
especially when it's run by the state.

3629
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,060
Yes.

3630
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,530
And that's what people need to understand.

3631
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:05,071
It's not,

3632
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:08,250
this is not as simple as like
the UFC needs to implement the,

3633
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,491
no,

3634
01:30:08,491 --> 01:30:10,260
you're dealing with a whole bureaucracy.

3635
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,840
He dealing with people that
don't want to lose their jobs.

3636
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:13,674
You're dealing with,

3637
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,620
it's really tough to fire people
because it's a government gig.

3638
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:16,881
Yes.

3639
01:30:16,881 --> 01:30:17,730
It's not the same,

3640
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,391
you know,

3641
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:19,320
and that's a part of it.

3642
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,710
Like there's a lot of people that are
judges that I like as human beings,

3643
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,820
I always say hi to them.

3644
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:24,930
They're very nice people.

3645
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,450
I just don't think they're
qualified to do what they're doing.

3646
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,613
And I think,

3647
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,200
I think there should be look
at them and see that yeah.

3648
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:31,311
There,

3649
01:30:31,311 --> 01:30:32,760
there should be some sort of,

3650
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:33,623
um,

3651
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,620
some sort of

3652
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:39,480
like absolute baseline knowledge
that you have to have had.

3653
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,810
You have to have some experience
in some sort of combat sports.

3654
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,810
I think that fighters are,

3655
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:48,750
judges should have been
fighters with so many fights.

3656
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,560
It's a good idea,

3657
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:49,910
you know,

3658
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:50,250
or,

3659
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,650
or at least hire a,

3660
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,430
a,

3661
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,610
a standup judge,

3662
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,300
a wrestling judge and the judge in a,

3663
01:30:56,301 --> 01:30:56,830
in a grand,

3664
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,840
you get to judge or you know,

3665
01:30:57,841 --> 01:30:58,381
some sort of,

3666
01:30:58,381 --> 01:30:59,490
and then have a fourth MMA.

3667
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:00,010
I don't know.

3668
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,291
Just they,

3669
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:00,680
they didn't,

3670
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:01,351
they need to figure it out.

3671
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:05,910
Something because everyone has to have
knowledge and I think the entire sport

3672
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:07,200
instead of just one facet of it.

3673
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:07,561
Yeah,

3674
01:31:07,561 --> 01:31:08,311
I think you're right too.

3675
01:31:08,311 --> 01:31:09,000
But man,

3676
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,590
if you had just to Jitsu judges,

3677
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,680
those motherfuckers would be,

3678
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:13,360
every five was the Juju.

3679
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:13,801
So let's,

3680
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,010
when me and my friend,

3681
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,810
he didn't know he can posses God,

3682
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:19,770
my friend.

3683
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:19,981
You know,

3684
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:21,000
we disagree.

3685
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,283
Everybody.

3686
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:25,710
There was so many Brazilians were
mad when Haji Gracie got cut.

3687
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,230
Yeah.

3688
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:26,460
They,

3689
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:27,750
they're fucking legend.

3690
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:28,650
He's just so good.

3691
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:29,461
And it's one more five,

3692
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:29,591
four,

3693
01:31:29,591 --> 01:31:31,650
two oh five Mr Deno whites,

3694
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:32,401
they're like,

3695
01:31:32,401 --> 01:31:33,151
they all wanted him.

3696
01:31:33,151 --> 01:31:33,520
You know,

3697
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,080
they're so loyal and
like a name like Gracie,

3698
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:40,950
that's his royalty and mixed
martial arts as you get.

3699
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:41,930
Fuck Prince Charles.

3700
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:42,541
All right.

3701
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:43,351
That's real royalty.

3702
01:31:43,351 --> 01:31:44,510
The Gracie name is Royal's.

3703
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:44,940
It is.

3704
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,280
So when Dana Cut Heidrick Gracie,

3705
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:47,491
it's like,

3706
01:31:47,491 --> 01:31:47,581
well,

3707
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:48,414
she's just,

3708
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:49,650
what?

3709
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:50,483
How dare you,

3710
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:52,800
he's a dude that I don't
think she'd be fine in one 85.

3711
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,870
I look at hydro and he's so big.

3712
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:58,860
He's so tall and it is murder for
that motherfucker to make one 85.

3713
01:31:58,861 --> 01:32:02,050
I his like what he looked like
after he had weighed in like,

3714
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:02,913
Jesus,

3715
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:03,671
that dude,

3716
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:03,941
I mean,

3717
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:06,720
that is really hardcore weight cutting.

3718
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,510
That guy's doing.

3719
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,691
Yeah.

3720
01:32:07,691 --> 01:32:08,470
He's a big boy.

3721
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,001
Fuck yeah.

3722
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:09,834
Yes man.

3723
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:12,910
The weight cutting is his.

3724
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:13,930
Yeah,

3725
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:15,220
he's big dude.

3726
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:16,120
When you're around him,

3727
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,950
like how does that guy way one 85?

3728
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,120
How's that even possible?

3729
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:19,660
Because he,

3730
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:22,840
I see a lot of guys like that and I
mean at every weight that is just like,

3731
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,680
wow.

3732
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:23,950
Yeah.

3733
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:26,260
No one better exemplifies it then.

3734
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:27,094
Who,

3735
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:28,543
uh,

3736
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,460
GSP is pretty bad.

3737
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:31,061
Anthony Rumble.

3738
01:32:31,061 --> 01:32:31,520
Johnson.

3739
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:31,901
Johnson.

3740
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:32,734
Yeah.

3741
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,161
He's,

3742
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:34,240
I mean he made one,

3743
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,470
well we barely made one mistake.

3744
01:32:35,471 --> 01:32:37,090
One 70 but now he's
fighting it in heavyweight.

3745
01:32:37,210 --> 01:32:37,930
Yeah,

3746
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:38,410
it's okay.

3747
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,240
And he's beating guys like our Lawsky.

3748
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:40,690
You missed,

3749
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:41,920
you missed wait at 70.

3750
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:43,060
So they kicked out a 70.

3751
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:44,290
They kick you out of a weight class,

3752
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,030
which I don't knew that was possible.

3753
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:51,010
Then you miss wait at the next higher
for the 15 pounds higher weight class by

3754
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:51,940
12 pounds.

3755
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:54,760
So you missed your original
weight by 2027 pounds.

3756
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,220
You're just being an asshole now.

3757
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:01,090
I met him in between fights
once his back when he was,

3758
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:01,390
uh,

3759
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:03,310
one of the scariest guys in
the welterweight division.

3760
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:04,300
He was just coming up.

3761
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,750
He had knocked out Tommy
Burns and remember that fight.

3762
01:33:07,751 --> 01:33:07,980
Yeah,

3763
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,430
but ruthless fight man,

3764
01:33:09,431 --> 01:33:11,350
he was absolutely brutal.

3765
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,860
Tommy was coming off of the
ultimate fighter and he was,

3766
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:18,340
there is moments in fighters'
careers where they just appear like,

3767
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,390
oh my God,

3768
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,160
this is the motherfucker right here.

3769
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,180
And he was one of them.

3770
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:25,480
And that moment when he bursts on the
scene and knocked out that Tommy Burns,

3771
01:33:25,481 --> 01:33:26,860
who that was like his coming out party,

3772
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:27,371
I was like,

3773
01:33:27,371 --> 01:33:29,680
this kid is fucking powerful.

3774
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:30,573
That's what it was.

3775
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:32,480
He went after people and he just,

3776
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,060
it just physically just crushed.

3777
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,900
And he was so big for one 70.

3778
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,010
Didn't even make sense.

3779
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:39,370
No,

3780
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,660
I met him in between fights.

3781
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,081
He was a,

3782
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:41,771
at one of the,

3783
01:33:41,771 --> 01:33:42,580
um,

3784
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,420
I think it was in Denver.

3785
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,370
Came down and he wasn't competing,

3786
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:47,140
so he was giant.

3787
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:47,801
I go,

3788
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:49,000
what do you way?

3789
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:49,631
And he goes,

3790
01:33:49,631 --> 01:33:51,580
I'm about to 30 to 20 to 30.

3791
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:52,690
Like how watch,

3792
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,640
he was huge.

3793
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:56,140
It was fucking gigantic.

3794
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:56,510
That's,

3795
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:56,730
I mean,

3796
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:57,130
the foot,

3797
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,450
that's a 60 pound weight cut.

3798
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:59,770
And he's building a heavyweight too.

3799
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,001
I mean he be like,

3800
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:02,590
looked like it didn't look like,

3801
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:02,771
man,

3802
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:03,810
you shouldn't be fighting heavyweight.

3803
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,181
It was like,

3804
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:04,421
yeah,

3805
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:05,260
you can be a heavyweight.

3806
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,360
How the fuck did you get one 70?

3807
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:07,701
Cause he's,

3808
01:34:07,701 --> 01:34:08,471
he's tall too.

3809
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:11,560
It's not like he's a
short super thick guy.

3810
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:12,790
He's just a big man.

3811
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:12,990
Yeah.

3812
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:13,660
That's,

3813
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,660
that's just gotta be
unbelievably bad for your body.

3814
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,870
It's just gotta be unbelievably bad for
your body when you have that Nice nutty

3815
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:20,320
seesaw.

3816
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,153
Right.

3817
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,360
Yeah.

3818
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,880
I honestly probably think it takes a year
or two off your life every time you do

3819
01:34:24,881 --> 01:34:25,001
it.

3820
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:29,830
I mean it's like I cut the most I've
ever cut was 18.8 and last 20 hours.

3821
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,810
It's a different thing for you though too,

3822
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,990
because of the percentage of your body
weight as opposed to like a guy like

3823
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,060
Johnson who's 50 60 pounds heavier.

3824
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:37,781
But as I'm saying,

3825
01:34:37,781 --> 01:34:38,920
I was in Florida.

3826
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:39,821
Oh my God.

3827
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:44,821
When I thought deep Demetrius the second
time I cut 18.8 pounds the last 80 or

3828
01:34:45,191 --> 01:34:46,024
last 20 hours.

3829
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,480
I don't even know what
it was before that was,

3830
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:49,380
I just,

3831
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:50,213
I just,

3832
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,940
that that one was really screwed me up.

3833
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:53,440
But when you go to a place like Florida,

3834
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:57,230
how much time do you spend adjusting to
the moisture in the air and the change

3835
01:34:57,231 --> 01:34:58,040
in the environment?

3836
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,581
Uh,

3837
01:34:58,581 --> 01:34:59,040
I don't,

3838
01:34:59,040 --> 01:34:59,590
I don't,

3839
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:00,500
I mean I don't really,

3840
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:01,520
it doesn't really bother me.

3841
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,590
What about an altitude
if you have to fight it?

3842
01:35:03,591 --> 01:35:04,190
Like Denver?

3843
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,480
I never fought in the
high altitude before.

3844
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,350
Wow.

3845
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:09,280
But I mean that'd be a wild place
to wash some fucking fly whites.

3846
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:09,861
Cheese,

3847
01:35:09,861 --> 01:35:10,131
man.

3848
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:10,964
I wonder,

3849
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:14,390
cause heavyweights in Denver are crazy.

3850
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,920
Like every time you have a
heavyweight fight in Denver,

3851
01:35:15,921 --> 01:35:16,820
it's like these poor fucking,

3852
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:19,730
God's got just got drugged
and pushed into a cage.

3853
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:20,930
You gotta fucking dark your neck,

3854
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:21,320
man.

3855
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,580
People don't understand man.

3856
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:23,780
If you've never been to Denver,

3857
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,040
that shit is up there.

3858
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,540
That's a mile high city,

3859
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,051
legit.

3860
01:35:27,051 --> 01:35:29,300
And the people that live there
have more endurance than you.

3861
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,040
If you get used to that too.

3862
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:33,060
Like that's why those guys
trained in Albuquerque or,

3863
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,160
but he goes up to big bear.

3864
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,510
When you get used to that shit,

3865
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:39,470
it makes your body like super enriched
with oxygen and red blood cells.

3866
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:40,460
You have all this endurance.

3867
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:40,961
Well that's it.

3868
01:35:40,961 --> 01:35:41,870
But my girlfriend outside,

3869
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:42,161
she,

3870
01:35:42,161 --> 01:35:43,790
she lives in Reno is always in tile.

3871
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:44,330
Uh,

3872
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,530
so you're always up there high.

3873
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,251
And then she's,

3874
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:47,084
I mean she's always,

3875
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:48,470
she comes out here more but,

3876
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:50,000
but you have to go up there to train.

3877
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:51,140
Uh,

3878
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:51,400
no,

3879
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:51,560
no,

3880
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,010
I'm going to start in more cause I,

3881
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,100
cause she's up there and I
actually genuinely liked this one.

3882
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:57,410
So I would think that for a guy like you,

3883
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:00,230
like there'd be a real benefit and
training at a place like big bear.

3884
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:00,711
Well,

3885
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,830
I don't make enough
money to pay for a camp,

3886
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:04,190
you know,

3887
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:05,480
and I do do see Vac,

3888
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:05,951
which is that,

3889
01:36:05,951 --> 01:36:06,900
I don't know if you've ever yeah,

3890
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:07,130
no.

3891
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:09,380
What Seabeck explain
that though for it is,

3892
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:10,010
uh,

3893
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,290
let me try it and be split at 10.

3894
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:12,260
Like Bj has.

3895
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:12,711
No,

3896
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:13,181
it would have,

3897
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:14,900
or the sleeping bag.

3898
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,733
It's an egg.

3899
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,380
And that egg you sit
in and you're getting,

3900
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,380
like you're sitting in a
recliner and basically it's,

3901
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:23,180
it does the elevation,

3902
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:23,861
but it's,

3903
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:25,490
it's changes to temperature,

3904
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:27,230
density of air elevation.

3905
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,453
Um,

3906
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:29,390
a few,

3907
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:32,240
a few different things where it
makes your body at a cellular level,

3908
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:36,950
flex and expel all the bad stuff and
you're just ready to suck and you feel

3909
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:37,311
amazing.

3910
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,121
Like you'll shoot from,

3911
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:43,121
from sea level up to 25,000 feet within
20 seconds and then shoot back down and

3912
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:43,941
then up.

3913
01:36:43,941 --> 01:36:45,350
And they do this rhythmic stuff to it.

3914
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:48,230
And you have why you do
breathing exercises and it,

3915
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:49,064
um,

3916
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,910
I mean,

3917
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:52,430
why am I only hearing about this
for the first time right now?

3918
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:53,121
I'm so excited.

3919
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:53,391
I'm the,

3920
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,120
I was the first real fighter
just starting to me and now,

3921
01:36:56,121 --> 01:36:56,391
I mean,

3922
01:36:56,391 --> 01:36:58,160
you've got a lot of guys are
doing it in Newport beach.

3923
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,270
I mean this is something I bought.

3924
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:00,020
Okay.

3925
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:00,370
It,

3926
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:01,203
what'd you call it again?

3927
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,030
See Back,

3928
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:02,480
look up.

3929
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:02,840
Uh,

3930
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,640
meanwhile cut to 10 months from now,

3931
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:05,980
Joe Rogan caught up and,

3932
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:06,880
uh,

3933
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:07,820
sent Newport beach.

3934
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,151
They get it.

3935
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:10,220
That hoax ever,

3936
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,160
I got tricked into going
into a fucking egg.

3937
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:14,060
Yeah,

3938
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,870
there's totally a hoax
heard and I love it man.

3939
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,261
I'm sorry.

3940
01:37:18,261 --> 01:37:19,190
So how do you say it again?

3941
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,960
Seabeck see back EAC.

3942
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:21,910
Yeah,

3943
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:22,250
Dunno.

3944
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:22,970
Vac.

3945
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:23,580
And it's a,

3946
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,590
I go to a cent in Newport beach and it,

3947
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:26,300
I mean it's,

3948
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,740
I'll do 20 minutes sessions,

3949
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:29,420
I'll do three of them and they just pound.

3950
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,351
I pound out,

3951
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:30,530
you know,

3952
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:31,490
a lot of like this for the good,

3953
01:37:31,491 --> 01:37:31,760
you know,

3954
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,370
9.5 ph or whatever while I'm in there.

3955
01:37:34,371 --> 01:37:35,030
And it just,

3956
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,910
I feel amazing.

3957
01:37:35,911 --> 01:37:37,760
And then I do breathing
exercises while I'm in there,

3958
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:39,380
so I'll hold my breath.

3959
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,040
And what it does is when
you shoot up an elevation,

3960
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:46,550
you're already full of oxygen
and it stretches your lungs.

3961
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,383
Like why?

3962
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:48,130
It's,

3963
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:50,600
there's no other way to get this
feeling that I've ever felt.

3964
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:52,490
It literally stretches your lungs out,

3965
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:53,324
then you

3966
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:55,441
and then breathe again.

3967
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:56,260
It's like,

3968
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,890
what am I having a hard
time finding a seat back.

3969
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:58,171
What?

3970
01:37:58,171 --> 01:37:59,130
See Back Newport beach.

3971
01:37:59,131 --> 01:37:59,720

3972
01:37:59,720 --> 01:37:59,941
Yeah.

3973
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:01,880
Google see back or see back a scent.

3974
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,873
A Sci,

3975
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,833

3976
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:06,060
A S C a Vac?

3977
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:06,211
No,

3978
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:08,200
it's just a separate [inaudible].

3979
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:08,620
Yes.

3980
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:09,400
What's that?

3981
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,051
A sense?

3982
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:10,560

3983
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,393

But am I,

3986
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:14,130

3987
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,360
Sca Vac?

3988
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:16,321
Yeah,

3989
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:17,630
but nobody see backs is just one word.

3990
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,360
C O C and then Vac.

3991
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:22,310
That's Literacy Vac.

3992
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:23,130

okay.

3996
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:26,260
CVA.

3997
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:27,330
See that's what it is.

3998
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:28,290
So it stands for something.

3999
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:29,124
What does it stand for?

4000
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,060
I have no idea.

4001
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:33,120
A sense seevak but yeah,

4002
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:33,571
I mean it's,

4003
01:38:33,571 --> 01:38:35,640
it's something that has been around for a,

4004
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:36,690
it's been around for awhile.

4005
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:38,700
Powerful five star review on Yelp.

4006
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,880
They've just a Yelp,

4007
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:40,620
some amazing.

4008
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,840
They've just started to really
catered towards athletes more.

4009
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:43,860
Tito goes,

4010
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,480
I've been going for a while now.

4011
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,370
Wow.

4012
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,450
So what is the process?

4013
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:49,320
How does the uh,

4014
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:51,330
how's the actual thing
you can go with your body?

4015
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,300
You go in and you sit in
the pod and then as it,

4016
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:55,620
as you build up,

4017
01:38:55,621 --> 01:38:56,610
there's different levels.

4018
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:57,400
Um,

4019
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:57,580
the,

4020
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,910
the fluctuations in the pressure,

4021
01:38:59,911 --> 01:39:00,601
the temperature,

4022
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,800
the elevation,

4023
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:02,270
you know,

4024
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:02,511
the,

4025
01:39:02,511 --> 01:39:03,630
the density of the air,

4026
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,920
it just makes your body just heal faster.

4027
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,180
You get rid of swelling.

4028
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:09,751
I mean,

4029
01:39:09,751 --> 01:39:10,130
it did,

4030
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:11,280
has a list of stuff.

4031
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:11,461
I mean,

4032
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:12,294
you read on there,

4033
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,601
uh,

4034
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:16,470
what it does and I can't
really put my finger on it.

4035
01:39:16,471 --> 01:39:17,850
It just makes me feel amazing.

4036
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:18,681
It makes my cardio going.

4037
01:39:18,681 --> 01:39:18,750
If

4038
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:20,360
the sounds like walls,

4039
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:23,510
magnet bracelet son haven't check it out.

4040
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:26,960
Cycle variations in adaptive
control conditioning.

4041
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,581
Okay.

4042
01:39:28,581 --> 01:39:29,450
That's what they're calling it.

4043
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,920
Building the new Super Athlete,

4044
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:32,030
men's journal.com.

4045
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:33,320
And it's in,

4046
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:33,980
in this.

4047
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:34,370
It works.

4048
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:35,180
It works for me.

4049
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:35,601
I believe you,

4050
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:35,721
dude.

4051
01:39:35,721 --> 01:39:37,090
I'm only fucking with you man.

4052
01:39:37,190 --> 01:39:37,851
Much respect.

4053
01:39:37,851 --> 01:39:38,684
I'm just joking.

4054
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,730
But what they're saying is this,

4055
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:41,390
uh,

4056
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:41,680
this,

4057
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:41,931
this,

4058
01:39:41,931 --> 01:39:42,800
this is called the power of,

4059
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:47,330
it's an article that's in a men's Journal
magazine and the article is building

4060
01:39:47,331 --> 01:39:52,331
the new super athlete and
the first sentence is the
power of the pod and it says

4061
01:39:52,971 --> 01:39:57,110
Heather Henniker owns and runs what could
be considered a gym of the future in

4062
01:39:57,111 --> 01:39:57,711
Newport beach,

4063
01:39:57,711 --> 01:39:58,490
California.

4064
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:01,250
The machine does all the
work at her ascent facility.

4065
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:05,480
The training consists of showing up
and settling into one of her three

4066
01:40:05,481 --> 01:40:09,170
stationary CBAC pods
for a 20 minute session.

4067
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:10,220
The air pressure inside,

4068
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:11,054
we'll Jojo,

4069
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:16,120
which means sea level and about 22,500
feet with 200 to 400 pressure changes in

4070
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:22,130
between when you hit maximum altitude
or rather the air pressure equivalent,

4071
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:27,310
you take a rapid nose dive back to Earth
akin to racing up to the top of the

4072
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,990
uncle Gog gras.

4073
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:31,160
I don't know what that is on,

4074
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:32,900
on call a,

4075
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:33,351
c.

4076
01:40:33,351 --> 01:40:36,470
O.

4077
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,470
N.

4078
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,470
C.

4079
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,470
A.

4080
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,470
G.

4081
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:37,130
Guya.

4082
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:38,270
Why did you have to be so obscure,

4083
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:38,871
crazy person?

4084
01:40:38,871 --> 01:40:42,470
You couldn't say [inaudible] Heather
it fuck head Heather treme together.

4085
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:42,950
Uh,

4086
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:46,940
and jumping off the 36 year old Hinkler
said that the pod is the only thing that

4087
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:48,240
has kept her rum.

4088
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:51,710
Boyd Arthritis at bay and that
she left her job in finance.

4089
01:40:51,711 --> 01:40:52,770
Sanker lifesaving.

4090
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:56,650
It's into this and saw her business nearly
go under until word starts spreading

4091
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:58,570
around the California jock.

4092
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:58,961
Great.

4093
01:40:58,961 --> 01:40:59,680
Fine Dude.

4094
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,000
Welcome to the California job.

4095
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:01,400
You're,

4096
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:01,530
you're,

4097
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:02,070
you're part of the,

4098
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:02,620
wow.

4099
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:04,270
You're in the California Joc Grapevine.

4100
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,590
I don't know if that's good or not.

4101
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:06,551
It's a tricky one,

4102
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:06,731
right?

4103
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:07,810
When someone calls you a jock.

4104
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:08,650
Yeah.

4105
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,450
She says the majority of her
clients are professionals,

4106
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:10,961
athletes.

4107
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:14,950
And the first thing it says UFC fighters
and it says major league baseball

4108
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:17,800
player and dirty comedian.

4109
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:18,663
I'm coming,

4110
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,540
I'll go there.

4111
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,373
You've got to try that shit.

4112
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:20,801
Come on down.

4113
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:21,850
Many times you go a week,

4114
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:22,870
three days a week.

4115
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,400
It's death to get down there though.

4116
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:25,250
Yeah.

4117
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:25,480
Well,

4118
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,140
and supposedly it cures veneers
and they kept telling Dana,

4119
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:28,841
you got to come try it.

4120
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:29,471
You gotta come and try it.

4121
01:41:29,471 --> 01:41:32,470
I had vertigo for like
six months in my life,

4122
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:33,461
a while back.

4123
01:41:33,461 --> 01:41:34,240
Here's nearest,

4124
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,860
how's it cure my nears again?

4125
01:41:35,861 --> 01:41:36,461
I don't know.

4126
01:41:36,461 --> 01:41:36,761
I don't,

4127
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:41,020
I didn't build it in as it or bracelet
with a rubber band and the day they sign

4128
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:42,730
I told them to just give it a shot.

4129
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:42,921
It,

4130
01:41:42,921 --> 01:41:43,990
it makes me feel better.

4131
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:44,530
So,

4132
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,620
well it sounds like there's
something happening.

4133
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:47,130
It's not,

4134
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:47,680
it's not like,

4135
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,370
yeah,

4136
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:49,570
it sounds like also,

4137
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:50,050
uh,

4138
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,930
it's getting a lot of people
that are excited about it,

4139
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,540
which finally people are
starting to see it and they're,

4140
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:55,751
they're,

4141
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:57,100
they're starting to see that the results,

4142
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,330
although I do have to say,

4143
01:41:58,420 --> 01:41:59,800
we were talking about Shane Carlin,

4144
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:02,320
much respect Shankar went
much loved Shane Carlin,

4145
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:04,720
big Shank Cohen fan as a
human being and as a fighter.

4146
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:07,570
But that mother fucker was trying to tell
me that that rubber band work for him.

4147
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,140
He had a rubber band with a magnet on
who's telling me that it's really helping

4148
01:42:11,141 --> 01:42:11,621
my balance.

4149
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:12,110
Like touch,

4150
01:42:12,110 --> 01:42:12,810
touch,

4151
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:15,250
nothing that's in your head that,

4152
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:15,911
that those guys,

4153
01:42:15,911 --> 01:42:19,490
the guys who have been in power
balance so crazy from there.

4154
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:20,950
From my area.

4155
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,480
And there's a bunch of them now,

4156
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:22,721
right?

4157
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:22,870
Yeah.

4158
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,610
But I'm saying power
balance that that coverage,

4159
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:26,830
the one at least was done
by when they get in jail.

4160
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,060
Did they have to go to jail?

4161
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,173
I don't think so.

4162
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,063
Did they get away?

4163
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:32,040
I mean I know there was
some like crazy losses,

4164
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,400
whether there was them or someone else,

4165
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,130
you just had to get money or
they had to stop doing something.

4166
01:42:36,131 --> 01:42:36,641
And I know,

4167
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:37,331
I know went under,

4168
01:42:37,331 --> 01:42:39,370
but they made a boatload
of money while they could.

4169
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:39,731
Well,

4170
01:42:39,731 --> 01:42:44,590
if you sold something that gave you the
kind of confidence that made you believe

4171
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:45,360
that,

4172
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,900
I mean is that a product?

4173
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,510
Cause if you got all
those fucking positive,

4174
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:50,021
you know,

4175
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:52,180
you look at like those stupid rubber band.

4176
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:52,621
Thanks man.

4177
01:42:52,621 --> 01:42:54,670
It's so many people were
telling me how great they are.

4178
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,200
I want them just to wedges just to,

4179
01:42:56,201 --> 01:42:57,250
just to where it's all people.

4180
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,260
So for one I can try to get
the sponsorship out of it.

4181
01:42:59,350 --> 01:42:59,690
Oh,

4182
01:42:59,690 --> 01:42:59,991
there you go.

4183
01:42:59,991 --> 01:43:00,610
That's fine.

4184
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,060
I didn't,

4185
01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:02,260
I thought it was bullshit,

4186
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,570
but if it did actually help
because everybody else had them on,

4187
01:43:04,571 --> 01:43:05,230
I was wearing.

4188
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:07,830
Do you know the only reason why
I was willing to believe outlook?

4189
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,970
I've been willing to believe
a lot of dumb shit in my life.

4190
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,770
Psychics and fucking Tarot card
readers and I've been leading,

4191
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:15,250
willing to believe a lot of stupid shit.

4192
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:20,370
But the reason why I didn't believe in
this one when it got down to it was that

4193
01:43:20,741 --> 01:43:22,750
the dude who was trying
to demonstrate it on me,

4194
01:43:22,751 --> 01:43:24,310
he was trying to do carnival tricks.

4195
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,263
Yeah.

4196
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:26,740
Put your arm out like this.

4197
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:27,730
Now resist.

4198
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,600
Okay,

4199
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,180
now I'm going to put the bracelet on
you and put your arm out like this.

4200
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:31,490
Resist.

4201
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:31,661
I'm like,

4202
01:43:31,661 --> 01:43:32,920
that's not the same position.

4203
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:33,531
Like go.

4204
01:43:33,531 --> 01:43:34,301
We were up here.

4205
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:35,770
Let's go bring my arm back to here.

4206
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,430
Okay,

4207
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:37,211
we're back here again.

4208
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:37,450
Yeah,

4209
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:37,751
go ahead.

4210
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:37,901
No,

4211
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:38,734
you weren't there before.

4212
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:39,131
Yes.

4213
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:39,881
I was like,

4214
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:40,714
what are you doing?

4215
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,940
Like you guys are playing carnival.

4216
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,180
They were doing leverage tricks.

4217
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:46,690
Exactly like trying to like get
me to pick him up with my hand.

4218
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:47,710
Like what are we doing?

4219
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:51,100
Like you're holding your hand next to
your waist to try to prove strength.

4220
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:52,340
This is one way to prove strength.

4221
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:52,760
Stupid.

4222
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:52,970
Yeah.

4223
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:57,020
Put some weights on a stack and let's
see if I can lift the same amount or less

4224
01:43:57,021 --> 01:43:57,420
or more,

4225
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:57,920
whatever.

4226
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,810
That's the only way you
can't do a carnival.

4227
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:00,710
Treg so I go,

4228
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:01,610
what are you guys doing?

4229
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,260
Like w who taught you how to do this?

4230
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:03,800
I go,

4231
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,060
is this like did they teach you?

4232
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,160
And then they got like real
weird with me and I was like,

4233
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:07,850
is this,

4234
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,683
come on man,

4235
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,590
you're trying to make some money.

4236
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:10,880
I've seen people try and
make some money before,

4237
01:44:10,881 --> 01:44:12,430
but they teach you how to do this.

4238
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:12,981
I'm like,

4239
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:16,610
cause this is the second person that I've
ever met that has these wristbands for

4240
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:18,440
sale that wants to thumb wrestle.

4241
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,800
They want to like keep going.

4242
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:22,250
You get you in some weird yesi position.

4243
01:44:22,251 --> 01:44:23,030
Exactly.

4244
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,181
Okay,

4245
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:24,320
we'll try and lift me up now.

4246
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:26,280
It's like when what?

4247
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,770
It was ridiculous.

4248
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:28,940
Yeah.

4249
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:30,500
And the guy wasn't even that good at it.

4250
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:30,800
You know,

4251
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,090
I resisted it and I'm like,

4252
01:44:32,091 --> 01:44:32,901
come on man,

4253
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:33,830
you're not even doing it right.

4254
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:36,200
At least at least do it right.

4255
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:36,660
If you're going to,

4256
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:37,810
if you're going to try
and sell me this crap.

4257
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:41,810
It's one of those things where people
want to believe that there's a rubber band

4258
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:43,400
that you could put on that
makes you feel better.

4259
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:43,650
Yeah.

4260
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,020
Like slap that bitch on.

4261
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:50,150
I'm going to be ripped and good
looking and tell Dan is straighten up.

4262
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:50,984
My shockers,

4263
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:52,610
my shockers are out of line.

4264
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:53,301
I didn't know what it was.

4265
01:44:53,301 --> 01:44:53,991
I was taking yoga.

4266
01:44:53,991 --> 01:44:54,890
It was really a waste of time.

4267
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,430
I just needed a rubber band with a little
hollow ground and the middle of it put

4268
01:44:58,431 --> 01:45:00,740
me back in center in tune.

4269
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:02,690
So how long have you been doing this?

4270
01:45:02,690 --> 01:45:03,501
Three times a week thing.

4271
01:45:03,501 --> 01:45:04,610
And the CVIC pod.

4272
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:05,540
Oh Man.

4273
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:06,374
Since uh,

4274
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,610
before I got in UFC.

4275
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,121
By the way,

4276
01:45:08,121 --> 01:45:10,310
this is not sponsored by Cva right now.

4277
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:10,850
People going,

4278
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:11,330
oh,

4279
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,800
oh see the product placement.

4280
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:13,850
You worked your friends.

4281
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:14,330
Nope.

4282
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:15,560
This just spontaneous.

4283
01:45:15,561 --> 01:45:17,340
You've got to bring
Joe down to try it out.

4284
01:45:17,341 --> 01:45:19,550
I'd love to except I can't get
down there without a helicopter.

4285
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:19,811
Yeah.

4286
01:45:19,811 --> 01:45:20,870
Cause it takes her never,

4287
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,033
I just quit.

4288
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:24,650
I'll just pull over the
side road and go to sleep.

4289
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,360
But I haven't done a new port beach.

4290
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:27,981
People don't know.

4291
01:45:27,981 --> 01:45:28,880
It's a joke.

4292
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:31,130
I went to visit a yeah,

4293
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:35,100
I went down to a affliction and a
back when Tom was working there.

4294
01:45:35,101 --> 01:45:35,600
Yeah.

4295
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,201
And uh,

4296
01:45:36,201 --> 01:45:37,040
I went to visit him.

4297
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,341
I said,

4298
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:37,671
yeah man,

4299
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:38,840
I'll come vizio come hang out.

4300
01:45:38,841 --> 01:45:39,140
Yeah.

4301
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:40,480
It took two hours.

4302
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,633
Two hours.

4303
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,590
That's the norm.

4304
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:44,540
That's not even Orange County.

4305
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:49,430
Seal beach is seal beach is still
La County I think 40 minute drive.

4306
01:45:49,431 --> 01:45:51,830
I mean it should have been
a 40 minute drive ed most.

4307
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:52,251
And I was like,

4308
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:53,600
this is just ridiculous.

4309
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:55,910
Then they do that every day
and it wasn't even like,

4310
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:56,780
it was an off time.

4311
01:45:56,781 --> 01:45:58,610
It was like three in the
afternoon or two in the afternoon.

4312
01:45:58,611 --> 01:45:59,031
It wasn't even,

4313
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:02,970
my dad drove from my family dealership
in debt like downtown La next to staple

4314
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:03,240
center.

4315
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,073
The Toyota dealership.

4316
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:05,203
It's my families.

4317
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:09,440
He would drive from there down to Laguna
Niguel and then to San Clemente after

4318
01:46:09,441 --> 01:46:14,441
we moved to San Clemente on the beach for
30 years there for some really fucking

4319
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:16,940
long time.

4320
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,980
How old were you when you moved?

4321
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:20,120
You lived on the beach
like right on the beach?

4322
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,421
Yeah,

4323
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:21,230
like yeah,

4324
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:23,870
like I walk on my balcony and I could be,

4325
01:46:23,871 --> 01:46:24,231
it could be,

4326
01:46:24,231 --> 01:46:24,441
it could be,

4327
01:46:24,441 --> 01:46:25,540
it could be two in the morning.

4328
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:28,580
I could grab a group of people and run
and jump in the water naked and run back

4329
01:46:28,581 --> 01:46:30,110
in the house without getting caught.

4330
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,340
Wow.

4331
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:33,440
How old were you then when
you guys moved to the beach?

4332
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:38,890
We moved there when I was 16 or 17 and
I believe and we do find in any way that

4333
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:41,060
that had a change in your,

4334
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,980
in your demeanor at all,

4335
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:44,360
like being by the water?

4336
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:44,781
No,

4337
01:46:44,781 --> 01:46:46,990
cause I already had lived
in Laguna Niguel like,

4338
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:48,710
like a couple of miles from the beach.

4339
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:49,650
I was at the beach.

4340
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,160
That's

4341
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,730
where our whole little fight crew came
from was Salt Creek beached in Dana point

4342
01:46:53,731 --> 01:46:54,780
was that was our beach.

4343
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:55,351
Like,

4344
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:56,340
what are you doing in our beach?

4345
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:57,000
Like beat it,

4346
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,241
you know,

4347
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:58,074
be the cook.

4348
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,240
We had a bunch of pro surfer
friends and bodyboard friends and,

4349
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:02,790
and you would just bully people and
kick them off the beach and throw water

4350
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:03,181
balloons,

4351
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:03,391
you know,

4352
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:04,740
and like it bad it now.

4353
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,300
It always not really.

4354
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:07,134
It was kind of fun.

4355
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:09,990
It was our beach though.

4356
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:10,931
It was different,

4357
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:11,110
you know?

4358
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:12,060
That's so douchey though.

4359
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:13,380
I just want to use the ocean,

4360
01:47:13,381 --> 01:47:14,214
man.

4361
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,060
We were such to be recessed Douche bag.

4362
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,300
Is there a difference in uh,

4363
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:22,380
being by the water all the
time and living at the water?

4364
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:22,890
Yes.

4365
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:23,790
I've always wondered,

4366
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,560
like for me there is,

4367
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:29,520
I have a friend was a beach house and it
costs like 4 million bucks and it looks

4368
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:30,720
like it should be like 50.

4369
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,220
It's fucking crazy.

4370
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:33,061
It was like,

4371
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:34,590
this is not a $4 million house man.

4372
01:47:34,591 --> 01:47:35,880
And you're right next
door to the neighbor.

4373
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:37,170
Like this is the nuttiest thing ever.

4374
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:37,321
Like,

4375
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:39,780
how the fuck did somebody get you
to pay for $1 million for this?

4376
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:40,250
Yeah.

4377
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:42,630
You could have like a castle in Colorado.

4378
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:43,421
Exactly.

4379
01:47:43,421 --> 01:47:43,620
Yeah.

4380
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:47,850
You could have a hundred acres with elk
wandering through your yard instead.

4381
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:49,380
You're not jammed up on your neighbor.

4382
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:50,473
But he was like,

4383
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:53,460
it doesn't matter when you
get up and you see the ocean,

4384
01:47:53,490 --> 01:47:54,740
you look out your window to see the ocean.

4385
01:47:54,741 --> 01:47:55,170
And he goes,

4386
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,940
I'm on vacation every day in my life.

4387
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:57,270
Yeah.

4388
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,511
He goes,

4389
01:47:57,511 --> 01:47:58,261
I look out there,

4390
01:47:58,261 --> 01:48:00,690
I hear that water and
it just chills me out.

4391
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:00,901
Yeah.

4392
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:01,530
For Sleep.

4393
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:02,190
The water,

4394
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:02,341
I mean,

4395
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:03,180
my dad's a waterman.

4396
01:48:03,181 --> 01:48:03,540
He,

4397
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:06,960
his whole life has revolved around
surfing and fishing and traveling.

4398
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:07,950
Like that's like his passions,

4399
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:08,670
you know.

4400
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:09,503
Um,

4401
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:10,650
demand fish,

4402
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:10,860
fear.

4403
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:11,693
My Dad,

4404
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:12,561
you know,

4405
01:48:12,561 --> 01:48:14,430
he's his spear fishing,

4406
01:48:14,690 --> 01:48:14,860
uh,

4407
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:16,470
any sort of phishing spear phishing,

4408
01:48:16,471 --> 01:48:17,370
some wild shit,

4409
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:17,760
man.

4410
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,150
He's,

4411
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:18,481
he's,

4412
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:19,260
uh,

4413
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,100
my friend Aubrey,

4414
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:23,370
the CEO of on it just got back from
two and some spear fishing and fun.

4415
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:24,220
And he was saying,

4416
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,700
it's like hunting underwater
while you hold your breath.

4417
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:26,840
It's,

4418
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,110
it's such a different thing.

4419
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:28,321
Yeah.

4420
01:48:28,321 --> 01:48:29,170
And there's a lot more creatures.

4421
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:30,004
Don't wanna eat you,

4422
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:31,651
you know,

4423
01:48:31,651 --> 01:48:33,030
it starts to come soon up next to you.

4424
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:37,140
But like you know like living on the
beach at as a senior in high school,

4425
01:48:37,590 --> 01:48:37,861
you know,

4426
01:48:37,861 --> 01:48:38,760
he was never home.

4427
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,380
My parents are getting
divorced at that point.

4428
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,290
I had his brand new car to drive
brand new Porsche drive around.

4429
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,280
Oh my God.

4430
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:47,010
And he let you drive a Porsche
when you were in high school?

4431
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:47,230
No,

4432
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:47,331
no,

4433
01:48:47,331 --> 01:48:47,391
no,

4434
01:48:47,391 --> 01:48:47,521
no.

4435
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:47,870
I would,

4436
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:48,800
I just dream it.

4437
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:50,430
Do you know how many people right now?

4438
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,650
I just know he didn't know how
he found out it was driving it,

4439
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:56,320
but I would just like an evil character
in a fucking teeny bopper movie.

4440
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:59,030
I was a horrible kid thinking about it.

4441
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:01,860
Like there was like a
16 candles type movie.

4442
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,160
I really feel like the
ultimate bad character,

4443
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:06,270
but then you know what?

4444
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:09,300
They'd probably be a girl in the movie
and you fall in love with her and you

4445
01:49:09,301 --> 01:49:10,170
would change for her.

4446
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:11,160
That's what's happening right now.

4447
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:12,230
Yeah.

4448
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:13,030
That's a bit of review.

4449
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,863
Like

4450
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:19,020
just thinking about your driving your
dad's Porsche around living in the fucking

4451
01:49:19,021 --> 01:49:20,010
beach and shit.

4452
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,630
And kicking guys asked is like,

4453
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:22,830
what a constantly,

4454
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:23,723
and it,

4455
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:24,541
my dad would bring,

4456
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:25,500
he would go kill fish,

4457
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:25,820
you know,

4458
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,560
big tuna or whatever had in Mexico and
come back with a whole fish whole to,

4459
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:31,760
and just literally we would eat it.

4460
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:32,760
They don't get any fresher than that.

4461
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:32,941
I mean,

4462
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:33,560
he's cutting up,

4463
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:36,870
he's gutting it and then
giving you a Sushi is amazing.

4464
01:49:36,871 --> 01:49:38,400
I've never done any tuna fishing,

4465
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:42,210
but my friend Tommy did and he said
they ate Tunis Sashimi on the boat.

4466
01:49:42,211 --> 01:49:42,451
He said,

4467
01:49:42,451 --> 01:49:43,650
it's the most ridiculous thing.

4468
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:45,150
You can't even believe how good it tastes.

4469
01:49:45,151 --> 01:49:45,381
It's,

4470
01:49:45,381 --> 01:49:46,200
it's a different,

4471
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:47,033
it's a whole different,

4472
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,243
and I mean

4473
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:49,203
to now it's a,

4474
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:50,690
it's a fucking torpedo.

4475
01:49:50,691 --> 01:49:51,250
A muscle.

4476
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:51,491
I mean,

4477
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:51,731
those are,

4478
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:54,190
that's the best fighting
fish in the ocean.

4479
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:55,121
Tuna,

4480
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:56,080
albacore like that.

4481
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:56,501
Rent those,

4482
01:49:56,501 --> 01:49:56,860
those,

4483
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:57,430
those g,

4484
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:57,971
the jacks,

4485
01:49:57,971 --> 01:49:58,630
you know,

4486
01:49:58,630 --> 01:49:59,441
maybe like yellow tail.

4487
01:49:59,441 --> 01:50:00,274
But tuna is the best.

4488
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:00,701
But,

4489
01:50:00,701 --> 01:50:01,450
um,

4490
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:04,150
and then also the best
eating drought was fun.

4491
01:50:04,151 --> 01:50:04,571
The pretty,

4492
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:05,141
but you know,

4493
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:05,830
we're selfish.

4494
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:06,071
You know,

4495
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:06,641
there was a fun,

4496
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,090
pretty bad,

4497
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:07,601
I mean,

4498
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,360
tune is unbelievably delicious.

4499
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:10,931
Especially,

4500
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:11,290
it's,

4501
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,720
it's so delicious that it's preferred raw.

4502
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:14,340
Yeah.

4503
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:16,570
Does that mean tuners preferred
raw more than anything?

4504
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:17,081
The Japanese,

4505
01:50:17,081 --> 01:50:19,000
it paid over a million
dollars for one fish.

4506
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,120
I love Sushi.

4507
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:23,050
How's that possible?

4508
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:24,213
How's that possible?

4509
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:25,560
You should not sure she makes it.

4510
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:25,830
No.

4511
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,200
Why?

4512
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,220
You can Google that shit.

4513
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:28,173
You can't Google like,

4514
01:50:28,350 --> 01:50:28,720
listen,

4515
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,310
this is at least 50 people listen to us.

4516
01:50:30,311 --> 01:50:32,110
I have to be really careful
about telling the truth.

4517
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:32,830
All right.

4518
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,250
Um,

4519
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,810
largest amount paid for a tuna.

4520
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:35,590
Yeah,

4521
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:37,360
but they regularly get like 30,

4522
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:38,980
$40,000 for a tuna catch.

4523
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:39,430
Right?

4524
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:40,121
If you go out,

4525
01:50:40,121 --> 01:50:41,980
like out of Nova Scotia
from my dad has told me,

4526
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:44,620
you go out and Nova Scotia
on a trip and everyone pays,

4527
01:50:44,621 --> 01:50:44,831
you know,

4528
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:46,530
for for a couple of day trips.

4529
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:46,990
My God,

4530
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,830
you were wrong.

4531
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:51,280
You're ready for this 1.8 million.

4532
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:51,441
Oh,

4533
01:50:51,441 --> 01:50:52,480
well fuck me running.

4534
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,100
That's insane.

4535
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:59,130
That's for a fish that and what did it
way depleted Bluefin tuna sold for one

4536
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:00,730
point $8 million.

4537
01:51:00,731 --> 01:51:00,941
We didn't,

4538
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:01,361
what does that mean?

4539
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:02,380
It just means that they're there.

4540
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:05,230
They're trying to get them endangered
because there are 500 pound,

4541
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:06,071
a moderate size,

4542
01:51:06,071 --> 01:51:11,071
500 pound bluefin attentive and sold
for an unimaginable price of nearly 1.8

4543
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:13,840
million US dollars.

4544
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,930
A new record at a Tokyo fish auction.

4545
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,720
Yeah.

4546
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:18,800
Wow.

4547
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:19,631
Okay,

4548
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:21,860
so that must be because the,

4549
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,350
the supply is way down know.

4550
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:24,580
Yeah,

4551
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,410
it's it because that
those we need to stop.

4552
01:51:26,411 --> 01:51:26,621
I mean,

4553
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:28,120
as much as I loved Bluefin Tuna,

4554
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:30,750
we need to farm it and we
need to let it rebuild in the,

4555
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:30,941
in the,

4556
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:31,181
in the,

4557
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:31,421
in the,

4558
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:32,050
in the fucking,

4559
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:33,670
if we ever want to fish it again because,

4560
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:34,751
okay.

4561
01:51:34,751 --> 01:51:35,441
But hold on.

4562
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:39,580
There's some fuckery here
at saint supposedly the high
prices paid at the annual

4563
01:51:39,581 --> 01:51:40,241
new year's.

4564
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:41,290
Tuna's auction,

4565
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:44,050
tuna auction in Tokyo
are a way to celebrate,

4566
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:49,270
more likely is about publicity and
do not reflect actual market price.

4567
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:50,711
Nevertheless,

4568
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:54,550
the continued increasing price buyers
are paying for Bluefin tuna mirrors.

4569
01:51:54,551 --> 01:51:55,780
It's increasing rarity.

4570
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:56,231
Okay,

4571
01:51:56,231 --> 01:52:00,010
so this is a really unusual
circumstance for this.

4572
01:52:00,011 --> 01:52:00,940
Probably fuckery.

4573
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:01,661
Yeah,

4574
01:52:01,661 --> 01:52:03,970
they probably did that just so
people are paying attention.

4575
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:04,340
Yeah.

4576
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:06,070
There could be some crazy shit going on.

4577
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:08,260
The old price was pretty
high anyway though.

4578
01:52:08,261 --> 01:52:11,260
The old record was $740,000.

4579
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:11,890
Yeah.

4580
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:13,090
Holy fucking shit.

4581
01:52:13,091 --> 01:52:15,700
And that wasn't even
supposedly fucked with that.

4582
01:52:15,701 --> 01:52:16,900
Supposedly a real record.

4583
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:18,160
That's biggest.

4584
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:18,994
Those things get,

4585
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:20,350
I got to be a thousand pounds.

4586
01:52:20,351 --> 01:52:22,000
I think you gotta be okay.

4587
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:22,601
Let's find out.

4588
01:52:22,601 --> 01:52:23,500
World record tuna.

4589
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,550
I'm scared now.

4590
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,540
I'm thinking of catching it.

4591
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,630
Could you imagine you're just,

4592
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,880
you're in for a fucking fights on
if he's gonna rip your arms off,

4593
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,121
I mean,

4594
01:52:31,121 --> 01:52:34,060
that has a thousand
pound ball or whatever,

4595
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,260
but however many pounds it is,

4596
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,100
ball of muscle that just
wants to eat and I mean,

4597
01:52:39,101 --> 01:52:40,030
those things could eat us.

4598
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,100
Biggest fish I ever caught was a Marlin,

4599
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:43,180
Amanda.

4600
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:43,961
It was not that big.

4601
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:45,320
It was only about 70 pounds,

4602
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,910
but it was,

4603
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:50,480
my oldest daughter was a
vegetarian a little bit.

4604
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:51,560
She's trying to be a vegetarian.

4605
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:52,280
And I was,

4606
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:52,790
uh,

4607
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:53,061
you know,

4608
01:52:53,061 --> 01:52:54,200
she's just a kind person.

4609
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:54,500
Yeah.

4610
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:55,760
And at the time,

4611
01:52:55,761 --> 01:52:57,380
I think she's about probably 12,

4612
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,413
if it makes sense.

4613
01:52:58,790 --> 01:52:59,120
Yeah.

4614
01:52:59,120 --> 01:52:59,953
About 12.

4615
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:00,710
And I say,

4616
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:01,230
you know what,

4617
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:02,570
let's let's go fishing.

4618
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:03,441
And I said,

4619
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:04,310
we'll catch a fish,

4620
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:04,911
we'll cook it,

4621
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:08,690
will eat it and we'll understand sort
of the cycle of life because you know we

4622
01:53:08,691 --> 01:53:11,450
buy things in the supermarket and
we're very disconnected from it.

4623
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:12,950
But you have to understand
like these animals,

4624
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:14,660
they eat each other and this is like,

4625
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:17,300
it's a natural way for people
to acquire food and its way.

4626
01:53:17,301 --> 01:53:18,500
People have done it throughout history,

4627
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,390
but she tried to be like
this really kind person.

4628
01:53:20,391 --> 01:53:20,990
So it was a,

4629
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:22,190
it was a moral reason.

4630
01:53:22,191 --> 01:53:22,980
Like she didn't want her to end.

4631
01:53:22,980 --> 01:53:24,020
Of course she loved animals.

4632
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:24,883
So anyway,

4633
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:25,903
we're fishing,

4634
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:28,940
we fishing for maybe 15 minutes.

4635
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:29,420
Yeah.

4636
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:32,300
And I hook a Marlin maybe 15 minutes.

4637
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:33,134
That's unheard of.

4638
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:35,720
Like people fish for years
and they never catch a Marlin.

4639
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,550
It's total stupid lock.

4640
01:53:37,570 --> 01:53:37,760
Yeah.

4641
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,630
Cause there were trolling,

4642
01:53:38,631 --> 01:53:40,370
it's not like no skill whatsoever.

4643
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,080
It just happened to hit my line.

4644
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:45,200
So we get this mileage
jumping through the air.

4645
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,040
It's wild man.

4646
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:46,700
It's really cool.

4647
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:47,720
It's not that big.

4648
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:48,970
It's only like 70 pounds.

4649
01:53:48,971 --> 01:53:49,290
Yeah.

4650
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:49,680
You know,

4651
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:50,513
maybe.

4652
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,170
Yeah,

4653
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,003
maybe.

4654
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:52,880
I don't know how many feet long,

4655
01:53:52,881 --> 01:53:53,390
but it's about,

4656
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,610
the guy said it was about 75 feet long.

4657
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:57,790
They get hundreds thousand
over a thousand pounds.

4658
01:53:58,040 --> 01:53:59,240
Well this fucking thing,

4659
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,200
they pull it,

4660
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,130
they gaff it,

4661
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:05,960
they bring it in the boat and then they
beat the fucking shit out of it with a

4662
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:06,794
club.

4663
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,120
And the way it works,

4664
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:08,954
we were in Hawaii,

4665
01:54:09,290 --> 01:54:10,130
in Hawaii,

4666
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:10,670
um,

4667
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:11,001
the,

4668
01:54:11,001 --> 01:54:12,530
the owners of the boat,

4669
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:13,690
they own the fish.

4670
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:14,900
Like if you catch fish,

4671
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:16,400
they'll take you and you'll enjoy it.

4672
01:54:16,401 --> 01:54:17,940
But it's also their livelihood.

4673
01:54:17,941 --> 01:54:18,890
It's how they make living.

4674
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:19,724
So it's like,

4675
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:22,250
it's a different sort of a
situation that a lot of charters,

4676
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:22,741
it's like they,

4677
01:54:22,741 --> 01:54:24,530
they want you to have a good time and,

4678
01:54:24,531 --> 01:54:27,320
but we know you're in a resort and this
is our livelihood and we would like the

4679
01:54:27,321 --> 01:54:27,801
food too.

4680
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:28,430
Is that cool?

4681
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:28,941
And everybody's like,

4682
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:29,091
yeah,

4683
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:29,331
it's cool.

4684
01:54:29,331 --> 01:54:32,810
Cause otherwise like sometimes the food
would go to waste and that's terrible.

4685
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:36,680
And I think they recognize that really
early and they put the Kabash on it and

4686
01:54:36,681 --> 01:54:37,011
they said,

4687
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:37,191
look,

4688
01:54:37,191 --> 01:54:38,510
people are just trying to have some fun.

4689
01:54:38,630 --> 01:54:39,650
Let's have them have some fun,

4690
01:54:39,651 --> 01:54:40,131
catch the fish,

4691
01:54:40,131 --> 01:54:40,964
but we'll eat the fish.

4692
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,020
So they were gonna take it and apparently
they bring it to a Luau and they

4693
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:45,854
smoked the Moreland.

4694
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:48,080
And my poor little 12 year
old is just sitting there.

4695
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:50,950
And while this Marlin kitchen hope love,

4696
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:54,050
and it's a big animal,

4697
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,410
I mean it's in a boat with us and it's
a fairly big beautiful animal that once

4698
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:57,861
you kill it,

4699
01:54:57,861 --> 01:54:58,790
the color goes away.

4700
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:59,270
Yeah.

4701
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,770
And it's the size of a dog.

4702
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:01,720
It's like,

4703
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,530
it's like a golden retriever size.

4704
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:05,760
Wheaton it with clubs and it's,

4705
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:07,130
it's real man.

4706
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:07,911
Some real shit.

4707
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:10,280
And when you're a 12 year old
girl wanted to be a vegetarian,

4708
01:55:10,281 --> 01:55:10,760
that's like,

4709
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,020
that's a fucked up thing to say.

4710
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:12,220
Yeah.

4711
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:13,430
It didn't die right away either,

4712
01:55:13,431 --> 01:55:14,150
man.

4713
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,200
It was flopping around,

4714
01:55:15,201 --> 01:55:16,490
they had ice on it and it did.

4715
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:17,660
It was fine.

4716
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,620
It wasn't moving at all.

4717
01:55:18,621 --> 01:55:20,230
And then I saw out of nowhere to fuck off,

4718
01:55:20,231 --> 01:55:20,351
off,

4719
01:55:20,351 --> 01:55:20,471
off,

4720
01:55:20,471 --> 01:55:20,621
off,

4721
01:55:20,621 --> 01:55:20,771
off,

4722
01:55:20,771 --> 01:55:20,921
off,

4723
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:21,081
off,

4724
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:21,800
off.

4725
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,020
It was devastating,

4726
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:24,861
devastating.

4727
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:27,230
And we didn't catch another fucking
thing for the rest of the trip.

4728
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,341
We caught this one,

4729
01:55:28,341 --> 01:55:29,030
Marlin.

4730
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:32,090
And then the rest of the day was just
looking down at this murder victim was in

4731
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:32,924
the boat.

4732
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:34,640
They're dead.

4733
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,980
And then afterwards
taking photos together.

4734
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:40,160
This is like really a
weird look on her face.

4735
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,950
Those fucking murder victim
that we clubbed to death.

4736
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,060
We didn't clubbed to death,

4737
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:46,470
but we aided and abetted.

4738
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:47,010
Yeah,

4739
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,090
tricked it into the boat.

4740
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:49,980
But they're uh,

4741
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,870
apparently you can't eat Marlin.

4742
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:52,740
Like I didn't know.

4743
01:55:52,741 --> 01:55:53,760
I didn't know you can't eat them,

4744
01:55:53,761 --> 01:55:54,690
but apparently you can.

4745
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,920
What is the size of that one?

4746
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:57,900
920 pound tuna caught last week.

4747
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,550
Oh my God.

4748
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:01,140
Look at that thing.

4749
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:01,351
Oh,

4750
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:02,460
I hope my dad's watching this.

4751
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,331
What a fuck.

4752
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:06,240
And they have to attach
it to a fucking crane,

4753
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:08,670
ladies and gentlemen to
get it out of the water.

4754
01:56:08,671 --> 01:56:10,290
They hook it up to a crane.

4755
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:12,980
I love Kimmy Fishman.

4756
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,460
Killin fishes is a good time.

4757
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:14,641
Well,

4758
01:56:14,641 --> 01:56:16,110
if you grew up near the ocean,

4759
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:18,840
did it look at the size
of this fucking thing?

4760
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,120
Oh my God,

4761
01:56:21,150 --> 01:56:21,990
that's a tuna.

4762
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,130
That's incredible.

4763
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:25,050
What a big animal.

4764
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:25,943
Jesus.

4765
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:28,530
I mean that thing you think of the speed,

4766
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:32,580
those things get so big they die off
because they can't get enough food.

4767
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,680
They just eat and eat and eat.

4768
01:56:34,681 --> 01:56:34,891
That's,

4769
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:36,390
that's their whole life is spent hunting.

4770
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:37,660
I mean,

4771
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:38,493
they are like,

4772
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:39,150
you know,

4773
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:39,983
vicious.

4774
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,390
What is the biggest one ever?

4775
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:43,743
I have no idea.

4776
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,220
Oh,

4777
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:48,030
we've got to find out now because the
biggest two never caught it's gotta be

4778
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:49,351
that one was what?

4779
01:56:49,351 --> 01:56:53,130
900 what it's gotta be
maybe 12 1300 pounds,

4780
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:53,870
I would think.

4781
01:56:53,870 --> 01:56:54,260
Well,

4782
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:54,900
let's see.

4783
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,580
What's the world record tune await.

4784
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:59,340
They're so cool looking to man.

4785
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:03,630
Can you imagine if there was like tuna
that had four legs and when run down a

4786
01:57:03,631 --> 01:57:05,310
field looking like that?

4787
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:06,800
Glistening and blue.

4788
01:57:06,801 --> 01:57:08,160
Just running like a bullet.

4789
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,610
Fucking up every other animal
in his path at pack hunting.

4790
01:57:11,611 --> 01:57:13,080
Just eating lions and shits.

4791
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:18,510
Managing of a fucking tuna could run
on ground as fast as it could swim.

4792
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:19,891
That's frightening.

4793
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:20,280
I,

4794
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:20,750
yeah,

4795
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:22,530
I always think of weird shit like that.

4796
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:23,363
Like about the fucking,

4797
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,270
what if parents were the size of,

4798
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:28,480
and they walked off
for us like dogs and I,

4799
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:30,360
I'm afraid of birds in general
cause they always hate me.

4800
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:31,800
But you should be afraid of birds.

4801
01:57:31,801 --> 01:57:32,670
Birds are cunts.

4802
01:57:32,730 --> 01:57:32,881
Yeah.

4803
01:57:32,881 --> 01:57:34,140
And the evil man.

4804
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,960
And they're vicious killers.

4805
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:37,201
Yeah.

4806
01:57:37,201 --> 01:57:38,520
They fucking art man.

4807
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:39,280
They're,

4808
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,113
they're creepy.

4809
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:41,300
The creepy animal.

4810
01:57:41,301 --> 01:57:42,000
Sorry.

4811
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,630
You know,

4812
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:44,400
they don't really give
a fuck about anything.

4813
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,531
I mean they're,

4814
01:57:45,531 --> 01:57:50,531
they're in a real survival of
the fittest gene pool situation.

4815
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:51,070
Yeah.

4816
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:51,903
You know,

4817
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,540
we're just lucky that
they're not that big.

4818
01:57:55,130 --> 01:57:57,090
He management birds like
the size of giraffes.

4819
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,040
If Eagles like the size of the giraffes,

4820
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:01,080
they would be eating people all day.

4821
01:58:01,110 --> 01:58:02,160
Nothing we could do to stop him.

4822
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:02,641
We'd have,

4823
01:58:02,641 --> 01:58:03,810
we'd have to kill them all.

4824
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,880
And it sounds like a
ridiculous thing to say.

4825
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:09,400
Marriage in the world of two
and who could run the world?

4826
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:10,530
Egos and size of drafts.

4827
01:58:10,531 --> 01:58:11,640
Well guess what asshole.

4828
01:58:11,730 --> 01:58:13,380
A giraffe's the size of a giraffe.

4829
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,220
Okay.

4830
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:15,720
There are animals that are that big.

4831
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:17,520
We're just lucky they don't eat people.

4832
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:17,820
Definitely.

4833
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:18,990
We're lucky they're not against us.

4834
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:20,880
We probably would've never got
to this place that they did.

4835
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:23,560
I don't know where we're,

4836
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:24,450
we're kinda tricky.

4837
01:58:24,451 --> 01:58:24,691
We've,

4838
01:58:24,691 --> 01:58:26,130
we've seem to Conaway this far.

4839
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,140
I really don't think
it would have happened.

4840
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,001
I think we,

4841
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:29,330
we,

4842
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:31,320
we came along like the premiere,

4843
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:35,010
like boxes that became heavyweights
after Mike Tyson and lost his prime.

4844
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,410
I like finding a gap.

4845
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:40,890
We were like falling into
this like relaxed period.

4846
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,050
My way through this.

4847
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,851
Through evolution.

4848
01:58:42,851 --> 01:58:44,540
It was way easier to survive ourselves.

4849
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,150
Dinosaurs got hit by that rock,

4850
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,260
you know,

4851
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:49,810
after buster Douglas came
along and he shrunk Tyson,

4852
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:51,280
the world got a little safer.

4853
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:52,210
You know,

4854
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,640
back in those days I cried myself
to sleep and that happened.

4855
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:58,120
It was a weird thing to see because
I watched it after the fact.

4856
01:58:58,121 --> 01:58:59,260
I didn't see the fight live.

4857
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:01,610
I had heard what happened and I
still didn't believe it happened.

4858
01:59:01,611 --> 01:59:02,470
Now I was watching it.

4859
01:59:02,471 --> 01:59:02,681
I was like,

4860
01:59:02,681 --> 01:59:03,251
he's going to get up.

4861
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:04,150
He's going to kick his ass.

4862
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:05,171
That's my game.

4863
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:06,760
My brother both literally cried.

4864
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:07,773
I turned around,

4865
01:59:07,790 --> 01:59:08,440
I cried.

4866
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:10,030
I like bawling to our parents.

4867
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:10,450
Like,

4868
01:59:10,450 --> 01:59:10,850
why,

4869
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:11,151
why,

4870
01:59:11,151 --> 01:59:11,980
why?

4871
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:12,850
Why did that happen?

4872
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:17,120
I couldn't remember the last time I got
emotionally attached to a fight and I

4873
01:59:17,121 --> 01:59:21,400
was devastated when a fighter lost it
was Mike Mccallum when he knocked out

4874
01:59:21,401 --> 01:59:22,234
Donald Curry.

4875
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:23,890
I was a big Donald Curry fan.

4876
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,040
Donald Curry was the welterweight
champion at the time.

4877
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:26,551
Donald McKinney,

4878
01:59:26,551 --> 01:59:27,910
I think he went up to one 54.

4879
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:31,510
Donald Curry like ruined his career
because he kept cutting weight down to one

4880
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:32,260
47.

4881
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:33,490
Couldn't do it anymore.

4882
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:34,990
He couldn't do it anymore.

4883
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,153
He had um,

4884
01:59:36,610 --> 01:59:38,500
those fights with a,

4885
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:39,361
not Macau,

4886
01:59:39,361 --> 01:59:40,210
but who was the other,

4887
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:41,620
there was another like really strong,

4888
01:59:41,621 --> 01:59:46,390
well Twitter Cronk fighter from that
era and he'd knocked that dude out and

4889
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:47,460
Donald Curry merge.

4890
01:59:47,461 --> 01:59:49,150
It's like the top pound for pound guy.

4891
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:52,330
But then he fought Lloyd Huntington
and he was just too dehydrated.

4892
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:53,430
He couldn't fucking do it anymore.

4893
01:59:53,431 --> 01:59:54,610
It just wasn't the same guy.

4894
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:55,391
And everybody's like,

4895
01:59:55,391 --> 01:59:56,860
that's the top pound for pound fighter.

4896
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:58,870
And that one beating to Lloyd Huntington,

4897
01:59:59,170 --> 01:59:59,700
never,

4898
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:00,730
he never was the same again.

4899
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:04,330
He went up to one 54 and then he
didn't have the physical advantages.

4900
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:09,260
And you had it 47 and when you see
the UFC and you see like that this is,

4901
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:12,180
especially in a higher way classes,

4902
02:00:12,190 --> 02:00:13,480
there's know big gaps,

4903
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:13,870
huge.

4904
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,940
And between the way classes,

4905
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,150
what would you like it,

4906
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,140
how would you,

4907
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:17,830
if you,

4908
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:22,480
if someone could like allow you to
create the optimum weight divisions,

4909
02:00:22,481 --> 02:00:23,470
what do you think it would be?

4910
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:25,473
I mean,

4911
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:28,480
she just don't want too many,

4912
02:00:28,870 --> 02:00:29,201
you know?

4913
02:00:29,201 --> 02:00:30,370
But I think there would be,

4914
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:34,600
we would really figure out who
is pound for pound the best,

4915
02:00:34,630 --> 02:00:35,080
you know?

4916
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:36,040
But at the same time,

4917
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:37,570
maybe 10 pounds cause boxing,

4918
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:39,040
there's so many champions he just gets,

4919
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:40,450
it gets diluted.

4920
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:40,930
You know,

4921
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:43,690
in boxing is a sport in general is
a box that has a bunch of different

4922
02:00:43,691 --> 02:00:44,630
sanctioning buddies too.

4923
02:00:44,631 --> 02:00:45,850
That's where it gets really weird.

4924
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:46,751
It's almost weird.

4925
02:00:46,751 --> 02:00:47,520
Are there?

4926
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:47,760
Yeah.

4927
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,500
Because of that than it is because
of the amount of weight classes.

4928
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:50,771
Yeah.

4929
02:00:50,771 --> 02:00:51,291
Oh it's,

4930
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:51,530
it's,

4931
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:51,790
it's a,

4932
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:52,623
it's a,

4933
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,320
all of it.

4934
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:54,940
It's just all a cluster fuck,

4935
02:00:55,240 --> 02:00:55,620
you know?

4936
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:55,850
Yeah.

4937
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:57,790
People don't realize how many
weight classes there aren't boxing,

4938
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:58,511
but it's crazy.

4939
02:00:58,511 --> 02:01:00,220
And they start at like one oh six right,

4940
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:00,780
isn't it?

4941
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:01,240
What's,

4942
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:03,430
what's like light flyweight it's
to be something that's like it's,

4943
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:08,410
I know I started like really light and
they go all the way up to one 95 and then

4944
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:09,910
heavyweight and that's the deviation.

4945
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:11,980
Like the USC the only gap they have.

4946
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:15,530
It's more interesting as the
two oh five to two 65 yeah.

4947
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:19,450
That's where they need to put at least
I think a weight class at two 40 or

4948
02:01:19,451 --> 02:01:19,850
something too.

4949
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:22,450
And I think also in between 85
and two oh five it would be good.

4950
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,201
I think have to tell you.

4951
02:01:23,201 --> 02:01:24,310
I could see that because you know,

4952
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:25,810
just making every 10 pounds.

4953
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:26,913
I think so too.

4954
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:28,091
I think so too.

4955
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:32,230
And I think that the big example of
that is between 55 and one 70 that's

4956
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:35,260
especially as you get low in
percentage of body weight.

4957
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:36,011
That's those,

4958
02:01:36,011 --> 02:01:36,940
those jumps,

4959
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:38,920
the between that one and
the one 85 to light heavy.

4960
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,060
Those are big jumps in

4961
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,340
math.

4962
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,760
15 pounds is a uh,

4963
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,010
is a lot of person.

4964
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,083
Yeah.

4965
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,010
And it's also,

4966
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:49,370
you're seeing these guys who are
making these cuts to get to two oh five

4967
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:50,510
salaried guy like Jon Jones.

4968
02:01:50,511 --> 02:01:53,480
He's coming down from
like two 25 to 30 yeah,

4969
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:58,720
like big shit at two oh five and if
you're like Kinda like don't want to cut

4970
02:01:59,001 --> 02:02:02,660
weight but you're really a
one 80 fiver and you find him,

4971
02:02:03,410 --> 02:02:03,741
you go,

4972
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:05,030
Oh God no,

4973
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:06,200
I got to lose the weight now.

4974
02:02:06,230 --> 02:02:08,540
Like you gotta you gotta
be realistic about this.

4975
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:11,570
And especially because the
way the sport's evolved,

4976
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:15,280
people get stuck in certain weight classes
because they're good for that weight

4977
02:02:15,281 --> 02:02:18,890
class and then they try and cut weight
or they try and gain weight and then they

4978
02:02:18,891 --> 02:02:21,890
end up not having the advantages
you know of of that they had,

4979
02:02:21,891 --> 02:02:25,250
they had before and they don't work
on it or they don't have it at all.

4980
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:26,120
They just can't get it.

4981
02:02:26,121 --> 02:02:29,690
So then they ended up getting beat up by
someone smaller or something like that.

4982
02:02:29,691 --> 02:02:31,640
What is it like to be a part of this,

4983
02:02:31,641 --> 02:02:33,410
this sport right now for you?

4984
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:37,820
Like as a top level professional fighter
because it's a really interesting time

4985
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,500
as far as the sport,

4986
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:40,170
like it's,

4987
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:42,890
it's evolved to this point where there's,

4988
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:48,050
there's clearly like the best athletes
that have ever been involved in MMA or

4989
02:02:48,051 --> 02:02:48,950
involved in and me now.

4990
02:02:48,951 --> 02:02:52,310
And the higher the level of fighting
and competition is as high as it's ever

4991
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:52,761
been before.

4992
02:02:52,761 --> 02:02:53,594
Now how by far,

4993
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:57,350
but you've had a chance to see it
from the outside for a long ass time.

4994
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:58,101
Like what is,

4995
02:02:58,101 --> 02:02:59,330
what is it like for you now,

4996
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,081
you know,

4997
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:01,260
the evolution of,

4998
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:01,731
of the,

4999
02:03:01,731 --> 02:03:02,130
of the,

5000
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:04,490
the people of the fighters.

5001
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,661
I think as a,

5002
02:03:05,661 --> 02:03:06,494
as a country,

5003
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:08,390
I think we're getting pussified,

5004
02:03:08,391 --> 02:03:08,571
you know,

5005
02:03:08,571 --> 02:03:09,680
kids aren't allowed to get in fist fights.

5006
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:11,960
I think it's a rite of passage for
young men to get in fist fights,

5007
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:12,501
you know,

5008
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:13,360
and not jumping each other.

5009
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,211
I'm talking no weapons,

5010
02:03:14,211 --> 02:03:14,480
just,

5011
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:14,991
you know,

5012
02:03:14,991 --> 02:03:16,730
just Duke it out and
deal with your problems.

5013
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:18,260
Some people don't want to do that though.

5014
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:20,400
And they don't want to be
harassed by people who want to be,

5015
02:03:20,401 --> 02:03:21,101
if they don't want it,

5016
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:21,611
they don't want to do.

5017
02:03:21,611 --> 02:03:22,490
They shouldn't have to.

5018
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:23,001
Right.

5019
02:03:23,001 --> 02:03:24,410
But how do you stop that though?

5020
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:25,380
The exactly.

5021
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:26,080
I Dunno,

5022
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,410
it's,

5023
02:03:26,410 --> 02:03:27,530
but that's not been just saying,

5024
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:28,281
but we're,

5025
02:03:28,281 --> 02:03:29,900
we're building better athletes in the gym,

5026
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:32,150
but we have to now.

5027
02:03:32,151 --> 02:03:32,781
Now I,

5028
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:33,140
which I,

5029
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:33,370
I,

5030
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:34,610
I get as a good thing.

5031
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:35,511
We,

5032
02:03:35,511 --> 02:03:36,830
if we want to build a tough kid,

5033
02:03:36,980 --> 02:03:37,940
if we want to make him tough,

5034
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:38,930
we'll blow them in the gym.

5035
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:42,860
And that maybe you know that that is a
good thing because not only is he going

5036
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:43,341
to be tough,

5037
02:03:43,341 --> 02:03:45,520
but he's not going to be a
dick like I used to be know.

5038
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:46,880
Because like I said,

5039
02:03:46,881 --> 02:03:50,180
I started out beating up bullies and
then I ended up just being a bully.

5040
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:51,280
You know?

5041
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,120
I'm glad you're really honest about that,

5042
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:53,421
man.

5043
02:03:53,421 --> 02:03:55,820
I think that's really
important because I think,

5044
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,391
you know,

5045
02:03:56,391 --> 02:03:59,420
there's a lot of kids out there that
are fighting that watch guy like you and

5046
02:03:59,421 --> 02:04:03,110
look up to you and when maybe they might
be on a similar path and they hear that

5047
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:04,520
and they can learn from your mistakes.

5048
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:04,730
Yeah,

5049
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,800
I've made just about
every mistake that it is,

5050
02:04:06,801 --> 02:04:07,430
you know,

5051
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:09,830
whether it's that or Diana Diana of drugs,

5052
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:10,070
you know,

5053
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:12,620
drug overdose or whatever or whatever.

5054
02:04:12,621 --> 02:04:14,020
I've done a lot of things and it's just,

5055
02:04:14,021 --> 02:04:14,390
it's,

5056
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:17,150
there's so many things that
I feel like I can share.

5057
02:04:17,570 --> 02:04:18,403
Um,

5058
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,341
and it do,

5059
02:04:19,341 --> 02:04:20,810
I can help one person change.

5060
02:04:20,811 --> 02:04:21,031
That'll be,

5061
02:04:21,031 --> 02:04:21,610
that'll work.

5062
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:21,940
You know,

5063
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:22,330
little,

5064
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:24,110
obviously I'd like to
help as many as possible,

5065
02:04:24,111 --> 02:04:25,110
but um,

5066
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:25,401
you know,

5067
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:27,170
just try and,

5068
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:27,770
you know,

5069
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,090
especially with the people
that are closest to me,

5070
02:04:29,091 --> 02:04:30,560
like we've got some amateur
guys that I'm trying to,

5071
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:33,440
trying to just turn into super
athletes and they already are,

5072
02:04:33,441 --> 02:04:36,440
but just get them focused and
ready and not make any mistakes.

5073
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,010
It's very difficult for a

5074
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:41,370
fighter to transition
from being a fighter too,

5075
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:47,030
like mainstream life to going back to
being like a regular person with a regular

5076
02:04:48,151 --> 02:04:52,800
job who you know doesn't have those
big crazy thrills every few months.

5077
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:53,461
You know,

5078
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:57,260
you just have sort of like
this weird steady drip of of,

5079
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:02,340
of life juice instead of
this wild rollercoaster rush
that everybody knows you

5080
02:05:02,521 --> 02:05:03,720
can only stay on for so long.

5081
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:04,260
Yeah,

5082
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:09,060
but the thing that I always try to stress
with people is that like one of the

5083
02:05:09,061 --> 02:05:13,710
best things about martial arts is the
development of the ability to do something

5084
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:14,011
good,

5085
02:05:14,011 --> 02:05:16,620
to be good at something and know what
it's like to be good at something.

5086
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:17,700
And then from there,

5087
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:19,380
like you knew how hard it was to get good.

5088
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:20,340
You didn't start out good,

5089
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,390
you started out Shitty,

5090
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:23,810
but you got better and he
got better and you get that.

5091
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:25,590
That understanding of that is,

5092
02:05:25,650 --> 02:05:27,240
it's so important for everything.

5093
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:29,250
Don't look at like the finish line and go,

5094
02:05:29,251 --> 02:05:30,300
I'm never going to get there.

5095
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:34,320
Look at progress and you can get anywhere
as long as there's not some crazy

5096
02:05:34,321 --> 02:05:35,240
physical limitation.

5097
02:05:35,330 --> 02:05:35,591
Yeah.

5098
02:05:35,591 --> 02:05:35,721
That,

5099
02:05:35,721 --> 02:05:36,020
that's,

5100
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:36,741
that's what I tell people,

5101
02:05:36,741 --> 02:05:38,930
cause they always turn
to me for rehab stories,

5102
02:05:38,931 --> 02:05:39,061
you know,

5103
02:05:39,061 --> 02:05:40,010
the drunk stories or whatever.

5104
02:05:40,011 --> 02:05:42,800
Cause I had been to
two rehabs and whatnot.

5105
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:43,663
How old are you?

5106
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,420
29.

5107
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:46,370
How old were you when you
went through your first rehab?

5108
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:49,280
I was 19,

5109
02:05:49,281 --> 02:05:49,730
I think.

5110
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,210
Wow.

5111
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:51,043
What was it for?

5112
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:51,680
Um,

5113
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:52,610
I got caught with,

5114
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:53,900
with some pills and then,

5115
02:05:53,901 --> 02:05:54,260
uh,

5116
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,093
I was appeal guy.

5117
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:55,730
Um,

5118
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:57,800
and then it was just through the court.

5119
02:05:58,070 --> 02:06:00,890
I had to check in and I got kicked out
of some like class things and they,

5120
02:06:00,900 --> 02:06:01,641
and they put me in like,

5121
02:06:01,641 --> 02:06:01,810
uh,

5122
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:02,170
uh,

5123
02:06:02,170 --> 02:06:02,480
uh,

5124
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,740
outpatient rehab program.

5125
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,060
And then I ended up,

5126
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:05,923
um,

5127
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:07,190
the second one was,

5128
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:08,360
you know,

5129
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:12,900
before in between WBC and tachy when I,

5130
02:06:12,901 --> 02:06:13,161
you know,

5131
02:06:13,161 --> 02:06:14,060
became world champ.

5132
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:15,283
Um,

5133
02:06:15,770 --> 02:06:16,603
I got in trouble,

5134
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:17,541
you know,

5135
02:06:17,541 --> 02:06:18,231
got arrested,

5136
02:06:18,231 --> 02:06:21,710
was looking at probably going to prison
for like three to five for just doing

5137
02:06:21,711 --> 02:06:22,160
some dumb shit.

5138
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:22,993
And then I had,

5139
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:23,661
I had a record,

5140
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:26,560
so me doing anything bad
but put me in prison.

5141
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:28,760
So I checked myself into
Rehab and they were like,

5142
02:06:28,761 --> 02:06:29,421
oh good job,

5143
02:06:29,421 --> 02:06:29,861
little buddy.

5144
02:06:29,861 --> 02:06:30,621
And they'll pat on the head,

5145
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:31,700
you can stay there for six months.

5146
02:06:31,701 --> 02:06:32,534
And it was live in and,

5147
02:06:32,830 --> 02:06:34,370
and at first it was just escape,

5148
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,620
just to scapegoat for
me not to go to prison.

5149
02:06:36,650 --> 02:06:37,790
But then it actually helps,

5150
02:06:37,791 --> 02:06:38,001
you know,

5151
02:06:38,001 --> 02:06:38,930
the people there helped me.

5152
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,760
They'll program helped
me to actually getting,

5153
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:41,983
getting my,

5154
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:42,800
uh,

5155
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,140
just to just help me get my life
together and I had to be sober,

5156
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:45,891
you know?

5157
02:06:45,891 --> 02:06:47,210
And I stayed sober for a long time,

5158
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:47,481
you know,

5159
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:48,314
and it was,

5160
02:06:48,470 --> 02:06:48,860
it was,

5161
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,161
it was,

5162
02:06:49,161 --> 02:06:49,910
it was good for me,

5163
02:06:49,910 --> 02:06:50,743
you know,

5164
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:51,371
it did.

5165
02:06:51,371 --> 02:06:51,510
I,

5166
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:56,390
it actually gave me some perspective on
life because I was just such a mess for

5167
02:06:56,391 --> 02:06:56,930
so long.

5168
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:57,470
But isn't it

5169
02:06:57,470 --> 02:07:01,830
crazy to be a guy who is such a Masson's
a wild and with like this really self

5170
02:07:01,831 --> 02:07:03,860
destructive style of living,

5171
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:04,480
especially with,

5172
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,320
with regards to drugs and your body,

5173
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:07,393
but you're a professional.

5174
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:08,253
Lastly,

5175
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:10,200
a high level professional athletes.

5176
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,320
How it works for so long.

5177
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:11,641
Yeah.

5178
02:07:11,641 --> 02:07:13,110
How the fuck did it work for so long?

5179
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:13,973
Um,

5180
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:15,050
I,

5181
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:15,660
I,

5182
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:16,800
I don't know really.

5183
02:07:16,801 --> 02:07:17,361
I mean I'm,

5184
02:07:17,361 --> 02:07:18,720
I'm like a cockroach or something.

5185
02:07:18,780 --> 02:07:19,141
There's something,

5186
02:07:19,141 --> 02:07:19,680
something,

5187
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,910
there's something inherently,

5188
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:22,500
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

5189
02:07:22,501 --> 02:07:23,790
I hope nobody tries to imitate it.

5190
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:23,970
Yeah.

5191
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:24,331
Do not,

5192
02:07:24,331 --> 02:07:25,380
do not do what I've done.

5193
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:25,951
They'll learn,

5194
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:26,820
learn from that.

5195
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,510
Don't do that.

5196
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:28,590
I'm a walking mistake.

5197
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:29,101
Go to the gym,

5198
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:29,760
Bitch.

5199
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:30,151
Exactly.

5200
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:30,984
The gym first.

5201
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:32,760
If I would have spent those extra,

5202
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:36,280
I mean hours that I was doing stupid

5203
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,113
things.

5204
02:07:37,300 --> 02:07:37,661
I believe me,

5205
02:07:37,661 --> 02:07:37,831
I've,

5206
02:07:37,831 --> 02:07:41,440
I've done calculations to
everything I could have put in that,

5207
02:07:41,441 --> 02:07:44,590
that cause they say it's 10,000
hours to master something,

5208
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:45,040
you know?

5209
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:45,291
Right.

5210
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:50,140
So I could have put an extra 10,000 hours
into Jiu Jitsu and extra 10,000 and to

5211
02:07:50,141 --> 02:07:52,120
kickboxing and extra
10,000 and the wrestling.

5212
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,050
If I would've done that because
I've been training for that long,

5213
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:57,220
I could have fit that in there.

5214
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:58,330
I would be,

5215
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,340
I would make everyone else look silly.

5216
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:05,170
Well don't you think though
that the something about
you that is the way you are

5217
02:08:05,171 --> 02:08:07,180
because of the adversity
that you've gone through?

5218
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:07,310
Oh,

5219
02:08:07,310 --> 02:08:08,560
of course I wouldn't change a thing.

5220
02:08:08,561 --> 02:08:09,580
I'm just saying that right,

5221
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:10,423
but isn't that weird?

5222
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:12,040
You know,

5223
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:12,711
I just like,

5224
02:08:12,711 --> 02:08:13,680
I would be the motherfucker.

5225
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:15,370
Motherfucker thought I'd be a choir boy.

5226
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:17,830
Crazy from that cause I
wasn't doing anything nuts.

5227
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:18,130
Yeah,

5228
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:18,670
I would.

5229
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:18,881
Yeah.

5230
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:19,121
And then,

5231
02:08:19,121 --> 02:08:19,810
and then this,

5232
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:20,171
then this,

5233
02:08:20,171 --> 02:08:23,140
this piece would show up now and it
would just blow it all that happens.

5234
02:08:23,141 --> 02:08:23,921
So a lot of guys too,

5235
02:08:23,921 --> 02:08:24,370
right?

5236
02:08:24,370 --> 02:08:24,730
They,

5237
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:26,440
they get it instead of on the way up.

5238
02:08:26,441 --> 02:08:26,831
They get it.

5239
02:08:26,831 --> 02:08:27,664
Once they get up,

5240
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:28,603
get there and they're like,

5241
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:28,961
oh,

5242
02:08:28,961 --> 02:08:29,794
this is too much fun.

5243
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:31,570
It never given you money.

5244
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:31,901
Yeah.

5245
02:08:31,901 --> 02:08:34,840
There's a lot of those dudes out there
like they should've never given you

5246
02:08:34,841 --> 02:08:35,674
money.

5247
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:37,870
Especially crazy wild,

5248
02:08:37,871 --> 02:08:40,870
impulsive athletes and fighters
like the Tyson stories.

5249
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:41,470
So the most,

5250
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:42,670
the dude got tigers,

5251
02:08:42,671 --> 02:08:43,504
he had his own talkers.

5252
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:46,330
He was like the most legendary
stories of spending money.

5253
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:47,380
$200 million.

5254
02:08:48,040 --> 02:08:48,671
Where did it go?

5255
02:08:48,671 --> 02:08:50,940
Seen his show that he does that.

5256
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:51,270
No,

5257
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:52,000
he's a stand up show.

5258
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:52,850
His one man show.

5259
02:08:52,851 --> 02:08:53,420
I heard it.

5260
02:08:53,420 --> 02:08:54,280
I heard it's awesome.

5261
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:55,200
I heard it's incredible.

5262
02:08:55,201 --> 02:08:55,481
I want to,

5263
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:56,021
I really want to,

5264
02:08:56,021 --> 02:08:57,550
Dana white called me up after he goes,

5265
02:08:57,551 --> 02:08:57,761
dude,

5266
02:08:57,761 --> 02:08:59,620
it's one of the greatest things
I've ever seen in my life.

5267
02:08:59,620 --> 02:08:59,861
He goes,

5268
02:08:59,861 --> 02:09:01,210
it's fucking amazing.

5269
02:09:01,330 --> 02:09:01,780
He goes,

5270
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,411
Spike Lee,

5271
02:09:02,411 --> 02:09:03,360
I guess direct it.

5272
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:04,130
Is that what happened?

5273
02:09:04,130 --> 02:09:04,850
And they just,

5274
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:05,740
they put it together.

5275
02:09:05,741 --> 02:09:06,790
It's a fucking show,

5276
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:07,320
you know?

5277
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,920
And it's just him,

5278
02:09:08,921 --> 02:09:09,310
isn't it?

5279
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:09,730
Yeah.

5280
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:10,720
He puts up a number.

5281
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:11,021
It's with,

5282
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:12,550
it's 200 or $300 million,

5283
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:16,270
puts up a number on the thing and
it's like this giant screen and goes,

5284
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:17,800
that's how my time lost

5285
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:22,840
$300 million or 200 million or whatever.

5286
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:24,670
There was 100 million,

5287
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:25,210
whatever.

5288
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:26,410
So same amount of money.

5289
02:09:26,411 --> 02:09:27,200
You just spent it?

5290
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:27,640
Yeah.

5291
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,630
He just spent it

5292
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:32,260
and crashed it and then
gave it to the cop.

5293
02:09:32,430 --> 02:09:33,263
Yeah,

5294
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:35,110
like tainted if it's all scratched up.

5295
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:36,581
I was like,

5296
02:09:36,581 --> 02:09:37,414
not interested.

5297
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:38,890
This thing's a piece of shit now.

5298
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:39,724
I really want it.

5299
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:41,950
There you have it and it cost
me a hundred grand to fix.

5300
02:09:41,980 --> 02:09:43,360
He used to wear furs and shit.

5301
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:46,390
He used to walk around
like Jack Dempsey style,

5302
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:47,380
like with the hat,

5303
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:50,800
like Jack Johnson when Jack Johnson was
the heavyweight champion was hanging out

5304
02:09:50,801 --> 02:09:51,634
with all these white chicks.

5305
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:53,651
Nobody did it.

5306
02:09:53,651 --> 02:09:58,651
They were trying to make those laws so
he could just state people don't even

5307
02:09:58,721 --> 02:10:00,130
know if you ever seen,

5308
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:02,440
was it unforgivable blackness?

5309
02:10:02,441 --> 02:10:03,850
Is that what the documentary is called?

5310
02:10:03,851 --> 02:10:05,020
What is the documentary called?

5311
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:07,900
I need to quote it because
it's an amazing documentary.

5312
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:10,150
I'll just blackness.

5313
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:11,050
Jack Johnson.

5314
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,441
Boy,

5315
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:13,250
am I going to jail for
fucking do a Google search?

5316
02:10:13,251 --> 02:10:14,084
I'm my show.

5317
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:15,821
Yeah,

5318
02:10:15,821 --> 02:10:16,200
I don't,

5319
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:16,480
um,

5320
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,410
I don't remember who made it.

5321
02:10:17,411 --> 02:10:18,760
I want to say it was Ken Burns.

5322
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:20,550
Okay.

5323
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,031
Cause you know,

5324
02:10:21,031 --> 02:10:23,430
he does a lot of those
unforgivable blackness.

5325
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,350
That's what it's called.

5326
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,673
MMM.

5327
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:29,000
Is it Ken Burns?

5328
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:31,570
I don't know if I saw
it as Ken Burns movie,

5329
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:32,900
but I saw it read pretty recently.

5330
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,081
Oh,

5331
02:10:33,081 --> 02:10:33,914
it's amazing.

5332
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:35,173
It's amazing.

5333
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:36,013
It's incredible.

5334
02:10:36,140 --> 02:10:36,620
I mean you've got,

5335
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:41,620
people don't realize what a bad mother
fucker this guy was and what incredible

5336
02:10:42,111 --> 02:10:44,360
racism he encountered,

5337
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:48,530
like the racism that fighter's encountered
today or people encountered today.

5338
02:10:48,531 --> 02:10:49,910
Like here's a perfect example,

5339
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:51,860
the recent thing with Oprah Winfrey,

5340
02:10:51,861 --> 02:10:52,730
do you know about this thing?

5341
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:53,593
No,

5342
02:10:53,690 --> 02:10:54,321
it's,

5343
02:10:54,321 --> 02:10:54,980
you know,

5344
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,970
they shouldn't have done it.

5345
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:58,940
She went to a store in
Switzerland or some shit.

5346
02:10:58,970 --> 02:10:59,803
Is that where it was?

5347
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:01,701
And um,

5348
02:11:01,701 --> 02:11:02,150
she,

5349
02:11:02,150 --> 02:11:02,900
there was a purse,

5350
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:06,500
it was a very expensive purse and she
asked to see it and the store clerks said,

5351
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:06,741
oh,

5352
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:08,120
you can't afford that purse.

5353
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:10,070
You don't only want to
look at it like we should.

5354
02:11:10,071 --> 02:11:11,540
You should look at something less money.

5355
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:12,830
And Roper was like,

5356
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:13,820
Oh shit.

5357
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:14,653
Really?

5358
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:14,901
Okay.

5359
02:11:14,901 --> 02:11:19,901
That's the kind of racism that Oprah has
to experience in 2013 with Jack Johnson

5360
02:11:21,081 --> 02:11:21,590
experiences.

5361
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:23,810
Like it's like to these people,

5362
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:25,700
it's like they wanted him dead.

5363
02:11:25,701 --> 02:11:29,540
And slavery had just ended
like inside of their lifetime,

5364
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:30,680
1865.

5365
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:34,670
So you're dealing with just a few decades
later and all of a sudden there's this

5366
02:11:34,671 --> 02:11:39,671
dude just knockin white dudes senseless
and taking these white chicks.

5367
02:11:39,891 --> 02:11:44,540
And impaling them on
this fucking Super Dick,

5368
02:11:44,541 --> 02:11:47,600
the likes of which white women had
never seen before and they were just

5369
02:11:47,601 --> 02:11:48,490
following them around,

5370
02:11:48,491 --> 02:11:50,600
a fallen out of his car while
he's driving down the street.

5371
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:51,530
I mean,

5372
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:52,101
he had,

5373
02:11:52,101 --> 02:11:56,210
he was like the first black I ever with
dope cars that get across that border

5374
02:11:56,211 --> 02:11:57,140
and just kill it.

5375
02:11:57,141 --> 02:11:58,190
And he just did it like,

5376
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:58,971
fuck you.

5377
02:11:58,971 --> 02:11:59,720
What are you going to do?

5378
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:01,370
He would take them across state lines.

5379
02:12:01,371 --> 02:12:02,780
They try to get them
for all kinds of shit.

5380
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:05,580
Transporting white women and
across dirt lines that they drew.

5381
02:12:05,590 --> 02:12:10,590
Who government was after you for
sleeping with white women that you're,

5382
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:11,753
you're waiting sir.

5383
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:12,560
Sad,

5384
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,850
sad movie.

5385
02:12:13,851 --> 02:12:15,860
And then at the end
when he throws a fight,

5386
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:16,131
you know,

5387
02:12:16,131 --> 02:12:17,360
you could tell he throws a fight.

5388
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,110
Was it?

5389
02:12:18,110 --> 02:12:18,421
No,

5390
02:12:18,421 --> 02:12:19,251
it wasn't just Willard.

5391
02:12:19,251 --> 02:12:20,084
Who was it that he froze?

5392
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:21,223
I don't remember.

5393
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:21,981
I don't remember.

5394
02:12:21,981 --> 02:12:22,221
But,

5395
02:12:22,221 --> 02:12:22,700
uh,

5396
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:23,600
I don't want to tell you.

5397
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,111
In fact,

5398
02:12:24,111 --> 02:12:24,921
even if I did remember,

5399
02:12:24,921 --> 02:12:25,640
you should watch it.

5400
02:12:25,640 --> 02:12:26,201
Go get it.

5401
02:12:26,201 --> 02:12:28,520
So it's an amazing
documentary and it's just,

5402
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:30,111
we see like,

5403
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:34,060
like those old Jack Johnson fights or um,

5404
02:12:34,370 --> 02:12:36,740
you see Jack Dempsey's old fights.

5405
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:37,191
Like,

5406
02:12:37,191 --> 02:12:37,520
boy,

5407
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,890
you're dealing with a totally
different kind of human being.

5408
02:12:39,891 --> 02:12:42,530
Back then it was a lot different.

5409
02:12:42,531 --> 02:12:43,370
There were animals,

5410
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:43,900
they,

5411
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:44,733
they're there.

5412
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:46,350
I think we're slowly losing that,

5413
02:12:46,351 --> 02:12:46,701
that,

5414
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:47,540
that piece of us,

5415
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:48,320
you know,

5416
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,220
with whatever,

5417
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:49,900
whatever is it,

5418
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:50,733
that's everything.

5419
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:52,250
Everything is taking it away from us,

5420
02:12:52,251 --> 02:12:54,920
but we're slowly losing
that killer instinct.

5421
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:55,470
Well,

5422
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:55,791
you know,

5423
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:59,480
it's funny that Tyson latched
on to the Jack Dempsey.

5424
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:03,290
Jack Dempsey was like one of his like
main heroes and his main idols for that

5425
02:13:03,291 --> 02:13:06,710
style of fighting that just
ferocious mauling style,

5426
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:07,371
you know,

5427
02:13:07,371 --> 02:13:10,250
and Tyson sort of recognize
that he was a throwback.

5428
02:13:10,251 --> 02:13:10,401
I mean,

5429
02:13:10,401 --> 02:13:15,200
you think about that in the 80s and then
you look at like Jack Dempsey was doing

5430
02:13:15,201 --> 02:13:16,400
it when there was no TVs.

5431
02:13:16,910 --> 02:13:17,540
No,

5432
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:21,380
they find out about fights from the radio
and he was doing that exact thing that

5433
02:13:21,381 --> 02:13:22,070
long ago.

5434
02:13:22,070 --> 02:13:25,850
You were either they're in person
or you were listening to guys talk.

5435
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:26,601
Jack Dempsey.

5436
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:27,890
When I left Jack Dempsey,

5437
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:29,270
he's down.

5438
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,550
I mean,

5439
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:32,911
I guess,

5440
02:13:32,911 --> 02:13:33,031
yeah,

5441
02:13:33,031 --> 02:13:33,540
I guess it was,

5442
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,500
it was all word of mouth,

5443
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:34,741
you know,

5444
02:13:34,741 --> 02:13:36,300
it was all back then the handover in.

5445
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:40,290
Did you see that a photo that somebody
posted on the underground the other day

5446
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:44,070
of a fight from a 1913.

5447
02:13:45,090 --> 02:13:45,960
Did you see that shit?

5448
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,640
I don't think so.

5449
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:48,630
With MMA or do you know that you find it?

5450
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,160
Do you know what it's on my Instagram.

5451
02:13:50,161 --> 02:13:51,150
If you go to my Instagram,

5452
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:52,770
um,

5453
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:53,131
it's a,

5454
02:13:53,131 --> 02:13:54,570
a dude name,

5455
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,620
Irish Rati.

5456
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:58,380
Um,

5457
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:01,530
it's a boxing match and
it's a boxing match from,

5458
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:02,413
you know,

5459
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:05,030
1913 that they've turned into a,

5460
02:14:05,031 --> 02:14:06,300
a a color image.

5461
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:08,180
They've processed it yet and,

5462
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:08,530
and,

5463
02:14:08,530 --> 02:14:10,440
and made it a true to life.

5464
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:11,370
It's fucking incredible.

5465
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:12,290
Pull it up here for you.

5466
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:14,293
Look at this shit.

5467
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:17,360
Look at that picture.

5468
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:18,980
Holy Shit.

5469
02:14:19,010 --> 02:14:19,310
Yeah.

5470
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:20,270
Holy Shit is right.

5471
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,360
It's incredible to have those guys.

5472
02:14:23,361 --> 02:14:26,000
That was back when they used to
fight like 50 fucking rounds.

5473
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:26,480
Yeah,

5474
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:26,840
right.

5475
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,051
I mean,

5476
02:14:27,051 --> 02:14:29,210
didn't they have like some
crazy fights back then?

5477
02:14:29,211 --> 02:14:29,590
Were they?

5478
02:14:29,590 --> 02:14:32,510
What was the most amount of rounds you
think anybody ever fought back in those

5479
02:14:32,510 --> 02:14:32,720
days?

5480
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:34,870
I probably 50 or 60 I mean,

5481
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:37,850
those guys look like they're like on the
verge of beating each other to death.

5482
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:39,410
Very close.

5483
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:39,770
Very,

5484
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:40,970
but I've seen some UFC fights.

5485
02:14:40,971 --> 02:14:43,490
It looked like that to
Joe Stevenson and Bj Penn.

5486
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:44,211
The end of that fight,

5487
02:14:44,211 --> 02:14:45,980
it looked like Joseph
Stevenson got murdered.

5488
02:14:45,981 --> 02:14:46,360
Yes.

5489
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:46,700
You know,

5490
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,150
I mean,

5491
02:14:47,150 --> 02:14:48,620
well especially those forehead cuts,

5492
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:51,770
forehead cuts are responsible
for some of the craziest,

5493
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:54,200
most ridiculous scenes
in the octagon ever.

5494
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:54,651
But what did,

5495
02:14:54,651 --> 02:14:56,390
what did that big foot
Silva's manager say his,

5496
02:14:56,391 --> 02:14:57,560
his head is well irrigated.

5497
02:14:58,380 --> 02:14:59,720
It's just the wording.

5498
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:01,250
Giant Noggin.

5499
02:15:01,310 --> 02:15:01,880
Yeah,

5500
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:02,481
no shit.

5501
02:15:02,481 --> 02:15:03,590
That was a crazy one.

5502
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:05,750
Longest boxing match ever.

5503
02:15:05,751 --> 02:15:06,584
Let's find out

5504
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:09,710
ever poem.

5505
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:10,763
Good at typing

5506
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:13,790
was the longest boxing match in history.

5507
02:15:13,820 --> 02:15:14,660
Oh my God.

5508
02:15:14,720 --> 02:15:15,810
A boxing match land.

5509
02:15:15,811 --> 02:15:17,540
It lasted seven hours.

5510
02:15:17,930 --> 02:15:19,460
How many I can do the math.

5511
02:15:19,940 --> 02:15:21,730
What is that?

5512
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,610
Is that real?

5513
02:15:26,530 --> 02:15:27,940
Oh my God.

5514
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:28,923
Listen to this.

5515
02:15:29,410 --> 02:15:34,060
The longest boxing match ever took place
in New Orleans on April six of 1893 the

5516
02:15:34,061 --> 02:15:36,370
matches between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke,

5517
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:39,730
both of whom claimed the lightweight
title after the reigning Champ,

5518
02:15:39,731 --> 02:15:42,610
Jack McCall full all a fee,

5519
02:15:42,700 --> 02:15:44,800
all of fee check my call if he retired,

5520
02:15:44,890 --> 02:15:49,890
the winner of this take all purse was
set at $2,500 and in order to decide who

5521
02:15:49,901 --> 02:15:51,310
is really the new champion,

5522
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:53,650
the match was set to fought to a finish.

5523
02:15:54,340 --> 02:15:55,570
They fought to a finish.

5524
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:56,320
I like that.

5525
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,490
All through the contest,

5526
02:15:57,491 --> 02:16:00,670
fighters went at each other aggressively
pounding each other with their gloves,

5527
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:04,420
inflicting and sustaining
tremendous punishment that red,

5528
02:16:04,421 --> 02:16:06,100
like someone wrote it
with their pants off.

5529
02:16:06,790 --> 02:16:07,840
That red light is vigorous.

5530
02:16:07,841 --> 02:16:12,841
They masturbating hold up and shaved
and yet three minute rounds wore off.

5531
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,681
Oh my God.

5532
02:16:14,681 --> 02:16:18,490
They went to 111 rounds.

5533
02:16:19,450 --> 02:16:20,540
Both fighters,

5534
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,940
dazed and weary,

5535
02:16:21,941 --> 02:16:25,750
gave up and did not come
out of their corner pools.

5536
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:27,371
Well,

5537
02:16:27,371 --> 02:16:29,560
you can't fight 112 well,

5538
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:30,250
more raw.

5539
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,480
That'd be one guy telling him,

5540
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:33,820
just get up rocky and your win.

5541
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:36,633
All that.

5542
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,010
What's that?

5543
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:42,010
Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 1825
but that's English people lying might,

5544
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:45,460
we're not much longer than that.

5545
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:48,130
Our insurance is superior.

5546
02:16:48,190 --> 02:16:49,780
We've proper boxing training.

5547
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:51,940
That sounded more South African,

5548
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,590
so maybe that right man,

5549
02:16:53,650 --> 02:16:54,160
I dunno.

5550
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:55,830
Whoever fought over a hundred rounds.

5551
02:16:55,831 --> 02:16:57,750
It's the craziest fucking
human being that's ever lived.

5552
02:16:57,751 --> 02:16:58,010
That fight.

5553
02:16:58,010 --> 02:16:59,320
It was only four and a half hours.

5554
02:16:59,590 --> 02:16:59,861
Oh,

5555
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:00,430
that's weird.

5556
02:17:00,430 --> 02:17:01,660
What do they have like 32nd rounds?

5557
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:03,161
It doesn't even make sense.

5558
02:17:03,161 --> 02:17:03,994
I can't even do the math.

5559
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:04,710
I don't know.

5560
02:17:04,710 --> 02:17:07,030
I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks.

5561
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:08,343
That's crazy.

5562
02:17:09,110 --> 02:17:12,380
I wonder where the welter for the
welterweight championship of the world are

5563
02:17:12,381 --> 02:17:13,810
lightweight round these days.

5564
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:14,980
It's a good question.

5565
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,030
It's a very good question.

5566
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:17,260
I bet it'd be like 1 million bucks.

5567
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:18,100
Yeah.

5568
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:18,933
Is that weird?

5569
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:22,660
Like when when you hear about
like economies imploding
and then all of a sudden

5570
02:17:22,661 --> 02:17:24,450
like a loaf of bread's worth $1 million,

5571
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:25,630
like how the fuck,

5572
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:26,650
what does that even mean?

5573
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:27,041
Yeah.

5574
02:17:27,041 --> 02:17:29,340
I don't even understand that
people have billions of dike.

5575
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:31,990
How does that number even
a real number and can I,

5576
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:34,720
how do you pull out $1 billion in cash?

5577
02:17:34,721 --> 02:17:35,350
Let me see.

5578
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:35,740
Yeah.

5579
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:36,820
At a certain point in time,

5580
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:38,920
you have to admit the hack the game.

5581
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:39,921
Okay.

5582
02:17:39,921 --> 02:17:41,020
You hack the game somehow.

5583
02:17:41,021 --> 02:17:41,261
Dude,

5584
02:17:41,261 --> 02:17:44,020
how'd you get $10 billion
that I don't understand.

5585
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:45,970
When you know your guy like Bill Gates,

5586
02:17:45,971 --> 02:17:48,340
you have submarine inside your giant.

5587
02:17:49,140 --> 02:17:49,360
Hey,

5588
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:50,193
what happened here?

5589
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:51,370
What exactly did you do?

5590
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:52,690
Where are you getting all that money?

5591
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:55,000
This isn't fair.

5592
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:55,860
Escape.

5593
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:56,800
Pause in your house,

5594
02:17:57,190 --> 02:18:00,460
jettison you to the middle of the fucking
ocean whenever it fucking dangerous

5595
02:18:00,461 --> 02:18:01,294
shows up.

5596
02:18:01,930 --> 02:18:02,111
Yeah.

5597
02:18:02,111 --> 02:18:05,560
You have a constant team of
security detail around you
that's like having a bank

5598
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,090
around you all the time.

5599
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:08,980
Bill Gates is worth what?

5600
02:18:08,981 --> 02:18:11,060
100 billion or something crazy like that.

5601
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:12,160
It would if it was the whole Jv,

5602
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:14,830
him dropping $40,000 he shouldn't
pick it up kind of thing.

5603
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:15,071
Yeah,

5604
02:18:15,071 --> 02:18:15,904
that's what they say.

5605
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:20,380
It's like if he drops $40,000 it's worth
more of his time to keep moving forward

5606
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:21,880
than it is to turn around and pick it up.

5607
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:22,620
He just,

5608
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:25,810
what happened was he just didn't
turn around to pick up the bonus.

5609
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:27,230
I just got almost for,

5610
02:18:27,390 --> 02:18:30,610
for bludgeoning and
other man for 15 minutes.

5611
02:18:30,910 --> 02:18:31,241
He,

5612
02:18:31,241 --> 02:18:32,200
if he dropped that,

5613
02:18:32,350 --> 02:18:33,183
he wouldn't pick it up.

5614
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:33,761
It is crazy.

5615
02:18:33,761 --> 02:18:37,190
If you think about how
much more difficult MMA is.

5616
02:18:37,191 --> 02:18:37,660
Yeah.

5617
02:18:37,660 --> 02:18:42,660
Then almost every other job
that you have to do physically,

5618
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:48,490
like besides being a soldier
or a cop or a fireman,

5619
02:18:48,730 --> 02:18:52,330
where you're really putting your life in
danger on a daily basis with fires and

5620
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:53,020
bullets.

5621
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:54,160
Take all those out.

5622
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:57,580
And then ambulance driver
pre fucking dangerous.

5623
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,020
There's a few race car drivers,

5624
02:18:59,021 --> 02:18:59,854
dangerous as shit,

5625
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:02,740
but MMA fighters of fucking scary one.

5626
02:19:02,741 --> 02:19:03,000
That's,

5627
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,780
that's one of the most dangerous jobs you
can have other than like crab fishing,

5628
02:19:07,810 --> 02:19:08,980
those fucking crazy assholes.

5629
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:11,130
Deadliest catch guys guys.

5630
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:12,280
There's guys are nuts.

5631
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:12,600
They're,

5632
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:13,930
they're secluded out there for a reason.

5633
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:15,340
You friends with Quida?

5634
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:16,270
Uh,

5635
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:16,481
I'm,

5636
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:17,480
we don't talk to anybody.

5637
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:18,251
He's a cool dude.

5638
02:19:18,251 --> 02:19:19,070
That's a great guy.

5639
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,290
Click.

5640
02:19:19,290 --> 02:19:20,740
Greta did that shit for like a year.

5641
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:22,840
I went to like test is metal,

5642
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:23,451
the mountain.

5643
02:19:23,451 --> 02:19:25,600
It was a fucking crabber crazy fuck.

5644
02:19:25,601 --> 02:19:28,190
He's the kind of guy who would just pick
that sounds fun or you make some cash.

5645
02:19:28,191 --> 02:19:28,381
Cool.

5646
02:19:28,381 --> 02:19:28,501
Okay.

5647
02:19:28,501 --> 02:19:28,980
I gotta go.

5648
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:29,770
Yeah,

5649
02:19:29,770 --> 02:19:30,160
yeah.

5650
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:30,993
Stop moving.

5651
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:31,281
Yeah.

5652
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:34,340
That dude's got some endurance just
on the boat the whole time doing that.

5653
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:37,340
I've seen him blow off
more energy at a way in.

5654
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:38,840
Then I have from a real workout,

5655
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:40,150
like a real workout.

5656
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:41,810
Like today I'm going to have some coffee.

5657
02:19:41,811 --> 02:19:42,644
I'm gonna really work out.

5658
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,070
Meanwhile,

5659
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:47,420
he gets more cardio in on the way up to
the scale and he's always fucking like

5660
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:49,790
super energetic where
everybody else is dried out.

5661
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:50,360
You know,

5662
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:50,541
they're,

5663
02:19:50,541 --> 02:19:54,680
they're cutting weight and Guido
wasn't much bigger than one 55 he had,

5664
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:56,240
he has ridiculous endurance.

5665
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:56,600
Yeah.

5666
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:57,170
That he's,

5667
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:58,003
he's just,

5668
02:19:58,310 --> 02:20:00,080
that's one of those natural things that,

5669
02:20:00,081 --> 02:20:00,914
uh,

5670
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:02,930
he's never at rest anyways,

5671
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:05,060
not just,

5672
02:20:05,550 --> 02:20:06,500
it's constant.

5673
02:20:06,501 --> 02:20:06,950
It's,

5674
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:08,060
his rest is active.

5675
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:09,320
She's never going to get tired.

5676
02:20:09,350 --> 02:20:11,110
It's a great fucking guy to guy.

5677
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:11,961
Very,

5678
02:20:11,961 --> 02:20:13,280
very fun dude to hang out with.

5679
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:14,411
And he drives like,

5680
02:20:14,411 --> 02:20:15,244
he fights.

5681
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:16,283
Do you ever drive with him?

5682
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,313
He's awesome.

5683
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,380
He drags you like,

5684
02:20:19,381 --> 02:20:19,761
all right,

5685
02:20:19,761 --> 02:20:19,980
clay,

5686
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:20,813
Galena.

5687
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:24,230
Close my eyes and just hold on.

5688
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:25,940
Fucking Chicago savages.

5689
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:26,540
Yeah.

5690
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:27,830
It's different than what it is.

5691
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:29,810
Those Illinois people or animals,

5692
02:20:29,811 --> 02:20:30,110
Bro,

5693
02:20:30,110 --> 02:20:31,490
never been that cold as fuck.

5694
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:35,450
It's just those cities where it's
really cold and there's a lot of people,

5695
02:20:35,451 --> 02:20:38,990
it takes a hardy mother fucker
to rise above and those spots.

5696
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:39,291
Yeah,

5697
02:20:39,291 --> 02:20:41,350
I wouldn't last eaten alive.

5698
02:20:41,430 --> 02:20:43,550
You're a like a growing up here,

5699
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,440
you grew up in paradise.

5700
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:48,320
This is the greatest weather
in the history of the universe.

5701
02:20:48,321 --> 02:20:49,100
Yeah,

5702
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:49,820
it's great.

5703
02:20:49,820 --> 02:20:53,900
But you've missed that adversity that
you get from dealing with the weather.

5704
02:20:53,940 --> 02:20:54,320
Yeah,

5705
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:57,890
there's like a knowledge that
it's out there that we don't have.

5706
02:20:57,891 --> 02:20:59,240
We're like oblivious out here.

5707
02:20:59,241 --> 02:20:59,570
Yeah,

5708
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:00,360
I like that.

5709
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:00,650
Sonny,

5710
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:01,483
another day,

5711
02:21:01,630 --> 02:21:02,250
you know,

5712
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:02,441
my,

5713
02:21:02,441 --> 02:21:02,690
my,

5714
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:03,361
my Stepdad for,

5715
02:21:03,361 --> 02:21:04,190
for instance,

5716
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:07,910
world down hunter and tracker like
sad and he's almost 80 years old.

5717
02:21:07,911 --> 02:21:11,470
He's this mountain of a man
was in the CIA and he's out,

5718
02:21:11,530 --> 02:21:15,500
he's a mason and he's
just this like that guy.

5719
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:17,300
My mom met him,

5720
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:17,840
you know,

5721
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,280
being a chef at his wilderness
hunting lodge in the middle of BFE in,

5722
02:21:21,281 --> 02:21:22,130
in Alaska.

5723
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:26,030
Like the Guy I've seen pictures
of him with with polar bear,

5724
02:21:26,031 --> 02:21:26,864
he killed like,

5725
02:21:27,030 --> 02:21:27,290
oh,

5726
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:29,900
it's just this big
mountain and polar bear.

5727
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:30,740
Holy Shit,

5728
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:31,880
I actually have a polar bear rug.

5729
02:21:31,881 --> 02:21:34,130
It's not have a house to put it in yet.

5730
02:21:34,131 --> 02:21:34,580
But,

5731
02:21:34,580 --> 02:21:35,370
but I mean it's just,

5732
02:21:35,370 --> 02:21:37,970
it that's like that
guys is just weathered.

5733
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,110
Like he don't eat polar bear.

5734
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:39,690
Yeah.

5735
02:21:39,690 --> 02:21:41,060
D I don't think so.

5736
02:21:41,061 --> 02:21:42,830
I think he just just did it to do,

5737
02:21:42,831 --> 02:21:44,270
but at the back then
he's said guys almost 80.

5738
02:21:44,271 --> 02:21:45,350
So back then it was okay.

5739
02:21:45,351 --> 02:21:46,610
I mean he doesn't hunt anymore.

5740
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:48,020
Then we own black people,

5741
02:21:48,021 --> 02:21:49,220
which shot polar bears,

5742
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:49,701
whatever.

5743
02:21:49,701 --> 02:21:50,690
Don't worry about it.

5744
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,350
It's okay.

5745
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:55,220
We drove drunk shooting in polar
bears out the window of the car.

5746
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:56,451
Yeah,

5747
02:21:56,451 --> 02:21:56,661
you're,

5748
02:21:56,661 --> 02:21:56,901
you're,

5749
02:21:56,901 --> 02:21:59,750
you're supposed to hunt certain
Predator Bairstow though.

5750
02:21:59,751 --> 02:22:01,220
They have to keep their numbers down.

5751
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:02,120
People don't like that,

5752
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:03,103
that idea.

5753
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:05,780
But it does become a real
problem when you have,

5754
02:22:05,781 --> 02:22:06,350
um,

5755
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:07,220
there's like the,

5756
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:10,700
the game wardens in these areas and
the department of fish and game.

5757
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:11,060
Yeah.

5758
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:15,320
They're very meticulous about keeping
track of numbers of both animals that are

5759
02:22:15,321 --> 02:22:16,400
pray like dear.

5760
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:17,780
And then animals that are,

5761
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,290
uh,

5762
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:21,770
there are also predators like
cats and bears and shit like that.

5763
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:25,040
And they're pretty good at figuring
out how to manage that stuff.

5764
02:22:25,050 --> 02:22:26,280
But you have to kill some of them,

5765
02:22:26,281 --> 02:22:27,114
unfortunately.

5766
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:27,400
Yeah,

5767
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:30,900
I understand that people hate that
idea because they're so beautiful and

5768
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:31,471
majestic,

5769
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:36,471
but the reality of biology is that there
has to be a certain balance of Predator

5770
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:38,820
and prey because if there's not,

5771
02:22:38,821 --> 02:22:40,200
then we become a danger.

5772
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:41,310
They're going to come fuck us.

5773
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:43,050
And nobody likes that idea.

5774
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:43,830
People,

5775
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:44,700
people that are like,

5776
02:22:44,701 --> 02:22:47,010
especially like people were
animal rights people or you know,

5777
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:48,330
people love animals.

5778
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:51,100
There's a lot of people that their dogs
are like their best fucking friends.

5779
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:52,800
The only thing that they
can count on for love,

5780
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:53,431
you know what I mean?

5781
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:54,480
That's not even a bad thing.

5782
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,141
Not a bad thing.

5783
02:22:55,141 --> 02:22:55,560
It's true.

5784
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:57,420
So I understand where they're coming from.

5785
02:22:57,421 --> 02:22:59,040
Like you would think about the a bear.

5786
02:22:59,041 --> 02:23:00,000
It's just like a big dog,

5787
02:23:00,001 --> 02:23:00,980
but this is a big dog.

5788
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:02,150
They will eat your asshole.

5789
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:02,490
All right.

5790
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:03,980
The thing doesn't give a shit about you.

5791
02:23:03,981 --> 02:23:04,321
Exactly.

5792
02:23:04,321 --> 02:23:05,020
Without even it.

5793
02:23:05,020 --> 02:23:05,791
It wants to eat.

5794
02:23:05,791 --> 02:23:06,030
Yeah.

5795
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:09,480
It's a heartless monster and for
the most part they're harmless.

5796
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:10,680
You don't go near them.

5797
02:23:10,681 --> 02:23:12,390
You stay away from them for the most part.

5798
02:23:12,391 --> 02:23:12,811
You're right.

5799
02:23:12,811 --> 02:23:13,560
We're going to be fine.

5800
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:17,010
But the reality is when they get to a
certain number and they start taking down

5801
02:23:17,011 --> 02:23:20,400
elk in front of people at the camp site
and scaring the shit out of everybody.

5802
02:23:20,410 --> 02:23:20,910
Yeah.

5803
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:23,020
You ever see a 12 foot
bear take out a moose?

5804
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:24,540
I haven't either,

5805
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:26,070
but just I'm trying to get,

5806
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:28,410
here is a video of a bear in a,

5807
02:23:28,411 --> 02:23:29,280
I've never forgot this.

5808
02:23:29,370 --> 02:23:29,971
Pull this shit up,

5809
02:23:29,971 --> 02:23:30,450
Jamie.

5810
02:23:30,450 --> 02:23:31,440
It's a bear.

5811
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:33,990
Eats a moose in a driveway,

5812
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:35,610
dude.

5813
02:23:35,610 --> 02:23:36,270
Okay,

5814
02:23:36,270 --> 02:23:37,740
just dude.

5815
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:38,873
Imagine.

5816
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:40,770
Imagine you're living in Alaska.

5817
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:41,633
Okay.

5818
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:43,080
I'm five eight.

5819
02:23:43,230 --> 02:23:43,860
Okay.

5820
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:46,320
I stood next to a moose
and it's fucking huge.

5821
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:48,090
It's Dick was over my head.

5822
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,370
They're gigantic.

5823
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:50,971
I went to Alaska.

5824
02:23:50,971 --> 02:23:51,361
I was a kid.

5825
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:53,580
That place is fucking
beautiful and they're gigantic.

5826
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:53,941
I mean,

5827
02:23:53,941 --> 02:23:54,450
I didn't,

5828
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:56,080
I didn't get really close enough to him.

5829
02:23:56,081 --> 02:23:57,330
It was to get his stick over my head.

5830
02:23:57,331 --> 02:23:58,164
But look at this,

5831
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:59,190
but this Mousse,

5832
02:23:59,191 --> 02:24:00,300
which is gigantic,

5833
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:00,810
okay,

5834
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:05,340
is killed by a grizzly bear and
this guy's fucking driveway.

5835
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:08,550
So could you imagine
there's a thing that's,

5836
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:09,391
oh,

5837
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:09,901
you know,

5838
02:24:09,901 --> 02:24:10,470
whatever.

5839
02:24:10,470 --> 02:24:15,470
10 times his size of a deer and it
gets killed by a giant wild dog.

5840
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:19,260
That's essentially what a bear is.

5841
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:23,040
A giant bulletproof
wild dog Moose or what?

5842
02:24:23,041 --> 02:24:23,940
Like 12 feet tall.

5843
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:24,100
Yeah.

5844
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:25,410
Fucking huge.

5845
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:26,460
It's a huge animal.

5846
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,230
That's not the biggest moose in the world.

5847
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:28,711
No,

5848
02:24:28,711 --> 02:24:29,330
but it's a,

5849
02:24:29,330 --> 02:24:30,330
and it's a female.

5850
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,460
It's a big fucking animal.

5851
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:38,270
And what's really crazy about
bear is bear eat moose alive.

5852
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,630
They'd all the animals,

5853
02:24:39,631 --> 02:24:40,650
they kill alive.

5854
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:42,750
A lot of times they go guts first.

5855
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,340
They don't even bother killing the animal.

5856
02:24:44,341 --> 02:24:45,300
They just start eating them.

5857
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:49,590
You look at the size
of that fucking thing,

5858
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:52,440
just ripping chunks off of this Moose.

5859
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:55,200
He's eating the guts now.

5860
02:24:55,201 --> 02:24:56,700
That's what they go for the first.

5861
02:24:57,810 --> 02:24:58,620
But they're,

5862
02:24:58,620 --> 02:24:59,400
they're just,

5863
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:00,510
they're everywhere up there.

5864
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:03,660
And it comes a time where the,

5865
02:25:03,661 --> 02:25:04,020
uh,

5866
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:06,480
the wildlife people determine that,

5867
02:25:06,481 --> 02:25:06,900
okay,

5868
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:08,730
are the population is too high?

5869
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:10,470
And so we have to manage this.

5870
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:11,820
What does that with a dragged it away.

5871
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:12,240
Wow.

5872
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:13,260
Look how they dragged it away.

5873
02:25:13,261 --> 02:25:14,100
Look at the size of it.

5874
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:16,140
Back that up so it puts it in perspective.

5875
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:17,761
Oh my God.

5876
02:25:17,761 --> 02:25:18,780
Look at them dragging it away.

5877
02:25:18,781 --> 02:25:20,400
Look how big it is.

5878
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:24,850
You don't realize how big it is
because the bear is so fucking big,

5879
02:25:25,270 --> 02:25:26,320
but when they drag it away,

5880
02:25:26,321 --> 02:25:26,681
you're like,

5881
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:27,940
Holy Shit.

5882
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:29,620
How big is that bear?

5883
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:31,750
Now let's go back to the bear.

5884
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:32,673
Go back to the bear.

5885
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:33,760
Look how big the Paris.

5886
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:34,541
God Damn.

5887
02:25:34,541 --> 02:25:36,220
How big is that fucking bear?

5888
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:37,593
Oh,

5889
02:25:38,290 --> 02:25:40,150
that's big bear dude.

5890
02:25:40,210 --> 02:25:44,500
Literally a fucking 600 pound angry dog
with bigger claws and look at the size

5891
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:44,891
of that thing.

5892
02:25:44,891 --> 02:25:48,700
Now that you know how big that fucking
moose is in comparison to a car,

5893
02:25:48,701 --> 02:25:50,260
that bear is huge.

5894
02:25:50,890 --> 02:25:51,820
Oh

5895
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:54,610
God.

5896
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:55,443
Damn.

5897
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:56,770
Fuck living in Alaska.

5898
02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:01,030
My mom was saying when she went to go
hunter dall sheep that of course my

5899
02:26:01,031 --> 02:26:01,870
Stepdad's not going to tell her,

5900
02:26:01,871 --> 02:26:03,170
but a bear a bear.

5901
02:26:03,171 --> 02:26:04,300
It was tracking them the whole time.

5902
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:04,541
No,

5903
02:26:04,541 --> 02:26:04,991
of course.

5904
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:05,171
Yeah,

5905
02:26:05,171 --> 02:26:06,830
they told the whole time and like,

5906
02:26:06,840 --> 02:26:07,120
and like,

5907
02:26:07,120 --> 02:26:07,421
she's like,

5908
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:08,770
oh we're wading through like thick,

5909
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:09,521
you know,

5910
02:26:09,521 --> 02:26:11,050
brush shit and just,

5911
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:11,950
you know,

5912
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:12,783
I wonder why.

5913
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:14,320
Just her telling the story.

5914
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:15,293
I was like,

5915
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:15,671
man,

5916
02:26:15,671 --> 02:26:17,530
that's fucking frightening
having something.

5917
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:18,820
If something wants to eat you,

5918
02:26:18,850 --> 02:26:22,390
it's so crazy because you can get there
at the wrong place and the wrong time

5919
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:26,590
and you can get there when there's an
old bear that can't catch catch moose or

5920
02:26:26,591 --> 02:26:30,430
deer anymore and they have worn out
teeth and they see you and they're like,

5921
02:26:30,431 --> 02:26:31,370
oh I can catch you.

5922
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:32,710
And then they just eat you.

5923
02:26:33,070 --> 02:26:34,840
And especially when
it's late in the season,

5924
02:26:34,841 --> 02:26:36,910
they say that's when it
gets really desperado.

5925
02:26:36,980 --> 02:26:40,750
Bears will eat their cubs and they get
really desperate because there's no food.

5926
02:26:40,990 --> 02:26:42,160
It can't catch any fish.

5927
02:26:42,161 --> 02:26:42,470
They can't.

5928
02:26:42,470 --> 02:26:44,680
There's no salmon laughed and
they're starving to death.

5929
02:26:44,681 --> 02:26:46,750
And so they'll fucking eat
everything in front of them.

5930
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:50,350
You can catch them in that really intense
desperation cause they're the last

5931
02:26:50,351 --> 02:26:55,351
animals that haven't hibernated the
healthy fat bears that what a grizzly man

5932
02:26:55,980 --> 02:26:56,141
man,

5933
02:26:56,141 --> 02:26:56,411
that moves.

5934
02:26:56,411 --> 02:26:57,100
Yes.

5935
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:58,060
I talk about that every week.

5936
02:26:58,061 --> 02:26:59,620
You can't talk about it
anymore unfortunately.

5937
02:26:59,990 --> 02:27:00,870
Let's talk about that.

5938
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,840
I'm just saying that it was,

5939
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:02,674
it was like that.

5940
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:05,620
That was exact storyline.

5941
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:05,890
Yeah.

5942
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:07,480
The guys stayed way too long.

5943
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:10,600
He was there in October or November or
some shit like that when they're supposed

5944
02:27:10,601 --> 02:27:11,500
to already be sleeping.

5945
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:12,641
Yeah.

5946
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:13,391
That's a weird thing,

5947
02:27:13,391 --> 02:27:13,631
man.

5948
02:27:13,631 --> 02:27:16,420
To live in the presence
of those crazy beasts.

5949
02:27:16,630 --> 02:27:20,350
My favorite shows are all these
subsistence shows like Alaska,

5950
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:21,340
the last frontier.

5951
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:21,730
It's my,

5952
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:22,600
one of my favorite shows.

5953
02:27:22,601 --> 02:27:24,940
I get giddy like a little
schoolgirl when I shits on.

5954
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:27,010
I got to watch it and it's
these people they live,

5955
02:27:27,011 --> 02:27:28,210
that's a bunch of families.

5956
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:30,940
The Kitchener family and
I believe like jewel,

5957
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:33,730
you know that a beautiful
singer and incredible voice.

5958
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:36,160
She is like related to these people.

5959
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:37,750
Fascinating.

5960
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:42,750
But these folks live in like a really
remote part of Alaska and they have a

5961
02:27:44,831 --> 02:27:46,160
homestead with eight.

5962
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,950
They're responsible for everything.

5963
02:27:47,951 --> 02:27:50,260
They're responsible for all their
own repairs on their equipment.

5964
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:54,280
They get all their own meat from either
cows that they have to butcher cause

5965
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:56,860
they run cattle or animals that they hunt.

5966
02:27:56,890 --> 02:28:00,550
Whether they hunt bear or a moose and
they have like very specific chores they

5967
02:28:00,551 --> 02:28:04,360
do and they have maybe four or five
months a year where they're just trying to

5968
02:28:04,361 --> 02:28:08,890
keep it together and then it's bundled
up for the cold and their whole life is

5969
02:28:08,891 --> 02:28:10,420
about preparing for the cold.

5970
02:28:10,450 --> 02:28:11,080
Yeah.

5971
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:15,310
And they're just fucking storing
fish and every is just a mad dash.

5972
02:28:15,311 --> 02:28:18,190
Getting up at six pulling nets of fishing,

5973
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:19,031
freezing.

5974
02:28:19,031 --> 02:28:19,930
I'm smoking them.

5975
02:28:19,931 --> 02:28:24,931
Everybody's working around clock and
then shoot the fucking frost comes in.

5976
02:28:25,161 --> 02:28:27,960
The river freezes over the point
where you drive cars on it.

5977
02:28:27,961 --> 02:28:28,460
Yeah,

5978
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:31,310
it's gangster cold up there
and we get to watch that.

5979
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:32,233
It's amazing.

5980
02:28:32,930 --> 02:28:33,681
I'm a Dork for it,

5981
02:28:33,681 --> 02:28:33,950
dude.

5982
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:34,241
Well My,

5983
02:28:34,241 --> 02:28:34,440
I,

5984
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:34,731
my,

5985
02:28:34,731 --> 02:28:35,001
you know,

5986
02:28:35,001 --> 02:28:35,834
my mom went through it.

5987
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:39,830
Your mom went through it because she was
living in being the chef at the hunting

5988
02:28:39,831 --> 02:28:40,664
lodge.

5989
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:41,690
God Damn.

5990
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:42,770
In middle of nowhere.

5991
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:43,011
I mean,

5992
02:28:43,011 --> 02:28:43,260
you know,

5993
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:46,430
she was living in Alaska for
a while and obviously Jim's,

5994
02:28:46,431 --> 02:28:47,264
you know,

5995
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:48,411
I'm sure listening to this,

5996
02:28:48,411 --> 02:28:48,561
he's,

5997
02:28:48,561 --> 02:28:48,680
you know,

5998
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,071
he's old,

5999
02:28:49,071 --> 02:28:49,791
but yeah,

6000
02:28:49,791 --> 02:28:50,740
he was up there forever.

6001
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,943
Wow.

6002
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:54,710
That's harsh climates or I don't,

6003
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:57,830
I like southern California
with way too much.

6004
02:28:57,860 --> 02:29:00,950
There's something amazing about the
people that come from those spots though.

6005
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:01,941
They have a different,

6006
02:29:01,941 --> 02:29:05,780
does a different sort of like
mentality that they possess.

6007
02:29:05,810 --> 02:29:07,490
It's for a pussy like me.

6008
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:09,440
It's a so attractive.

6009
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:10,303
So you know this,

6010
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:11,960
this guy that's a man right there,

6011
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,010
doesn't have a bank account.

6012
02:29:13,011 --> 02:29:14,390
He's got some beaver skins.

6013
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:18,470
He's going to trade for gasoline for
his fucking snowmobile and he's driving

6014
02:29:18,471 --> 02:29:21,950
around where it's 80 below zero and he's
running traps and that's how he feeds

6015
02:29:21,951 --> 02:29:22,784
his kids.

6016
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,570
Yes guy.

6017
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:27,980
There's a fucking show called mountain
men with this guy takes up plane every

6018
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:28,100
winter.

6019
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:28,940
He flies,

6020
02:29:28,941 --> 02:29:30,050
he leaves his family behind.

6021
02:29:30,051 --> 02:29:32,210
He flies for months and
camps out in the woods.

6022
02:29:32,211 --> 02:29:36,320
He's got like these shacks up there and
he runs these trap lines and just kills

6023
02:29:36,321 --> 02:29:37,750
animals in the wintertime.

6024
02:29:37,820 --> 02:29:40,550
It's like apparently easier to kill him
cause they're desperado and they go and

6025
02:29:40,551 --> 02:29:42,040
find the bait and snap down on it.

6026
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:46,160
And this guy just takes it all and
freezes them and skins and then brings him

6027
02:29:46,161 --> 02:29:46,581
back home.

6028
02:29:46,581 --> 02:29:49,550
It'd be lives out there by himself
for months and months at a time.

6029
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:50,593
No phone,

6030
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:51,523
no nothing.

6031
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:53,340
Just a wood house.

6032
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:55,310
Woodhouse in a snowmobile.

6033
02:29:55,790 --> 02:29:56,500
Jesus and it.

6034
02:29:56,500 --> 02:29:57,230
Yeah,

6035
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:58,041
and this party,

6036
02:29:58,041 --> 02:29:59,270
that's thing I look,

6037
02:29:59,310 --> 02:30:00,680
you'll do it and could you do it?

6038
02:30:00,681 --> 02:30:01,514
I don't know.

6039
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:03,140
I guess you could if you had to,

6040
02:30:03,410 --> 02:30:04,460
like if that was your life,

6041
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:05,810
if there was no way around it,

6042
02:30:05,811 --> 02:30:06,351
if there's like,

6043
02:30:06,351 --> 02:30:06,880
listen,

6044
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:07,190
um,

6045
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:07,491
you know,

6046
02:30:07,491 --> 02:30:08,570
they came to you and said,

6047
02:30:08,571 --> 02:30:09,280
hey,

6048
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:09,800
uh,

6049
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:10,633
there's a fucking,

6050
02:30:10,740 --> 02:30:11,900
there was an ice age comment.

6051
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:13,150
There's nothing we can do about it.

6052
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,420
Figured that we're going
to have to figure it out.

6053
02:30:14,421 --> 02:30:17,510
We're going to have to about four months
out of the year to gather up food and

6054
02:30:17,511 --> 02:30:20,840
then it's going to be 80 below zero
by the time December comes around.

6055
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:21,401
I can,

6056
02:30:21,401 --> 02:30:21,800
I do.

6057
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:22,051
Okay.

6058
02:30:22,051 --> 02:30:22,490
I do it.

6059
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:22,611
Well,

6060
02:30:22,611 --> 02:30:24,170
those people are going to die
off because you know what?

6061
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:25,430
People are doing that in Anchorage.

6062
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:26,420
Go Up there,

6063
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,070
go to Fairbank's.

6064
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:27,320
Yeah,

6065
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:27,800
go up there.

6066
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:28,633
There's a whole city,

6067
02:30:28,970 --> 02:30:32,930
the whole city where it gets so cold that
you could freeze to death while you go

6068
02:30:32,931 --> 02:30:33,764
to get your mail.

6069
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:35,240
Jesus Christ,

6070
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:36,110
you can freeze to death.

6071
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:38,090
They all carry candles
in their car and shit.

6072
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:39,170
If you get trapped somewhere,

6073
02:30:39,171 --> 02:30:39,960
you've got to light a candle.

6074
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:40,940
You can't just sit in your car,

6075
02:30:41,450 --> 02:30:42,560
you'll freeze to death to him.

6076
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,813
Yeah,

6077
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:45,073
I didn't know that.

6078
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:46,400
That's,

6079
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:47,780
that's not even,

6080
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,410
I mean like I,

6081
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:48,920
I'm,

6082
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:49,581
I would love to,

6083
02:30:49,581 --> 02:30:52,220
I want to learn to bow hunt
and go kill and eat my food,

6084
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,890
but I definitely want to come
home and bring it home to my mind.

6085
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:59,960
Might be air conditioned house by the
beach or the breeze and you know the Nice,

6086
02:30:59,961 --> 02:31:00,560
yeah.

6087
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,980
Did your dad take you on,

6088
02:31:01,981 --> 02:31:04,550
on like hunts and fishing
trips and stuff like that?

6089
02:31:04,551 --> 02:31:05,840
He came into my life,

6090
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:06,230
my,

6091
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:06,860
my Stepdad,

6092
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:07,620
the hunter,

6093
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:08,453
um,

6094
02:31:09,050 --> 02:31:09,890
later on where,

6095
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:10,880
I mean I would love,

6096
02:31:10,881 --> 02:31:11,031
I,

6097
02:31:11,031 --> 02:31:14,210
that's my goal is to now eventually
take him on like one last hunt,

6098
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:15,111
you know,

6099
02:31:15,111 --> 02:31:16,220
cause he's the man bulletproof.

6100
02:31:16,250 --> 02:31:17,330
But you know,

6101
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:18,680
cause he doesn't hunt anymore.

6102
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:20,210
I want want to go up to Alaska and,

6103
02:31:20,290 --> 02:31:20,630
and,

6104
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:22,530
and I don't want to kill
anything like a bear,

6105
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:22,741
anything.

6106
02:31:22,741 --> 02:31:23,291
I want to kill him.

6107
02:31:23,291 --> 02:31:26,400
I'm just gonna eat like elk Caribou,

6108
02:31:26,730 --> 02:31:27,151
Caribou,

6109
02:31:27,151 --> 02:31:28,380
Caribou gets them a dall sheep,

6110
02:31:28,381 --> 02:31:28,531
you know.

6111
02:31:28,531 --> 02:31:29,364
But some of the difficult,

6112
02:31:30,180 --> 02:31:31,650
but my dad had the side,

6113
02:31:31,651 --> 02:31:33,030
we were food fit was just how fishing.

6114
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:35,130
So we're always hunting something.

6115
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:35,451
Right,

6116
02:31:35,451 --> 02:31:35,791
right,

6117
02:31:35,791 --> 02:31:36,060
right.

6118
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:36,431
And it's,

6119
02:31:36,431 --> 02:31:37,264
it's,

6120
02:31:37,500 --> 02:31:38,130
it's definitely,

6121
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:38,940
I love doing it.

6122
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:39,300
I love,

6123
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:41,040
I knew I'd also need to go fishing again.

6124
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,831
Do you feel like the,

6125
02:31:41,831 --> 02:31:43,230
that's a primal thing too,

6126
02:31:43,231 --> 02:31:43,831
that almost,

6127
02:31:43,831 --> 02:31:44,071
I mean,

6128
02:31:44,071 --> 02:31:46,080
not obviously on the
same level as fighting,

6129
02:31:46,081 --> 02:31:50,490
but there's something about like the
satisfaction that you get from acquiring

6130
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:52,410
your own food is a very primal thing.

6131
02:31:52,440 --> 02:31:55,980
It's the most intimate thing you can
share with another creature is taking its

6132
02:31:55,981 --> 02:31:58,530
life sound like a fucking psycho.

6133
02:32:01,030 --> 02:32:03,150
If I was the fucking FBI profiler,

6134
02:32:03,510 --> 02:32:03,871
I'm like,

6135
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:04,021
yeah,

6136
02:32:04,021 --> 02:32:05,760
I'm going to follow your
Twitter from here on out,

6137
02:32:05,761 --> 02:32:06,594
pal.

6138
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:06,870
Why?

6139
02:32:06,870 --> 02:32:07,890
It's true cause you,

6140
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,000
you get to send it out.

6141
02:32:09,001 --> 02:32:09,250
I'm not,

6142
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,050
you just get the kit.

6143
02:32:10,050 --> 02:32:11,340
He had to kill something and eat it.

6144
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:11,791
No,

6145
02:32:11,791 --> 02:32:12,210
I know.

6146
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:13,043
I'm fucking with you.

6147
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,010
Obviously we're joking around,

6148
02:32:14,011 --> 02:32:14,580
but um,

6149
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:15,413
I know what you mean.

6150
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:17,010
I killed a deer for the
first time in my life,

6151
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,190
lasts a winter and uh,

6152
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:22,500
it was a very intimate feeling when
you're eating the liver of an animal that

6153
02:32:22,501 --> 02:32:24,030
you just shot a couple hours ago.

6154
02:32:24,050 --> 02:32:24,883
It's weird.

6155
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:26,233
He's fucking delicious.

6156
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:27,390
Unbelievably delicious.

6157
02:32:27,391 --> 02:32:31,260
And the reality is it's the most ethical
way to approach it because that animal

6158
02:32:31,261 --> 02:32:33,380
is probably not going to
survive much longer anyway.

6159
02:32:33,690 --> 02:32:35,300
It gets unfucking believable.

6160
02:32:35,301 --> 02:32:37,860
He cold in Montana in the winter and
a lot of them just freeze to death.

6161
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:39,380
There's a fucked up picture.

6162
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:40,740
Jamie be seen this shit of a,

6163
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:42,990
an elk frozen to death standing up.

6164
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:43,951
Yeah.

6165
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:45,570
You want to know how brutal Colorado gets?

6166
02:32:45,571 --> 02:32:46,260
Bitch,

6167
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:47,093
check this shit out.

6168
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:49,920
There's an elk that they
found that froze to death,

6169
02:32:49,921 --> 02:32:51,660
like trying to cross a lake
or something like that,

6170
02:32:51,661 --> 02:32:54,390
just like standing up frozen.

6171
02:32:55,100 --> 02:33:00,100
It was a trying to how whatever wasn't
really tall snow and it's stuck standing

6172
02:33:00,241 --> 02:33:03,450
up and animals have eaten
big chunks off of it.

6173
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:08,510
So it is like this freaky carcass of
this standing up Zombie elk that's a,

6174
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:11,520
that has like these chunks
taking it out of its body,

6175
02:33:11,521 --> 02:33:13,140
but it's frozen standing up.

6176
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:15,030
Oh Man.

6177
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,863
You find it.

6178
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:16,973
How dare you.

6179
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,480
That's how you got it.

6180
02:33:18,481 --> 02:33:19,230
Let me see it.

6181
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:20,730
This is going to freak out.

6182
02:33:23,610 --> 02:33:25,410
I'm sure there's people that
have some more MMA questions.

6183
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:26,370
You're gonna fucking stop.

6184
02:33:26,370 --> 02:33:27,203
Talk about animals.

6185
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:28,180
Totally.

6186
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:29,940
When they remember you fucking queer.

6187
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:31,433
Hey,

6188
02:33:31,910 --> 02:33:32,743
don't be mean.

6189
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:34,021
You hate her.

6190
02:33:34,021 --> 02:33:34,321
Folks.

6191
02:33:34,321 --> 02:33:34,920
Look at this.

6192
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:36,930
Look at that fucking elk.

6193
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:37,500
Dude.

6194
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:38,610
Are you shitting me?

6195
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:40,500
Can you see it in that picture?

6196
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:41,490
Is there a better picture?

6197
02:33:41,491 --> 02:33:43,020
That's gotta be a better
picture than that man.

6198
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,810
See if he can find the,

6199
02:33:44,811 --> 02:33:45,720
the actual picture,

6200
02:33:45,721 --> 02:33:48,720
because the actual picture of the
high rise picture is fucking crazy.

6201
02:33:48,721 --> 02:33:53,721
This thing's frozen standing up
and big chunks or bitten off of it.

6202
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:54,990
That's fucked up.

6203
02:33:54,990 --> 02:33:57,220
My point is we're such
pussies here in California.

6204
02:33:57,221 --> 02:33:58,054
It's true.

6205
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,980
It is true.

6206
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:00,510
I comes to the weather.

6207
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:01,101
Yeah,

6208
02:34:01,101 --> 02:34:01,371
we can't.

6209
02:34:01,371 --> 02:34:02,040
Exactly.

6210
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:02,740
But,

6211
02:34:02,740 --> 02:34:03,300
um,

6212
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:04,290
on the other hand,

6213
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:05,813
it's a,

6214
02:34:06,150 --> 02:34:08,850
it's a great place to develop
your free or an MMA fighter.

6215
02:34:08,851 --> 02:34:09,120
I mean,

6216
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:09,500
look at it.

6217
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:10,333
There's a picture.

6218
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,920
Holy Shit that's even
crazier than it looked.

6219
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:14,881
I mean,

6220
02:34:14,881 --> 02:34:15,081
they're,

6221
02:34:15,081 --> 02:34:15,240
they're,

6222
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:15,691
they,

6223
02:34:15,691 --> 02:34:17,470
they're eating whole straight it.

6224
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:17,921
Yeah.

6225
02:34:17,921 --> 02:34:18,970
It's just the body.

6226
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:24,030
Like you could see the spine and the
organs are all missing in the top area by

6227
02:34:24,851 --> 02:34:25,481
the spine.

6228
02:34:25,481 --> 02:34:27,100
And the organs are all like chew dancer.

6229
02:34:27,101 --> 02:34:27,490
Of course.

6230
02:34:27,490 --> 02:34:27,980
Yes,

6231
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:28,813
of course.

6232
02:34:28,960 --> 02:34:29,621
It's delicious.

6233
02:34:29,621 --> 02:34:30,490
They get right to it.

6234
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:31,421
What you gonna do,

6235
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:31,720
bitch,

6236
02:34:31,720 --> 02:34:33,400
they probably ate the
asshole before it even died.

6237
02:34:33,460 --> 02:34:33,790
Like,

6238
02:34:33,790 --> 02:34:34,720
Oh shit.

6239
02:34:34,721 --> 02:34:36,500
What we got and he has harp.

6240
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:38,260
I'm a bear.

6241
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:38,591
Actually.

6242
02:34:38,591 --> 02:34:39,071
It was a bear.

6243
02:34:39,071 --> 02:34:42,580
There'd be nothing that has to be
probably a coyotes or something like that.

6244
02:34:42,581 --> 02:34:45,740
Cause they didn't even knock it over or
chew through the bone wolves that are

6245
02:34:45,741 --> 02:34:46,600
probably chewed right through the,

6246
02:34:46,810 --> 02:34:47,111
what am I,

6247
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:48,190
a wildlife expert?

6248
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:49,061
Listen to me.

6249
02:34:49,061 --> 02:34:49,894
Like I'm a fucking,

6250
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:50,261
like,

6251
02:34:50,261 --> 02:34:51,580
I'm the crocodile hunter.

6252
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:55,060
Zoologists to some shit that fucks on.

6253
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:55,661
So,

6254
02:34:55,661 --> 02:34:55,990
uh,

6255
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,990
let me ask you about some,

6256
02:34:56,991 --> 02:34:57,160
uh,

6257
02:34:57,160 --> 02:34:58,270
some upcoming fights,

6258
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:02,230
people that people always request
this and I never get around to it.

6259
02:35:02,550 --> 02:35:02,920
Um,

6260
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,341
when,

6261
02:35:03,341 --> 02:35:03,730
um,

6262
02:35:03,730 --> 02:35:05,170
when fighters are on,

6263
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:05,920
um,

6264
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:10,600
to talk about upcoming cards because
there's a bunch of like really interesting

6265
02:35:10,601 --> 02:35:12,580
fights coming up that
people are interested in.

6266
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:13,031
First of all,

6267
02:35:13,031 --> 02:35:13,960
I got to ask you,

6268
02:35:14,220 --> 02:35:14,560
uh,

6269
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,870
what do you think about
Anderson and Chris Weidman,

6270
02:35:16,900 --> 02:35:17,950
the rematch that fight?

6271
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:21,820
I think this time,

6272
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:22,091
uh,

6273
02:35:22,091 --> 02:35:23,110
obviously Chris,

6274
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:24,701
you know,

6275
02:35:24,701 --> 02:35:25,660
can beat him I think,

6276
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:26,950
but I don't think he's going to,

6277
02:35:26,951 --> 02:35:29,230
I think I think Anderson is going
to blast through them quick.

6278
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:30,093
I really,

6279
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:34,870
I saw a turn in that
second round where I just,

6280
02:35:34,871 --> 02:35:35,800
I thought that the tie,

6281
02:35:35,801 --> 02:35:40,801
they completely turned and Anderson does
the same thing he always does and it's

6282
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:42,850
one to dip,

6283
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:43,221
you know,

6284
02:35:43,221 --> 02:35:43,591
he just,

6285
02:35:43,591 --> 02:35:46,180
because it's MMA guys don't
know how to box very well.

6286
02:35:46,181 --> 02:35:47,560
It's just a straight basic one,

6287
02:35:47,561 --> 02:35:48,250
two,

6288
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:48,790
right.

6289
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:50,260
And he always goes the same way.

6290
02:35:50,261 --> 02:35:50,651
One,

6291
02:35:50,651 --> 02:35:51,041
two.

6292
02:35:51,041 --> 02:35:52,810
And then if you start to pressure him,

6293
02:35:52,811 --> 02:35:55,300
he goes back and dips
to that cause that side.

6294
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:58,490
It's the same watch other video.

6295
02:35:58,491 --> 02:35:59,170
It's what he does.

6296
02:35:59,170 --> 02:35:59,880
Uh,

6297
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:00,610
you know,

6298
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:03,160
and I don't know why mine
have not even known it,

6299
02:36:03,161 --> 02:36:04,420
but all he did was take one step.

6300
02:36:04,421 --> 02:36:05,600
I met Ray Longo knew it.

6301
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:06,670
All he did was,

6302
02:36:06,670 --> 02:36:06,940
you know,

6303
02:36:06,940 --> 02:36:07,773
flash,

6304
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:09,550
he kind of stepped into South Bulb,

6305
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:12,340
flashed out of jab and then
through the hook and it was ugly.

6306
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:12,911
It wasn't,

6307
02:36:12,911 --> 02:36:14,530
it wasn't beautiful textbook punching,

6308
02:36:14,531 --> 02:36:15,270
but it worked

6309
02:36:15,270 --> 02:36:15,421
well.

6310
02:36:15,421 --> 02:36:15,631
You know,

6311
02:36:15,631 --> 02:36:17,730
that's that same hook that he
knocked your hall out with.

6312
02:36:17,731 --> 02:36:22,080
He has a weird long hook where he is this
arm like fully extended and he catches

6313
02:36:22,081 --> 02:36:24,030
you on the end with like his hand turned.

6314
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:24,421
Exactly.

6315
02:36:24,421 --> 02:36:24,640
And then,

6316
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:24,841
and,

6317
02:36:24,841 --> 02:36:25,051
and,

6318
02:36:25,051 --> 02:36:26,640
and Anderson's used to being out here.

6319
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:26,990
Yeah.

6320
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:27,270
You know,

6321
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:27,860
and he already got

6322
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:28,641
crack coming in.

6323
02:36:28,641 --> 02:36:30,070
So it's a,

6324
02:36:30,130 --> 02:36:33,080
he ate mean he just got lazy to come
overconfident or whatever it was.

6325
02:36:33,081 --> 02:36:33,231
And,

6326
02:36:33,231 --> 02:36:34,790
but I think that he,

6327
02:36:36,020 --> 02:36:38,900
I would love to see him in blitz Weidman.

6328
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:39,801
I just,

6329
02:36:39,801 --> 02:36:42,500
because I want to see Anderson do
it to somebody because he does it so

6330
02:36:42,501 --> 02:36:43,310
beautifully.

6331
02:36:43,310 --> 02:36:44,000
And then nothing against

6332
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:44,321
Chris.

6333
02:36:44,321 --> 02:36:44,690
Right.

6334
02:36:44,690 --> 02:36:45,523
I know what you're saying.

6335
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:46,251
I know what you're saying.

6336
02:36:46,251 --> 02:36:49,490
He's the most beautiful guy to
watch as far as movement by far.

6337
02:36:49,491 --> 02:36:49,940
Yeah.

6338
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:50,241
Yeah.

6339
02:36:50,241 --> 02:36:51,074
He's um,

6340
02:36:51,140 --> 02:36:53,280
it's hard to wrap your head around that.

6341
02:36:53,310 --> 02:36:56,000
He could like a guy like Chris Weidman
and want to see him get fucked up.

6342
02:36:56,150 --> 02:36:56,990
People don't understand that.

6343
02:36:56,991 --> 02:36:58,010
It's not what it is.

6344
02:36:58,220 --> 02:37:00,260
It's just you want to see the performance.

6345
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:00,681
Exactly.

6346
02:37:00,681 --> 02:37:01,071
I want to see,

6347
02:37:01,071 --> 02:37:02,880
I want to see a beautiful performance and,

6348
02:37:02,881 --> 02:37:05,810
and no one makes it more beautiful than
Anderson and when it's against a really

6349
02:37:05,811 --> 02:37:06,501
tough guy,

6350
02:37:06,501 --> 02:37:08,630
it makes it performance
all the more spectacular.

6351
02:37:08,631 --> 02:37:09,050
Exactly.

6352
02:37:09,050 --> 02:37:10,700
I'm a huge rich Franklin fan.

6353
02:37:10,730 --> 02:37:12,770
I've always been a rich Franklin
fan and he's a great guy.

6354
02:37:12,771 --> 02:37:13,740
He was a great champion.

6355
02:37:13,741 --> 02:37:13,970
Yeah.

6356
02:37:13,970 --> 02:37:16,610
So when beat Franklin for the title,

6357
02:37:16,611 --> 02:37:18,770
I knew how fucking tough rich Franklin is.

6358
02:37:18,810 --> 02:37:18,950
Yeah.

6359
02:37:18,950 --> 02:37:20,570
So it made it all the more crazy.

6360
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:22,940
When you're watching that
you're like Jesus Christ.

6361
02:37:22,941 --> 02:37:23,300
Like,

6362
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,910
if you don't know how tough Lee Marie is,

6363
02:37:26,460 --> 02:37:28,060
if you don't know how toughly Marius,

6364
02:37:28,290 --> 02:37:31,370
watch Lee Marie versus Anderson
Silva Watch first of all,

6365
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:35,000
watch lean Murray versus a host of other
motherfuckers that he just slept with

6366
02:37:35,001 --> 02:37:35,834
like one punch,

6367
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:38,060
like a mere renova already slept him.

6368
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:40,130
He was a sniper.

6369
02:37:40,131 --> 02:37:42,680
He hit a piston of a right
hand and he's that guy.

6370
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:43,310
Different breed,

6371
02:37:43,310 --> 02:37:45,530
that gap psychopath.

6372
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:46,490
Well he's in jail right now.

6373
02:37:46,491 --> 02:37:47,630
Listen to this podcast.

6374
02:37:47,631 --> 02:37:49,100
He listens to the pockets of Morocco.

6375
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:49,850
Yes.

6376
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:50,900
I think he's still in Morocco.

6377
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:53,540
I probably living in the castle,

6378
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:56,960
they probably got like a little
man hole in his gym and his uh,

6379
02:37:56,961 --> 02:37:57,920
his cage rather.

6380
02:37:57,921 --> 02:37:58,760
And like when Smith,

6381
02:37:58,780 --> 02:37:59,571
the guards go to bread.

6382
02:37:59,571 --> 02:37:59,691
Yeah,

6383
02:37:59,691 --> 02:38:01,670
he went and got a girl pregnant
while he's in the cage in prison.

6384
02:38:02,060 --> 02:38:04,820
He probably has like a little man hall
and he opens it up and it's like fucking

6385
02:38:04,850 --> 02:38:07,480
Saddam Hussein's palace
underneath the gym.

6386
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:07,800
It's,

6387
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,170
he's a crazy criminal character,

6388
02:38:09,530 --> 02:38:11,360
but he was an excellent fighter.

6389
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:12,050
His Day.

6390
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:17,050
It very dangerous striker and Anderson
Silva just ran it on him and the way he

6391
02:38:17,751 --> 02:38:22,751
attacked him so systematically his legs
out from under him and Anderson just

6392
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:26,570
fought brilliantly and also
showed a fucking worldclass chin.

6393
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:27,000
Yeah,

6394
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:27,260
know,

6395
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:30,590
which is interesting because this is the
first time we've really seen Anderson

6396
02:38:30,591 --> 02:38:32,900
staggered and hurt and stopped.

6397
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:34,590
It's never happened before and it's,

6398
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:34,970
it's,

6399
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:35,190
it's,

6400
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:36,140
it's such a cliche.

6401
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:37,520
It's the shot you didn't expect.

6402
02:38:37,521 --> 02:38:38,170
Exactly.

6403
02:38:38,170 --> 02:38:38,991
So cliche,

6404
02:38:38,991 --> 02:38:41,420
but even on a great fighter like Anderson,

6405
02:38:42,220 --> 02:38:43,790
I mean even on a great
fighter like Anderson,

6406
02:38:43,791 --> 02:38:44,840
it's so hard to believe,

6407
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:46,460
but it's a shot that you didn't expect.

6408
02:38:46,461 --> 02:38:46,790
Yeah.

6409
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:50,600
And perfectly landed point
of the Chin Rep legs go,

6410
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:51,621
that's it.

6411
02:38:51,621 --> 02:38:52,520
Lights are amazing,

6412
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:54,290
but it's also,

6413
02:38:54,291 --> 02:38:59,010
I think in a way it's poetic that
he's the guy who got caught that way.

6414
02:38:59,030 --> 02:38:59,510
Yeah.

6415
02:38:59,510 --> 02:39:04,010
Because as much as I'm a huge Anderson
Silva Fan and I will never not be the guy

6416
02:39:04,011 --> 02:39:07,490
who was like a human
highlight real of excellence.

6417
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,590
That's how I would describe
Anderson Silva's career,

6418
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:11,150
just infection perfection.

6419
02:39:11,690 --> 02:39:14,660
But it's good for young guys to see.

6420
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,640
It's good for young guys come up to go,

6421
02:39:16,641 --> 02:39:16,881
okay,

6422
02:39:16,881 --> 02:39:17,780
that can happen.

6423
02:39:17,810 --> 02:39:18,700
Even to that guy.

6424
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:19,793
You can't do that.

6425
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:20,850
That can happen either.

6426
02:39:20,850 --> 02:39:21,740
But you can do that though.

6427
02:39:21,741 --> 02:39:22,131
Sometimes.

6428
02:39:22,131 --> 02:39:23,920
You can do it only out.

6429
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:25,100
Only for so long.

6430
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:25,731
Yeah,

6431
02:39:25,731 --> 02:39:29,930
we're there with depends on who you're
fighting to and what's the circumstance.

6432
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:30,793
You know?

6433
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:31,161
You know what,

6434
02:39:31,161 --> 02:39:31,341
fine.

6435
02:39:31,341 --> 02:39:32,061
I'm looking forward to,

6436
02:39:32,061 --> 02:39:32,480
man.

6437
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:34,040
It's fucking to this weekend.

6438
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,770
You're Riaa Hall and John Dooms Day,

6439
02:39:36,771 --> 02:39:37,604
Howard.

6440
02:39:38,050 --> 02:39:38,300
Uh,

6441
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:39,230
they're going to slug it out,

6442
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,490
going to beat the crap out of each other.

6443
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:44,060
That's kind of people who don't know.

6444
02:39:44,061 --> 02:39:46,520
If you don't remember
John Howard and you know,

6445
02:39:46,521 --> 02:39:48,680
you seen her ride Uriah hall from tough,

6446
02:39:48,681 --> 02:39:51,590
who would just had some of the most
wicked knockouts in the history of the

6447
02:39:51,591 --> 02:39:52,880
fucking competition.

6448
02:39:53,240 --> 02:39:54,450
The ultimate fighter is like the,

6449
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:54,661
the,

6450
02:39:54,661 --> 02:39:56,300
the highlight reel of ultimate fighter.

6451
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:57,970
Without a doubt at the tops arrival hall.

6452
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:58,121
Oh,

6453
02:39:58,121 --> 02:39:58,580
by far,

6454
02:39:58,580 --> 02:39:59,331
without a doubt.

6455
02:39:59,331 --> 02:40:03,290
That wheel kick k that the right
hand to make it into the finals.

6456
02:40:03,291 --> 02:40:03,471
I mean,

6457
02:40:03,471 --> 02:40:05,030
he's a fucking monster,

6458
02:40:05,031 --> 02:40:05,420
man.

6459
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:06,440
He is really tough.

6460
02:40:06,470 --> 02:40:07,580
His striking is so,

6461
02:40:07,581 --> 02:40:11,900
but you know who throws
fucking hammers dooms day.

6462
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:13,063
John Howard,

6463
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:14,460
a good Yammer,

6464
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:15,420
tie striker.

6465
02:40:15,421 --> 02:40:18,090
He's real good able to
do that and I think it's,

6466
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:19,831
Oh man,

6467
02:40:19,831 --> 02:40:20,121
that's it.

6468
02:40:20,121 --> 02:40:20,821
That's a tough call.

6469
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:22,530
I'm going to have to go
with your idea I think,

6470
02:40:22,531 --> 02:40:26,640
but I mean if anyone's going
to end up spoiling that party,

6471
02:40:26,641 --> 02:40:27,474
it's going to be Howard.

6472
02:40:27,850 --> 02:40:30,610
Well you know Howard is
also only like five seven.

6473
02:40:30,670 --> 02:40:30,881
Yeah,

6474
02:40:30,881 --> 02:40:31,770
that's what I'm saying is short.

6475
02:40:31,930 --> 02:40:32,763
It's interesting.

6476
02:40:32,980 --> 02:40:33,820
I wonder,

6477
02:40:33,821 --> 02:40:35,350
I mean he's off thick motherfucker.

6478
02:40:35,560 --> 02:40:37,470
There's some guys that even at,

6479
02:40:37,471 --> 02:40:39,250
especially as they get
older in their career,

6480
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,170
they actually do better
when they go up in weight.

6481
02:40:41,470 --> 02:40:41,861
You know?

6482
02:40:41,861 --> 02:40:44,500
I wonder if that's going to be the case
where a wonder if he can carry that

6483
02:40:44,501 --> 02:40:44,861
power,

6484
02:40:44,861 --> 02:40:45,970
that one 70 pounds.

6485
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:49,330
That motherfucker carries
that power so hard.

6486
02:40:49,690 --> 02:40:50,180
It does it.

6487
02:40:50,180 --> 02:40:52,010
I mean he's got that kind of hit hardware.

6488
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:54,040
It doesn't matter if he
goes up a weight class,

6489
02:40:54,280 --> 02:40:56,860
you know it's probably the guys are
going to be able to absorb it better.

6490
02:40:57,010 --> 02:40:57,550
But he,

6491
02:40:57,550 --> 02:41:02,550
he throws some stupid one punch power
that hauls got a very diverse game too

6492
02:41:03,221 --> 02:41:03,850
though.

6493
02:41:03,850 --> 02:41:05,350
Hall does a lot of wild shit.

6494
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:06,470
Yeah.

6495
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:06,980
That,

6496
02:41:06,980 --> 02:41:07,880
that's a very,

6497
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:08,830
cause you,

6498
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:09,621
when you get the guy that's,

6499
02:41:09,621 --> 02:41:10,454
that's very,

6500
02:41:10,460 --> 02:41:11,390
very [inaudible],

6501
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:12,230
you know,

6502
02:41:12,230 --> 02:41:16,190
sometimes that random shits either going
to work really well or it's going to

6503
02:41:16,191 --> 02:41:18,320
get you in some trouble and you're
gonna take a fucking beating.

6504
02:41:18,530 --> 02:41:18,951
That's true.

6505
02:41:18,951 --> 02:41:19,131
Right.

6506
02:41:19,131 --> 02:41:22,580
If you miss and you slept and your back
is turned and did you just going to get

6507
02:41:22,581 --> 02:41:23,240
bludgeoned,

6508
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:23,920
especially if you can

6509
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:24,840
catch your legs.

6510
02:41:25,210 --> 02:41:26,400
I think that it's interesting.

6511
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:26,701
It's a,

6512
02:41:26,701 --> 02:41:28,620
it's an interesting thing
because your eye has a,

6513
02:41:28,630 --> 02:41:28,980
uh,

6514
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:31,290
I mean he obviously has a
lot of Moitai skills as well,

6515
02:41:31,291 --> 02:41:34,470
but he also has a lot of
traditional like karate style,

6516
02:41:34,471 --> 02:41:36,150
taekwondo style techniques.

6517
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:38,070
It's always interesting
when you see those,

6518
02:41:38,071 --> 02:41:38,201
the,

6519
02:41:38,201 --> 02:41:39,034
the clash of those.

6520
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:39,631
Yeah.

6521
02:41:39,631 --> 02:41:43,470
I was actually just talking to a layout
as brother on the way back from the,

6522
02:41:43,471 --> 02:41:46,440
from the fight to the hotel and uh,

6523
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:48,031
it's kind of awkward.

6524
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:48,230
He's like,

6525
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:49,500
so who do you think one?

6526
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:50,960
Oh Shit.

6527
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:52,193
Ah,

6528
02:41:52,230 --> 02:41:53,310
honestly that fight sucked.

6529
02:41:54,060 --> 02:41:55,220
It wasn't the best fight of,

6530
02:41:55,221 --> 02:41:56,070
but I enjoyed it.

6531
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:56,910
It was,

6532
02:41:56,910 --> 02:41:57,681
I wouldn't say that fight,

6533
02:41:57,681 --> 02:41:58,351
so it was just,

6534
02:41:58,351 --> 02:41:58,800
well,

6535
02:41:58,800 --> 02:41:59,520
I mean for,

6536
02:41:59,520 --> 02:41:59,861
I don't know,

6537
02:41:59,861 --> 02:42:04,510
I didn't like it very much because I
think that neither of them did enough to,

6538
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,940
to really win that much.

6539
02:42:05,941 --> 02:42:06,121
I mean,

6540
02:42:06,121 --> 02:42:06,331
it was,

6541
02:42:06,331 --> 02:42:06,490
it was,

6542
02:42:06,490 --> 02:42:07,470
it was a toss up.

6543
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:07,981
It was,

6544
02:42:07,981 --> 02:42:09,540
it was just not exciting to me.

6545
02:42:09,541 --> 02:42:10,800
Maybe you're so crazy.

6546
02:42:10,950 --> 02:42:12,000
I thought it was very exciting.

6547
02:42:12,030 --> 02:42:14,400
It was just so crazy.

6548
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:15,930
It was just one of the things that,

6549
02:42:15,931 --> 02:42:16,500
I mean,

6550
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:16,891
it had,

6551
02:42:16,891 --> 02:42:17,940
it had flashes of brilliance.

6552
02:42:17,941 --> 02:42:18,930
Both guys are awesome.

6553
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:20,010
I liked both guys a lot.

6554
02:42:20,011 --> 02:42:20,341
It's just,

6555
02:42:20,341 --> 02:42:21,510
it just was a bad matchup.

6556
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:22,291
It didn't work out well.

6557
02:42:22,291 --> 02:42:22,430
Well,

6558
02:42:22,430 --> 02:42:23,300
you know what I think,

6559
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:28,360
I think that it wasn't as exciting as
it could have been because not a lot of

6560
02:42:28,671 --> 02:42:29,810
action took place.

6561
02:42:29,811 --> 02:42:34,370
But to me it was very entertaining because
I was watching a puzzle take place.

6562
02:42:34,371 --> 02:42:34,760
That's true.

6563
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:36,320
And I was watching it trying to be solved.

6564
02:42:36,321 --> 02:42:38,220
I was watching Phil Davis
tried to hit to take down.

6565
02:42:38,230 --> 02:42:38,420
Yeah,

6566
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:40,610
I was watching Liotta try
to defend and land shots.

6567
02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:42,980
And Phil Davis landing shots of his own.

6568
02:42:43,190 --> 02:42:43,730
You know,

6569
02:42:43,730 --> 02:42:44,840
and it's interesting,

6570
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:45,111
you know,

6571
02:42:45,111 --> 02:42:48,890
if it was just a kickboxing match it
would be curious to see how it would have

6572
02:42:48,891 --> 02:42:49,724
gone down.

6573
02:42:49,730 --> 02:42:52,280
But you throw in the
wrestling and you know,

6574
02:42:52,281 --> 02:42:54,740
Davis accounted himself
very well on the feet.

6575
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:54,900
Yeah.

6576
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:56,600
Which I think surprised a lot of people.

6577
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:57,141
You know,

6578
02:42:57,141 --> 02:42:59,000
you look at the way Machida knocked out.

6579
02:42:59,001 --> 02:42:59,840
Ryan Bader,

6580
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:03,740
you look at the way Machida knocked out
Thiago Silva Machida's used that sniping

6581
02:43:03,741 --> 02:43:07,880
style on some really highly skilled
strikers and fuck them up bad.

6582
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:08,200
But you know,

6583
02:43:08,200 --> 02:43:08,290
they,

6584
02:43:08,290 --> 02:43:09,710
especially the Thiago Silva fight,

6585
02:43:09,711 --> 02:43:10,730
I mean Ooh.

6586
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:13,570
And Bader man caught him
with one punch coming in.

6587
02:43:13,571 --> 02:43:15,880
I mean he's a bad motherfucker
as far as his counters.

6588
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:19,360
And Phil Davis didn't really
take any of them full clip.

6589
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:19,930
You know,

6590
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:20,770
he avoided,

6591
02:43:21,010 --> 02:43:23,170
he took some shots but he
rolled with a lot of them.

6592
02:43:23,380 --> 02:43:24,550
He had good defense,

6593
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:25,540
took a good shot.

6594
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:27,700
Like it showed good chin constantly.

6595
02:43:27,701 --> 02:43:27,791
What?

6596
02:43:27,791 --> 02:43:28,780
He never was squared up.

6597
02:43:28,781 --> 02:43:29,291
He was constant.

6598
02:43:29,291 --> 02:43:31,270
He was constantly moving
back and forth and,

6599
02:43:31,271 --> 02:43:32,260
and had good head movement.

6600
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:33,250
But you know,

6601
02:43:33,251 --> 02:43:35,110
I think Machida landed more strikes.

6602
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:35,530
Oh yeah.

6603
02:43:35,530 --> 02:43:35,741
You know,

6604
02:43:35,741 --> 02:43:39,010
so it becomes a matter of what's more
important is to take down more important.

6605
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:41,140
But when he did he hit a take down what,

6606
02:43:41,141 --> 02:43:43,510
how much damage was actually
accomplished during a tank down.

6607
02:43:43,511 --> 02:43:44,344
Exactly.

6608
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:45,340
Do you feel like there's like a,

6609
02:43:45,640 --> 02:43:48,600
an overhaul that needs to be
done with the scoring system?

6610
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:52,330
They definitely need to figure this
out because there's been so many,

6611
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:52,960
I mean,

6612
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:53,370
put my,

6613
02:43:53,370 --> 02:43:54,880
my shitty call aside.

6614
02:43:54,910 --> 02:43:55,151
I mean,

6615
02:43:55,151 --> 02:43:57,460
there's been so many that are bad that,

6616
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:58,920
I mean they need to have a,

6617
02:43:58,930 --> 02:43:59,763
um,

6618
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:04,330
maybe it's a scoring system
where a takedown is this much,

6619
02:44:04,450 --> 02:44:04,631
you know,

6620
02:44:04,631 --> 02:44:05,110
but it,

6621
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:08,860
it just has to be like fought over by a
big group people to just to just figure

6622
02:44:08,880 --> 02:44:09,850
out every angle,

6623
02:44:09,851 --> 02:44:10,480
you know,

6624
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:10,721
and,

6625
02:44:10,721 --> 02:44:13,540
and because people are going to keep
on getting screwed no matter what.

6626
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:14,980
And for folks who don't understand,

6627
02:44:14,981 --> 02:44:15,610
again,

6628
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:17,620
we talked about if you're
not like a fan of the sport,

6629
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:18,120
the,

6630
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:18,401
the,

6631
02:44:18,401 --> 02:44:21,250
the state athletic
commission is the one who uh,

6632
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:23,680
choose the judges and you know,

6633
02:44:23,681 --> 02:44:27,220
the rules are in place essentially
like piggyback from boxing.

6634
02:44:27,240 --> 02:44:27,490
Yeah,

6635
02:44:27,490 --> 02:44:28,000
they paid,

6636
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,500
they took the ten nine system.

6637
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:31,150
So one fighter,

6638
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:31,570
uh,

6639
02:44:31,570 --> 02:44:32,351
if they win,

6640
02:44:32,351 --> 02:44:33,160
they get 10 points.

6641
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:33,971
If they lose the round,

6642
02:44:33,971 --> 02:44:37,360
they get nine points and the
difference is in a boxing match,

6643
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:38,201
there's 10,

6644
02:44:38,201 --> 02:44:39,280
nine and then there's 10,

6645
02:44:39,281 --> 02:44:39,551
eight.

6646
02:44:39,551 --> 02:44:40,320
If there's a knockdown,

6647
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,541
it's like,

6648
02:44:40,541 --> 02:44:42,210
it's easier to define ten seventh,

6649
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:42,991
there's two knocked down.

6650
02:44:42,991 --> 02:44:43,090
It's,

6651
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:44,290
it's pretty easy to define.

6652
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:47,470
It's very rare that fighter gets
knocked down but wins the round.

6653
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:51,610
Whereas in MMA you're dealing with a
longer round and you're dealing with all

6654
02:44:51,611 --> 02:44:52,391
these other variables,

6655
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:54,670
kicks and take downs
near submission attempts.

6656
02:44:54,850 --> 02:44:56,560
If a guy like peppers,

6657
02:44:56,620 --> 02:45:00,370
a guy with a with strikes
and then he gets taken down.

6658
02:45:00,460 --> 02:45:03,820
But absolutely nothing happens
while he's on the ground.

6659
02:45:03,821 --> 02:45:04,960
He just ties the guy up.

6660
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:08,710
How much damage does he take and is it
equal to all the punches that he landed

6661
02:45:08,711 --> 02:45:09,491
before you were taking?

6662
02:45:09,491 --> 02:45:10,324
He was taken down.

6663
02:45:10,360 --> 02:45:14,230
It becomes a weird situation of like
what's worth more forcing the fight into

6664
02:45:14,231 --> 02:45:15,610
the area where the fighter wants it,

6665
02:45:15,611 --> 02:45:19,330
whether it's through a takedown or forcing
the fight by standing up and landing

6666
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:20,710
strikes Leister by stopping the tape.

6667
02:45:20,750 --> 02:45:21,160
Right.

6668
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:21,851
What is more,

6669
02:45:21,851 --> 02:45:22,601
what's worth more?

6670
02:45:22,601 --> 02:45:23,410
Is it a,

6671
02:45:23,410 --> 02:45:23,711
you know,

6672
02:45:23,711 --> 02:45:26,980
a take down or defending yourself and
attacking from the guard and getting a

6673
02:45:26,981 --> 02:45:27,581
near submission?

6674
02:45:27,581 --> 02:45:27,970
Yeah,

6675
02:45:27,970 --> 02:45:30,250
like if a guy takes you down but you
almost get them in a triangle like,

6676
02:45:30,730 --> 02:45:31,240
hmm,

6677
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:33,180
how does a judge really know
how to score that correctly?

6678
02:45:33,250 --> 02:45:34,330
That's it gets tricky.

6679
02:45:34,331 --> 02:45:34,630
Right.

6680
02:45:34,630 --> 02:45:39,070
Especially not some random person who
got their job just because they know they

6681
02:45:39,071 --> 02:45:40,240
know someone who works there.

6682
02:45:40,360 --> 02:45:40,571
Yeah.

6683
02:45:40,571 --> 02:45:42,460
I mean I'm sure they
teach them some stuff,

6684
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:44,590
but my take on it has always been there.

6685
02:45:44,591 --> 02:45:49,060
So many fans out there that would love
that Gig and they were like huge fans of

6686
02:45:49,061 --> 02:45:50,980
MMA and would do a good job.

6687
02:45:51,020 --> 02:45:51,790
Much better job.

6688
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:52,180
Yeah.

6689
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:54,550
I think it should be like a Yelp
thing and the Internet Yelp thing.

6690
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:56,530
They should do what you do
without at the UFC from now on,

6691
02:45:56,531 --> 02:46:01,390
which do online vote came to give them
an opportunity for an online metro pcs

6692
02:46:01,391 --> 02:46:01,840
vote.

6693
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:02,591
Metro pcs.

6694
02:46:02,591 --> 02:46:03,424
Let's make this happen.

6695
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:04,390
Maybe a bud light vote,

6696
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:04,781
bud light.

6697
02:46:04,781 --> 02:46:05,810
Bud light doesn't like us anymore.

6698
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:07,090
The Culinary Union got rid of him.

6699
02:46:07,340 --> 02:46:07,740
Ooh,

6700
02:46:07,740 --> 02:46:09,010
I think it's bud light or Miller,

6701
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:09,943
wherever it was.

6702
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:10,790
I don't know.

6703
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:11,300
Um,

6704
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:12,860
Overeem and browns this weekend too,

6705
02:46:12,861 --> 02:46:13,694
man.

6706
02:46:13,850 --> 02:46:14,600
Um,

6707
02:46:14,600 --> 02:46:17,110
I want to Travis to win because I'm,

6708
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:17,590
I'm,

6709
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:17,800
you know,

6710
02:46:17,800 --> 02:46:18,440
I'm friends with them,

6711
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:19,273
but,

6712
02:46:20,090 --> 02:46:20,620
okay.

6713
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:21,191
Can he,

6714
02:46:21,191 --> 02:46:23,920
I mean Overeem's too cocky,

6715
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:24,701
you know,

6716
02:46:24,701 --> 02:46:24,940
mate,

6717
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:25,361
maybe,

6718
02:46:25,361 --> 02:46:25,601
you know,

6719
02:46:25,601 --> 02:46:25,811
we,

6720
02:46:25,811 --> 02:46:26,631
we saw that in,

6721
02:46:26,631 --> 02:46:26,921
in the,

6722
02:46:26,921 --> 02:46:27,611
in the Silva fight.

6723
02:46:27,611 --> 02:46:28,331
He got knocked out.

6724
02:46:28,331 --> 02:46:30,340
He's a better fighter technically.

6725
02:46:30,610 --> 02:46:32,710
Then I think just about anyone
in the heavyweight division,

6726
02:46:32,711 --> 02:46:34,540
if you break down just about each aspect,

6727
02:46:34,900 --> 02:46:35,733
but,

6728
02:46:35,990 --> 02:46:36,270
okay.

6729
02:46:36,270 --> 02:46:37,940
I don't know if it's
his lazy or what it is.

6730
02:46:37,941 --> 02:46:38,220
He just,

6731
02:46:38,220 --> 02:46:38,851
he casts out.

6732
02:46:38,851 --> 02:46:40,200
It's just there's
something wrong with him.

6733
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:40,381
Well,

6734
02:46:40,381 --> 02:46:42,300
I think you also asked to
deal with his hormones.

6735
02:46:42,570 --> 02:46:43,140
I mean,

6736
02:46:43,140 --> 02:46:43,320
yeah,

6737
02:46:43,320 --> 02:46:44,790
of course this is a reality of that.

6738
02:46:44,890 --> 02:46:45,270
Let,

6739
02:46:45,270 --> 02:46:46,140
let's be honest here.

6740
02:46:46,220 --> 02:46:46,440
Yeah.

6741
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:47,910
You can't not talk about that exactly.

6742
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:53,070
He had a completely different shape to
his body when he came back after testing

6743
02:46:53,551 --> 02:46:55,260
positive for testosterone.

6744
02:46:55,261 --> 02:46:55,710
Yeah.

6745
02:46:55,710 --> 02:46:56,490
So when,

6746
02:46:56,490 --> 02:46:57,323
when you do that,

6747
02:46:57,450 --> 02:46:57,781
you know,

6748
02:46:57,781 --> 02:46:58,320
I mean,

6749
02:46:58,320 --> 02:46:58,740
and I,

6750
02:46:58,740 --> 02:46:59,101
you know,

6751
02:46:59,101 --> 02:47:03,450
I have no reason to believe that he
didn't accidentally get this injection by

6752
02:47:03,451 --> 02:47:05,370
this doctor who was going
to fix your shoulder.

6753
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:05,551
Yeah.

6754
02:47:05,551 --> 02:47:06,720
It might have happened that way,

6755
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:07,590
you know,

6756
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:11,940
or it might've been that in pride and
there's other organizations and k one you

6757
02:47:11,941 --> 02:47:14,340
could get away with doing things and
then when you get off those things,

6758
02:47:14,341 --> 02:47:16,890
the problem is your body doesn't exactly
know what the fucking do exactly.

6759
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:17,371
Because uh,

6760
02:47:17,371 --> 02:47:17,671
your,

6761
02:47:17,671 --> 02:47:19,180
your testosterone is really low and he,

6762
02:47:19,181 --> 02:47:22,440
so he tested like really low for
his last fight against big foot.

6763
02:47:22,470 --> 02:47:22,860
Yeah.

6764
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:24,440
Like almost in like a dangerous area.

6765
02:47:24,460 --> 02:47:25,230
Like whoa,

6766
02:47:25,230 --> 02:47:28,800
that's a professional athlete and this
is like really low and you're that big.

6767
02:47:29,250 --> 02:47:30,070
Yeah.

6768
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:32,600
So it's interesting and it's
unfortunate because man,

6769
02:47:32,601 --> 02:47:35,070
you juiced up dude up
and he's a motherfucker.

6770
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:35,370
Yeah.

6771
02:47:35,370 --> 02:47:36,203
You know when,

6772
02:47:36,270 --> 02:47:37,800
when he was finding Brock Lesnar,

6773
02:47:37,801 --> 02:47:38,940
and I'm not saying he was juiced up,

6774
02:47:38,941 --> 02:47:40,080
but let's just say for instance,

6775
02:47:40,081 --> 02:47:40,891
if he was juiced up,

6776
02:47:40,891 --> 02:47:42,300
then God damn,

6777
02:47:42,301 --> 02:47:43,560
he looked good and scary.

6778
02:47:44,010 --> 02:47:45,540
Dude that fight against Brock Lesnar,

6779
02:47:45,541 --> 02:47:46,980
he ragdolled Lesnar,

6780
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:50,570
he slammed those kicks into his body
and he was kicking Lesnar and Lesnar was

6781
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:51,900
just like ultra wrestler.

6782
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:52,270
Yeah.

6783
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:53,041
He didn't give a fuck.

6784
02:47:53,041 --> 02:47:56,110
You still slamming kicks into objects
and knees and do his midsection.

6785
02:47:56,490 --> 02:47:59,070
The clench and Laszlow
couldn't take him down.

6786
02:47:59,070 --> 02:47:59,281
You like,

6787
02:47:59,281 --> 02:48:03,000
how is this pain hundred pound guys
that were just clubbing each other like,

6788
02:48:03,001 --> 02:48:04,320
oh dude,

6789
02:48:04,410 --> 02:48:05,460
whatever he was on,

6790
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:06,660
let's say he was on nothing.

6791
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:07,260
Yeah,

6792
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:08,100
whatever that,

6793
02:48:08,130 --> 02:48:10,050
that shape that he was in back then,

6794
02:48:10,170 --> 02:48:11,360
that's the scary it.

6795
02:48:11,370 --> 02:48:11,700
Yes.

6796
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:12,511
That's the Overeem.

6797
02:48:12,511 --> 02:48:14,460
Did everybody thought it was going
to be the greatest heavyweight?

6798
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:15,841
You've all time,

6799
02:48:15,841 --> 02:48:17,450
just wicked ground game.

6800
02:48:17,451 --> 02:48:17,971
So Mitzvah,

6801
02:48:17,971 --> 02:48:18,151
Torah,

6802
02:48:18,151 --> 02:48:18,721
Belford winds,

6803
02:48:18,721 --> 02:48:20,040
the Abu Dhabi trials.

6804
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:20,691
I mean he's,

6805
02:48:20,691 --> 02:48:21,730
he's a motherfucker one.

6806
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:22,583
The Europeans,

6807
02:48:22,950 --> 02:48:23,521
as you know,

6808
02:48:23,521 --> 02:48:24,100
a grappler,

6809
02:48:24,100 --> 02:48:24,960
straight grappler.

6810
02:48:25,830 --> 02:48:26,220
That's a,

6811
02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:27,330
that's a big fucking fight,

6812
02:48:27,331 --> 02:48:27,750
man.

6813
02:48:27,750 --> 02:48:28,240
You know what else?

6814
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:29,073
A big fine.

6815
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:31,753
Travis.

6816
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:32,270
Uh,

6817
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:32,560
uh,

6818
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:32,921
excuse me.

6819
02:48:32,921 --> 02:48:34,480
Matt Brown versus Mike Pyle.

6820
02:48:35,290 --> 02:48:36,690
That's another very interesting fight.

6821
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:37,360
A good fight.

6822
02:48:37,360 --> 02:48:37,770
I'm going to go,

6823
02:48:37,770 --> 02:48:38,603
I'm going to go with Mike.

6824
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:39,670
Yeah,

6825
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:40,030
yeah.

6826
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:40,691
I think piles too.

6827
02:48:40,691 --> 02:48:41,470
Crafty.

6828
02:48:41,470 --> 02:48:42,000
Yeah,

6829
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:43,090
that's exactly what I think it is.

6830
02:48:43,091 --> 02:48:44,500
I think that that Brown's good.

6831
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:45,131
I mean he's,

6832
02:48:45,131 --> 02:48:45,341
you know,

6833
02:48:45,341 --> 02:48:46,960
he's obviously been in
forever for a reason,

6834
02:48:46,961 --> 02:48:47,651
but I think that,

6835
02:48:47,651 --> 02:48:48,280
uh,

6836
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,360
that piles to crafty,

6837
02:48:49,361 --> 02:48:49,541
he'll,

6838
02:48:49,541 --> 02:48:52,260
he'll end up getting him as something
piles a craft and motherfucker,

6839
02:48:52,270 --> 02:48:52,550
he's,

6840
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:54,070
he's an underdog man.

6841
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:56,410
And it's not in this fight necessarily.

6842
02:48:56,411 --> 02:48:59,860
I'm sure it probably is listed as an
underdog with Matt Brown coming off his

6843
02:48:59,861 --> 02:49:00,460
last fight.

6844
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:01,450
But I meaning that division,

6845
02:49:01,451 --> 02:49:02,350
he's like a dark horse.

6846
02:49:02,351 --> 02:49:03,020
Like you can be sure.

6847
02:49:03,020 --> 02:49:04,810
A lot of the top guys,

6848
02:49:05,110 --> 02:49:05,261
you know,

6849
02:49:05,261 --> 02:49:08,250
and everybody that trains with Mike Pyle
will you that like Mike Pyle and the

6850
02:49:08,251 --> 02:49:09,950
gym is this motherfucker.

6851
02:49:09,970 --> 02:49:10,320
Yeah.

6852
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:12,030
Like he's even guys that have beaten him.

6853
02:49:12,031 --> 02:49:13,710
He fucking trounces in the gym.

6854
02:49:14,130 --> 02:49:14,491
You know,

6855
02:49:14,491 --> 02:49:17,880
it's like just sort of coming
into his own final as a fighter.

6856
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:19,590
And he's had a long career already,

6857
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:22,200
but Matt Brown is a
special kind of savage.

6858
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:22,800
Yes.

6859
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:23,191
This is a,

6860
02:49:23,191 --> 02:49:27,420
there's a darkness to that man's heart
when he fucking comes after dudes.

6861
02:49:27,750 --> 02:49:28,530
You could like,

6862
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:31,170
you could smell the devil in the
room when he's beaten on dudes.

6863
02:49:31,171 --> 02:49:31,711
I'm telling you,

6864
02:49:31,711 --> 02:49:32,340
man,

6865
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:35,610
that fight with Jordan mean that
that was a fight to the death.

6866
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:37,420
That was a fight to the death match.

6867
02:49:37,421 --> 02:49:38,450
And I think if I saw that fight,

6868
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:40,200
that was an incredible fight.

6869
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:41,820
Incredible fucking fight.

6870
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,780
He went after me and in me and he's like,

6871
02:49:43,810 --> 02:49:44,360
tough,

6872
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:45,510
talented kid.

6873
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:46,950
He's fucking good.

6874
02:49:46,951 --> 02:49:49,410
And Matt Brown put a assault on him.

6875
02:49:49,770 --> 02:49:50,340
It was a,

6876
02:49:50,340 --> 02:49:54,990
you smelled the devil who smelled just
just wisp of brimstone as he's beating

6877
02:49:54,991 --> 02:49:55,920
the fuck out of this dude.

6878
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:56,753
You're like this guy.

6879
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:57,241
There's a,

6880
02:49:57,241 --> 02:50:01,560
there's a certain fury that that dude
brings into the cage is he's got that

6881
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:01,981
instinct.

6882
02:50:01,981 --> 02:50:02,611
He's got that,

6883
02:50:02,611 --> 02:50:03,444
that,

6884
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:05,190
that wants to wear your
skin kind of thing.

6885
02:50:05,370 --> 02:50:07,980
All these fucking dudes
that went through rehab.

6886
02:50:09,370 --> 02:50:11,160
What is it about the Rehab?

6887
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:11,770
Oh yeah,

6888
02:50:11,770 --> 02:50:12,001
man.

6889
02:50:12,001 --> 02:50:15,090
He had also some similar near
death experiences with drugs.

6890
02:50:15,710 --> 02:50:16,640
Rory Macdonald's so weird.

6891
02:50:17,130 --> 02:50:17,550
I see it.

6892
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:19,860
Its own issues but you see
what it's got his own issues.

6893
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:21,060
But uh,

6894
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:21,893
it's uh,

6895
02:50:22,170 --> 02:50:23,070
think about um,

6896
02:50:23,150 --> 02:50:23,340
uh,

6897
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:24,510
court court McGee.

6898
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:24,780
Yeah.

6899
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:25,410
Another one.

6900
02:50:25,410 --> 02:50:26,610
Same sort of situation.

6901
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:27,960
That dude's fierce.

6902
02:50:27,961 --> 02:50:28,794
Man.

6903
02:50:28,930 --> 02:50:32,520
Court McGee is a bad motherfucker
and he doesn't get tired man.

6904
02:50:32,521 --> 02:50:33,420
He never gets tired,

6905
02:50:33,421 --> 02:50:36,510
keeps calm and have you see
that Gal elevation training.

6906
02:50:36,511 --> 02:50:36,811
There you go.

6907
02:50:36,811 --> 02:50:39,300
He elevation with weight vests in hills.

6908
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:41,760
The fucking dude runs miles
with a weight vest on.

6909
02:50:42,150 --> 02:50:42,930
He doesn't get tired.

6910
02:50:42,930 --> 02:50:43,620
He's a tank.

6911
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:43,801
Yeah,

6912
02:50:43,801 --> 02:50:44,490
he's a scary dude.

6913
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:45,240
And it's the same thing.

6914
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:47,310
These dudes that go
through crazy adversity,

6915
02:50:47,430 --> 02:50:49,950
even if it's self imposed
adversity like drugs.

6916
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:51,030
There's some,

6917
02:50:51,030 --> 02:50:52,260
you guys been to the other side?

6918
02:50:52,261 --> 02:50:53,094
Is that what it is?

6919
02:50:53,700 --> 02:50:54,290
Yeah.

6920
02:50:54,290 --> 02:50:54,720
So Hannah,

6921
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:55,650
I don't ever want to go back,

6922
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:56,671
but you,

6923
02:50:56,671 --> 02:50:56,911
you,

6924
02:50:56,911 --> 02:50:58,680
you have had like a near death experience.

6925
02:50:58,710 --> 02:51:01,640
I died but then he didn't die right away.

6926
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:02,050
Got My,

6927
02:51:02,050 --> 02:51:05,220
that I got hit with like three Epi pens
and the paddles can just see aliens.

6928
02:51:05,880 --> 02:51:06,251
Um,

6929
02:51:06,251 --> 02:51:06,511
no,

6930
02:51:06,511 --> 02:51:07,141
there was no light.

6931
02:51:07,141 --> 02:51:09,660
I woke up in the hospital with my
brother just shaking his head at me.

6932
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:10,560
Whoa.

6933
02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:12,960
So you didn't know anything
and this was a real overdose.

6934
02:51:12,961 --> 02:51:13,560
This wasn't like,

6935
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:13,741
oh,

6936
02:51:13,741 --> 02:51:15,870
I overdosed and they've
let me out the night.

6937
02:51:15,871 --> 02:51:16,650
That night.

6938
02:51:16,650 --> 02:51:16,861
No,

6939
02:51:16,861 --> 02:51:18,180
I was in the hospital for a week.

6940
02:51:18,570 --> 02:51:19,020
Whoa.

6941
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:20,940
Like I aspirated like I had pneumonia,

6942
02:51:20,941 --> 02:51:23,700
like I actually was dead
and they brought me back.

6943
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:24,593
Was it pills?

6944
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:24,811
Yeah,

6945
02:51:24,811 --> 02:51:25,441
it was mix of,

6946
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:29,180
of pills and alcohol and more pills and
this other pills and some GHB and some

6947
02:51:30,670 --> 02:51:31,680
God damn.

6948
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:32,161
I just,

6949
02:51:32,161 --> 02:51:35,670
and I was sober for a while and I just
went right back and I just used me

6950
02:51:35,671 --> 02:51:38,580
getting a tattoo as an
excuse to get fucked up.

6951
02:51:38,581 --> 02:51:39,840
And it,

6952
02:51:39,841 --> 02:51:40,410
uh,

6953
02:51:40,410 --> 02:51:41,011
I literally,

6954
02:51:41,011 --> 02:51:41,580
I remember,

6955
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:45,480
I remember parts of it and then I remember
waking up in the hospital with just

6956
02:51:45,481 --> 02:51:46,314
like,

6957
02:51:47,460 --> 02:51:48,293
you know,

6958
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:51,450
one of my friends and I don't
know how the hell she got there.

6959
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:52,171
Still to this day.

6960
02:51:52,171 --> 02:51:55,890
I never even asked to just to stop your
story right now and make the rest of it

6961
02:51:55,891 --> 02:51:58,320
up and write a book about what
I learned on the other side.

6962
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:00,660
How many dudes get to
go to the other side?

6963
02:52:00,700 --> 02:52:00,990
Ah,

6964
02:52:00,990 --> 02:52:02,310
just make a dope book about it.

6965
02:52:02,311 --> 02:52:03,144
Make some shit up.

6966
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:06,191
I saw the light.

6967
02:52:06,191 --> 02:52:06,761
You could do it.

6968
02:52:06,761 --> 02:52:07,750
You've been to heaven.

6969
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:08,831
He came back,

6970
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:09,131
man.

6971
02:52:09,131 --> 02:52:10,060
You could tell us some shit.

6972
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,631
Just makes me,

6973
02:52:10,631 --> 02:52:11,170
it's true.

6974
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:11,580
Okay.

6975
02:52:11,580 --> 02:52:12,430
Shh.

6976
02:52:12,490 --> 02:52:13,323
Don't tell anybody.

6977
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:13,631
Okay,

6978
02:52:13,631 --> 02:52:14,211
so you don't want really,

6979
02:52:14,211 --> 02:52:15,044
you wanna know what happened.

6980
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:16,391
Do you feel,

6981
02:52:16,391 --> 02:52:16,930
um,

6982
02:52:16,930 --> 02:52:19,150
like they have like a
second chance at life?

6983
02:52:19,810 --> 02:52:20,410
Yeah,

6984
02:52:20,410 --> 02:52:21,790
definitely feel like I
have a second chance.

6985
02:52:21,960 --> 02:52:22,301
Uh,

6986
02:52:22,301 --> 02:52:23,470
and he did it feel like that?

6987
02:52:23,471 --> 02:52:24,760
Like tangibly like wow,

6988
02:52:24,761 --> 02:52:27,250
I kind of got to get this thing right?

6989
02:52:27,340 --> 02:52:28,173
Um,

6990
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:28,781
no,

6991
02:52:28,781 --> 02:52:30,190
because I still fucked up after that.

6992
02:52:31,100 --> 02:52:31,933
I still,

6993
02:52:32,530 --> 02:52:32,891
honestly,

6994
02:52:32,891 --> 02:52:34,600
I still dropped the ball
a couple times after that.

6995
02:52:34,601 --> 02:52:35,260
I still just,

6996
02:52:35,260 --> 02:52:35,530
Oh,

6997
02:52:35,530 --> 02:52:35,801
you know,

6998
02:52:35,801 --> 02:52:35,971
I'm,

6999
02:52:35,971 --> 02:52:36,850
I'm running out of time.

7000
02:52:36,910 --> 02:52:38,590
Is it three minutes left?

7001
02:52:38,620 --> 02:52:38,710
I,

7002
02:52:38,710 --> 02:52:38,990
I'm a,

7003
02:52:38,990 --> 02:52:39,241
I'm a,

7004
02:52:39,241 --> 02:52:39,610
I'm a,

7005
02:52:39,610 --> 02:52:40,870
I'm a constant threat to myself.

7006
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:41,081
Oh,

7007
02:52:41,081 --> 02:52:42,010
please get it together.

7008
02:52:42,011 --> 02:52:43,870
So you such a fun guy and that's what I'm,

7009
02:52:43,871 --> 02:52:44,471
I'm working,

7010
02:52:44,471 --> 02:52:45,430
I'm a work in progress.

7011
02:52:45,460 --> 02:52:46,930
I love underdog stories.

7012
02:52:46,990 --> 02:52:49,210
I love when a dude pulls it out.

7013
02:52:49,211 --> 02:52:51,220
Like you fucked it up in the beginning.

7014
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:51,460
You,

7015
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:53,080
Eh,

7016
02:52:53,190 --> 02:52:54,160
gets it on track.

7017
02:52:54,430 --> 02:52:56,770
I love those stories
spinning and cause I think,

7018
02:52:56,771 --> 02:52:58,190
I think they're beneficial for everybody.

7019
02:52:58,191 --> 02:52:58,271
Yeah.

7020
02:52:58,271 --> 02:52:58,871
I think I'm,

7021
02:52:58,871 --> 02:53:00,090
I'm not a perfect person.

7022
02:53:00,100 --> 02:53:00,990
I never been a person,

7023
02:53:01,090 --> 02:53:01,751
perfect person.

7024
02:53:01,751 --> 02:53:04,750
I made a lot of fucking mistakes and
I think in talking about mistakes,

7025
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:07,960
not only do I get like some
jokes and relief out of him,

7026
02:53:07,961 --> 02:53:08,860
like other people can,

7027
02:53:08,861 --> 02:53:09,940
you could realize like,

7028
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:10,450
oh,

7029
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,460
he's sucked at life too.

7030
02:53:12,510 --> 02:53:12,820
Yeah.

7031
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:13,320
You know?

7032
02:53:13,320 --> 02:53:13,690
Anyway,

7033
02:53:13,690 --> 02:53:14,321
it's therapy.

7034
02:53:14,321 --> 02:53:15,550
It's therapy for me to be able to,

7035
02:53:15,551 --> 02:53:15,791
to,

7036
02:53:15,791 --> 02:53:16,560
to,

7037
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:18,810
to explain my story to you.

7038
02:53:18,940 --> 02:53:20,770
Taking it to a whole new level
is what I'm trying to say.

7039
02:53:21,220 --> 02:53:21,581
It's like,

7040
02:53:21,581 --> 02:53:23,920
my stories are fucking
ridiculous compared to yours.

7041
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:24,281
I mean,

7042
02:53:24,281 --> 02:53:25,031
you fucking die,

7043
02:53:25,031 --> 02:53:25,810
dude.

7044
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:26,050
All right.

7045
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:28,060
That's about as fucked up as you can get.

7046
02:53:28,650 --> 02:53:30,220
You fucked up so bad.

7047
02:53:30,221 --> 02:53:35,140
Your body said we fucking quit and then
science came along and shock this dummy

7048
02:53:35,141 --> 02:53:35,801
back to life.

7049
02:53:35,801 --> 02:53:36,700
We need them around.

7050
02:53:37,210 --> 02:53:37,721
Well look man,

7051
02:53:37,721 --> 02:53:38,081
look at that.

7052
02:53:38,081 --> 02:53:40,660
You you die and then you come back
and have some awesome fights and back.

7053
02:53:40,930 --> 02:53:41,763
It's amazing.

7054
02:53:41,780 --> 02:53:42,040
Yeah,

7055
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:42,190
dude,

7056
02:53:42,190 --> 02:53:42,850
let's do this again.

7057
02:53:42,850 --> 02:53:43,330
Let's do it.

7058
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,170
Let's do it more often.

7059
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:46,240
I live close to that for all I that here,

7060
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:47,103
close enough,

7061
02:53:47,610 --> 02:53:50,170
a faster car that's just got to deal
with it and this is why you need a

7062
02:53:50,171 --> 02:53:51,010
helicopter bitch.

7063
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:52,720
Maseratis not fascinate.

7064
02:53:52,730 --> 02:53:53,021
Listen,

7065
02:53:53,021 --> 02:53:55,780
congratulations on all your
progress and thank you very much.

7066
02:53:55,781 --> 02:53:58,240
It's been a lot of fun and
you can follow him on Twitter.

7067
02:53:58,241 --> 02:54:03,241
It's uncle creepy MMA on Twitter and a
uncle creepy MMA on Instagram as well.

7068
02:54:04,361 --> 02:54:07,840
I tagged it in a picture I
took of us earlier today.

7069
02:54:08,170 --> 02:54:08,800
Ah,

7070
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:09,270
thanks man.

7071
02:54:09,270 --> 02:54:10,060
So have fun.

7072
02:54:10,060 --> 02:54:10,481
It was fun.

7073
02:54:10,481 --> 02:54:10,751
Thank you.

7074
02:54:10,751 --> 02:54:11,321
