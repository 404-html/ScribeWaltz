1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,180
but out of that lack of confidence that
you get or that lack of sense of like

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,110
not everything's threatening,

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:07,651
not every,

5
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,790
it's even like a roast.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,900
I come not even good at roasts because I
take things personally and if I'm going

7
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:13,950
to insult somebody,

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,903
I mean it,

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,511
there's no,

10
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:15,901
you know what,

11
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm cutting to the bone.

12
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,810
I'm not looking for the laugh.

13
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,010
I've gotten better at that.

14
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,700
I can,

15
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
I can,

16
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,670
I can take the hit a little
better and I enjoy it.

17
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,001
But,

18
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:24,540
uh,

19
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,120
but it's really hard if
you're a competitive person,

20
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:27,954
Andrew Insecurity,

21
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,630
you have no sense of healthy competition.

22
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,390
No one's going to want hanging around
with you and everyone's going to think

23
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,080
you're a Douche bag.

24
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,730
And what you said is really important.

25
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,260
It's sort of threatens your self
definition when you lose someone taking

26
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,293
something away,

27
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,960
right?

28
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,360
It your pride.

29
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:42,811
You're like,

30
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,340
you know your manlihood,

31
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:44,761
you're,

32
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,061
you know,

33
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,160
like how other people
are going to see you.

34
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,540
It's fucking like,

35
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,351
there was one time,

36
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:50,730
this is rock and roll oriented,

37
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:51,960
but uh,

38
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,480
it's kind of a funny story in,

39
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:58,050
in this that there's a real difference
between judging yourself against other

40
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,130
people and,

41
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,560
and just judging yourself
against your own work.

42
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,251
It's a,

43
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,580
it's a hard shift to make cause like a
lot of my career was built on like how

44
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,600
that fucking guy get that,

45
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,950
why is that guy popular?

46
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,340
Why can't you get me to get,

47
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,740
why can't I be on that show?

48
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,663
What the fuck?

49
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,710
As opposed to not realizing at that time.

50
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,180
Like I got all that stuff.

51
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,470
A lot of my breaks early on,

52
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,390
we're out of spite and looking back on it,

53
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,460
I wasn't ready for it and I,

54
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:22,920
and I botched it just
because like I had no,

55
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,281
you know,

56
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,810
I was all about the competition,

57
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,820
but there was this one time where,

58
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:27,701
you know,

59
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:30,660
if I was at a music camp and,

60
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:31,040
uh,

61
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,960
it was just basically my parents sent
me to this camp and they let you smoke,

62
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,130
it was great.

63
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,790
I was like 14 and we could smoke
cigarettes and play guitar all day.

64
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,330
Wow.

65
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,750
Yeah.

66
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,190
And then the final night,

67
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,461
like,

68
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:41,671
you know,

69
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,330
there was a big performance where the
people in the camp put together bands and

70
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,740
stuff and uh,

71
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:49,230
and you perform for the whole
camp in this big band shell.

72
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,530
So of course I ended up with these
fucking stoners and shit heads,

73
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:52,981
you know,

74
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:55,740
and we're just like the
guy I had played bass,

75
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,551
he was okay.

76
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,271
Long haired dude,

77
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,470
they're all troubled guys.

78
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,860
And a while we wanted to do is
play some chuck berry songs.

79
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,341
You know,

80
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,110
I figured how hard
could Johnny be good be,

81
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,501
you know,

82
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,390
how hard we should be
able to pull that off,

83
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,970
right?

84
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,410
And we're all,

85
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:07,621
you know,

86
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:11,850
1415 years old and then there's this
other crew of kids that were complete

87
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:15,180
fucking music nerds that like
new fucking how to read music.

88
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,920
And that could play
better than any of us in.

89
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,230
So here's what happens.

90
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:22,980
So we go on and all the dudes I'm with
get fucked up before we go on stage,

91
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,540
which is doing Johnny be good man.

92
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,871
It's,

93
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,920
it should be easy.

94
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,850
It's three courts.

95
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,130
My drummer's too fucked up to play drums.

96
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,180
The guy on piano is not playing in
the right key and it was a disaster.

97
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,710
I started singing out of key.

98
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,170
It was the most shameful and
embarrassing fucking thing.

99
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,880
I might as well just shit my pants on
stage and then we get off and those other

100
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:45,330
guys get up there and in my memory they
played the entire side of a genesis

101
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,050
album.

102
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,100
That's my memory of it,

103
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,600
that they got up there and they did
some amazing thing and I felt fucking

104
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,470
invisible.

105
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,870
I felt ashamed and to,

106
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,180
you know,

107
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,860
literally till maybe two years ago,

108
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,640
I couldn't fucking,

109
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,860
I was afraid to sing in front
of people for half of my life

110
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,850
because of that.

111
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,871
And if I just,

112
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,490
you know,

113
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,610
put more thought into,

114
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:03,941
you know,

115
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,360
making the song better and working with
these dudes and just like learning how

116
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,290
to do that shit,

117
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,370
I wouldn't have fucking,

118
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,740
it's a weird story and I don't
know if it really applies,

119
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,630
but I do know the feeling afterwards of
embarrassment and shame and I felt that

120
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,810
those guys had won and I
fucking hated him for it.

121
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,040
This in the Bible,

122
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:21,874
man,

123
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,740
that story as iron people sharpen people.

124
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,400
Yeah.

125
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,850
Yeah.

126
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,361
So what it is,

127
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:28,571
man,

128
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,530
you need to feel that.

129
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,080
You need to feel lost in order
to realize what you did wrong,

130
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,920
but you can't live in it.

131
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,221
Yeah.

132
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:33,881
You can't live in it,

133
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,420
but you,

134
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,300
it motivates you to move
forward and it motivates you.

135
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,700
But that terrible feeling
shouldn't be ignored.

136
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,540
It should be figured out.

137
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,720
It's like you got to figure out what,

138
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,101
what is,

139
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,850
what is causing this?

140
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,340
But you can lock into that
feeling for many years.

141
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,440
Like all the crazy like,

142
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,780
you know,

143
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,400
the cargo cults co what's the cargo cult?

144
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,323
Come on.

145
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,020
I don't know.

146
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,900
My favorite thing.

147
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,120
Cargo.

148
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah,

149
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,770
the cargo look up cargo called does.

150
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,630
I explained what it is.

151
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,530
Okay.

152
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,530
So Papua New Guinea was a staging point
for the American army during World War

153
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,630
II and they cut these impossible,

154
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,260
uh,

155
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,120
runways into the jungle.

156
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,470
Right.

157
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,980
And,

158
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,760
but the people who were living
there were like Bronze Age people.

159
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,420
And so they saw these
planes come out and then,

160
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,130
and then,

161
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,380
you know,

162
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,930
they would give them
like spam and whatever.

163
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,883
Like stuff,

164
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:24,790
you know,

165
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,623
parachutes.

166
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,760
And so then they left at the end of the
war and they started a whole religion on

167
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,211
the plane.

168
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,630
So they built these planes and they come
in and they mimic the landing and they

169
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,890
mimic the people coming out.

170
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,800
And they still have the
American uniforms and the,

171
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:38,970
the,

172
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,810
the tribesmen with like
a bone through his nose.

173
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,370
And if you like one dread,

174
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,490
we'll come out with like Chi,

175
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:43,840
you know,

176
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,310
captain fucking Joe Adams,

177
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,144
you know,

178
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:46,930
and then they'll,

179
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,980
they'll bring like the law,

180
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,843
the empty cans,

181
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,320
cans of spam and shit.

182
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,460
And they have these like planes made out
of flowers that they pretend to launch

183
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:54,761
and stuff.

184
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,594
And you're like,

185
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,980
this is the craziest fucking,

186
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,040
just really watching
religion did they made,

187
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,930
they made the religion
because of the planes,

188
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,220
you know,

189
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
the beef 52 coming with supplies and the
whole religion is like the plane is the

190
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:13,840
vessel of God and the Captain Joe
Abrams who comes out is that he's God.

191
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:16,660
And then this right Giorgio sucralose,

192
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,880
which spike his hair up
and come in here and say,

193
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,940
is it possible that the reason why these
things exist that we learned them from

194
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,524
aliens?

195
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:30,911
Yeah,

196
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:31,940
I mean it makes sense if,

197
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,520
if you live to stone age life and a
plane landed and gave you some spam,

198
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,210
100%,

199
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,460
it would become folk lore.

200
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,070
And it's gotta be so strange if I
think they are they illiterate culture?

201
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,590
So no,

202
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,720
I mean yeah,

203
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,100
the cargo called they do,

204
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:51,840
they do the whole religious thing through
the reenacting that when the planes

205
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:52,674
first landed.

206
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,120
But actually there's a thing now they
are kind of littered now because these

207
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,710
people in New Guinea
who are fighting Exxon,

208
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,760
there's a lot of oil there.

209
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,340
Exxon is trying to turn to um,

210
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,640
exploit the oil and these uh,

211
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,480
tear they,

212
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,840
well,

213
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,231
whatever,

214
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,570
everyone's going to get oil though.

215
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,530
Cause if there's fucking
oils and was going to get it,

216
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,390
but they have this trial,

217
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,510
but they have this tribe
now that's dressing as,

218
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,433
um,

219
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,780
you know,

220
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,620
the gods,

221
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,160
the car,

222
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
the cargo co,

223
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,240
and they're attacking Exxon dressed
as American servicemen from 1942.

224
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,550
I think the whole theme of this
is from American 1942 today.

225
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,500
But like,

226
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,750
it's,

227
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,220
it's cool because they make big,

228
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,540
huge white helmets.

229
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,703
And then,

230
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,573
uh,

231
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,260
if you Google God,

232
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:46,041
that's Google,

233
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:46,520
uh,

234
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,140
Papua New Guinea versus Exxon.

235
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,940
And you'll see the crazy outfits.

236
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,123
John's very,

237
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,890
he doesn't know as Bell Papau New Guinea.

238
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,920
He barely knows how spells is new.

239
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,900
It's pretty fucking interesting
that there's a whole,

240
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,920
it's a huge country.

241
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,970
Patenting is massive.

242
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,910
And there's a whole like
how big Texas sized?

243
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,250
Oh,

244
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,570
much,

245
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,680
much bigger than Texas.

246
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,250
Really?

247
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,150
And you have a big,

248
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:10,130
big country where like,

249
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,460
uh,

250
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,460
like huge pockets of it
worship cargo from 1944.

251
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,480
Oh my God,

252
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,060
I changed up 42 to 44.

253
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:19,641
Is there,

254
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,150
um,

255
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,690
is there a big city like where you
can go and get Wifi in a Starbucks?

256
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,553
Yeah.

257
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,460
Um,

258
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,293
does that too.

259
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,133
There's that too.

260
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,820
It's just like a cheesecake factory there.

261
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,230
Popular might be,

262
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,750
you can go get a Starbucks.

263
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,650
Can I get a Starbucks?

264
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:34,520
If I went to New Guinea,

265
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,960
you can probably get some
sort of pizza hut product.

266
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,063
Wow.

267
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,703
Okay.

268
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,760
Oh Shit.

269
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,240
Itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

270
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:12,810
Server.
