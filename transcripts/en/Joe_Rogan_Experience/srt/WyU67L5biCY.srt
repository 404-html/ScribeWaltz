1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,640
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,211
Oh you know,

3
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:02,530
they've,

4
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,910
they've done some really interesting
studies work cause you know,

5
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,590
they just over the last
10 or 15 years ago,

6
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:07,970
we see inside the brain,

7
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,420
I for the first time ever,

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,820
they again these Fmr I and where
do you see inside the brain?

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,980
And they found people who've been
identified as say this and they show them

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,390
pictures of people being hurt
intentionally and they're
like happy joy centers

11
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:22,170
light up their little like bring dancers.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,470
That's all messed up.

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,251
You know,

14
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,690
cause it's like opposite planet,

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,560
you know,

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,010
all things.

17
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,120
We've got this thing from religion,

18
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,710
like everyone has a soul
and we're all kind of equal,

19
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,530
all made in the image of God
and this and that and the other.

20
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,850
But it's according to this,

21
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,620
people I've talked to in
the research that I've done,

22
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,130
I mean there's some real predators among
us who really are not kind of like us

23
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:40,964
at all.

24
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,720
And it's somebody who likes cs,

25
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,031
you know,

26
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:48,350
some being driven over and he giggles
and finds that really quite thrilling.

27
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,610
I mean that,

28
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,090
I don't even know what
species they have it.

29
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,900
And I think they're alive and you're going
out there that they make like kind of

30
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,860
difficult for the rest of us.

31
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,091
It's a real issue.

32
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:56,960
It's very scary.

33
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,120
And how are these people becoming that?

34
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,770
Is it because of nature or nurture?

35
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,820
Is it because of,

36
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,130
you know,

37
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,590
abusive,

38
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,390
they've personally suffered
and that sort of stimulating?

39
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,520
Yeah.

40
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,740
Well,

41
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,040
so I mean this is the fascinating
thing about epigenetics,

42
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:10,221
right?

43
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:10,881
So I mean,

44
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,790
when I was a kid growing up,

45
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,100
but there was this nature versus nurture.

46
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:14,230
Like you got your genes,

47
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,021
that's what you're born with,

48
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:15,231
right?

49
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,970
And then maybe you can
influence it a bit with nature.

50
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,690
But what they're finding out now is
that genes turn on and off depending on

51
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:21,440
experience.

52
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,610
So they found like if you
have a particular gene and
you're a boy and you are

53
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:27,050
physically abused as a child,

54
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,441
almost for certain,

55
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,274
that you're going to end up,

56
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:29,811
you know,

57
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,890
on the bad side of things,

58
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,960
like you're gonna end up violent,

59
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,590
aggressive criminal j or whatever.

60
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,190
Right?

61
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:34,341
Now,

62
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,111
if you don't have that gene,

63
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:35,620
you're abused,

64
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,590
you've likely heard,

65
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,424
but it's less.

66
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:37,880
Uh,

67
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,090
and so certain genes for aggression get
turned down and strengthened based upon

68
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:41,721
your experiences.

69
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,330
You can end up deck twins who grew up
in different households can end up with

70
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,250
different genetics based
on their environment.

71
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,740
So that's what so important about,

72
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:48,921
you know,

73
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:50,720
something I focus a lot
on is the parenting,

74
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:51,440
parenting parents.

75
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,650
It seems to be so many people are out
there and they're just so messed up.

76
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,221
Like you just,

77
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:57,890
you can't rewind and you can't
send them down a different path.

78
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,840
But if you kind of look
at the next generation,

79
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,674
the next generation,

80
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,670
what if we could have the percentage of
people spanking their children down from

81
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,451
90%.

82
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:05,871
I mean,

83
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:09,470
it seems so weird and the 21st century
that that's how parents are really

84
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,313
focused,

85
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,290
depending on where you counted.

86
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,280
80 to 90%.

87
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,270
It's less so in Europe,

88
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,230
like in Sweden,

89
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:17,720
I think it's been banned since like 1973.

90
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,680
And y'all know what a hell hole Sweden is.

91
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,963
They're doing fine.

92
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,220
But um,

93
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,431
yeah,

94
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:23,860
it's still 80 to 90% in,

95
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,500
uh,

96
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,333
well it's legal here.

97
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,770
It's legal in America from two to 12.

98
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,510
You can hit a child in Canada illegally,

99
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,490
just not of the face and
not with an implement.

100
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,863
Um,

101
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,430
so,

102
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,601
oh,

103
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,430
I care about is the opponent
in front of me and uh,

104
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,623
and that fight,

105
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,020
I don't,

106
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't do anything to,

107
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,260
to go out there and lose man,

108
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:41,831
fuck that.

109
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,620
And I go out there to go to war and,

110
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,730
and be the nastiest Munis
individual I can be.

111
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:51,100
And I view the fight as the most
important thing and everything else is,

112
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,700
if I was thinking about
the things surrounding the
fight and in and separating

113
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,920
that from the flight was more,

114
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,030
that would be more difficult for me
to navigate because that's also not

115
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,800
necessarily all within my control,

116
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,870
but the full kind of thing specifically,

117
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,531
oh,

118
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:08,771
you know,

119
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,950
you've got your media days and
this and what you should say,

120
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,410
you know,

121
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,070
what you're trying to do and maybe
getting this sponsor all these different

122
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,030
little things that have,

123
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,923
that are not,

124
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,400
that are not directly a controllable
by you or she can get in the way.

125
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,090
Right.

126
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,181
Oh,

127
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:22,841
of course it can,

128
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,980
but I separate the two.

129
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,060
I keep them completely,

130
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,230
entirely separate.

131
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,740
And at the end of the day I will throw
away everything that is not the fight.

132
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,780
The fight is what gets you what you want.

133
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,201
You know,

134
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,060
I always say over and over again,

135
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,163
if you,

136
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,340
if there is nobody left alive to
stop you from taking what you want,

137
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,240
then you,

138
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,780
you can have all the trophies
and trinkets and all that stuff.

139
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,770
Then everything is left.

140
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:45,820
It's the spoils of war.

141
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,210
So go out and win your war and
then deal with the rest later.

142
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,530
There's an article about it online.

143
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,000
It says,

144
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,290
Janice,

145
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,790
Stan's male soldiers are
having sex with other guys,

146
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,320
but don't call them homos.

147
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,510
Well there was also something where like,

148
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,553
ah,

149
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,380
they were like their soldiers.

150
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:04,080
They would have a young boy who
would have to service everybody,

151
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,270
check this and they had
to tell the soldiers,

152
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,620
don't get upset about that.

153
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,060
But yeah,

154
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,990
don't get involved.

155
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:10,980
That's their custom.

156
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,020
Whoa.

157
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,140
Well we know their customers
that the young girl that died,

158
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:18,000
she was sold away way to marriage.

159
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:18,840
She was eight years old.

160
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,490
She died after having sex with a guy.

161
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,070
Let's listen to this
Afghanistan's will the,

162
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,310
the article is in a query,

163
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,210
um,

164
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,120
free of an agenda except that gay one,

165
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,520
queerty.com queer like instead of Cordy
Queerty how Ha Alex every day when they

166
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,354
got that domain

167
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,281
as I love,

168
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,000
I love the title to a free of agenda.

169
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,341
Yeah,

170
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,010
go ahead.

171
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,840
Um,

172
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,610
and it's talking about a,

173
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,050
it says Afghanistan's mail.

174
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,370
Sir soldiers have a sex,

175
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,540
have sex with other guys,

176
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,850
but don't call them homos.

177
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,693
And it says,

178
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,631
it's really interesting.

179
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,090
It says America's gay soldiers have
unique struggle in their hands,

180
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,240
whether the hide or be
open about their sexuality.

181
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,370
But Afghanistan's gay soldiers have a
different battle despite regularly having

182
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:05,250
sex with other men and shunning women.

183
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,990
Many of these male soldiers
refused to identify as gay,

184
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,240
which can get in the way of say,

185
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,590
preventing STDs.

186
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,100
You need only watched the CNN clip below
where three gay American troops speak

187
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,850
of the need to repeal,

188
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:21,331
don't ask,

189
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:21,901
don't tell,

190
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,160
which has been repealed.

191
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:27,270
Now I believe to understand
the difficulties of being
gay in the US armed forces

192
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:27,391
here.

193
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:30,700
The oldest article is from man love.

194
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,060
Thursdays has its own
post on urban dictionary.

195
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,980
It's a the article,

196
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:36,480
it doesn't say where it's from here.

197
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,350
Unfortunately it doesn't say what year.

198
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,240
So it was before.

199
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:42,661
Don't ask,

200
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:43,980
don't tell was repelled.

201
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,690
So I don't,

202
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,110
hmm.

203
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,943
Repealed rather.

204
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,670
Um,

205
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,690
for these Afghan soldiers.

206
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:48,961
However,

207
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:51,660
having sex regularly with
other men is no big deal.

208
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,740
Just don't call them gay and unclassified
study from military research unit in

209
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:56,850
southern Afghanistan.

210
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,880
That's a funny statement.

211
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,230
An unclassified study from a military
research unit in southern Afghanistan

212
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,950
that's looking into gay sex details,

213
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,210
how homosexual behavior is
unusually common amongst men,

214
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,300
among men in the large ethnic
group known as Pash Dunes,

215
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,520
PA ash t you ends Pashtuns,

216
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,750
although they seem to be in
complete denial about it.

217
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,990
What's a new unclassified
study of past June meant,

218
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,411
oh,

219
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:27,890
that's,

220
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,701
that's what the new,

221
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,420
uh,

222
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,150
unclassified study
revealed these men admire.

223
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:37,151
Other men physically have
sexual relationships with
boys and shun women both

224
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:38,900
socially and sexually.

225
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:42,350
Yet they completely reject
the label of homosexual.

226
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,080
The research was conducted as part of a
longstanding effort to better understand

227
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,830
Afghan culture and improve western
interaction with the local people.

228
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,570
When you reach it like
that and you read that,

229
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,220
you're like,

230
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,420
people are dying over there.

231
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,231
You know,

232
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:57,481
and you,

233
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,630
you think like the idea that
they're going to try to change this.

234
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,351
You think about what they do,

235
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,041
where they marry off.

236
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,620
Eight year old girls
cut women's noses off.

237
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,360
They do this kind of shit.

238
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,240
Pretend they're not gay,

239
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:09,620
whether fucking each other and
be homophobic at the same time.

240
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,590
It's absolute madness.

241
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,050
It's reality your way right away.

242
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,730
It's like custom made reality.

243
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,081
This is what they do.

244
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,150
This is how they figured
out their way around it.

245
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,510
The pash Dune men interpret the Islamic
prohibition on homosexuality to mean

246
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:28,700
they cannot love another man,

247
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,750
but it doesn't mean they can't
use men for sexual gratification.

248
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,040
What an interesting
little gray area there.

249
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,640
There's a little fine print right there.

250
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
You're a fucking human being.
