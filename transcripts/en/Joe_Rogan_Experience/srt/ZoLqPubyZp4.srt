1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,310
If you had the opportunity to go
and view any culture from the past,

2
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:12,060
like if you can be completely invisible
and walk around amongst the Romans or

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:16,470
cave people or native Americans
before the Europeans came,

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,573
what would you choose?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,091
Wow,

6
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:19,290
that's really hard question.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,243
Yeah.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,530
MMM.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,910
The first time where anything
was trying to be colonized,

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,490
like changed like the first time,

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:32,910
like a boat showed up in Polynesia or
something like that and some white people

12
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:33,390
got out,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:33,631
right?

14
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,830
We're used to being in the fields every
day and this guy hunts and this guy

15
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,030
watches after the boys
and teaches them and,

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,980
and then all of a sudden they come up
and they're building like you guys need

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,814
to,

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,750
why you live in,

19
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:51,751
he calls for Color Cox are the women are
staring at their fucking balls two feet

20
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:53,801
from the ground.

21
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,551
What are these things?

22
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:54,621
I,

23
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:54,951
they my,

24
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:59,590
what the fuck is going
on price please guys.

25
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,510
Got To fucking look at his hair.

26
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,520
It's chunked off his fucking Tito.

27
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,610
He's got bones in his fucking air price.

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,560
Can I get a Bible

29
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,183
lesson?

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,530
And there was this
thing called Noah's Ark.

31
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,131
Sit down.

32
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:15,761
He's fuckers.

33
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,690
Don't pay attention.

34
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,780
Get you fucking round them up.

35
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,810
Me and the boys,

36
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,610
we're going to need about
40 these fucking things.

37
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,560
Climb trees is your character's name.

38
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,230
I love the guy.

39
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,840
He needs to come back more often.

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,530
This is the kind of say,

41
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,120
Geez,

42
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,953
Joe,

43
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,880
they climb trees.
