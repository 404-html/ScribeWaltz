1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,443
Freak bitches of the faction that he 
needed to become prime minister was by 

2
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,300
guaranteeing them that he wouldn't move 
too fast on gay marriage.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,623
So it's a minority of a minority,
of concern of like culturally 

4
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:15,054
conservative conservatives who represent
rural districts with a bunch of farmers 

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,400
and the farmers,
you know,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,010
it's always God damn farmers.
I had a joke,

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,853
one of my old specials.
There's only two types of people that 

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,950
care about gay marriage.
People were really dumb,

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,620
or people that are secretly worry that 
dicks are delicious.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,750
I think that makes sense.
That's right.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,300
Fucking farmers.
Someone's got to get them to suck a dick

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,850
and you realize,
what's the,

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,860
all the Hoopla about what about just go 
ahead and suck it.

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,720
You probably wouldn't even like it.
And then you'd be like,

15
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,930
yeah,
this very guy.

16
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,070
I don't give a fuck.
What about the guy who was second oldest

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,120
whole sticks and um,
and a claw is that Seattle was,

18
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,210
he was dressed up in like leather and 
he'd go out in the farm in the middle of

19
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,170
the night and he'd like give.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,243
Whoa.
You're talking about the guy who got 

21
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,600
arrested several times,
talking about the guy with died.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,470
He died from getting.
His name was.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,330
They used to call him Mr.
Hands.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,100
I love that you know his name.
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,070
There was a documentary called zoo and 
uh,

26
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,023
it was all about zoophilia,
which is a real sexual attraction that 

27
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,860
people have to farm animals.
Always white people by the way.

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,270
[inaudible] hollow white people.
Yeah.

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,133
Actually,
I think the guy who got arrested was 

30
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:34,380
black,
I think just covered in leather,

31
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,180
black leather bro.
He's from Australia.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,793
It's also kind of adding insult to 
injury for the animal that you're 

33
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,370
actually wearing.
Leather.

34
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,204
You,
I'm wearing.

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,460
You're wearing your skin at the same 
time as I.

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,240
Fuck you.
He's not wearing a horse here though.

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,981
Maybe not.
Yeah,

38
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,360
it's different.
It's different species,

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,230
but I'm this guy who lived in enough 
claw.

40
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,950
They had found each other online on him 
and the horse,

41
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,843
him and all these people,
they developed this relationship online 

42
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,863
with these people that were really into 
horses and getting fucked by farm 

43
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,394
animals.
And so they invested in this property 

44
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,710
and they got this farm and they had 
these horses.

45
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:18,090
There was over 100 hours of footage of 
these people getting fucked by animals.

46
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,010
And one guy,
they type it.

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,540
No,
there's a video of it.

48
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,310
You could watch it.
You want.

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,400
See?
Absolutely.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,333
What else am I doing this afternoon?
And folks who are listening only I urge 

51
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:35,940
you to go to youtube just to watch the 
subtle twist of his head.

52
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,000
Absolutely mate.
I've been awakened Los Angeles.

53
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,820
I got a lot of time on my hands between 
meetings.

54
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,750
They'll be a.
do you want to win the lottery?

55
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,584
Absolutely.
Ban and famous enough claw horse sex 

56
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,110
faces.
New Charges in Tennessee.

57
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,220
Um,
oh,

58
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,560
it was a different guy.
What year is this?

59
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,160
Two thousand nine.
So after I'm.

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,920
That guy was dead.
It says,

61
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:56,550
okay.
Here it is.

62
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,300
A former Washington state man who was 
convicted of at an enum cloth farm where

63
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:05,560
a man was fatally injured while having 
sex with a horse in 2005.

64
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,560
Right.
Is accused of having sex with animals on

65
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,394
a Tennessee farm.
So one of the same people that was in 

66
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,990
that group,
they're going to grow out of it.

67
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
Of course,
the way you're hardwired is the way 

68
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,840
you're hardwired.
It's like,

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,763
I don't know about all that.
I would think the ones my friend got 

70
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,500
fucked to death.
I might want to reconsider it.

71
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,260
So yeah,
you would think that sensible,

72
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,094
but it's.
I mean the thing is like being gay or 

73
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:25,684
something,
I always get in trouble because when we 

74
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,030
talk about pedophilia and stuff like 
that,

75
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,120
I sort of make the same analogy,
which is I have.

76
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,263
I mean whilst it's the worst conceivable
thing that I can imagine anyone doing 

77
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,674
morally,
I have some sympathy for people who are 

78
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,344
hard wired in such a way that they get a
hard on from infants or animals or 

79
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,921
something.
Right?

80
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,754
I mean the reason I'm not a pedophile is
not because I'm morally superior is 

81
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,520
because I've never been attracted to a.
to anyone who's not post pubescent,

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,810
most likely you're right,
most likely you're right.

83
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,403
The real problem becomes in trying to 
decipher what is causing some person to 

84
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,004
have these feelings.
Like is it an instance of them being 

85
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,570
molested themselves and they were 
younger,

86
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,670
which is Mary.
It's disproportionately.

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,533
Yeah.
Is it the spectrum of a different ways 

88
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:15,661
that the mind functions is so complex 
and so confusing as to what's the origin

89
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
of these behavior patterns?
Is it because of abuse is because of a 

90
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,450
malfunction?
Is it a,

91
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,293
is there a tumor?
Like what the fuck is going on in 

92
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,024
someone's brain that leads them down 
these paths and I don't think that's 

93
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,990
been answered.
I know.

94
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,920
I mean what?
Look at the ticket back to be bestiality

95
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:34,960
and like having a,
giving a horse a blow job.

96
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,193
Like is there anything necessarily 
unethical about giving a host of blow 

97
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,460
job is the horse is pushing back?
I say no,

98
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,103
what if?

99
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,010
Yeah,
exactly.

100
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,920
So yeah,
if you offer up your butt to a horse and

101
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,530
he's.
And he's just digging in there.

102
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,490
He just shook his head.
I'm telling you though,

103
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,324
like what is morally,
what is actually morally wrong with 

104
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,720
fucking a horse?
If the horse is into it?

105
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,560
Well the horse fucks you.
First of all the horses is a top.

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,030
Um,
the,

107
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,220
the video of the guy getting fucked to 
death by the horse though is horrific of

108
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,054
course available.
How was he not able to get out of this 

109
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,160
situation?
But the horse out of pin.

110
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,810
Those are the video starts out.
A buddy of mine sent this to me.

111
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,970
This one I watched it 100 times,
Bro.

112
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,630
On my computer right now.
The screensaver.

113
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,150
It's sitting there.
I just copy it.

114
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:25,984
I put it on little flash drives leaving 
around my house just in case somebody 

115
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,620
decides to delete it off the Internet.

116
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,280
I'm the guy.
It's the video starts out and the guy is

117
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,060
naked and he's bent over bale of Hay and
then his friend,

118
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,103
I use air quotes,
grabs the horses penis and leads it up 

119
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,010
to his butt.
And you're like,

120
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:46,540
there is no fucking way.
And then what does that even happen?

121
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,610
How?
Like what kind of what?

122
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,370
No,
he's up on his laptop.

123
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,560
Ladies and gentlemen.
Here we go.

124
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,540
Don't be scared.
Homey.com.

125
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,790
What do you mean how,
I mean the guy,

126
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,570
just a giant.
But it's really that simple.

127
00:05:58,571 --> 00:05:58,901
Yeah.
Well,

128
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,734
no,
I mean I know that like you gotta like 

129
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,510
you gotTa Lube up a little bit 
beforehand,

130
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,970
you're going to make sure that you're 
available,

131
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,750
but that's a lot.
That's a lot of fingers.

132
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,430
You've got to put it in before the horse
can go.

133
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,780
Yeah,
there's a lot going on there.

134
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,860
It's not that simple.

135
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,350
Um,
it's again,

136
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,184
it's one of those things like,
what the fuck is it about a person's 

137
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:22,590
mind that allows that in there?
Yeah.

138
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,170
Why?
What,

139
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,003
and how do you get from A.
I think this would be an amazing thing 

140
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,420
to try to actually being there in the 
band.

141
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,130
I like straddled over the bale of Hay.
I don't know how you,

142
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,430
I'd be too.
I'd be too bashful.

143
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,900
Even if I wanted to do it,
I'll be too.

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,360
It's adorable.
I wouldn't have the guts,

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,050
I think,
uh,

146
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,870
I mean obviously I'm just thinking what 
the fuck do I know?

147
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,940
But don't pretend you never horse 
walker.

148
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,100
I think there's,
there's just,

149
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,353
look,
there's a reason why some people love 

150
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,304
jazz music and there's some people that 
love basketball and some people like 

151
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,524
sailing,
some people hate the water and some 

152
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,374
people want to sunbathe all day and some
people want to only go out at night and 

153
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:03,574
we're plucking people vary a lot and in 
this gigantic broad variance of human 

154
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:14,060
beings every now and then put one 
pressure cooker spits out a doodle.

155
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,590
Let's get fucked by horses.
What I mean,

156
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,670
yeah,
I totally take that,

157
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,910
but what I mean is I'm amazed at the,
at the people who can,

158
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,983
who can translate their latent mental 
desires into actual real world 

159
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,720
experiences,
whether that's climbing Mount Everest.

160
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,703
I mean,
there was all kinds of things I'd like 

161
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,904
to do.
Joe's eyes just getting real life as he 

162
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:32,860
looks at something on his laptop.
I'm trying to find Mr.

163
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,843
I found it,
Mr.

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,690
whether it's a.
I'd like to go scuba diving with sharks.

165
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,790
I'd like to go,
uh,

166
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,624
you know,
I'd like to go scuba diving under 

167
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,193
Antarctic ice,
but I haven't done it because I'm too 

168
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,110
much of a pussy and I'm too much of a 
pussy to get raped by a horse.

169
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,310
That's what I'm saying,
dude.

170
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,430
It's not my thing.
I don't get it.

171
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,560
Why it?
In the meantime,

172
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm going to plug my podcast,
which is a,

173
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,680
which people should go and check out 
weight.

174
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,570
The people alive.
We have paypal as well.

175
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:57,404
One word and you can find it on the.
We basically get three interesting 

176
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:03,560
people in a bar and we all talk about 
that.

177
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,300
What's going on in the world?
Jim Norton,

178
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,830
Artie Lange,
beautiful.

179
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,940
Looks like that.
Great.

180
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,490
Well,
New York's a good spot to do that.

181
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,870
A lot of opinionated people.
Yeah,

182
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:11,704
it's fantastic.
We did one here as well with Greg 

183
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,170
Fitzsimmons and uh,
Fred's dollar,

184
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,080
Anzac craiger funny people and Joe was 
on it as well.

185
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,900
If you want to check out episode 30 
episodes,

186
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,510
30 Joe Rogan bars that,
uh,

187
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,760
that particular one is pine box rock 
shop,

188
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,760
which is where we used to do it.
That was in,

189
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,613
it was great.
That place looks awesome and now we do 

190
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,630
it in Williamsburg.
Oh,

191
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:33,464
of course you do.
How dare quick do you have to roll up 

192
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,600
the.
The cops of your pants?

193
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,670
It wouldn't be a tide.
It'd be like a bow tie,

194
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,380
but yeah,
like done Sinatra style.

195
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm tucked or exactly around my neck and
he found the video.

196
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,660
I want to say something funny.
Here it is.

197
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,670
I don't.
Do I want to say this?

198
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm not gonna be able to undo this.
Am I going to able to unsee this?

199
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,040
Will make sure that he doesn't.
It doesn't get shown on screen.

200
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,910
Jamie,
starring Mr Han's.

201
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,430
So here's the gentlemen.
Okay.

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
There's a little dark.
It looks like a night vision type thing 

203
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:07,080
because the guys lifting the at the 
front legs are on his shoulders.

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,360
No,
no.

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,070
The horse's front legs are on the Hay 
and see the horses Dick.

206
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:13,220
And it's,
hey,

207
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,730
look at this seeing this dare he cued up
and the guy's having a hard time getting

208
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,070
it right.
And how about that?

209
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,890
And it goes all the way and is that one 
lives in test on the phone,

210
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,830
son?
Yeah.

211
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,860
He died.
What sounds?

212
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,470
Do you hear the sound?
Yes.

213
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,980
And now the Dick comes out and it's got 
liquid all over it,

214
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,520
which is probably like,
oh,

215
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,230
is that what it was?
Yeah.

216
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,920
I can't look anymore.

217
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,420
What if I go to jail for having that?
Like it's totally illegal.

218
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,623
I'm like,
I'm feeling I'm feeling a little 

219
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,560
violated.
Should a guy died that way.

220
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:56,670
I just saw him in dying from a Dick 
Eighty minutes ago.

221
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,504
I pulled into the car park here on a 
beautiful California day and if you'd 

222
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,514
told me then that in 80 minutes time I 
would have just watched a man die from 

223
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,360
being anal.
He raped by a horse.

224
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,040
How about the sound he makes?
I wouldn't have believed you when I hear

225
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,841
the sound again.
No,

226
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,300
I don't want to hear the sound again.
Joe.

227
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,560
A sound pleasant conversation is 
pleasant.

228
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,110
What about health and happiness?
We should be happy.

229
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,253
Would you be happy?
We figured out a way to not have this 

230
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,600
happen to us.
Yeah.

231
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,670
Yeah.
It's pretty easy to.

232
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:24,504
Not have that happen to you there.
There are so many things that have to 

233
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,480
happen in order for that to happen.

234
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,943
Okay?

235
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,790
Hear that.
That's the moment in which,

236
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,570
uh,
which,

237
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,403
uh,
horses penis goes through his intestine 

238
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,870
and into his head.
That's called.

239
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,860
That's a wrap.
That's a wrap for this life.

240
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,140
Folks.
Take care of.

241
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,360
We're seeing the next dimension,
Gilis fucking way to die.

242
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,680
The Darwin awards.
There's one who may be awesome.

243
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,723
Maybe it's better than being in a 
nursing home and having some guy kick 

244
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,274
you.
Isn't there anything in between that 

245
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,630
allows my only two options?
Either they get to Beta nursing home and

246
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,503
somebody kicked me.
I get to get mainly raped to death by a 

247
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,060
horse.
That's it.

248
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,110
Gender options,
but I mean,

249
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:11,944
listen,
my point of view is that this guy in 

250
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:14,794
getting fucked to death by a horse 
created this video and this video has 

251
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:18,964
provided me with hundreds of hours of 
entertainment that I would have never 

252
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:25,510
gotten without.
This guy dies of als has only one minute

253
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:25,810
long.

254
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,900
If you have 100 times.
I've watched it so many times,

255
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,763
I'm exaggerating,
but think about all the people 

256
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:35,980
throughout the world who will now Google
Mr Han's find that video.

257
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm sure it's up there somewhere.
[inaudible] laugh their fucking ass off.

258
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,670
Like that guy probably gave all those 
people a burst of happiness like through

259
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:43,504
his death.
Like you think about like what you've 

260
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:46,114
done in life and what having those 
experiences and showing them to other 

261
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,850
people,
what impact it has on them.

262
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,580
How many people have watched people do 
those?

263
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,370
Those bird suits.
The squirrel suits.

264
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,253
They jump off buildings and shit and 
they fly around and you watch me get a 

265
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:00,430
thrill out of it.
Like,

266
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,870
whoa.
You watch those videos.

267
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:02,890
You get a thrill out of that,
right?

268
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,260
You watch a guy bungee jumping and get a
thrill.

269
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,170
Yeah.
Watch this and millions of people.

270
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,370
Sure.
I think.

271
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,970
I think it.
Does that make you happy?

272
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,120
The same way that the birdman videos 
make you happy?

273
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,733
Yes.
There's a difference here at dude dies 

274
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,310
getting anal.
He raped by a horse.

275
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,110
Bird guys die all the time.
Yeah.

276
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:23,980
I wouldn't want to say one way that 
trees and shit motherfuckers.

277
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,450
See,
that's what I'm talking about.

278
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:27,160
This is a humble board on the edge of 
the road,

279
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:32,161
on the edge of the top of us guys.
These guys are spinning around on one of

280
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,000
these.
First of all,

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,920
you're counting on these Chinese lithium
ion batteries.

282
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,800
They were put together by slaves.
Who knows if they're going to burst into

283
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,480
flames.
This guy's doing handstands.

284
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,320
He's doing fucking handstands on top of 
a skyscraper.

285
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,920
Cool.
What does that Dubai.

286
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,540
Where is he?
It looks like to fly.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,720
No,
he's perfect example,

288
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,600
if you saw that,
like that gives you a thrill,

289
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,703
but if one of those guys did that and 
then when flying off the building like 

290
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,270
that,
I wouldn't like what if Mr.

291
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,203
Hands.
That was a video where he lived because 

292
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,690
he got fucked to death.
A gang.

293
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,890
I mean get fucked a gang at times where 
you get fucked to death.

294
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,300
I'd be.
I'd be happier.

295
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,110
I'd be happier if he lived,
but then I wouldn't know.

296
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,103
I also wouldn't be happy about that.
I'm just enjoying the entire Mr Han's 

297
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:13,750
experience.
Joe Rogan.

298
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,584
But what if you met him and then he was
