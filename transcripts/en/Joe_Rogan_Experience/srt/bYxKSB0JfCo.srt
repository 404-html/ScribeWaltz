1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,970
And the one thing that I noticed,

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:04,320
and I've said it before is like,

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,800
and I feel like other people have noticed
this it cause I've gotten a lot of

5
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:08,730
fights when I was young,

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:10,080
but I don't think I ever won one.

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,240
And I feel like I must exude this kind
of waft of something that like I just am

8
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,320
not a fighter,

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,680
but every time I've gotten in a fight
it's been more that someone has,

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,120
I feel like it's taking,

11
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,480
trying to take advantage of me or has
been picking on me for a long period of

12
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:24,661
time.

13
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,240
And it's the only way that this is
going to stop or have been or have been

14
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,310
picking on someone that I cared about.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,743
And,

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
and I always got the sense afterwards
that the person who beat me up basically a

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,751
new what?

18
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:36,931
New?

19
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,280
That they're like they,

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,710
I can draw Davidson into a fight and I'll,

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,080
and,

22
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,560
and he'll,

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,650
he'll only go in,

24
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,830
he'll go into the bear trap and then
I'll just be able to beat him up.

25
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,620
And the only good thing about
it ultimately is that they,

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,630
the picking on stuff stopped,

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,381
you know what I mean?

28
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,980
But I had to take a beating in
order to sort of affect that,

29
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,963
you know?

30
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,021
Yeah.

31
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,021
That's a weird psychological sort of a
relationship between the bully and the

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,770
person who gets picked on.

33
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah.

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,821
Yeah.

35
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,720
But I feel like,

36
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,020
and I feel like the real true fighters
wouldn't even do something like that.

37
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:10,854
They would recognize,

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,640
you know,

39
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,710
this guy or I'm not going
to bother with this guy.

40
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:14,930
I mean the I am mother.

41
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,451
Yeah.

42
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:15,751
I mean,

43
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:16,000
May,

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,231
may,

45
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:16,741
I don't know.

46
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:17,011
Maybe,

47
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,830
maybe there are some fighters who liked
to beat the shit out of people or you

48
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,071
sit,

49
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,610
yeah,

50
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,031
yeah.

51
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,271
You've,

52
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:22,550
I'm even noticing fight.

53
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Sometimes I feel like that guy
looks like he probably might have,

54
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,960
would be happy to be beating
up someone with far less skill.

55
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,150
He'd be taking as much
delight in it as he is.

56
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,710
Usually they've been abused.

57
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,580
Is that so,

58
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,330
yeah.

59
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,580
I believe that's a big part of,

60
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:35,811
uh,

61
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:36,900
a lot of what,

62
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,720
what constitutes a
bully is physical abuse.

63
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,650
You know that they've been abused either
at home or they've been abused by other

64
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,260
kids and they're trying to
lash out and get theirs.

65
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:51,000
Now they've sort of taken on the role of
the bully because they've been bullied

66
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,451
so much.

67
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,470
That happens a lot.

68
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,401
I could see that.

69
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,234
I actually,

70
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,380
here's the,

71
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,910
here's the sort of a story of my,

72
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,390
one of my,

73
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,620
my worst beatings.

74
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,041
Uh,

75
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,910
I was at the YMC,

76
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,570
hey,

77
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,310
me and my brother were playing basketball.

78
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,990
That was probably like I 16,

79
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,381
17,

80
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:06,420
eight towns might in my last
year of high school probably.

81
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,170
And uh,

82
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,130
these two guys come and say,

83
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,580
let's,

84
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,480
let's play two on two.

85
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,021
So we did,

86
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,270
and back then I probably
weighed like two 40.

87
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,810
I was,

88
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,850
I was a big fat dude.

89
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,361
You know,

90
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,200
I just see it.

91
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,070
40 in high school.

92
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,530
Yeah.

93
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:17,890
Yeah.

94
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,131
Maybe,

95
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,490
maybe,

96
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:18,930
maybe,

97
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,741
maybe two 30.

98
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,360
Like I was enormous,

99
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,350
but it was not a,

100
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,490
it was not a healthy weight.

101
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,720
Obviously that's what you weigh now.

102
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,530
One 75 one that,

103
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,030
that's partly the whole boxing stuff.

104
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:31,860
And we do tree planting
a lot up in Canada.

105
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,570
That's sort of like what
you do at university.

106
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,350
You just go up to the woods
and plant trees and that.

107
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,170
I shed a lot of weight that way,

108
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,530
uh,

109
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:37,891
during,

110
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,730
during university,

111
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,420
but,

112
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,530
so I was a big beast,

113
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,771
you know,

114
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,210
when I started,

115
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,730
knew how to use my body and the guy that
I was playing against was maybe one,

116
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
one 60.

117
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,450
Um,

118
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,910
so we're getting close to beat them.

119
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,770
And I turned around and I see the ball,

120
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,270
it's a whipping right at my face.

121
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,780
He'd thrown it at me and I turned my head
and it sort of goes by the side of my

122
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,410
head and just,

123
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,243
you know,

124
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,840
gives me a scalp burn basically.

125
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,770
And then he's,

126
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,890
then he's charging right at me,

127
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,240
like to get no fight.

128
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,290
Um,

129
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,040
and there was no pro prior provocation.

130
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,891
None at all.

131
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,491
That's the thing.

132
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:06,761
I mean,

133
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,440
this guy just to basketball,

134
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,150
just a basketball game and,

135
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,984
and,

136
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,291
and,

137
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:11,501
okay.

138
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:12,071
It's in the why.

139
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,521
So I'm like,

140
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:12,761
okay,

141
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,530
well we're not going to have a fight
right in the middle of the why.

142
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,790
I think I'm going to be okay.

143
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,320
That's,

144
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,691
I mean,

145
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,860
I didn't really want to get into a fight,

146
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:18,221
but again,

147
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,210
this guy throwing a basketball,

148
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,260
I mean it's pretty shitty move.

149
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,461
So anyways,

150
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:22,300
this guy comes out,

151
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,620
he's gotta be like 80 years old.

152
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,880
He's like one of those guys at the y
that was like a retired gym teacher and

153
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:28,511
they sort of said,

154
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:29,620
okay bill,

155
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,400
um,

156
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
you can just start hang out
around here and keep order.

157
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,090
That's the be nice of you to do that.

158
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,240
So he comes out and he's got a whistle
around like an old p whistle around his

159
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:37,810
neck.

160
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,643
He says,

161
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,730
take it outside.

162
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,230
I'm like,

163
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,010
I don't,

164
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,140
the last thing I want to
do is take this outside,

165
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,240
but,

166
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,640
and,

167
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:45,941
and,

168
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,660
and he says,

169
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,500
that's it guys.

170
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,580
You take this outside.

171
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:48,910
So I'm like,

172
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,390
oh sh I'm sort of like being shoe horned
into going out to having a fight with

173
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,224
this guy.

174
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,720
So I'm going down the
hallway and my brother is,

175
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,640
it's like out of a raw,

176
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:56,891
he should,

177
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,890
he's massaging my shoulders cause I
guess he thinks that's what he should be

178
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,310
doing.

179
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,551
You know,

180
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,660
that's how it's a little,

181
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,860
we know about fighting.

182
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:03,551
You know what I mean?

183
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:03,760
He's,

184
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,301
my brother was like,

185
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:04,421
well,

186
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,710
I guess I've seen this in rocky.

187
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,544
I should keep him,

188
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,560
keep him limber and you know,

189
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,001
he's like,

190
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:09,250
oh,

191
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:09,541
you're,

192
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,510
you're going to be fine.

193
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:10,961
And if I,

194
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,370
but I had a chance to look in his eyes,

195
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:12,761
he'd be like,

196
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,210
you are,

197
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,690
you are,

198
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,523
you are fucked.

199
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,071
You know what I mean?

200
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,420
And I think I knew that too.

201
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,010
So I ended up outside,

202
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,120
it's winter in Canada and uh,

203
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,640
there's ice on the,

204
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,150
on the,

205
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,490
on the sidewalk and you know,

206
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:24,820
I,

207
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,180
I face up and what I assume is somewhat
somewhat of a fighting posture.

208
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,040
And he kicks me in the head.

209
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,280
It's a first thing he does just
like kicks me right in the head.

210
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,380
And I'm not even sure
what that will happen.

211
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,460
I'm still standing,

212
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,000
you know,

213
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,440
and they need does it again.

214
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,490
And then I'm like,

215
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,001
Oh God,

216
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,780
this is not,

217
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,650
this is not good.

218
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,090
So he had martial arts training.

219
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,691
Auslan.

220
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:43,991
Yeah,

221
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,824
definitely.

222
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,431
And then,

223
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:45,641
you know,

224
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:47,680
there was a bike rack and
I remember he like rang my,

225
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,990
my head off of it and I'd get them in a,

226
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,830
you know,

227
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,970
sort of a headlock.

228
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:52,804
And,

229
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,673
uh,

230
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,010
and I remember being like face down and
there's like ice melts on the street,

231
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,161
you know,

232
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,110
that those blue crystals they put down,

233
00:04:59,111 --> 00:04:59,411
you know,

234
00:04:59,411 --> 00:04:59,711
and I'm,

235
00:04:59,711 --> 00:04:59,921
I'm,

236
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,280
my face is pressed into it and
thankfully it goes on for awhile.

237
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:03,941
Clearly I'm,

238
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm beat.

239
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,201
And he's like,

240
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:05,680
are you,

241
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,951
are we,

242
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,761
are we had enough here?

243
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,450
I'm like,

244
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,810
yeah,

245
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,081
I mean,

246
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:08,230
I've,

247
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,861
I've had enough,

248
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,430
that's enough.

249
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,530
So he goes back inside
chuckling with his buddy.

250
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,400
Um,

251
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,870
I'm sitting out there
on the street bleeding.

252
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,700
I don't even want to go back into the why,

253
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,271
you know what I mean?

254
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,560
I'm going to have the people inside going,

255
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,520
what the hell happened?

256
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,211
Do you need help?

257
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:19,630
And I'm like,

258
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,400
I just want to crawl into a hole and,

259
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,450
you know,

260
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,580
not see humanity for about a month.

261
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,103
Uh,

262
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,250
saw my brother goes inside,

263
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,860
gets my clothes,

264
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,693
we go,

265
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,190
I find out later this guy,

266
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,950
we lacrosse is a big sport in our,

267
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,813
in our country.

268
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,230
And he was like the enforcer
on the Lacrosse Lacrosse team,

269
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:39,670
like the triple a Lacrosse team.

270
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,040
So he was a tough guy.

271
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,510
Like I didn't have a chance,

272
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,411
you know,

273
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,280
right from the get go.

274
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,240
I didn't have a chance.

275
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,583
And then,

276
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,250
you know,

277
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,530
I discover his name cause
we lived in a small town.

278
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,101
And you sort of,

279
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,360
these things sort of come to you.

280
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,661
Uh,

281
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,820
as time goes by and then,

282
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,030
um,

283
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,900
my buddy calls me up,

284
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,980
but a couple of years later he says,

285
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,950
you hear about so and so?

286
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,310
I said,

287
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,820
no,

288
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,170
I was away at university at this point.

289
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:00,740
He's like,

290
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,070
they went camping in the
woods and hit him and his dad.

291
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,870
And this word gets back
to your idea of abuse.

292
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,690
He stabbed his dad 44 times,

293
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,243
killed him,

294
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,080
killed him in the woods,

295
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,340
and they caught him just walking down
the street with the knife in his hand.

296
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,791
And,

297
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,330
uh,

298
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,691
and you know,

299
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:18,620
later on the interview,

300
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,000
his mom and his mom was like,

301
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,451
yeah,

302
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,284
he was,

303
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,363
uh,

304
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,701
you know,

305
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,640
he basically would sit out on the porch
saying that George Bush was going to

306
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,310
come in air force one anytime,

307
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
pick them up for some top secret missions.

308
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:29,840
So we clearly had some,

309
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,130
some mental instabilities that didn't
present themselves at the age at which at

310
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,480
least they were maybe emerging,

311
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,020
but later use them.

312
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,540
I mean,

313
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,760
that part had never been been into,

314
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,031
I'm not,

315
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,590
I can't really comment on that,

316
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,490
but I mean,

317
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,680
I,

318
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,370
I don't know,

319
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,280
but I think I feel like he
stabbed the man 44 times.

320
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
It would have to be a
really heated argument.

321
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,350
And if they had no prior sort
of history with one another,

322
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,011
I don't,

323
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,731
I don't really know.

324
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,510
But first of all that he stabbed him
and then he stabbed him that many times.

325
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,290
Holy Shit.

326
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,801
Yeah.

327
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,920
And I sort of thought later,

328
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:02,871
man,

329
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,860
as bad as I got it,

330
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,761
I mean,

331
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,410
I could've gotten a lot worse.

332
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,131
You know what I mean?

333
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:07,880
At least he like,

334
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,110
let me off at the end.

335
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,501
He's like,

336
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:09,990
all right,

337
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,231
well,

338
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,500
I always try to explain that someone
who gives people the finger and a car,

339
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,270
like you never know who
you're giving the finger to.

340
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,891
Exactly.

341
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,190
My,

342
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,990
my wife has a bad habit
of honking the horn.

343
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,833
I'm like,

344
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,351
baby,

345
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:19,741
I love you,

346
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:20,510
but don't,

347
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,080
don't do it.

348
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,751
Don't do it.

349
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,360
Don't you don't know who the hell is
stepping out of that freaking car.

350
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:24,730
You know?

351
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,261
Not only that,

352
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,840
you never know what state they're in.

353
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,610
They can be in the worst state of mind
ever at the moment you lay on that horn,

354
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:34,560
you could have caught them
at the breaking point.

355
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:34,920
Yeah,

356
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,740
and that's what puts them
picked fucking people.

357
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:41,700
Especially in this day and age when
you're dealing with cities and traffic and

358
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:46,701
the unnatural stress of slamming 200
fucking million people together like this.

359
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:47,780
Yeah.

360
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,410
Very nice.

361
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:48,900
You're like,

362
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,591
Oh shit,

363
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:49,921
I'm,

364
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,750
I'm up against a different
breed of humanity,

365
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,270
right guys kicking me in the
head and nowhere and you know,

366
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:57,390
you're just trying to play basketball and
your brother's rubbing your shoulders.

367
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:58,051
Neither want to be know.

368
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:58,881
What the fuck are you doing?

369
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:59,070
Oh,

370
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,420
we're totally neo fights and,

371
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:00,960
and you know,

372
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,681
and there was something,

373
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:01,921
you know,

374
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,410
this is probably way too like writerly,

375
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,350
but there is something about
the eyes of a guy like that,

376
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:08,010
that you're just like,

377
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,670
oh,

378
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,270
I'm,

379
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,511
you know,

380
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:09,931
you know,

381
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:11,760
you're done before you're done.

382
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,520
You're done before one
thirds of those dudes.

383
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,090
Yeah.

384
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,750
There's just something
clock working around it.

385
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,633
Their eyes,

386
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,180
and you're just like,

387
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,931
oh no,

388
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,201
no,

389
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:19,471
no,

390
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:19,980
I'm not,

391
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,360
I'm not built to this standard.

392
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,130
This is not going to
work out too well for me.

393
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,370
Okay.
