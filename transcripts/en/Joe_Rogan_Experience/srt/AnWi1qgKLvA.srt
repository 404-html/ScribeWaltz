1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,520
Yeah,

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,860
I know somebody to talk to a
cop and they said that when,

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:09,040
how they started working
and then 11 years later,

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,670
oh yeah.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,670
Going into those areas where these things
always happened and after years and

7
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,054
years,

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,720
it just,

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,340
it just wears on you for sure.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,420
And I know from the air,

11
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:21,760
it's just me drawing up in situations,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,833
you know what I mean?

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,980
I wouldn't want to go back.

14
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,270
I barely go back there,

15
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,200
you know,

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,740
so,

17
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,210
but it do give you nerves.

18
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,420
Your nerves heighten.

19
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:31,330
It naturally kicks in 100%,

20
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,900
you know,

21
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,531
and like,

22
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,040
yeah.

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,780
And some people can't handle those nerves.

24
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,420
You learn how to breathe quietly.

25
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:37,841
You don't know.

26
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,674
Like somebody,

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,970
you could walk down the street and
somebody could pull a pistol out on those

28
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:44,350
things though.

29
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,860
I've been driving down the street when
my ex lady and she was talking and I was

30
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,011
like,

31
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:52,360
get down because I saw God draw on a
corner and shoot across the street at

32
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:53,050
another guy.

33
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,231
Oh,

34
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,090
Jane has the gun went up.

35
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,790
We drove under the,

36
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,920
the the the fire,

37
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:00,440
right?

38
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:00,521
Oh,

39
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:01,150
it was long.

40
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,870
It was long.

41
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,703
Oh my God.

42
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:03,843
And as it went up,

43
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,923
we went under,

44
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,441
oh no,

45
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,200
we got a second shot off
and I drove and I was like,

46
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:08,501
man,

47
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,161
that was crazy.

48
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,280
Like I'm that guy like late,

49
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,521
like,

50
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:11,720
you know,

51
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,730
we made that was crazy.

52
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,500
And she was like you and call the police
in her life of what is he like to tell

53
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:16,991
what happened?

54
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:17,824
And that was like,

55
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,860
I don't want to be,

56
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,860
and that's how crazy is that way you
don't even want to be involved because you

57
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:26,440
gotta go to the cops and I
ain't up calling the police.

58
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,813
And um,

59
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,501
he's like,

60
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,500
he described the victim.

61
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,000
I was like white tee shirt,

62
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:31,834
blue jeans,

63
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,280
that's all I say it.

64
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,001
And that it was like,

65
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:34,834
was he black?

66
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,710
And it was just a law.

67
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,553
Paul's,

68
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,910
there's a long pause and they like,

69
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:40,290
sir,

70
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,123
is he black?

71
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,453
And I was like,

72
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:42,941
no,

73
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,870
you know that nick was black.

74
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:49,821
You know,

75
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:54,410
if you can help somebody out and they
can get rid of it or change the way you

76
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:54,720
think.

77
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:54,870
I,

78
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,011
he,

79
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:59,030
Joe Schilling Mani did Simon [inaudible]
relationship with his dad was miles

80
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,260
better before he passed away.

81
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,820
It wasn't that pretty powerful.

82
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,081
Yeah.

83
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,760
Joe talked about it on the podcast.

84
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,770
He talked about it just,

85
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,920
it's completely changed
his whole perception of his
relationship with his dad,

86
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,160
who his dad was in his life
and just he let it all go.

87
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,590
Yeah.

88
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,020
And that just helped him tremendously.

89
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,850
Yeah.

90
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,670
What more can you say
the na really as a coach,

91
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:17,911
I mean,

92
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:18,870
Ian Mccall had said,

93
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,660
you know,

94
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,680
I know they didn't get his fight with
Justin Scoggins and that because of the

95
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,000
weight,

96
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,670
whatever her name was saying that his
life has changed since two inside mine

97
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,930
therapy and doing the,

98
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,261
you know,

99
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:28,951
work with me,

100
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,280
not just timeline therapy and not just
hypnosis with my coach and in general,

101
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,170
cause it's multifaceted really.

102
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,190
And um,

103
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,390
he said he's lives changed.

104
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:36,660
He,

105
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,800
he's a different person.

106
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,890
People have no [inaudible].

107
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,271
We know.

108
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,104
So that's,

109
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,430
for me it's great news.

110
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,380
I think sometimes it just
takes the realization of
what's been fucking with you.

111
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,110
That once you realize what it is,

112
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:50,900
then you have it in your mind and then
you can kind of look at it for what it

113
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,321
really is.

114
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:55,400
Instead of this like thing that's playing
in the background that you can't quite

115
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:59,950
identify or you or you know what
exists but you ignore and you just,

116
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,070
you

117
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,460
don't,

118
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,510
you don't ever get over it.

119
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,380
Yeah.

120
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,860
He says he's interested in I to a
client the other week called joy.

121
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:10,861
She's 80 years of age and she was going
to a wedding in Spain for our grandson

122
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,910
and she was beside herself.

123
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,260
She was terrified,

124
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,751
you know,

125
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:15,131
and we did it.

126
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,360
Just a few things,

127
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:16,840
you know,

128
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,290
little things to make you
consider different ways of
looking at the anxiety she

129
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,450
was getting because
anxiety is basically a,

130
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,210
you should have your unconscious mind
is to focus on what you want because if

131
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,290
you're in an anxious state,

132
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
you're focusing on what you don't want,

133
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,240
right.

134
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,110
There's different levels of it.

135
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,770
Of course.

136
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:29,981
Wait,

137
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,350
she was focusing on what may go wrong,

138
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,350
instead of saying all this will go
into a wedding is a celebration of two

139
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,760
People's matrimony,

140
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,211
whatever,

141
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,650
and it's going to be nice and Dah,

142
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:38,771
Dah,

143
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:38,861
Dah,

144
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:38,981
Dah.

145
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,880
She wasn't focused on that.

146
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,750
She was focused on something else.

147
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,680
I changed that and like she was happy
and she went to the wedding and it's,

148
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,451
you know,

149
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:46,771
he's got,

150
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:46,931
I mean,

151
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,830
she's 80 years of age.

152
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,200
He might not be going
to Lowe's or weddings,

153
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,960
let's be honest.

154
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,470
Right.

155
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,303
But if for me,

156
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,660
the job itself,

157
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,550
what can you say about nice?

158
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,100
He's,

159
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,590
it transforms people,

160
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,331
you know,

161
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:58,790
and I adore it.

162
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,020
Mark Spitz.

163
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:00,830
That's right.

164
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,670
I don't remember that guy.

165
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,130
He was a 76 Olympics I think.

166
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,993
Is that right?

167
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,111
It has to be it.

168
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:07,670
He looks like Burt
Reynolds from deliverance.

169
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:07,990
What?

170
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,170
72 72.

171
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,041
Yeah,

172
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,251
man.

173
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:10,611
That's right.

174
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:11,480
I forgot about that guy.

175
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:11,781
Okay.

176
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:14,030
So he was the first of the,

177
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:14,864
um,

178
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,900
the superstar Michael Phelps type
swimmer dudes I think before,

179
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,923
um,

180
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,510
I want to say before Phelps came
along and I really don't know,

181
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,440
but I think that spits was the guy who
won the most gold medals up until that

182
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
moment and then Phelps just
fucking blew him out of the water.

183
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,303
Where is he now?

184
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,900
Um,

185
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,830
if I had to guess,

186
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:34,191
by the way,

187
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,950
it looks in an Burt
Reynolds movie in the 1970s.

188
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,101
Yeah,

189
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,934
I'm looking at him.

190
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,840
I hope that guy still rocks that look,

191
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,350
I wonder if being in water
more than a more average,

192
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,420
the average person is
better or worse for your,

193
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,260
your skin.

194
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,040
For every probably worse because
chlorine is not good for you.

195
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,570
It's not good for Ya.

196
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,570
Chlorine kills everything
that's in the water,

197
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,560
but it also fucks with the
floor of your own skin.

198
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,870
Like it's,

199
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,670
it's not the best stuff in
the world for your skin.

200
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean,

201
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,380
it's sterile water.

202
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,341
What about saltwater?

203
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,390
That's probably better for you.

204
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,811
Yeah.

205
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:10,370
Let's say salt water's better for ya.

206
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,150
Yeah.

207
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,740
So water is interesting man,

208
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,840
because I can't get it in my eyes.

209
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,400
I know some people can
get it in their eyes.

210
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,270
They don't have a problem with it.

211
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,931
I get it in my eyes,

212
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:18,980
it fucking stings.

213
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,510
I don't know why.

214
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,740
Like when I go to,

215
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,340
uh,

216
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,821
the,

217
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,031
uh,

218
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,630
the beach,

219
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,650
if I get water in my eyes,

220
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,690
it fucking stinks.

221
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,200
Oh,

222
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
is that add to your sodium levels?

223
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,291
He's not.

224
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:28,611
It's mark.

225
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,770
Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap.

226
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:32,240
When you're saying in
your eyes were stinging.

227
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,990
He doesn't have goggles
on either price on it.

228
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,551
Yeah,

229
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,140
but I'm talking about a pool.

230
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,720
He swam in a pool and the
ocean is where my eyes sting.

231
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:39,554
Huh?

232
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,401
But uh,

233
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:40,760
yeah,

234
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,810
Mark Spitz was,

235
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,920
the old school is,

236
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:43,520
fuck,

237
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,020
he probably swam in a flannel shirt.

238
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,110
Those are looking at his body.

239
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,220
They're going to shore.

240
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,590
He sorts of probably made
from like red dye number nine.

241
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,340
They didn't do any strength
and conditioning back
there stops showing me just

242
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,031
men in their underwear.

243
00:05:59,031 --> 00:05:59,630
Jamie,

244
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,463
stop it.

245
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,480
The iconic speedo indoors.

246
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,531
So this,

247
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:03,830
uh,

248
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,450
go to full body on this gentlemen.

249
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,910
Look at his fucking body.

250
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,510
Man.

251
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,930
I'd like,

252
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,321
you mean,

253
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,730
I guess he kind of looks like an athlete
or he looks like a your girlfriend's

254
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:15,320
brother that's staying with her over the,

255
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:15,561
you know,

256
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,670
you get up in the morning,

257
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,660
you meet him for the first time.

258
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:17,751
Well,

259
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,584
how you doing man?

260
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,311
Nice to meet you.

261
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,144
Oh Hey man.

262
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,631
Hey,

263
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,560
y'all got soap?

264
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,610
Like that's what he looks like.

265
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,280
He's like some,

266
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,480
some weird fucking dude might've worked
out a couple of times in his underwear.

267
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:29,781
Like,

268
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,800
why are you just in your,

269
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,431
in your underwear?

270
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,550
Like that dude with gold
chains around your neck.

271
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,410
This is a fucking strange picture.

272
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,020
It doesn't really look to
swim swimmer body either.

273
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,320
Like the difference between that body
and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer

274
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:44,831
nowadays,

275
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:46,180
it's like pretty different.

276
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:46,881
Like his legs,

277
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,160
he actually seemed Kinda Chubby.

278
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:48,581
They're like,

279
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,414
uh,

280
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't know.

281
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,480
They don't really seem
muscularity kind of seems sexy.

282
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,400
Well,

283
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,880
um,

284
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,271
what,

285
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:54,840
um,

286
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,141
you got,

287
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:56,370
you beat a guy like Robbie Lawler.

288
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:59,730
You knock 'em out and in one round you've
got to think the momentum coming off

289
00:06:59,731 --> 00:06:59,911
of that.

290
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:00,870
It's gotta be stunning.

291
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,300
I would love to see fantasy UFC like a
show where they take maybe the fighters

292
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,540
that have retired or people that aren't
as good as the other fires and have him

293
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,430
like almost do like game
show stuff like this.

294
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,900
Like you have to do a game go.

295
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:13,111
All right,

296
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:13,681
so this fight,

297
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:14,670
you have your shoes tied,

298
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,530
you have to hold a
banana and not crush it.

299
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:17,610
You have to protect this banana,

300
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:18,450
like it's a baby,

301
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,260
you know,

302
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,670
like fun things like that.

303
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,270
Yeah.

304
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,841
You know what I mean?

305
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,320
Like where you saying,

306
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,970
cause I think even as I think as
a fight it would still be fun.

307
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,481
Just the hat,

308
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,530
throwing the other options.

309
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,640
Like almost like a video game,

310
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,911
you know,

311
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,000
where go the doctor,

312
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,360
I've told you many times
something wrong screen.
