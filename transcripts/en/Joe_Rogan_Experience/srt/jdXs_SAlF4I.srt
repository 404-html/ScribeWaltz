1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,200
Not only as a mortal technique here,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,410
but his broad a motherfucker so
cool that he's wearing a fanny pack.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,100
Bobby Bang, Bang. Independent of my
love for the fanny pack. This dude was,

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,590
she's out there all completely on his own,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,660
on the Nache with true love for
the fanny pack. Much respect.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,830
Not only am I bring it back to fanny pack,
I just started selling them.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,230
So I sell a higher primate.com fanny pack.
It's a quality roots fanny pack,

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,560
just dice clay was in and he
had the dopest fanny pack,

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,290
this sweet leather fanny pack.
And it was so nice.

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,980
City bank was something wrong.
It was me by roots.

11
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:43,560
You know that company that makes bags,
it's like a dope fanny pack.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,820
And I was like,
what'd you get done?

13
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,520
When I was jealous cause all my other
ones were functional but discuss thing.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,910
But this was like, it was
actually fashionable. I was like,

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,650
I can bring it back with roots.

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,910
So I contacted roots and had them print
up the higher primate logo on a fanny

17
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,180
pack. So boom. Not just t shirts,

18
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:04,740
but now fanny packs a motherfucker's
branching out. See, there it is.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,230
It's hard to see the logo,
but then some monkey with like

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,920
go, whoever coined the term fanny
packs are we fucking see. To me,

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,390
if it had been like survival pack, every
dude would have when like, oh dude,

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,250
I got my new survival pack. My, it's
not a man purse. It's a survival pack.

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,720
No Dude, it's a fanny pack. I don't
mind saying I'll put it on. Lie Down.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,560
It's true strength that you're not
worried about the definitions of others.

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,630
Really word. These guys who have given
you a hard time during this rocket.

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,950
Rocket strong. No, not me. It was my
there. I would rock that one bucket.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,130
Bucket strong. I like
that. Survive survival pat.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,450
It's all in the market though.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Yeah, it's, it's a cock
shield. Keeping myself in them.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,310
If an asteroid comes from the sky,

31
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:50,230
it'll hit my fanny pack
before it hits my deck.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,470
Hopefully it'll deflect,
deflect it.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,400
Listen if something's falling out of the

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,140
fanny pack and save your pack and
your leg and then two days today,

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,740
cell phones are very
durable, my friend. Correct.

36
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,780
I think you're out of line.

37
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,720
You've done those studies.
Yeah.

38
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,050
There's some fucking people that have
survived actually rocks falling from the

39
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,560
sky and hit it. I'm strange enough
a lady got hit in the arm recently.

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,070
It was like a, it went through her
house and like hit her arm. All right,

41
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,210
thank you. Can get great. Okay. Come
on. I mean she didn't catch a dome shot,

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,300
you know, that would have been some
whole other shit, you know? Yeah.

43
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:35,900
Well most likely you're going to die if
you get hit by some folks with Scott,

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,290
Donnie Darko, jet falling
out of the sky. Yeah. Engine.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,350
Most likely. If something falls
from the sky, you're fucked.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,970
But if it doesn't and it hits
your higher primate fanny pack,

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,510
you might survive, son. You
might get to that shit alive.

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,610
Better survival packs. Survival pack.
Indeed. Indeed. So if I have a pack,

49
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,980
just sounds too phony
though. Nah, you got to

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,510
put the survival pack and then you got
to put like the Joe Rogan Cock Shield

51
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,380
edition with like just like the metal
plate. I think it should just be implied.

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,190
A metal plate on the top of the cameo,

53
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,360
son c s I don't think I should sell it
should have a hole in it so you can see

54
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,960
play with your Dick. Ain't good parties.
So like diner, like the movie diner.

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,840
Remember when he got that girl Mickey
Rourke got that girl to touch his dick by

56
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,420
putting it through the popcorn. Oh,
that's an old school trick, right?

57
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,770
That might've been invented. And that
movie though, I'm not sure. Probably not.

58
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,820
When you think about all the perverts
in the world, that Shit's probably old.

59
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,070
Really old. She's um, anyway,

60
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:45,690

primate also. Yeah, it's both now.

Just a guest that you need the name.

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,090
Name of the actual bouquets.

104
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,230
No heat in my heart was
so obvious is a key.

105
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,400
There's beautiful flowers.
That's the key to the the woman's heart.

106
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,020
That's the actual name.
Yo,

107
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:36,310
you are amazing fan already,
but now I'm amazed.

108
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,300
That's not a freestyle.
It's total freestyle.

109
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,940
That was a luck. That's what I
mean here. It was total luck.

110
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,200
I had no idea what that was. The name
of it. That was total luck. Look,

111
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,960
it's got a key. It's a bouquet.
I mean what the fuck else is?

112
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,640
It's like that's what
it's going to be called.

113
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,950
The trick guys into thinking that you
were a penthouse pet of the month.

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,280
Listen man, this ain't hard. It's key.
You only you would know about that.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,790
Most guys, we're not know the Penthouse
peds carry keys are on their next.

116
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,890
Anyway,

117
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,090
our other sponsor is legal zoom.com which
Brian will most likely one day need.

118
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,560
Again, legalzoom.com not going to get
you that at any of that kind of trouble,

119
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:14,070
but what it can do is deal with any legal
bullshit that you would normally have

120
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:17,550
to go to a lawyer for and wait in line
to pay a lot of money, deal with it,

121
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:18,121
much cheaper,

122
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:22,080
much easier and with way less hassle
things like starting a business or

123
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:26,250
incorporating forming an LLC. You
could do that. It just 99 bucks,

124
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,330
you can get a last will for 69 bucks
a living trust, power of attorney,

125
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,530
all that kind of shit.

126
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,700
Legal Zoom can get all that done
for you and if you freak out,

127
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:38,070
if you're in the middle of it and
you're like, fuck, this is not,

128
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,150
this is not legal.

129
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,900
Legal Zoom will connect you to a
third party independent attorney.

130
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,190
So if you do panic,

131
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,730
that will connect you with attorney
that's not connected to them so well

132
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,910
connected in the fact that they connect
you. You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

133
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,890
Someone objective.

134
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,970
Is the call center here in like
America or is it like somewhere in like

135
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:00,480
Indonesia? Like a tide attorney? Listen,

136
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,330
I wasn't,
I would assume that good

137
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,543
your area,

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,640
if you live in Indonesia you're going
to get a fucking Indonesian attorney.

139
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,170
I can just imagine the call center being
like Mongolia or some shit like no.

140
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,760
According to our tribal law,

141
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,230
like the two of you have to meet
and fight with like a Yak ball.

142
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,820
I don't think so.
I think it has to be American.

143
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,870
And now for a special discount

Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

146
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,110
but they can connect you with a third
party attorney and provide you with self

147
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:39,020
help services. This is what Brian
used to incorporate a desk squad.

148
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,610
It's what Arbor use for on it.
Uh,

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,230
legal zoom is a way that you can get a
lot of really important legal shit done

150
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,540
without actually having to go to a
lawyer. What's funny about that? No,

151
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,221
I'm just looking at this.

152
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:52,840
Divorce is chicks like I am so ready
to get some more dick. Oh yeah,

153
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,130
that's exactly what she's
saying. Perfect picture. Cause

154
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,060
she's a catch. If you just thought, well
just, you know, if you were like, so uh,

155
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:04,230
what's your situation? Well just getting
divorced right now unfortunately.

156
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,820
I mean fortunately

157
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,270
I'll be nice to you too.
Let's kiss junk.

158
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,270
We got fucked up and
look what he left behind.

159
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,800
Someone's gotta be tuned 99 no,
no, no, no, no. Nothing wrong.

160
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,100
Maybe she's in a wheelchair.
No, no. I mean beautiful woman.

161
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,950
Maybe she's in a wheelchair.
Maybe somebody didn't fucker correctly.

162
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,440
How about that 99 come on man.

163
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,930
This is a lot of dudes out there that
don't fuck their girlfriend correctly.

164
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,000
It's true. Shit goes wrong. You
forget. You start, start getting lazy.

165
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,790
Just going for the titty grab and then
right into sticking it in and then I

166
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,780
totally see you going to
handle your business. Somebody
else will. Well you know,

167
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,770
maybe it's just the guy that showers
and then she talks to at the gym and you

168
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:50,400
know, he's, he's just friendly. He
didn't even try to get my phone number.

169
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,250
I'd see him at the gym.
It's just friendly.

170
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,680
It was like finally a guy
that doesn't have an agenda.

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,910
Next name, change. One 39
that's coming next, sweetie.

172
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,530
Changing names. There's too much weird
shit on the Internet about your real name.

173
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,190
Hooker. It's time to change. Change.

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,950
Switch up your Google search results.

175
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,130
legalzoom.com use the code word rogue
and save yourself some money. Green Card.

176
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,520
Get a green card.
You can get a green card.

177
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,500
They can get a green card for 595 dog.
They can shut up. Had a hot chick.

178
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,070
That's well, they, they're not saying
that you're going to get a green card.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,350
That's one thing that's real important.

180
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,750
If you're actually going through
the paperwork already. Yeah.

181
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,280
Maybe legal zoom can help you out,

182
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:40,281
but if you just knock under a fucking
fence from Mexico and you're like,

183
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,330
well,
why does it go scrape together 500

184
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,020
that's the only place to sneak
under a fence. Come on, man.

185
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,740
You doesn't mean he's gotta be
Mexican. You can't sneak. You're right.

186
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,790
It could be Afghany.

187
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,250
I've been catching a lot of
people that are not Mexican.

188
00:10:56,251 --> 00:11:00,060
Cross it to the Mexican border, Bro.
I'm sure. I would imagine so. They think

189
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,740
I've been watching the news. Lakey,
I last sponsor [inaudible] dot com

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,420
and n I t since Aubrey Marcus
was on the podcast yesterday.

191
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:12,020
We talked a lot about on it. I'll give
you an abbreviated podcast sponsor.

192
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,260
This is human optin.

193
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,810
Is that when you'd say
[inaudible] sometimes that
you're supposed to say n a n

194
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,310
and it seems like you'd say,
ah,

195
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,020
but really it's supposed to be an like I,
I forget.

196
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:27,680
There's a few examples of that where
it's the correct grammar is actually Ann

197
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:31,970
and I and I sometimes pretend them smart
and try to use it the right way and I

198
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:35,570
fuck it up.
I'm on it.com o n n I t,

199
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,340

immune system on it.com o.
N N.

203
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,500
I t used the Codeword Rogan save
10% off any and all. All right.

204
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,980
And mortal technique is here.
It's get cracking

205
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,050
Joe Rogan podcast.
He's back.

206
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:09,710
Ladies and gentlemen with the
new posse mortal technique.

207
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,010
The only guy this is posted on
the message board, uh, yesterday.

208
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,580
This is the only guy that brought a posse
to the podcast and they didn't suck.

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,990
Oh thank you. Cause usually when
you get posses you get like,

210
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,590
like you'll have like one cool dude
and his friends who are annoying,

211
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,740
you know that shit happens. We're also
just him, me, all my peoples holding down.

212
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,980
All right. This is my brother, Chino
XL Chino, my man. And that is my,

213
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,310
with Bobby Bowden. It was
throbbing. It was just his birthday.

214
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:42,290
So he's still recovering. Tom. It's
hard being on the road with these two

215
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm sure especially cause
Bobby rocks a fanny pack

216
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,930
soldier and Barbara,
you'd be surprised what fanny,

217
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,570
how many wonders the fanny
pack does for me. Hey man,

218
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,710
it's great at the airport clip. Drop it
in that bag, pick it up at the other side.

219
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,240
Boom. Done. Survival
pack, survival. Surviving.

220
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,600
What am I going to survive? What do
you, what do you got another 50 years.

221
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,140
Come on man, you ain't survive and
shit. No one survived and shit.

222
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,100
Maybe the getting bypass.
Maybe the I exists now pat.

223
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,400
It really should be called a groupie
pack cause you could just flip it around

224
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,980
and keep all your personal
items and never leaves your,

225
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,500
oh you're a criminal yourself
relating me or anybody else.

226
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,250
Just him.
I don't know what you meant by that.

227
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,810
That just slide all the men in the room.

228
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,350
You said you confuse you the
fuck out of here with that.

229
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,770
You got a little cocky on there.
That's what happened there son.

230
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,410
You forgot where you were. It's a survival
plan as part of the survival pack.

231
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,000
The works survival. That's like
a Douchey word though, right?

232
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:45,870
Like survival.

233
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,730
Like you know like survival survivor
man is cool but like survival training,

234
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,340
we're going through survival training.
Like I'll come on man,

235
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,220
what are you doing and
you'll find the people are,

236
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,560
is there are people who really do
that type of like my friend told me,

237
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,060
uh, there was some ex military dude that
he liked trains executives on like this

238
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,120
survival like vacation weekend.

239
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,630
And it's basically like for people that
want to feel like they did something

240
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:10,320
important.

241
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,830
So He'd take them out to like this like
area in the countryside and they run a

242
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:17,130
bunch of obstacles and they get
them in shape for like, you know,

243
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:18,870
week or two and then bust their ass.

244
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,880
And then they call it
like survival training.

245
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,520
But that's obviously not
like real survival training.

246
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:27,120
So by that I guess he had jumped out of
like a parachute out of a fucking plane

247
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,080
into like a wilderness area and then
meet someone at a certain place like two

248
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:35,110
weeks later. Like all right, go
to like Lz one like you know,

249
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,130
15 miles away through like wolf dens and
mountain ranges forest and who the fuck

250
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,950
else knows? You know, you just
can't take the four oh five there.

251
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,850
You got to walk on the fucker.
That's the train.

252
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,630
They can be a real show that where they
took a guy and just dropped him off

253
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,600
hunger games style in the
middle of the woods. I'm,

254
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm Kinda surprised they
haven't done that yet.

255
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,640
That'd be kind of very interesting.
They sorted, they like can survivor,

256
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:06,260
they do go and they have to like get
food and they, they do shit like that.

257
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:10,520
But it's very different than like taking
one person and like telling them that

258
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,690
they have to make it across a forest
and get to another side. You know,

259
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,570
I'd never really watched that show too
often are where their lives ever really

260
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,610
endanger.
That's the point.

261
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,000
It's always an Dorrance really more than
survival because you know that there's

262
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,834
a way out.

263
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,290
Let's take somebody who didn't even
know this was going to happen at all and

264
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,710
dropped them there. Yeah. Well
those people that are on that show,

265
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,090
you know like when you like you see that
everybody gets by okay and everybody's

266
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:38,750
okay and the, you know, like they're
not in danger because it's television.

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,010
They're,
they're in danger.

268
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,520
If you're in Borneo or one of those
places where they filmed survivor man,

269
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,360
survivor rather, you're in danger,
you're fucking for sure in danger.

270
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,470
There's a lot of shit out there.

271
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,210
Like just because he's a
bunch of cameras out there,

272
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:53,390
it doesn't mean they're going to keep
you safe. Like when we did fear factor,

273
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,980
there was a lot of times we just got
lucky with like, nobody got hurt,

274
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:01,550
but it's just because we got lucky like a
rattlesnake, which, you know, like bowls.

275
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,760
They made people ride bowls. All
right. That's just ridiculous. Dude.

276
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:09,000
They had a 90 pound girl. I say they, I'm
distancing myself from the shot. No, no.

277
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,250
I said like,
he wasn't in that,

278
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:14,330
like I wasn't even the tone at the top
of the book. If it was happening today,

279
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,950
I swear to God,
I would tell them not to do it.

280
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,200
I would tell the girl not to do it 100%.

281
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,280
Like there was a guy that was like a
crazy daredevil dude. I would have said,

282
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,480
you know, hey man, people have done it.
I Know Donaldson, Ronny [inaudible],

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,850
Ronny rides bulls, the crazy
fuck. But for most people,

284
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,390
it's a hair raising proposition
for this little 98 pound girl.

285
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,870
There's no way she's going to be able
to hang on. And these guys who were the,

286
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,360
the stunt guys were like,
don't worry about it. These
are stunt bowls. They're, uh,

287
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,840
they're, they're less aggressive.
There's stunt bolts. Yeah, but this,

288
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm like the bold isn't
though. It's a fucking stud
ball to the bull. He's a bull.

289
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,930
There's no stunt bowls in the bowl world.
They don't have like a, well, you know,

290
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm just thought, you know what man,
I'm not going to tell you as something,

291
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,500
you know what I mean?
That's my brother over there,

292
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,710
away about the amount of dudes.
You know what? I'm just gonna.

293
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm showing you his boss and then
I'm going to stomp on your head.

294
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,900
Now they'll stop on your fucking head.
They'll kick you in the face.

295
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,970
We just got lucky. So like survivor
man, that guys, that's real shit.

296
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,190
Like there's nothing fake about that show.

297
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:14,030
But that's when that dude exists
by himself and, and you know,

298
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,850
he'll get to like a certain location
and I'll pick them up like in five days.

299
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,610
He even doesn't 10 days sometimes,

300
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,690
but that's the guy that carries his own
camera, right? Yes. That is 100% legit.

301
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,640
He's in danger.
He's in danger every show.

302
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,370
I think I seen him super dehydrated
at one time. It was really,

303
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:33,050
really bad if that mother fucker was
in Lyon territory, the survivor man,

304
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,060
survivor man or the survivor,
the show survivor on man.

305
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,030
I was making the comparison between the
two of them. Like that survivor show,

306
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,650
there's still in danger.
You're, you're still in danger.

307
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:47,360
You're doing a bunch of dangerous shit.
You're doing wild aggressive shit. But no,

308
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,340
no, you know, no more danger than if
anybody would be, if you were camping,

309
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
you know, camping, you're
doing dangerous shit different.

310
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,280
If it was like survivor Basra,
like survivor,

311
00:17:56,281 --> 00:18:00,910
Mogadishu matter. I
mean survivor man, Shit.

312
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:05,911
Like that dude went to Africa and he
slept a night in Africa in this area where

313
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,500
we're lions live with a hot air
balloon. And he's, his idea was,

314
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,920
the idea for the show was if you were in
a hot air balloon and it ran out of gas

315
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:17,940
and it fell somewhere like wa or the
balloon got punctured or some shit and it

316
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,060
fell somewhere and you were trapped,
how would you get by?

317
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,871
How would you get out of it?

318
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:25,980
So this guy went to fucking Africa and
that was all he had for shelter was the

319
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,750
basket that this fucking,

320
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,550
this suppose that hot air balloon
had and then the flame thrower to,

321
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,590
to make the balloon inflate and go up.
You know,

322
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:38,340
they hit that the fire comes up and the
heat is what makes the balloon rise and

323
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:40,810
they drop it off when they
want it to fall. Well he uh,

324
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,660
had that as well and he was using that
to keep the lions away low and fire at

325
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:49,020
them because when he would set it up on
the ground, it was like a flame thrower.

326
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,170
Right. Cause it's when, when
it's underneath the, the
balloon, it's, you know,

327
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:56,250
it's blowing this fire up
into the inflated balloon.
But when it's on the ground,

328
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
he's just shooting it at the line.

329
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,810
It's just him and one can't it just
him and a camera and a camera and some

330
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,170
fucking lions. Did you hear in
the background you hear like,

331
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,850
yeah, that's good to know how
that show's going to end. Right?

332
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,790
It's just going to end with like a still
shot of like it was fucking camera on

333
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,610
the ground and people picking
out his NDA man. Well yeah,

334
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,650
I think what they do is they um,

335
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,390
they know where he is by GPS location
and I guess he probably has a satellite

336
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,940
phone. Like if everything went
terribly wrong and he had to call,

337
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,790
like if he breaks his leg or something
like that, he'll just die. I mean,

338
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,870
he has to get medical help so they'll,
they must have some sort of a plan,

339
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,380
but he still, his life is in
danger every step of the way. Oh,

340
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,200
I mean when you see people that
swim with sharks for example,

341
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,510
that's the part that I, I say, okay,

342
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,530
I did that with like baby sharks
and we'd like sand sharks.

343
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,150
They have something at
the mall of America.

344
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,200
I went back then with like my ex
girlfriend years and years and years ago.

345
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,400
It was cool. But when I see people
who swim with like 10 foot sharks,

346
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,280
12 foot in like the wild,
you know,

347
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,400
where the shark doesn't know
that you're a filmmaker.

348
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,660
It doesn't have any idea that this
is for discovery or anything else.

349
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,040
Right. And it's not a stunt
shark and they never will.

350
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,160
They don't understand anything with it.
All they know is what's in front of them.

351
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,090
Eat, eat, what's in front of him,
eat whatever we eat with them.

352
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,890
Used to eating well, they used to
eat. There's some people that have,

353
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,170
I don't know what it is,
I don't know what they're doing,

354
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:26,250
but they managed to not get killed.
I think if you get into the water,

355
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,300
the shark doesn't see you as prey as much
as it sees you if you're on the top of

356
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:31,020
the water.

357
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,470
I think the top of the water is a big
danger because people look like seals.

358
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,890
That's one.
One thing when you're down in the water,

359
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,590
I think you're more of a weird curiosity.

360
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:45,040
He looked like a swimming monkey water
and it, oh good. I get a snack. It's,

361
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,220
it's hard to figure out probably what
the fuck you are. You know? I think

362
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,720
the animals that are that stupid,

363
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,230
they just sort of get by doing the
same shit over and over and over again.

364
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,860
And for sharks, it's like, look for
seals. Boom, looked for seals, boom,

365
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,210
look for seals. Whoa, what the fuck is
this? Surfboard? It's tastes terrible.

366
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,700
You know, this tastes like Arby's. Get
this fucking Guy Adam, my marriage.

367
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,960
But if you like, look at
them, man, you look at their,

368
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,230
their black dead eyes and
you look at their, you know,

369
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,790
their body is just designed to just chew
or there's not a lot of thinking going

370
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,240
on. We had this conversation earlier
about what it means to be a hunter,

371
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,870
but wouldn't it be hunting really if
you were like in a rowboat with like a

372
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,990
Harpoon going after one of
them and not like, you know,

373
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:30,290
and like a giant vessel shooting at them
with a high powered rifle as they were

374
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,140
in a little boat.
You're going to die.

375
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,810
You're not going to beat a great
white shark, but all right. All right.

376
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:36,760
We're talking about,
you want to get extreme right now.

377
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't mean like any kind of shark,
the shark or that's big a tiger shark.

378
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,740
I guess maybe like a six footer.
If you're really good with a spear,

379
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,340
you gotta get like four or five and,
but if he flips you in the water man,

380
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,280
most likely you're fucked. I mean, I
just depends on what kind of boat you're,

381
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:55,360
if you're in their element,
that's a cheating thing
anyway. If you're in a boat,

382
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,490
you're cheating. If you have anything
out, if you have anything. Yeah,

383
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
actually cheated.
Everyone can act.

384
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:02,390
You like drop all those weapons
and just go flesh to flesh. Yeah.

385
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,670
You got no chance. Don't have teeth.
Like y'all Niggas do have hands.

386
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,083
That doesn't,

387
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,620
the shark skin note is when you feel
it. It, when you rub it one way,

388
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,160
it's like completely rough and we'll
cut your skin and then when you go from

389
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,700
back to front, it's completely,
absolutely silky smooth.

390
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,420
Yo when we were little kids, we had like
a dissection program. And the last, uh,

391
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,870
the last thing that we did was
like third grade or something,

392
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,710
but they cut open a shark and we had to
take his kids out like it's children.

393
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,350
And when you felt the shark,
they said watch.

394
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,300
And the science teacher rubbed his hand
nose to the back and his hand was cut

395
00:22:40,301 --> 00:22:40,840
open.

396
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,530
And he said that what the normal normal
sharks do is they just swim through a

397
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,890
school of fish. And since this skins
built like that, whatever they touch,

398
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:48,724
they cut.

399
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,360
And then on the second loop around they
can smell the blood or they can see one

400
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,280
of the fishes that they've
cut and go through it.

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,990
But if you touch the shark normal shot
from like, you know, back to front,

402
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,870
it's totally silky
smooth. Wow, that's weird.

403
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,340
Why would it be silky smooth that way?

404
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,390
That seems strange because
I think that thing,

405
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,230
it's just like a jagged sort of thing.

406
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,430
I have no idea if they can pull it
in and pull it out, you know? I mean,

407
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,950
there must be some mechanism.
All I know is that, hey man,

408
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
I don't want to get rubbed up on by them.
I don't want to pull,

409
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,360
I don't want them to pull anything in.
I'm pulling anything out on me.

410
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,080
Getting in the water with sharks,
playing civil, if you will.

411
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,970
There's a big issue now in Australia,
you know,

412
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,470
because they're calling the sharks.

413
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,020
They're killing a lot of great whites
because they've had so many people die

414
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,390
recently. They're just
like, enough is enough.

415
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:39,010
Too many people are
getting attacked by sharks.

416
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,600
Like we've got to kill some
of these fucking sharks,

417
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,860
and a lot of people think it's bad idea.
Those people are assholes.

418
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,010
Fucking

419
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,790
crazy. Assholes knows a lot of bad idea
or the sharks killing people. Yeah,

420
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,850
well you know what?
Is there a EH wrong?

421
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,690
Our planet suck it.

422
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,490
If there's a bunch of sharks out
there that are killing people,

423
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,580
it's time to start killing sharks,
period.

424
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,810
Anybody who wants to argue
is a fucking anti-American.

425
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,480
It's going on in Australia.
They support terrorism.

426
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:15,920
Is that what goes on, Joe Rizzo? A
shark. You're down with the enemy.

427
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,260
That's the ultimate,
not the NSA.

428
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,340
It's on our ultimate enemy or ultimate
enemy or fucking sharks. You know,

429
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:24,680
it's funny,
with all the shit that they listened to,

430
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm always surprised that we still
have old kidnapping serial killers.

431
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,780
You figured if they were
tapping everybody's phone,

432
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:35,450
they could find anybody that they want it.
Yeah,

433
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,020
they would look at everybody's
phone. I just killed my
seven Tucker. Lol. You know,

434
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:43,130
like look at this mother fucker just
texted his friend. Who knows, dude,

435
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,170
someone someone's going to slip up. Oh,
well there's most certainly have. I'm,

436
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm sure they've used it. I mean, if the,

437
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,260
if it's been around as long
as they say it's been around.

438
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,600
When you hear about the,
uh,

439
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:56,780
the actual coding of the NSA software
and how they first started doing it,

440
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,390
there was a guy there,
original NSA whistleblower.

441
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,270
I should pull this guy up and give
him his props because it's a pretty

442
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,790
fascinating story because he was a,

443
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,620
he was a whistle blower a long time ago
and he was the guy that was responsible

444
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:14,360
for making the software. And He, when
he, when he was making the software,

445
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,440
he was telling everybody like, hey, you
can't use this to just spy on everybody.

446
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,600
So he started doing all these interviews.
Um,

447
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,780
but it was before Edward
Snowden that so everybody,

448
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,890
everybody thinks of Edward Snowden as
the original, uh, NSA whistleblower.

449
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,810
But there was another guy before that.
There was another guy in 2002,

450
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,410
I believe. He came out
and, uh, yeah, here it is.

451
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,020
Bill Binney and,
uh,

452
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:43,310
this fucking guy told people
about this a long time ago.

453
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,960
There's a story of it on Youtube,
on, uh, the RT America channel.

454
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,860
That's Bill Binney, B,
I, N, n, e, y, and a,

455
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,960
he was a u s intelligence official.

456
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,170
And you worked for the NSA and he turned
into a whistle blower in a October

457
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,090
31st, 2001 after more than
30 years with the agency.

458
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,250
He was a high profile critic of his
former employers during the George W.

459
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,600
Bush administration and was subject
to an FBI investigations, of course,

460
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,010
including a raid on his home. Of
course, fucking thugs. Where's he at?

461
00:26:16,011 --> 00:26:19,570
Where's he doing time now? He's not,
he's not doing time. That's what's crazy.

462
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:22,310
Where is he?
Because he called this before they did it,

463
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,940
whereas Edward Snowden called
it while it was happening.

464
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,530
So Edward Snowden got in trouble.

465
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:31,490
This guy was predicting the future and
he was saying that when he found out that

466
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:36,440
they were able to spy on everyone
and that they were using this system,

467
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,600
uh, the, the system that was a, it was
initially called trailblazer and uh,

468
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,441
it was a,

469
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:46,290
a system intended to analyze data carried
on communications networks such as the

470
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:50,490
internet, including social networks. Yes.
And he found out that they were actually,

471
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,560
they were starting to do it on there.

472
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,080
They were just trying to do
with everybody and he called it,

473
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,680
he said that's their plan. Their plan is
to monitor every email, every phone call.

474
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:01,460
And he said, the guy, you know,
he said, look, this is unamerican.

475
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,380
And the guy stuck his neck out there.
He got away with it though.

476
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,000
It's really interesting because
he just predicted it and you know,

477
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,940
he wasn't actually talking about
something that had happened,

478
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,460
but he got out of the NSA and said,
this is going on.

479
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,380
You know what's crazy though?

480
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,800
So for the first couple of years,
I mean making music.

481
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,820
People used to call me a
conspiracy theorist and I
always used to laugh and I'd

482
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,040
be like, all right, well
let's play it down. Let's,

483
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,990
let's Encyclopedia Brown this bitch right
now and tell me what is my conspiracy

484
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,790
that the government spies on you?
I was right about that. You know,

485
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,070
I released a record talking about how
you know we're going to war for false

486
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,160
reasons, that this is a false
premise to be in war. Okay,

487
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:41,350
well we found out that no
weapons of mass destruction,

488
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,950
I never said that Bush was
directly responsible for
nine 11 I said that I never

489
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:47,770
believed that government's version
because they couldn't even tell the truth

490
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:51,590
about the air to breathe. I always felt
like the story was in complete what's,

491
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,640
what's the conspiracy theory?
That's absolutely fucking true.

492
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,080
Now we find out that there are layers
upon layers upon layers of what's going on

493
00:27:59,081 --> 00:27:59,920
in the world.
I said it,

494
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,360
the government itself was involved in
the drug trade in Peruvian cocaine.

495
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,350
So people said, oh my God, how can you
use this conspiracy theory? Really?

496
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,440
And now we find out that they
protect certain Mexican cartels,

497
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,670
it as long as they sell
out to other homeys.

498
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:19,090
The absolute truth of the drug game here
in America is they don't go after the

499
00:28:19,091 --> 00:28:21,310
little fish to get the big fish.
You know what I mean?

500
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:25,030
They want the big fish so he can rat
out all the little fish and they can all

501
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:29,380
spend time in the jail because only the
main dude has the $10 million attorney.

502
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,250
So I mean, I don't blame this guy for
just being fed up and saying, hey man,

503
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,280
this is exactly what's going on or
what's going to go on in the future.

504
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,300
I'm just surprised that somebody
hasn't found a way to give him cancer

505
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:44,770
assumption and kill him off in a way
that doesn't raise that much suspicion.

506
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,160
Like I said,
he did it so long ago,

507
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,190
right before it ever became a public
issue that he quit in 2001 and that's when

508
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,650
he started talking and doing
all these interviews. Um,

509
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,480
you know what it is in three nine 11, 2001
post nine 11. It's when he quit. Look,

510
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,160
the dude is essentially, I mean he's
a real patriot. That's what he is.

511
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,760
He's a guy who was working in the,
in the office of,

512
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,120
he's working for the defense of the
country in the right way. I mean,

513
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:14,370
that's what he's doing.
He's, he, he doesn't,

514
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,520
he wants there to be like laws.

515
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,200
He wants there to be protection of rights
as well though he wants us to be able

516
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,011
to go after terrorists,

517
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,580
but he doesn't think the government
should be able to just willy nilly looking

518
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,730
at everybody's fucking emails.
But the government shouldn't,

519
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,360
shouldn't become a terrorist
in the process of going
after terrorists. Exactly.

520
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,310
And you're torturing random people

521
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,390
full in order to do that. Then you are
becoming the terrorists themselves.

522
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,790
And then there's no distinction really,
because one is a,

523
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,130
is a hidden danger that
people are terrified of.

524
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,410
And the other one is
exactly the same thing.

525
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,940
A hidden danger that people are
terrified from someone in power. He says,

526
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,980
you know what? I don't like
this guy. I don't like Rogan.

527
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,250
You know he's talking about the ATF.
That's my business. You know what?

528
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,470
I want you guys to ruin his fucking life.
I want you to go after him. You know it.

529
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,850
Well, it's been proven that they
do that with the IRS, right?

530
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,590
They use the IRS to go after
political enemies. I mean there,

531
00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:09,770
there are a lot of fucking hedge rolled
because of that shit cause it got public.

532
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,630
Yet people have this, there's a lot
of no nonsense people out there.

533
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,830
That's the real issue.
There's a lot of people like harsh.

534
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,780
You believe in big foot, you believe
in conspiracy theories swollen.

535
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,940
What do you think the
government's out to get you?

536
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:27,590
There's a lot of these people that like
to pretend that it's foolish to think

537
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:30,080
that the government is involved
in anything shady ever.

538
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,990
And if they're always above ground,
they have too much power.

539
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,630
Whenever you get groups of
people that have that much power,

540
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,720
when you have essentially
the power to create laws,

541
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,870
the power to to go in to the the very
laws that were established in the

542
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:48,320
beginning of this nation and change them
so that you can get away with shit that

543
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:50,100
would ordinarily be illegal,
right?

544
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,020
Like all those things are only done
by people who have too much power.

545
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,210
They're not in,
they're never things that people vote on,

546
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,690
nobody of the people who never vote to
give themselves less rights and people

547
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,820
never vote to give more
trust in the government.

548
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,090
And the government's just sort of takes
it slowly but surely in the best way to

549
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,940
take it is to tell you there's a bunch
of enemies they have to protect you from.

550
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,880
It's a timeless age old trick.

551
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,090
And the idea that that's a conspiracy
theory is ignoring all of human history

552
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,350
from the jump,
everything ever done by people with guns,

553
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,640
swords or arrows, right? Everything
ever done was done with deception.

554
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,690
It was done by establishing enemies
and protecting you from those enemies.

555
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,210
They're they're timeless techniques and
the idea that the greatest government

556
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,140
conquer that.

557
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,160
We would stop doing that in 2014 that
after all they've learned after all these

558
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,360
years they go, you know what,
all that time tested shit.

559
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,590
We're going to set it aside and we're
going to be ethical. We're going to do,

560
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:46,490
we're going to be the ethical

561
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,510
because we're bomb was in office.
Now we're going to be ethical. I,

562
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,540
but there were people who believed in
his fairy tale and I did it. I wanted to,

563
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,430
I wanted,
I wanted to get in and go gotcha pitches.

564
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,780
I was fucking child of a single mom.
I was smoked weed is

565
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,560
there,

566
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,530
I remember in Harlem when he was
elected and it was like pandemonium.

567
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,210
I Shit you not that it,

568
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,720
it just so happened that they were moving
like a subway car. I'm pretty big deal.

569
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,400
People will usually want
to see him in the street.

570
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,050
But they were moving a subway car via
like a tractor trailer and they were

571
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:23,500
moving it through one 25th
from one side to another.

572
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,430
And they had a jumbo tron set up by
like the state building and he gave his

573
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:32,110
address and there were like hundred
thousand people in the street right there.

574
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,180
And they followed the procession
of the subway everywhere.

575
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,010
I saw an old lady get out of her car
and start dancing, you know what I mean?

576
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,740
And she was just like, look in she,
she must have been like 80 years old.

577
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,630
And I was like, Yo, my grandma, if you
see so happy, she's like, you know,

578
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,530
you got to understand,

579
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,210
I grew up in a time where people looked
at me like I wasn't a fucking human

580
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:58,010
being. And to see that, I mean,
look, I always discuss the, these,

581
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,290
these variations of oppression because
people try to liken what happens to

582
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,710
Africans and native to native Americans
to other struggles and other people

583
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,440
being oppressed. But you know what, you,

584
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,680
you can't you no one ever tried to,

585
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,023
for example,

586
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,740
kill somebody else from another
group because they knew how to read.

587
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,783
You know what I mean?

588
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,790
Like these things were specifically done
to a people to try and take away from

589
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,460
the legitimacy that they have to
dehumanize because that's the only way to

590
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:30,710
really do something that
negative to someone.

591
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,180
You have to find some sort of different
way to define them as a person so that

592
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,110
then you can justify it, not just to
yourself but to other groups of people.

593
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,760
You know, normal people
won't be like, Hey man,

594
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:44,150
I'm just going to kill this person and
take their land and their gold and their

595
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,300
oil or whatever it is. But
now it's like, oh my God, no.

596
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:51,530
These people and the way they are are
wicked and their wickedness is going to

597
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:55,070
spread to the rest of us so much.
Well, we have belief systems,

598
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,920
man and belief systems. Once they're in
place, they can be really scary. You know,

599
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,280
if you have a belief system that this
group that you're going after or all evil

600
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:08,060
and God is on your side and they
need to be smitten from the earth.

601
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,890
But that's on our side. Yeah. That's
the other one. God on your side.

602
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,980
And that's what I think turns a lot of
people off about religion. It's not,

603
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,310
there's no personal response
as much as you know, the, the,

604
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,620
the right wingers that are our
religious scream about, oh,

605
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,810
we want people and not get out.
I have personal,

606
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,350
why don't you take some personal
responsibility? You know, don't,

607
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,480
don't put it on God.
Put her on you.

608
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:32,320
You feel uncomfortable with
this being this way or you,

609
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,280
you don't like these
people for some reason.

610
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,550
Or maybe you've actually done the history
and you know that these people have a

611
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:40,610
legitimate reason to be unhappy with
this government or know that they've been

612
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,890
treated unfairly in some
way, shape, or form.

613
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:46,280
And I think there's a difference
between being angry, angry,

614
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,710
and having holy anger and having
a righteous anger, you know? And,

615
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,260
and being angry for reason,

616
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,320
not just being upset and feeling
like your quote unquote the victim,

617
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,620
but technically looking at
a situation and saying, no,

618
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:00,830
I was treated unfairly and you
know what I was taken advantage of.

619
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,340
And I think from the time that people
had been a caveman to, you know,

620
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:08,990
tomorrow all anger comes from being
treated unfairly or the perception that

621
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:12,860
you're treated unfairly. Anything lied
to you, treated me unfairly. You told,

622
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,020
you told someone else the truth,
but you told me a lie.

623
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,500
You know you stole from me, you treated
me unfairly, I let you into my house,

624
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,560
I protected you and you fucking
repaid me by robbing me.

625
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,240
All of that comes back to it.

626
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,600
And I just think that if this
government is even going to survive,

627
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,500
it really has to address the amount of
cynicism that exists in America right now.

628
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,380
Because that was the whole point.
I thought of Obama coming in,

629
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,470
the idea that people were so cynical
about a government under Bush that saw

630
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:41,970
McCain as an extension to that. They were
like, oh my God again, another one. Well,

631
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:44,700
who are we going to go to war with now?
But then when he came in,

632
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:47,820
he was supposed to be, you know,
the, the, the great unifier,

633
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,780
but he turned into a great pacifier.
He was just like, okay, cool,

634
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,640
everything's going to be
good. I'm going to, Oh,

635
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:57,690
I'm going to intellectualize all of this
and make it seem rational, you know,

636
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:01,860
so I'll get away with a whole bunch of
shit that if Mitt Romney had been elected

637
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:06,630
or if McCain had been elected and
done the exact same shit that he did,

638
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,860
they would have gone crazy.
They,

639
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,200
where are the people that are
more marching on Washington to,

640
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:15,390
to go against the war? We're
at a now. That's why, you
know, I keep it real Rogan.

641
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,770
I do a lot of activism.

642
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,670
We did a show yesterday to raise money
for people that were victims of that

643
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,510
typhoon in the Philippines,
you know,

644
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:25,710
and it's going straight to them because
of working with grassroots organizations.

645
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,920
But a lot of times when I see these big
activist groups and they come up to me

646
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:31,470
and I'm just like, Yo, where
the fuck are you now? You know,

647
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,230
you were all waving your flag, you
know, when it was the Bush era,

648
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,190
but now that Obama was in power, you
don't want to make any waves, you know?

649
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:41,880
Now I see people on Msnbc.
You're advocating a war in Syria.

650
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,250
You don't even know what the
fuck is going on. You know,

651
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,230
you don't know anything about
the history of that struggle.

652
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,570
You know the thing anybody,
uh, about the, the, the, the,

653
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,830
the idea of what's going to
actually happen once they
get attacked and they have

654
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:55,800
to call their clients. I mean,
there are clients, state of Russia,

655
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:57,060
there a vassal of Russia now.

656
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,990
They basically sold themselves off
because of the chemical weapons thing.

657
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,250
They said, all right, we'll give you the
chemical weapons then you and the UN,

658
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,200
we'll deal with that personally.
It enables them to say, all right,

659
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:10,680
we're going to be partners forever
and ever as long as Russia exists,

660
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,680
Syria will be here.
And that's the deal that they had to make.

661
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,170
And there are plenty of people
who made that deal with America.

662
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,690
As long as they exist,
man will be good.

663
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,880
But as soon as America is endanger guests,
what my ass is in danger too. You know,

664
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,100
there are plenty of places like Guam,

665
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,170
America holds on to Puerto Rico like
it's balls. Israel, I'll tell you right?

666
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,440
Puerto Rico is one of the weirdest ones,
right? Because it's sort of a state,

667
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,710
but not really a state. Well, it's
a commonwealth, right? It received,

668
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,770
it received a charter of independence
from Spain in like 1898 and literally the

669
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,060
next year the USS Maine exploded.

670
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
But when people did research,
you know,

671
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:54,210
decades later they found out the ship
imploded, exploded from the inside.

672
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,150
And ironically,
here's another interesting tidbit.

673
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,560
All of the white officers were on the
land when the ship exploded and the only

674
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:05,050
people on the ship were like the deck
hands and the people of color. And

675
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,800
Are you implying that someone in the
government blew up that ship, sir,

676
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,640
is that she has never happened before.
Remember the USS Maine,

677
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,400
that's what they say.
That's never even been planned.

678
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,920
There's a lot of people that feel that
the Bush administration had planned a

679
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,460
false flag on Iran,

680
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,780
but that's false because the Bush
administration was awesome and if they did

681
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,040
plan it it would have happened.

682
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,270
So you don't know what the fuck you
talking about? They were perfect.

683
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,160
They had god on their side. God got
underside side. Yo, I swear to God,

684
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,800
there was so many times
when I've seen people,

685
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:42,640
like when I go to colleges and there's
some preacher dude like in front of the

686
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:46,930
college arguing with the atheists and
I always ask him, I'm like, Yo Dude,

687
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:50,260
do you do you believe in the president?
And he said, I absolutely support,

688
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,850
you know, President
Bush. I was like, what?

689
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:55,810
What would he have to do to lose
your support? Like what, what,

690
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,310
what sort of things
would he have to abuse?

691
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,470
Could he kill someone and
still gain your support?

692
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,910
You know when the guy was like, well
that depends who, and I'm just like,

693
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,250
wait a minute, do what? Do you be mid?

694
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:10,330
Depends who the v ordered the deaths
of some people overseas who aren't

695
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,950
Christians,
he's forgiven,

696
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,430
but if he like shot someone next
door who he went to church with me,

697
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,100
he should burn in hell forever.

698
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,030
I mean at that point I think the select
of morality is what bothers a lot of

699
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,910
people about religion in general.
It's just like, okay cool.

700
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,350
I'm only going to care about the lives
of certain human beings because they

701
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:33,310
share the same belief system of mine,
but the moment that you don't,

702
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,140
then I feel so threatened
by your existence that I
don't care if your children

703
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:38,974
live or die.

704
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,711
Well,
you heard the,

705
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:44,230
the latest revelations about the NSA that
they were ordering drone strikes based

706
00:39:44,231 --> 00:39:47,830
on metadata. They were ordering
drones, tribes based on GPS,

707
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:51,130
location of phones that
they were tracking. So they,

708
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,090
they might not have even known that
the guy that they were looking for was

709
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:59,440
inside the building and they just randomly
targeted buildings where these phones

710
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:04,060
existed. You know? That's if that's
true, that means they just said, okay,

711
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,340
well we're going to have to kill a whole
bunch of fucking people to get this

712
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,390
phone right.

713
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,210
Fun that he may not even be,
he'll hold my phone today, man.

714
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,350
Yeah. Uh, the, the whole thing here,
I'll pull it up because, uh, they were,

715
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:19,560
they did a story of it
on, um, on Rt. Yeah.

716
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:22,950
Use of NSA metadata defined drone.
Target kills.

717
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,140
That's crazy. Kill civilians.
They would find these,

718
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,270
I mean,
this is really hard to believe,

719
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,380
but they would find these people by the
location of their phone and then send in

720
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:38,520
the missiles. Jeez. That's,
that's evil shit. Wow.

721
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,300
That's really evil shit. And I know
there's bad people in the world for sure,

722
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,500
but that is not in any way,
shape or form the way to handle it.

723
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,220
There's gotta be a better way to kill
people because there's bad people that you

724
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:56,190
have to kill. You can't just kill
everybody around them. That shit's crazy.

725
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:59,300
You'll turn everybody against you a well,
you or I'm against you.

726
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,000
We should all be against, right. It's
murder. You're a murderer. You're,

727
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,910
you're just murdering people
in a way that is sanctioned.

728
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,560
But what strikes me about that is that
this government has no problem doing that

729
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:13,830
anyway. They call it collateral damage.
They say, okay, you know, we have,

730
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,420
we have a military target. It happens
to be near a school. You know what,

731
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,340
that's collateral damage.

732
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:23,430
Anybody could even think about doing
something like this though with the

733
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:28,320
metadata that's like insane, extreme
collateral damage. It's insane.

734
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,580
That's how they feel about it.

735
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,640
Glenn Greenwald, uh, is that
the guy, uh, who put this out?

736
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,440
I liked that guy. I liked
him too. My friend Sam Harris
hates his guts though. Why?

737
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,260
He thinks Sam Harris is a anti Islam.
Uh,

738
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,240
he's t Sam Harris is a neuroscientist,
is an author and he's,

739
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,750
he's pretty strong proponent of
atheism. Right? And, uh, this guy,

740
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,310
Glenn Greenwald, thinks that he's
got an anti Muslim, uh, agenda,

741
00:41:58,311 --> 00:41:59,750
anti Islam agenda.

742
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,810
You know what's interesting,

743
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,490
I had this discussion with somebody about
atheism and their way of dealing with,

744
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,580
um,
different cultures and societies.

745
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,470
You can totally be an atheist to
be racist. It's like me, you know,

746
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,220
you can be a feminist
and you can be racist.

747
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:17,850
That's ridiculous to think that those two
things can't coexist in the same being.

748
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,960
My thing is this, when I hear
people like Darwin, sorry,

749
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:26,130
Richard Dawkins and people who are
Darwinists, um, have conversations.

750
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,170
What's interesting to me is the,
the,

751
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:33,030
the level of civilization that they'll
attribute to like white Christian

752
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:35,880
society.
And even though they'll say it's barbaric,

753
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,710
it's still not as barbaric as those dark
brown people's cultures because they're

754
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:44,820
even more dangerous. And my thing is
this ticks, right? My thing is this,

755
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,930
it's like if someone says allow
walk bar before they go into war,

756
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,160
and that is the, the, the benchmark
to say that this is, you know,

757
00:42:53,161 --> 00:42:54,120
a religious killing.

758
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,350
Then what about all the soldiers of
America who say the Lord's prayer before

759
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:01,380
they go into combat? Isn't
that interpreted as, Oh man,

760
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,660
Jesus helped me kill these motherfuckers.
Really?

761
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:08,250
Then you're making a sacrifice then is
Christ a blood God to you or is it a god

762
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:12,060
of peace? That's the question that I
have to ask. And that is the part where,

763
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:12,570
you know,

764
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,230
when I speak to people who are atheists
who don't believe in in theism and stuff

765
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:16,650
like that,

766
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,340
you have to separate that from actual
historians and people who have studied the

767
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:24,240
history of religion and the history of
different cultures and societies to say

768
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:29,390
which one is more so called civil to one
another because I think we've fallen to

769
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:31,530
this idea of the civilized savage.

770
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,310
You know the idea that certain cultures
brought civilization to other people.

771
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,920
Nobody ever brought
civilization to anybody.

772
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,920
Civilization is the act of
being civil to one another.

773
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,100
When you take somebody else's shit
and then you say, Oh, guess what?

774
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,920
You're going to use our way of
doing things now rather than yours.

775
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,360
You didn't civilize anybody.

776
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,980
You just took them over and you enslave
them in a very polite way sometimes and

777
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:54,780
sometimes in a not so very polite way.

778
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,490
Cause colonization is too nice of a
word for rape. Genocide and fucking,

779
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
yeah.
Is it ever summation of population?

780
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,250
Has anybody ever taken over a country?
Nice. It's always not so nice. I mean the,

781
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,530
the, the horrors that happen
in this country alone when
it's hard to believe that

782
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:10,670
just a couple of hundred years ago,

783
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:14,330
all this stuff wasn't here and I need
a couple hundred years ago is nothing.

784
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,830
It's a blink of an eye.

785
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,910
Well that's what we
used to get an argument.

786
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,910
We may have talked to us about this on
the first show when people were like, oh,

787
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:25,380
you know, the aliens had to help those
people back in the day. And I was like,

788
00:44:25,381 --> 00:44:27,990
Yo dude, if they helped them, you know,

789
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:32,040
for the over the course of 10,000 years
build a pyramid, then maybe they helped

790
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,180
you because about 200 years ago you were
driving a horse and carriage and now

791
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:40,140
you've got a rover on Mars, so you got
a little boost to from the aliens buddy.

792
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:40,860
You know what I mean?

793
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:45,860
I think that it's just
ridiculous to assume one
culture had communication in one

794
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:46,471
culture,

795
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:49,440
couldn't possibly add if they've been
here and they've been here the whole time.

796
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:53,160
Well, if, if it is possible that we
were ever visited by aliens, who knows?

797
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:55,170
Maybe it takes a long
fucking time to get here.

798
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:59,520
Maybe they can only come here once or
twice in a generation. I don't know.

799
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,460
They set up shop here dude,
that if that's the case,

800
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,170
wouldn't there be levels of aliens?

801
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:06,300
Just like there's levels
of human civilization,

802
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:10,290
like human civilization goes from having
a horse and buggy to having a car to

803
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,124
having an airplane.

804
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,580
Wouldn't alien civilization go from
there to maybe some of them reach us and

805
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,640
these are like the real ghetto aliens
that are barely getting their shit

806
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,680
together out there in the world.
They're not,

807
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:23,340
they don't have any fucking alien
comes like, what are you doing?

808
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:26,280
Very sketchy science. They
fucking blow up. Sometimes.

809
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,470
Those are the guys who crashed at Roswell.
They'll like,

810
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,590
they're more advanced than us,
but there's still kind of fucked up.

811
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,910
And then there's dudes that are so far
advanced than them that they make them

812
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:36,930
look like cave people.

813
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,470
And these people don't no longer have
bodies and they travel interdimensionally

814
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:44,540
and they, they exist. That's what,
that's what I think it's like a big too,

815
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,390
like there's no saying like what dimension
they're in. You know what I mean?

816
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:52,480
Or how our eyes are calibrated, what
we are, what we can or can't see. Well,

817
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,800
I mean I used to be really attracted
to the idea that aliens came and helped

818
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,000
people.
I was very,

819
00:45:57,001 --> 00:46:00,150
very attracted to the idea and I'm still
attracted to it because I think it'd be

820
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,620
insanely fascinating because it really
follows what human beings would do if we,

821
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,250
if we were super advanced and we came
to a planet and we found some primitive

822
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:11,370
life forms, for sure we would
drop off some of our fucking Jizz.

823
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:14,640
We would definitely give them
some of our DNA. We're gross.

824
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,960
We thought we could touch this world
in some way. We decided to do that.

825
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,730
He did fuck the Avatar, didn't
he? Yes. Side big blue cat.

826
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,150
Think about what we're talking about doing
the Mars. Is that beastiality hold on.

827
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,020
That's interspecies
beastiality cause they talk.

828
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,070
It's just you're fucking an alien.
No, no, it's not BC. I don't know.

829
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,620
It's interspecies. It's not
beastiality isn't the fuck aliens man.

830
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,070
Shit fucking be.
We're calling her an animal.

831
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,350
We don't know what her final animal,
she talks.

832
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,280
Should we establish that shit back in star
trek when Kirk, fuck that green check.

833
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,520
I remember that. That was it. That's
precedent. It's legal presence.

834
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,600
She didn't have the girl didn't have
a tail. I don't give a fuck dude.

835
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,930
She had like a nose, like a cat.
Dude's hot. You mother fucker.

836
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,920
I fucked that Avatar Bitch. But at
the end of the my respect that, yeah.

837
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,370
By the end of the movie,
I wanted to live.

838
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,280
I wanted to live with
the Navi in the trees.

839
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,830
I wanted to be camping and
shooting arrows and fly.

840
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,930
So it was taking the consensus are
jre that fucking a 10 foot tall cat.

841
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:18,480
What bitch is not beastiality.
What about the planet of the apes?

842
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:19,380
When they cut the scene,

843
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:21,270
they were supposed to read
the market mark version joint.

844
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,990
You're supposed to be a scene where he
was having sex with the eight. No. Yeah.

845
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,280
Do they filmed it and they were
saying, is it BCI? He's like, it it.

846
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,040
Is it wrong

847
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,730
to be interspecies you
know what I'm saying? Yeah,

848
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,450
yeah. Listen, it's okay to fuck hot
aliens. I'm gonna say it right now.

849
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,760
If a hot alien comes to visit
me in the middle of the night,

850
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:42,280
if I get away with it, I'm
gonna fuck her. I respect that.

851
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,640
I'm not mad at her dad [inaudible] but
what if there he's looked like hers.

852
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,320
Oh, topsy turvy world. Oh Man.

853
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,210
What if the intonation,
everything was perfect, right?

854
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,930
Except that she had a really deep voice.
Like

855
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,950
I fucked a few smokers and my day
really hot chick with a big edge voice.

856
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:12,850
They're just ready to take you under their
wing. I'll take care of it. She's hot.

857
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,313
I'll deal with it.

858
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,840
I'm totally just never talked to
her on the phone. My thoughts,

859
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,410
thoughts on aliens visiting with
people though that people don't really

860
00:48:24,411 --> 00:48:28,880
understand how long a hundred years is.
We think of like 400 years ago.

861
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:33,500
It was being like, wow, 400 years ago, you
know, back then they didn't have cameras.

862
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:35,030
Back then they didn't have automobiles.

863
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:38,810
Everybody rode horses and then 400 years
before that, in 400 years before that,

864
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,150
you stop and think about what we
were talking about with Egypt.

865
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,150
You're talking about a culture that
existed for thousands of years,

866
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,830
thousands, thousands of years and
the, obviously we're smart as fuck.

867
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,310
They wrote down a lot of shit.
Just what they left behind.

868
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:55,520
Forget about what was found during the
burning of the library of Alexandria.

869
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,150
I mean they,

870
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,170
when they found that they destroyed all
these like ancient records and all this

871
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,990
information about how they did their,
their construct,

872
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:05,390
I mean who knows what the fuck was in
there when they burnt all that stuff.

873
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,780
But what these burned several
times. Yeah, but what the, yes,

874
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:13,760
it was what they left behind though carved
in the stones. It's magnificent shit.

875
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:19,070
I mean all their high rig lifts
there did the beautiful works of art.

876
00:49:19,071 --> 00:49:22,880
They left behind like the symmetry of
their buildings and the mathematics.

877
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,350
They're construction. It's so obvious.
There were super, super advanced people,

878
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,600
like they were really advanced.
And we just think of that as being like,

879
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:37,640
well, there's no way aliens must did it.
No, it's real possible that a human race,

880
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:42,290
a human culture can get super advanced
and fuck it all up and it could be fucked

881
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:47,120
up by disease and it can be fucked up
by asteroids and it can be fucked up by

882
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,640
other humans invading them,
which would happen to Egypt.

883
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:52,370
They got invaded by the Nubians
and the Nubians took older.

884
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,030
That's why the older fair though,

885
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:58,370
than the more recent Pharaoh's all had
black African faces like the Pharaoh in

886
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:02,360
the face of the Sphinx is
a very distinctly different
face than some of the more

887
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:05,480
Sephardic pharaohs that you saw,
like in the early days. Right. Yeah.

888
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,190
And the other thing is this,
that Egypt initially begin, um,

889
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,660
as a society that rose from other places,
you know what I mean?

890
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:17,690
There were other civilizations
that predated it such as Sumeria,

891
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,930
things of that nature. And
when you look at it, yes,

892
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:24,650
of course they could have easily took
from those civilizations as well. Sure.

893
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:27,110
We took from other civilizations for sure.
We took from,

894
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,640
from tribes and from other view,

895
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,050
I mean our constitution itself is based
on an air coy confederacy and something

896
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:36,440
that people don't really realize
or pay attention to that yes,

897
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,900
we didn't just get corn
from indigenous people.

898
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:43,880
We got this idea that different places
could be under the same federal state,

899
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:48,170
but still guests what have laws of their
own that are respected by the federal

900
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,350
gov or forceful that,

901
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,000
that they are forced to respect because
this is a different tribes and these

902
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:57,620
tribes are not going to tolerate you
telling them how to live. However,

903
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:02,621
we will combine forces for
the survivability of all of
us together as opposed to

904
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:03,710
individual tribe.

905
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,510
Wasn't that the whole forming of
the constitution as well? I mean,

906
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:10,950
didn't they get the ideas in the
constitution from studying the, the great,

907
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,930
um,

908
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:16,560
the great civilizations of the past like
Rome and Greece and all their ideals

909
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:20,610
about how society should be put together
and use those ideas and a lot of ways

910
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:21,990
to formulate the constitution?

911
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,970
Well, I mean, Napoleon civil code also
influenced a lot of western societies.

912
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,830
Europe's legal system now,
but I think you know,

913
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:34,640
when we talk about whether it's aliens
or whether it's anybody that interferes

914
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:38,270
in, in a human society,
you want to think that,

915
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,030
what would their agenda be?
What do they want?

916
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:45,830
What could they possibly have to gain
for all of it? Resources, land. I mean,

917
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:48,950
if you read the Bible that
says that, you know, the, the,

918
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,670
the sons of heaven made it with
the daughters of men. You know,

919
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,470
who's to say that's angels. Maybe
that's, we came down to fuck a woman.

920
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,760
It's absolutely possible
that it did happen.

921
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:02,690
I know people don't like to hear that
look all great. You believe in aliens.

922
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,160
That's not even what I'm saying.

923
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:08,210
I'm saying it's absolutely possible
because this fucking thing is so big.

924
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,710
It's so big. The idea that we've
never been visited before is silly.

925
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,460
But if we pay attention to the way we
treat the things on this planet that we

926
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:20,030
can control and we think about how
the fuck they would deal with us,

927
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,690
we should be probably pretty
happy that it is bullshit.

928
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,810
Because if there are anything like us,
I wouldn't,

929
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,720
I wouldn't put it past them
creating us at a monkeys.

930
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,510
I wouldn't put it past some
super advanced alien species.

931
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:35,630
Look at some stupid chimps and
go get these dumb mother fuckers.

932
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,590
Let's take some of our shit and put
it into then and then come back in a

933
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,520
thousand years. All my God, they got
planes and buildings and who knows?

934
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:47,420
It is possible that that happened. It
sounds quite ridiculous. Don't worry.

935
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:50,810
I know that and I know it sounds it,

936
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,620
but I'm not saying it's impossible.
I'm not saying it's likely.

937
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,660
It's certainly there's,

938
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,050
there is a chance that this
planet has been visited before.

939
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:03,080
Just the fact that we can
go to Mars with a drone.

940
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,850
We know that we sent these
manned vehicles into space.

941
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,480
We know that their satellites in orbit,
we've used the space shuttle.

942
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,580
We've used rockets there.
There's,

943
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,420
without a doubt a rover that's
moving around on the Mars right now.

944
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,690
If a vis a rover moving around on Mars,
we sent it from this planet.

945
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,460
We're monkeys.
I mean,

946
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,010
we're a couple of hundred years
removed from slavery in this country.

947
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,990
We just came up with the
Internet 20 years ago.

948
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:31,320
We already have a robot
moving around on Mars.

949
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,900
If there's something else out
there that's a hundred years,

950
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,580
a thousand years more advanced than us,

951
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:38,850
if they haven't blown themselves up for
sure they would send some shit our way.

952
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,850
If they came here a long,
long ass time ago,

953
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,810
the universe is 13 point
whatever billion years old.

954
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,140
Allegedly earth is only
4.6 billion years old.

955
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,350
I mean that's there's a hell of a long,
it's a long time.

956
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:57,351
That window that leaves nine fucking
billion plus years that someone else could

957
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:59,940
have been in a much more
stable solar system,

958
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,450
developed a civilization that's
not based on dominator culture.

959
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,360
Empires figured out of boulder and
that they might've had it completely

960
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:10,560
psychedelic culture like from the jump
they were eating mushrooms never got out

961
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:12,240
of it.
They might live in a tropical climate,

962
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:15,240
like the whole planet might be a
stable tropical climate where they're

963
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:18,030
consistently engaging in
mushroom use and they,

964
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,640
they developed the ability
to read each other's minds,

965
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,600
it like a fucking thousand years into
their civilization and they'd just been

966
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:26,220
rocking it freestyle since then.

967
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,300
And here they are 10 billion years
older than you know this planet.

968
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,170
But if we are like a
downgraded version of humans,

969
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,500
then human humans like 4.0 must
be really frightening creatures.

970
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:39,811
Oh,

971
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:43,620
it's something that can like look into
your mind and see you control things at

972
00:54:43,621 --> 00:54:46,710
the head and the people who
don't necessarily believe this,

973
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,170
but who won't even subscribe
to the possibility.

974
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,400
These are the same people that think that
laws hold our country together rather

975
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,980
than the iron fist of a
talking monkey. Well, there,

976
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:57,770
there's what holds this shit hurt me.

977
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,800
I will destroy you if you break these
things that I've written about the NSA

978
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:05,910
whistleblower. The fucking FBI breaks
into his house. Get on the floor trader.

979
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,770
I heard a word to that
when you were talking. Um,

980
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,040
there's a woman named Dr. Karen Mason.

981
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,520
She has a talking about the
evolution of the species and uh,

982
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,350
she says that there are hurt.
There we is,

983
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:20,040
that we're all homo erectus
because we walk up. Right.

984
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:24,060
But there's also different people on
this planet that a call home on noetic is

985
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,260
meaning that they have more than just
the five senses that people have.

986
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:31,050
So we're not all the same species.

987
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,420
Some people are more devolved
or evolved than others.

988
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:38,370
So you can't say that though, man. People
will accuse your racism, but no, no,

989
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:41,550
no, no. Don't say that. You can't say that
there's some people are just dumber. No,

990
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:44,670
no. Different species of
people. Meaning that you could,

991
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:47,940
you know how sometimes you could just
think of a friend and they'll call you?

992
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:50,670
Well, how about this just don't,
there's no term too. It's not,

993
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,840
it's not so much dependent on the ideas
of compartmentalizing people in the way

994
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,110
we do in terms of race
or in terms of religion.

995
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:01,860
It wouldn't be like to say that one
person of this color or this is not even

996
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,750
holler creed would have been smarter.

997
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,640
It would have been a specific
individual that's born within that line.

998
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,310
Either. It could be here in
America, it could be in Mexico,

999
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,330
it could be in Nigeria
or Scandinavia somewhere,

1000
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:16,950
but for example,

1001
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:20,400
there are types of intelligences that
we really do appreciate in this country.

1002
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,500
We look at science and math and we
say, oh man, you're really smart.

1003
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,010
You know you're going to

1004
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,640
be a fucking engineer. But people
don't appreciate social intelligence,

1005
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:29,140
emotional intelligence.
You know?

1006
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:32,080
Imagine somebody that's able to come
into a room and they look at you and they

1007
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:35,860
like, you know what, Joe? Joe Walks
different today. That means he sad.

1008
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:39,320
You know what I mean? Or you know, he,
he's worried about something. Or you know,

1009
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,050
when he's,
when he's checks his phone a lot,

1010
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,370
he only key only interrupts the podcast
to speak to his chalk child or something.

1011
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:48,120
So something must be wrong at home.
People who pick up on those things, right?

1012
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,450
It's, it's, it's incredibly, it's not like
female intuition, that sexist bullshit.

1013
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,900
It's the idea that people in
general, male, female, whatever,

1014
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,960
some of them are just more in touch with
the idea of giving a fuck about how the

1015
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:05,680
people around them exist and
therefore they're just a more,

1016
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,170
I wouldn't say a more
considerate human being,

1017
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,800
but they have more emotional and to
pay more attention to developing that

1018
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,980
musical intelligence. For example,
people could say, all right,

1019
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,050
I hear a note that's a g sharp.

1020
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,110
Now I'm going to create a whole song
around it and it's already finished in my

1021
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:24,640
head. That's a musical
genius. Physical intelligence.
People who say, you know you,

1022
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,720
you MMA shit, God damn it.
That's physical intelligence.

1023
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,560
Anyone who's got a fight in the ring in
and calibrate and exact punch or know

1024
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:35,920
how to move somebody or to to to
step them in this direction other,

1025
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,090
that's an incredible physical genius that
they have to possess in order to carry

1026
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:44,020
on something like that and not kid
knocked the fuck out by someone's swing on

1027
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:45,760
you as hard as they possibly can,

1028
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,440
but only certain intelligences are valued
in this country and in the world in

1029
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:55,000
terms of human society as opposed to
delving into what they would really be if

1030
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:58,450
we took them each at not just face value,

1031
00:57:58,451 --> 00:58:01,240
but what they represent for our
human culture. You know some,

1032
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,360
I know that's why some people fuck with
animals more than they fuck with people.

1033
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,430
I know people that they're
like, oh, I love my dog.

1034
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:08,140
Why can't you love a
dog more than a person?

1035
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,860
Sometimes a dog is more human
being than a human. You know,

1036
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:15,320
you got a homeless person in
the street who's crying you.

1037
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,990
Most people will walk right by him.

1038
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,430
You put your dog next to a homeless
person was fucking and tears. Somehow.

1039
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,510
I've seen it. My dog that doesn't like
nobody will go over there like, hey man,

1040
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:29,680
like kind of look at you like sad. Like
why are you sad? Why are you hurting?

1041
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,850
Who the fuck would do that? As a normal
person, we're trained to ignore that.

1042
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:38,280
Whereas something like a dog is
trained to say, hey man, no, someone,

1043
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,500
someone's in pain that's not right.
As if to say,

1044
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,190
I wish I could help you if I wasn't
trapped in this fucking body.

1045
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,400
You know what happens when people start
really paying attention to a lot of

1046
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:48,590
homeless people and hanging out with them?

1047
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,010
You realize the fucking crazy and if you
bring those mother fuckers in your life,

1048
00:58:53,011 --> 00:58:54,090
your life is going to be chaos.

1049
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,010
Can we take that crazy crying lady
underneath the bridge and say, come on,

1050
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:59,640
come on on my house, Doug. Stan help
used to do that. You know what happened?

1051
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,780
They got in a knife fight and
it's fucking driveway. Uh,

1052
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,360
the woman's stabbed her boyfriend.
Yeah. Doug, you still let him,

1053
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,510
he had a front lawn. He lived in. Nobody's
saying you got to breastfeed them.

1054
00:59:09,511 --> 00:59:12,030
I'm just saying that you're saying,
I know what you're saying.

1055
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,470
It's a very romanticized ideal that the
reality is we want to go out there and

1056
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:18,120
fucking bring homeless people
in your life every day.

1057
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:22,080
You only got 24 hours in a fucking
[inaudible] up with it all.

1058
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:26,350
Shit be screaming and crying.
No, no soap. Look, hey,

1059
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,690
you're on fucking shit together or
you're crazy. It's one of those two,

1060
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,010
and if you,
if you crazy,

1061
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:34,140
that's the real issue that when the
Reagan administration was here, they,

1062
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,330
they changed the laws.
They changed the,

1063
00:59:36,331 --> 00:59:40,010
the standards as far as like taking people
that you had to take care of and they

1064
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:42,040
let a lot of people out of
mental hospitals that were,

1065
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:46,070
they were infirmed for life and they got
him out and then these people were just

1066
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:48,680
like, free. You're free. You're on your
own. If you could take care of yourself,

1067
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,270
but then again,
when we think about it,

1068
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:54,370
then let's take that then and then let's
not make it romanticized. Idealized.

1069
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,620
If these people are sick,
if they have a disease,

1070
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,820
then shouldn't they be taken care of?
Shouldn't they be right? No question,

1071
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,361
no question.

1072
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:04,790
If someone had fucking pneumonia and
they were lying on the fucking highway,

1073
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,440
some, uh, you called the
ambulance, they would come get
him. Somebody sitting there,

1074
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,400
there are schizophrenia,
you know what I mean?

1075
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,690
Or they have multiple personality
disorder. They're more liable to, to,

1076
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,230
to hurt themselves and they're their
danger to themselves and to other people.

1077
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,830
Those people need to be taken care
of. For example, I look at that,

1078
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:23,240
the way I look at drug addiction.

1079
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,120
Those people don't belong in
prison for 40 or 50 years.

1080
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,240
They obviously need treatment.
They need to be fixed,

1081
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,080
but we only give a fuck when it's a
Phillip Seymour Hoffman that that dies.

1082
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,570
And then when a, where are the rest
of their heroin addicts? You know,

1083
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,780
I went off on Twitter the other day
because I was like, Yo Dude, you know,

1084
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:43,220
the NYP ds investigating
who sold them the hot dose.

1085
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,360
Really,
you know,

1086
01:00:44,361 --> 01:00:48,560
I know lots of people I've known through
my life that either almost died or died

1087
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,030
of a damn heroin overdose or some kind
of drug overdose and the NYP d didn't go

1088
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:55,610
meticulously looking
for the specific dealer.

1089
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,610
You want to know where the
heroin is coming from, homie?

1090
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,770
I told them you can go first stop.
You need to do is Afghanistan.

1091
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,910
That's where it's coming from.

1092
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,840
And the poppy fields are being protected
by our troops because the war lords

1093
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:10,130
that we want to stay in power that are
willing to give us access are the ones

1094
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:14,450
that need the money. So we allowed
them to grow the poppy and we disallow.

1095
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:15,950
The Taliban supported it too.

1096
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,410
But listen, don't bring any homeless
people in your house. Trust me.

1097
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,090
I know he's saying that all make sense?
But you got to trust.

1098
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,580
Had a background in comedy. Don't
watch it. Come in your house.

1099
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,710
They don't even know what toilet paper is.
Dude,

1100
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:34,550
fix everybody that's
close to Valentine's Day.

1101
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:38,960
I know he can't be captain.
Save a hoe. You can't.

1102
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,790
You can't be that guy. I'll tear. We're
trying to fix the world. Nice to that.

1103
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:47,090
God did a problem is the really fucking
crazy people. You're not going to fix.

1104
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,450
You could,

1105
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,510
you could work all day everyday for the
rest of your life and you wouldn't put a

1106
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:51,344
dent in that shit.

1107
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:56,030
And I think that they have to
someone hallmark of our society.

1108
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:56,910
It's a question.

1109
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:59,940
Do you think those people started that
way or do you think it was the things

1110
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:02,550
that happened to them within the
course of their life more often?

1111
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:03,040
That makes sense.

1112
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,100
You would be crazy to assume
either or. You're, you know,

1113
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:09,790
no one has any idea what the background
of a lot of those people are other than

1114
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,260
the people that have
treated them in the past,

1115
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,300
they probably don't even know
what the fuck happened to them.

1116
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:16,570
There's a lot of really sick people out
there that just happened to be homeless

1117
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:18,130
people because we can't,

1118
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:23,070
we can't them as insane enough
to institutionalize. Not,

1119
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,680
not then to be crazy
enough to try to define it,

1120
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:30,120
but wouldn't you think that the majority
of these cases of people who had

1121
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:34,680
extreme trauma of some sort as a child?
I would imagine. Yeah, I would imagine.

1122
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,640
Well, you know, abuse people, people
that have been homeless, I've met,

1123
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:43,620
I knew quite a few people that were
homeless at the stages of their life from

1124
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,720
the time when I used to
hang out in pool halls,

1125
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,200
one of my best friends was homeless
for a long period of time when I was a

1126
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:50,010
struggling comedian.

1127
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,500
My friend Johnny was a pool hustler or
legit hundred percent pool house and it a

1128
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:57,750
drug addict. But the pool
hustler thing is how he got by.

1129
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,170
He was extraordinary pool player and
he would pretend to sock and he would,

1130
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,100
he would go to places and he was a fast
talker and he was a slick dude and he

1131
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:08,670
got a big thrill out of tricking guys
into playing him. And then you know,

1132
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:12,960
he would like lose a little then complain
and then they would start talking shit

1133
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:14,570
and calling them fat
and all this different.

1134
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,880
And then it would slowly start playing
better and they like make it real

1135
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,760
emotional with the guy and like he would
get thousands of dollars at a people

1136
01:03:20,761 --> 01:03:24,090
and a lot of it was psychological.
He just knew how to play people.

1137
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,670
He had emotion tells
motional intelligence,

1138
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,340
social intelligence and emotional
intelligence. He had both,

1139
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:31,680
but he was homeless a
good portion of the time.

1140
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,390
Like sometimes he would
come stay at my house.

1141
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:37,140
This motherfucker hadn't slept in days
except under pool tables and he would

1142
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:38,490
just conk out.

1143
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:42,270
Like he got shot with a tranquilizer dart
and just sleep for like he slept in my

1144
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:43,350
house for two solid days.

1145
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:47,970
Straight ones because he was just burning
it best leave of his life probably.

1146
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:51,300
Yeah man. The dude, the poor dude
was just out there and you know,

1147
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:53,370
and he had issues himself.
He had a,

1148
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:57,120
a lot of mental health issues himself
and I think that there's a lot of people

1149
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:59,940
out there that are homeless
that have mental health,

1150
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,640
which I think that's the
majority of a lot of the cases.

1151
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,640
I think a lot of the homeless people
that have mental health issues,

1152
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,500
and what's sad is that,
you know,

1153
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,860
especially when you find people who
are supposed to be cared for by this

1154
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:11,220
government.

1155
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,370
And it goes back to what we were
talking about before and the imagine the

1156
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:17,640
veterans that are homeless out there who
are paid dues and risk their lives to

1157
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:19,740
this country and they are
completely looked over.

1158
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,630
And you would think the people who say
that they love America so much wouldn't

1159
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:26,460
be the ones that are bleeding it dry.

1160
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:31,110
But ironically it's the people that are
criticizing this country for the things

1161
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:33,390
it does wrong that love it the most.
Why?

1162
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:36,720
Because we want to fix the things that
are wrong as opposed to people that say,

1163
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:41,130
Hey, we just love America. And anything
you say against America is wrong. No,

1164
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,120
that's not the case.

1165
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,630
Because the people who usually say that
are the ones that are bleeding this

1166
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:49,860
country dry by saying, Oh
man, I love America. You know,
I want to destroy unions.

1167
01:04:49,861 --> 01:04:53,070
Unions are destroying them. You know what?
I want to stop workers from doing this.

1168
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,120
Dude, you're not doing it because you
love America. You love money. You know,

1169
01:04:57,121 --> 01:05:00,540
if you really loved America, how come
you've got a God damn plant overseas?

1170
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,270
You know you could be
not making 10 billion.

1171
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:05,820
You could be making 7 million a year,

1172
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,400
but you would be feeding
10 times more people.

1173
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,740
You know here in America
they would never do that.

1174
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,360
Of course you billion is a big number.

1175
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't know what kind of
country you live in and stuff,

1176
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:18,280
but that's what I'm talking about. Taxes.
My 3 billion pays for social programs.

1177
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,600
Clean the streets.
Who Do you want to build these bridges?

1178
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,660
That extra 3 billion is important,
right?

1179
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,780
The only that they're not going
to pay it in taxes either.

1180
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:28,300
It's not like it's when they go
to anything and that's right.

1181
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:32,230
They weasel that shit. Yeah. I mean
come on. The NFL is like a charity

1182
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:39,640
funnies things of all times. The NFL
is tax free. Is it team by team though?

1183
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:43,390
Did I talk to the dude? The whole
thing is a charity organization. Please

1184
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,360
get the fuck
in the world.

1185
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,980
The UFC needs to get on that.

1186
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,950
I don't know what the Fuck Dana White's
waiting for. We need to be tax free.

1187
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,350
We need to irrigate the UFC.
Charity.

1188
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,290
Charity should be a charity.
That's what I'm saying.

1189
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:07,630
Crazy shit. You imagine the
UFC tried to become tax free.

1190
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,000
You know who else was
like, oh my God, the NHL,

1191
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:14,770
they're tax free to get the fuck
up and HR. That is hilarious. Mba.

1192
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,430
That is. No, but I think they get that
they got to pay too many black people.

1193
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:23,020
They got to play it. They're not happy
with this. 99% black people got dammit.

1194
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:27,170
Make them pay taxes. I mean he's baseball.
They gotta pay to too many Latino,

1195
01:06:27,171 --> 01:06:28,270
too many Latinos.

1196
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:33,100
These mother fuckers coming over here
throwing heat coming up. Money, bitch,

1197
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,310
give me,
yeah,

1198
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,560
taxes man.
The people that don't have it have

1199
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,710
to pay taxes. It's a real God
damn mind blower. It's like,

1200
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,700
well how does that get determined and
like religions that make money like

1201
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:49,200
religions,
like say Scientology.

1202
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:52,650
Scientology is a tax people
organization and tax free organization.

1203
01:06:52,651 --> 01:06:57,651
That was written by a science
fiction writer who l Ron Hubbard,

1204
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,440
who publicly stated that the best way
to make a lot of money is to start your

1205
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:06,030
own religion. And he got tax free. That
guy got tax rate. You know what's funny?

1206
01:07:06,031 --> 01:07:06,990
When I got out of prison,

1207
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:11,630
I went to try and find a job and all these
places and everyone said no to me and

1208
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,410
there was this one ad that was like,

1209
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,460
come learn the secret to life
and get paid while doing it.

1210
01:07:17,461 --> 01:07:22,461
And it was like a $12 an hour job and
like 1999 when I just made parole and they

1211
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:27,660
were advertising like, please come to
this area, you know you can learn. And,

1212
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:32,310
and I walked in and it was a Scientology
center course and I walked in.

1213
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:36,330
Lady was Super Nice. They're all
the most polite, no, no, no, no.

1214
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:40,050
They just wanted to fucking sign.
They literally just brought me in.

1215
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,670
They shoved me in front of a screen with
like four or five other people and they

1216
01:07:44,671 --> 01:07:48,720
played me like a Scientology video and
then they will, they, they asked us,

1217
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:53,610
they were like, did you all understand
the truth in this video? And I was,

1218
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,700
I was sitting, I was just like,
Yo, I really want it to be like,

1219
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,540
what the fuck is wrong with you?
Like no one believes this shit.

1220
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,510
But at the same time I sat
back and I said, you know what,

1221
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:07,050
I really don't understand this religion
enough for me to make a commitment about

1222
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,480
it right now. And they were
very polite to me. They're like,

1223
01:08:09,481 --> 01:08:11,880
thank you very much for your
time, sir. Take care of,

1224
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,160
and it was somebody else in there
who really needed that job and

1225
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,880
they just looked at me and
they would, they gave him
this kind of look like, cool,

1226
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:22,760
cool. You're out in the running anymore.
And there were like, I was touched.

1227
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,620
I had to swear to God,
Yo,

1228
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:29,240
I could see the charlatan and the snake
oil coming out of the side of the jacket.

1229
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:32,870
Dude. They were like, I was touched by
this video. Like I really thought it was.

1230
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:36,140
I mean the dude, they're there
to get a job. Yeah. That was it.

1231
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,260
Joe. You, I looked at it. You might be
right about this racist shit, by the way,

1232
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,640
because the only other ones that don't
have to pay taxes, the golf league,

1233
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:45,800
the PGA and the NHL

1234
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,490
[inaudible]

1235
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,900
all the owners that own a
fellow daddy's fucking creep.

1236
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,860
The NBA should be pissed.
Yeah.

1237
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:01,870
Doug Golf guys don't have to pay
tax like the most money. Right? Wow.

1238
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:06,700
That's dark. That's dark racism.

1239
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,950
Wow.
I think it's racism,

1240
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:13,740
crying racism for the NBA and I
don't even watch basketball. Yeah.

1241
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,770
The idea that you could get away with the
Scientology thing, that that could be,

1242
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:21,000
we need to start her own fucking religion.
God dammit.

1243
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,160
That's how you're really good.

1244
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:28,540
That's how you're really locked down.
That's the quote right there.

1245
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,790
When you're starting a
religion, God dammit. Well,

1246
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,730
they have so much money that
they can get away with it.

1247
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,270
Like Scientology is a number
to land owner in Los Angeles.

1248
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,060
They own more buildings and
property and real estate.

1249
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,280
In Los Angeles then like almost anybody.

1250
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:44,310
The freakiest thing is,

1251
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,040
you know how they rope off
everything at a time square when, uh,

1252
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:50,040
when the ball is going to drop or whatever
and there's a certain time you can't

1253
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:54,810
go past the barricades. One night
I was there and the guy said, well,

1254
01:09:54,811 --> 01:09:57,330
you remember the Church of
Scientology? And I said, yeah,

1255
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:01,680
and he let me in through the back
through the barricade. Real Story. Dude.

1256
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,530
Real Story.
He probably just wanted to fuck you.

1257
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:09,910
[inaudible] handsome guy.

1258
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,960
[inaudible]

1259
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:28,550
came right out of just press a button.
Whoa.

1260
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,240
You got to keep the ball moving.

1261
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,050
What is the, wow, what are you supposed
to say? Amazing. He probably loved you,

1262
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:43,820
dude. Scientologists try and make
friends. He was a police officer too.

1263
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:47,660
That's hilarious. Well, they met.
It might have some sort of a deal.

1264
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,000
Maybe they pay off the cops get,
get through the line.

1265
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:51,590
I think that's the now brochures.

1266
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,170
That's the only way you
really do get anything done.

1267
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:57,020
I think a lot for a lot of
companies and corporations.

1268
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:59,960
They just pay off whoever it
is that's in charge. Well,

1269
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:03,680
the only reason why people aren't
investigating Scientology in this country,

1270
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:05,240
but yet they are in other countries.

1271
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,860
It's got to be just how
much money they have.

1272
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:07,820
That's the one thing that makes sense.

1273
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,560
Because if it was a new group that came
out of nowhere and they hadn't had all

1274
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,550
this history owning all these buildings

1275
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:19,230
and you found out like that they had
developed this religion based on the

1276
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:23,610
scientific or a science fiction authors
writings and you would read it and go,

1277
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,860
wait a minute, what the fuck?
What did these he meters,

1278
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:29,700
you hold onto these these aluminum
cans and they tell me your personality.

1279
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,000
Get the fuck Outta here. That's
not real. They would be shut down.

1280
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,860
You would think that they
would be run out of town. Well,

1281
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:39,030
I mean someone else could tell you, hey,
this cracker is really the flesh of,

1282
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:40,970
you know, a Hebrew Zombie. You know?

1283
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,800
I mean someone could put it in that
way and you would feel ridiculous.

1284
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,500
As long as it's old, we're cool
with it. No, but that's what I mean.

1285
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:48,930
As long as it's through a
certain period of time. Look,

1286
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,580
I have a great respect for people who
I've seen use religion to make them a

1287
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:57,960
better person. Well, when I see someone
become more pretentious, more judgmental,

1288
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,190
more like I have all the answers and
unless you believe in exactly what I

1289
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:04,320
believe,
then you're going to go to damnation.

1290
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,390
That's when I see religion as like a
destructive thing that ends up ruining

1291
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,330
people's lives. But when I see
people that honestly just take it,

1292
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,760
and I think that's the thing with a lot,
with a lot of religions,

1293
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,720
as long as the Kennan can be as
ridiculous as it's going to be, you know,

1294
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:20,400
people will believe preposterous things.

1295
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,220
All of the mask you to believe
something preposterous. You know the,

1296
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:26,820
the ocean is divided, you know,
of Muhammad ascended into heaven,

1297
01:12:26,821 --> 01:12:28,590
you know what I mean? Or, or you know,

1298
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:32,310
Jesus Christ was born of a virgin
and then died and came back to life.

1299
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,250
And yet when you look at people's lives,
you know,

1300
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,120
some people's lives are preposterous. You
know, there was a, there was a family,

1301
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:42,960
my friend was staying and doing a photo
project down in Brazil and he was down

1302
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:45,270
there and he was like, you know, there's
a whole there, two holes in the floor.

1303
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,140
One hole is in the bathroom where everyone
goes to the bathroom and the other

1304
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:52,500
hole is like literally right next door.
And they put like a,

1305
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,220
like a bucket down there to catch shrimp.
And I'm like, wait a minute, wait.

1306
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,630
So where is it like in a different
river or something like nine,

1307
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:03,780
it's the same water. And I'm like,
really? Like yeah definitely.

1308
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:05,670
It's the same exact water.
And he's like,

1309
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,330
you have to understand that's the only
way they're going to eat anything that

1310
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:12,150
day is to fish for shrimp
in that shit water.

1311
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,750
And that's preposterous to me for you and
I to look at that and be like, Oh man,

1312
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,420
you know who in this room would imagine,
you know,

1313
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:21,120
I'm gonna put my hand in the toilet
to pick up my dinner tomorrow.

1314
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,260
But that is the absolute reality that
people who are living in those types of

1315
01:13:25,261 --> 01:13:28,620
dire conditions, cause if they don't eat
that they're not going to fucking eat.

1316
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:33,210
That's why I'm honestly not offended if
somebody, you know, steal someone. Oh,

1317
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,750
I'm in some third world country. I mean,
not that I liked that shit, but yo,

1318
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:40,290
you're taking something because you're
going to die if you don't sell it to eat.

1319
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,750
And motherfuckers just stealing,
you know,

1320
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,530
Reebok pumps cause they want to look
fucking cool. Like soccer. My Nigga,

1321
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,970
the only person I know that's ever
actually started a religions, Alex Grey,

1322
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,900
Alex Gray is the visionary artist.
I don't know if you've ever seen his work,

1323
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:57,990
but everything he does is the
psychedelic portraits. They're,

1324
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:01,290
they're like these really intense,

1325
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,760
like a multicolored.
They look like dimethyltryptamine trips.

1326
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:10,410
It's all like, uh, like Iowasca trips
or mushroom trips and all of his art.

1327
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:11,940
This is the stuff coming out of people.
Yeah.

1328
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,670
This is all of his stuff.
Well, he's, he's created his,

1329
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,410
not only is he created his own religion,

1330
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:22,180
but he got tax free status
and his city is trying to, uh,

1331
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,820
to fight it. They still want
them to pay taxes. I think,

1332
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:29,150
I don't know if he ever worked that out,
but he's actually trying to do it in a,

1333
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:31,570
in a really like positive,
healthy way.

1334
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:35,620
He's not trying to make money off people
are own people or give you a bunch of

1335
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:39,280
rules that you have to follow.
He's just essentially,

1336
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:44,340
he's a guy who really believes that
psychedelics are a connection to the true

1337
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:49,120
God of the universe, love and
God and, and you know, the,

1338
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:51,400
the energy that exists
when you have these, uh,

1339
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:57,130
these powerful transformative
psychedelic experiences. So he, um,

1340
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,770
he's building this thing
in upstate New York.

1341
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,510
He came on and showed me
and Brian, his, uh, his, uh,

1342
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,250
communities putting together up there,

1343
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:11,080
but he's got this huge building that he's
making that he came on our podcast and

1344
01:15:11,081 --> 01:15:15,670
did a Kickstarter for it and raise the
money like in no time. It was amazing.

1345
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:20,020
The people from this podcast fucking
represented, like in as positive,

1346
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,540
a strong way as was humanly possible.

1347
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,210
And a whole bunch of people
supported this and uh,

1348
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,480
he got all his funding and he's
building this incredible building.

1349
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:31,030
Look at this thing. Look it up. Tech.

1350
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:36,070
It's on the other one behind in front
of you too. That this is going to be,

1351
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:40,750
this is going to his church. Yeah.
It's all based on his artwork and uh,

1352
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:43,900
it's like probably going to be one of the
most beautiful buildings in the world.

1353
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,670
And where is he going to build this? And
upstate New York. He has like, uh, he has,

1354
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:48,311
yeah,

1355
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:52,060
he has like a temple and I'm still going
on something like a jungle in Columbia

1356
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,970
or some shit. You know what I'm telling
you, the top of a mountain I met,

1357
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,090
I've met the dude several
times and he is the real deal.

1358
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:00,610
He really is a beautiful person.
He's all full of love.

1359
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,020
The guy's like so loving and happy and
friendly. He's not evil in any way,

1360
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:08,110
shape or form.
And he just wants to promote those,

1361
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:13,090
those ideas and promote art. And,
and, and promote love. I mean,

1362
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,370
you couldn't ask for a better guy
trying to create his own religion,

1363
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:19,310
but what he's trying to do is you just
influence people in a very positive way.

1364
01:16:19,311 --> 01:16:24,240
She, Noah, Joe, it's usually never the guy
who creates it. All, right? Always things.

1365
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:27,310
Heritage is always, it's always
the inheritance. That's so true.

1366
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:30,170
Ever the fuck takes this shit over.
It's going to be like, listen, you know,

1367
01:16:30,171 --> 01:16:35,171
in order for you to really get the
psychedelic experience [inaudible] shit.

1368
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:41,500
You know what I mean? Let me father
children with everyone's wife here.

1369
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:43,510
It just, they all do that, right?

1370
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:46,600
Eventually it was too hard
to hot girls walking around.

1371
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:51,550
They love you so much because you're
the Messiah Tam on it hit this fucking

1372
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:53,830
husband and hers.
It's just fucking up my flow.

1373
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,330
Yeah, well that's just human nature, man.

1374
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:01,540
I mean that's obviously the issue with
priest telling them they can't have sex.

1375
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,990
You know, you'd create monsters. He
create monsters. When you suppress,

1376
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:08,250
there's no way around it. If
you, if you suppress energy,

1377
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,300
finds a way he threw in another way.
I really wouldn't do some in depth

1378
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,280
research on when that started happening.

1379
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:18,281
Cause nearly Orthodox
Church people who were um,

1380
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,800
officials of the church
were allowed to have wives.

1381
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:24,410
They were allowed to have a dispensation.
They were not to get married.

1382
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,380
They got married by the pope.
I mean the Pope had children.

1383
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,160
I mean I think at some point people looked
at it and probably in the Middle Ages

1384
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:36,000
where people got real pious and you
know, when you examine the, the, the,

1385
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:40,430
the changing of Christianity,
you find specific points where it becomes,

1386
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:41,301
you know,

1387
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:46,301
from that time where people are completely
nonviolent to becoming structured,

1388
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:50,360
to be a violent society. You know,
people say, oh well who, who,

1389
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:51,290
whose writings of those,

1390
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,560
I always said it was Saint Augustine
and then it makes sense cause he dies in

1391
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:57,620
the siege of hippo. Regis. During
that particular time, you know,

1392
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:00,950
the eastern Roman empire was trying to
eradicate something called area aneurysm,

1393
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,850
which is the idea that the father is
superior to the son. In other words,

1394
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:08,810
the father created the sun and therefore
the sun was inferior to the father as

1395
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:09,740
he was a creation.

1396
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:14,540
The the people of the church hated this
idea and so they overthrew all of the

1397
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:18,660
Germanic kingdoms that inherited the
western Roman Empire in order to to to

1398
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:23,630
impose their idea of what Christianity
would be, which if you think about it,

1399
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:28,510
would make that the first crusade ever.
In terms of Christianity Celibacy,

1400
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:31,810
there's,
this is where it starts out celibacy.

1401
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:36,870
The first mandate requiring priest to be
sell of it came in three o four a d so

1402
01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:42,250
the year three Oh four Canon
33 of the council of Elvira,

1403
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:47,251
that is some Harry Potter Shit stated
that all bishops press putters and deacons

1404
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:53,521
and all other clerics were to abstain
completely from their wives and not to

1405
01:18:54,641 --> 01:18:56,020
have children.
Wow.

1406
01:18:56,050 --> 01:19:01,050
A short time later and three 26 the
council of Nicea convened by Constantine

1407
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:07,330
rejected a ban of priests marrying
requested by Spanish clerics.

1408
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:11,320
Wow.
This is fantastic.

1409
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,660
So they just decided they
were saying too much dick.

1410
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,870
That's the only way around it.
That's exactly what was going on.

1411
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:20,080
Does know they had too much power.
There was no rock stars back then.

1412
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:24,160
You had poets, and by the way, when
you're dealing with 3000 and you know,

1413
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:28,090
I mean 304 rather,
there was no one was reading the Bible.

1414
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,000
They didn't figure out how to
read the Bible until, till uh,

1415
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,590
till Martin Luther came along and
translated it into a phonetic language.

1416
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,310
That was when most people come try to,
when do they chore was Latin.

1417
01:19:39,311 --> 01:19:42,220
The first time it was translated into gym,
Germanic egg

1418
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,870
was, I believe in the fourth century
by a priest called will fill up.

1419
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:50,460
And when I look at the actual
extension of where it is,

1420
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:52,800
a lot of people were really
illiterate in the first place.

1421
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,420
And the way that they learn to read,

1422
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,760
I'm in Greece and in Rome was actually
by reading the Bible and reading the

1423
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:01,620
actual scripture and saying,
oh,

1424
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,790
it would be the way someone would read
a kid's book these days only you're not

1425
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:06,630
reading a Kid's book.

1426
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:09,690
You're reading what you're going to be
indoctrinated into for the rest of your

1427
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:12,360
entire life. In other words.
That's the first book.

1428
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:13,710
In the last book you're gonna read,

1429
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:16,650
probably if you are sitting in there
and you're a peasant in the middle of

1430
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:18,210
nowhere in the Middle Ages,

1431
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,950
it says that Germanic
language translations of the
Bible have existed since the

1432
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,951
Middle Ages,

1433
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:27,570
and the most influential is Luther's
translation and that the Martin Luther

1434
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:32,100
translations, I believe that was in
the 15 hundreds or something like that.

1435
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,240
There's a great hardcore history podcast
on that called the something Thor.

1436
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:42,990
Thor Thor's find it, find the
name of that. I forget what it is,

1437
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:47,490
but it's all about Martin
Luther translated the Bible
into a phonetic language.

1438
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:49,650
Yeah,
they couldn't read it.

1439
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:54,680
So back then when a priest was
the only direct connection to God,

1440
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:59,810
he was the only guy that was able
to tell you the word of God. He was,

1441
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:03,450
here it is angels.
Here it is.

1442
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,050
The gothic Bible or the will fill a bible.

1443
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:11,730
Christian Bible as translated by the ref
will fill it in the fourth century into

1444
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:16,680
the gothic language spoken by the eastern
Germanic peoples or the gothic tribes,

1445
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:22,010
meaning the inheritors of the
Roman state as Rome fell in a four,

1446
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:27,420
10. And then of course I think
in four 55 and then finally,

1447
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,080
um,
what was the last four 76?

1448
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,450
And back then the Germans were
totally different. Like the, the,

1449
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:38,230
the whole country of Germany.
There was so many barbarians.

1450
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:42,240
There's big fucking powerful,
scary. But this, this is,

1451
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,240
this is the interesting point.

1452
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,030
What makes them a barbarian
that they weren't with Rome,

1453
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,660
if anything wasn't roam the most
barbaric out of all of them? Well,

1454
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:52,780
I mean when I say barbarian,
I mean like Conan the barbarian.

1455
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:56,170
We use a big giant to the fuckers
who ate meat and drink milk.

1456
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:00,310
That was like primary staples of their
dying and any massive amount of protein,

1457
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,850
but the protein content of their diet.
It's why they were so big.

1458
01:22:03,851 --> 01:22:05,080
They were enormous people.

1459
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:08,350
I don't think they did a whole lot of
farming cause it's cold as shit up there.

1460
01:22:08,351 --> 01:22:11,470
So they're there, they're
eating, you know, a lot of
animal protein. And they were,

1461
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:11,981
apparently,

1462
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:15,850
they were enormous in comparison to a
lot of the people that would encounter

1463
01:22:15,851 --> 01:22:19,360
them. Like that was like the first
depictions from China, I believe,

1464
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:23,230
of encountering German people.
They were like, Holy Shit,

1465
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,450
are these fucking people big?
You know,

1466
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:29,770
they were just enormous savage
people, you know? Well, I mean,

1467
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,173
I dunno.

1468
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:35,640
I'm sure that there were some sort of
human sacrifice here and there. Oh fuck.

1469
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:39,870
Yeah. The thing is that everybody
did that. That shit was standard.

1470
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:43,360
When you look at their, their tribal
societies though, I really would like to,

1471
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,200
to sit down and examine what the,
the,

1472
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,350
the process was for them in,

1473
01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:53,790
in their societies as opposed to when they
were romanized, you know, because that,

1474
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:58,500
that people living in, in like some
mud hut in the middle of Germany,

1475
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:03,680
I'm sure they had some different
idea of controlling themselves and,

1476
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,980
and to,
in

1477
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,850
similar to the way native American
people don't, didn't ever had a prison.

1478
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,420
You know what I mean? Where the fuck did
you put the people that did bad things?

1479
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:16,450
Will, you just have to fix
them or put them on sticks.

1480
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,700
Somebody had to be fixed the islands
off. Someone had to be fixed. Yeah.

1481
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,670
Or Kill Them. I think they'd probably
killed a lot of people too. Well,

1482
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,870
that's the thing. I mean,
it depends on what he wants.
Society, you want to imagine.

1483
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,320
I mean, I remember I watched the movie
300 right? And it was like, Oh man,

1484
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:35,410
they seem, they make these Persians
seem like the wicked his people,

1485
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,281
but when you look at it,

1486
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:39,040
what were the Greeks still and
they were practicing infanticide.

1487
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:43,300
It was still a monarchy. Sparta's
still had slaves like a motherfucker.

1488
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,560
I give him the movie 300 a lot of
creative freedom because it was based on a

1489
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:51,250
graphic novel and it's obviously got a
lot of, they're doing uncle [inaudible].

1490
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,030
I know I don't have I Lao goes
through that movie. I loved it.

1491
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:57,150
But to me it's a comic book.
Right?

1492
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,520
The real problem with making a movie
about Spartans is you're going to have to

1493
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:06,400
have a bunch of dudes fucking each
other. Okay. If you're gonna do it right,

1494
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:09,160
you want to do it right.
You got to do a historically accurate,

1495
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:12,910
which is why when Martin, when he was
like, oh dude, those Athenian boy lovers,

1496
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:17,410
and I was like, wait a minute dude, exam
from Sparta dudes here in the gymnasium,

1497
01:24:17,411 --> 01:24:20,350
which means like naked in Greek
or something. It's off course.

1498
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:23,800
There was a lot of man fucking
going on, but it was normal. I mean,

1499
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:27,110
I'm not saying that they should
do it because it would, you know,

1500
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:28,660
somehow or another discredit them,

1501
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:33,430
but it is historical fact that the people
that live back then engaged in much

1502
01:24:33,431 --> 01:24:34,810
more homosexual activities.

1503
01:24:34,811 --> 01:24:38,560
Then we think of today that particular
area and that particular the Greeks and

1504
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:41,080
the Romans and the Spartans
and all this fucking savages,

1505
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,650
they were banging each other. They
always were and it was a part of life.

1506
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:48,340
It was a normal thing. And men having
boys for lovers and like that was like,

1507
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:53,200
I mean how many philosophers had said,
hey, that's not real. It's not spartan.

1508
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,080
That's your boyfriend.

1509
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,280
Fucking some veterans who come down and
put some gay guy up. Don't do it again.

1510
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:03,370
That's, it's not, not,
it's not, you know, I mean,

1511
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:06,270
how is that what you're talking
about murderers and, and,

1512
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:09,340
and warmongers you're talking about
people that constantly engaged in the

1513
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:10,360
slaughter of people.

1514
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:13,480
Like why would it somehow or another
discredit them if they had gay sex?

1515
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:17,230
Like who gives a shit? But it is the
reality. The reality is like this,

1516
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:22,300
this picture of, it's a real depiction of
a, a real gladiator in a real young boy.

1517
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:23,990
And cause that shit was like super calm.

1518
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,820
Some people thought in that particular
age that the only true love that could

1519
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:30,670
exist was between a man and a young boy.

1520
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,360
That's unfortunately dow that
society chose to. I mean,

1521
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:38,440
you know that in other words has been
used in a lot of times I've seen to taint

1522
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:43,390
the uh, the arguments that are made
for, for, for gay rights and people say,

1523
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,990
oh well now they're going to want
children that had absolutely nothing to do

1524
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:47,530
with that.

1525
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:52,530
That's a different complete era of time
in which people didn't have adult hood

1526
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:57,430
defined the way we do now. And I think
that's the problem that that engages,

1527
01:25:57,431 --> 01:26:00,970
and I'm not being an apologist or
excusing it, it's just that when,

1528
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:05,570
let's say this, the 1200 you
know, you become an adult,

1529
01:26:05,571 --> 01:26:08,360
not when you're 18 years old.
You know,

1530
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:12,560
most people die when they were like 30
so if you're 18 you're damn near like the

1531
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:15,860
equivalent of like a
being a middle aged man.

1532
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,400
But if you think about it during
that particular very sparse,

1533
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:24,920
hey, that's not where
he's supposed to put that.

1534
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:30,750
What hasn't we put down your rock
real quick? This is called back mount.

1535
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:34,130
Obviously I'm, one of them is
muscular and the other one is not.

1536
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:37,310
Oh Brokeback Greek closing
on the guy on the bottom.

1537
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:42,320
Even back then they had tops and bottoms
because it's like one dude who just

1538
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:44,360
clearly is the one who's going
to get fucked every time.

1539
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,880
And the other dude is going
to do all the fucking,

1540
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:49,540
so you look at the guy on the bottom,
he's all smooth and shit.

1541
01:26:49,541 --> 01:26:53,630
It doesn't look that he does is sit ups,
doesn't do is squash the guy on top.

1542
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:56,990
It's very ripped. I think the guy
in the bottle is kind of dough

1543
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:04,400
that's tired, easy. The guy in
the bottom needs a lot of naps.

1544
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,760
Yo.

1545
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,330
But you couldn't have a movie like that
if you had a movie like that where you

1546
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:15,010
showed the true lives, the spark wasn't
able to grow with it, right? Yeah.

1547
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,740
But did they have a lot of gay sex
in that movie? No, not try Alexander.

1548
01:27:17,741 --> 01:27:20,870
I mean I was gay because Collin
Farrell was it. It was the,

1549
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:24,380
the lead him and whatever
the other dude was in there.

1550
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,660
And so let me ask you something.

1551
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,050
In the MMA where like you have your balls
and someone else's face and they're on

1552
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:32,780
the ground. Are you allowed to talk shit?
Are you allowed to talk shit like that?

1553
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:35,840
Absolutely. Jake, when
you're on the floor,

1554
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:38,660
if you want to fuck with the guy's head,
you could definitely do that.

1555
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,480
As long as they do a lot of that
shit. Oh yeah. There's some dudes,

1556
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:45,710
Nick Diaz talks mad shit during every one
of his fights. Everyone has his fights.

1557
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:48,110
You standing in front of people
going, what? Bitch? What? Beck? Boom.

1558
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:50,120
And then it pops you.
I'm fucking you up bitch.

1559
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,340
Like he'll talk shit to you while he's,
no,

1560
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:55,180
I don't mean that white frat boy
swag shit that they put before.

1561
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,910
I just mean like Mexican first one.
But I'm just saying,

1562
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,600
I know I picked that up on it. He has
came out. I'm just saying, you know,

1563
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:06,610
that's just what I hear. Oh, what's up
bitch? Screw this right now. Like, Oh,

1564
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:11,310
you know that men of costing in. That's
the way I see all the time with schools.

1565
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:13,850
When I, when I used to wipe out
my, my thing is this though,

1566
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,170
this is like an officer. We're talking
about an MMA fight we're talking about.

1567
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:23,060
Right. But I mean in terms of,
in terms of the sexual portion,

1568
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,240
I'm sure guys do. I'm sure
guys, fuck with guys. Look,

1569
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:28,550
if someone's gonna fuck with you
and try to get inside your head,

1570
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:33,070
they're going to try to do it by any
means necessary. There's no limit on that.

1571
01:28:33,071 --> 01:28:34,730
It like for example,
other sports,

1572
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:38,060
they have a limit to what they can
say and then they're like, oh no,

1573
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:39,030
this is like too,

1574
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,410
didn't they get in trouble on some shit
in the NBA when they were talking about

1575
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:45,640
somebody else's wife or you're
only allowed to say certain things.

1576
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:49,190
You're talking about somebody
else's kids ear. Like for example,

1577
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,290
in certain soccer leagues,

1578
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:54,310
you're not allowed to mention somebody
who's family or talk about racism like

1579
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:58,090
when you were in a scrum. I know the
football players are notorious for that.

1580
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:01,290
Saying the darkest,
most evil shit to someone on another team.

1581
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:05,100
I'm going to rape your babies. I'm like,
dude, you got to be a beautiful kid.

1582
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:07,860
I'm going to fuck his face right
after I pound you into the ground.

1583
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:11,100
Like dudes is without a
doubt said Shit like that.

1584
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:13,230
It's psychological war man.

1585
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,990
He does know cool,
but there's no,

1586
01:29:14,991 --> 01:29:19,340
but similar to some of the way some sports
regulated. Should it be regulated, Joe?

1587
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,080
No, no. It's free speech.

1588
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,740
Anything that you say it took your
house is on fire right now. Well,

1589
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:29,360
that's different. First of all, you're
saying in the middle of a fight,

1590
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,310
you can't. Yeah. You should be
able to say, your house is on fire.

1591
01:29:31,311 --> 01:29:33,500
How the fuck would you mom?
No, my house. Right. Or,

1592
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:36,710
you know what could your dick out of my
face? Stop Talking Shit about my house.

1593
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:41,020
What is this? Why don't you pull it
down so we could read it? I said,

1594
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:42,420
this is a New York Knicks.

1595
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:47,860
Camilio Anthony Carmelo is strange
from wife l law of whatever.

1596
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,200
What is it about,
what is it about putting this up?

1597
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:54,250
He pretty much said a comment
like when he was playing, I,

1598
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,320
your wife tastes like honey nut cheerios
and then getting in trouble for that.

1599
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:03,410
You know, it's funny.
Melo was, let's be honest,

1600
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,830
pretty mellow was waiting
for him apparently. Um,

1601
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:12,440
like uh, where they go to the
walk to the bus, like right there.

1602
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:15,920
He was supposedly waiting for him. Oh
look, he's going to kick his ass. I mean,

1603
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:19,200
again, they were both on the same
team together as different teams,

1604
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:20,660
different things. Well, you know,

1605
01:30:20,661 --> 01:30:22,520
that's a choice he's going
to have to make on his own.

1606
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:28,720
Yeah. Listen, I need that chair.

1607
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,540
It's interesting to talk shit.
It's part of it look

1608
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:35,740
like that.
You're clearly an asshole.

1609
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,770
You clearly a piece of shit as a human
being and if you willing to be a piece of

1610
01:30:38,771 --> 01:30:43,540
shit as a human being just for, you know,
just to win, you can win without that.

1611
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,630
You went without that and be healthier.
You know, especially fighting,

1612
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:50,710
you know the odds of you really getting
inside a dude's head and causing them to

1613
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,320
do somethings, going to make them lose
the fight. They're fucking professionals,

1614
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:56,830
man. Those are the dudes who are really
good. Stop Brian. Stop putting shit up.

1615
01:30:56,920 --> 01:31:00,580
Distracting. But isn't it the dudes
that are winning, man, there's,

1616
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,820
there's fucking Samurais.
They know what the fuck they're doing it.

1617
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,200
But wouldn't the professionals know what

1618
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,950
to say to get into someone's
head? No, no, no, no, no, no.

1619
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:11,290
Isn't that a part of warfare? No, it's
a lot of guys are not good at all.

1620
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:15,540
Like mystery writers ever. Misdirection
distraction. Yeah, of course.

1621
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:18,930
You have the silent warrior now you're,
yeah. You're the one who's romanticizing.

1622
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,250
No, no, no. Here.

1623
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,700
Who will just sit there praying and some
Buddhist temple until he gets up like

1624
01:31:23,701 --> 01:31:27,090
Ken and Raju and goes and beats the shit
out of his opponent and then fly back

1625
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:28,560
to Thailand so they can send them to that,

1626
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:31,650
that fake statue and fights
the got later. No, I mean dude,

1627
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:33,210
he's going to say some
fucked up shit in your ear.

1628
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:35,580
No, you're wrong. This is
why you're wrong. Okay.

1629
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,040
The greatest fighters almost
always are martial artists,

1630
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,120
like real martial artists.

1631
01:31:39,121 --> 01:31:42,600
The guys like George Saint Pierre and
the guy's like Leo Machida, these guys,

1632
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:44,550
they're not shit talkers ever at all.

1633
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:47,280
They followed by the true martial arts
principles and it's one of the reasons

1634
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:49,870
why they're so good.
They don't carry the burden of Shit.

1635
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:54,290
Talking what a guy like Chael Sonnen
talking mad shit before a fight. Look,

1636
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,670
Shayle Kann obviously back it up.
He's obviously a very good fighter,

1637
01:31:56,671 --> 01:31:58,080
but make no mistake about it.

1638
01:31:58,081 --> 01:32:03,070
There's a tremendous on him because of
that shit talking on top of the fact that

1639
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:06,550
he's got to fight. That is an extra
opponent that you have inside the octagon,

1640
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:09,820
knowing that if you lose my God,
you're going to look like a fucking idiot.

1641
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:14,920
That shit is real and it's an enemy.
And it is also enforcing the ego,

1642
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:15,873
which is,

1643
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,170
it has to be left out as much as possible
in any situation where you're dealing

1644
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:24,820
with extreme pressure because
it shows character, cracks,

1645
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:27,880
cracks. But then what about, what
about a guy like Muhammad Ali?

1646
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,880
Muhammad Ali was a brilliant,
a brilliant boxer,

1647
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:35,050
and he was a brilliant sportsman and he
figured out how to get inside a lot of

1648
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:36,370
people's heads and defeat them,

1649
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,170
but he would have been able to do
that just by boxing them. Look,

1650
01:32:39,190 --> 01:32:41,980
it was beautiful what he did because
it was entertaining for all of us.

1651
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,880
And by doing that, he also called a
tremendous amount of attention to himself.

1652
01:32:45,881 --> 01:32:50,170
But you know what I think he
did was a form of extreme.

1653
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:55,171
The extreme braggadocious nature of the
way he would talk was so obvious that it

1654
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:59,260
was almost like theater. Like
Howard Cosell said to him,
champions seem truculent.

1655
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,240
He goes, whatever. Does
it mean if it's good,

1656
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:06,241
I'm that like just that somebody in
somebody's ear saying whatever you want to

1657
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:08,800
say to him.
You know,

1658
01:33:08,801 --> 01:33:13,180
and if you want you s you see him doing
that at that particular time. Sure is.

1659
01:33:13,181 --> 01:33:14,980
People wouldn't think he's wrong for that,

1660
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:18,790
but someone would think that someone
who's talking shit on a football field

1661
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:23,050
saying reckless things about someone
else's family, they're row. Oh well wait,

1662
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:26,820
first of all, people definitely thought
he was wrong for that. I'm not saying,

1663
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,840
do you think he's wrong for that? No, I
don't think anybody's wrong for anything.

1664
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:33,820
I told you I think you should be able
to talk mad shit on the football.

1665
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:37,010
But you said that people who do that
are a Douche bag cause he comes back.

1666
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,160
Oh yeah. He was definitely
a Douche bag of Joe Frazier.

1667
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:42,790
He was 100% of Douche bag of Joe Frazier.
He used to bring a gorilla,

1668
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:46,540
a rubber gorilla during the time
of the fifties and sixties rather,

1669
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,910
w where you're, you're dealing
with this. When they grew up,

1670
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:54,330
Ali and Frazier grew up during the
worst racial time in all of history and

1671
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,070
Muhammad Ali in this,
the history of this country,

1672
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:59,700
60 was probably worse than that.
It's pretty bad. But I mean,

1673
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:03,550
as far as like the turn of the times,

1674
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:08,280
they're dealing with Martin Luther
King, The d, The all the race riots.

1675
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,490
And then you're also dealing with
a new medium, which is television,

1676
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:16,210
and you're dealing with this face
that is not only is this guy a,

1677
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,100
an incredibly controversial figure,

1678
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:22,030
but this guy was also a black African
American who doesn't want to fight in

1679
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,140
Vietnam War,

1680
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:28,120
and he's holding up a gorilla and he's
calling Joe Frazier, an uncle Tom,

1681
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:32,230
and he's hitting this gorilla doll
saying that he's a big ugly gorilla.

1682
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:37,150
Joe Frazier, and he's setting Joe
Frazier up to be like this, this,

1683
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:41,980
this uncle Tom with the white man
champion. That doesn't question anything.

1684
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:46,600
Well, he's, I mean, he savaged that guy's
reputation to destroyed that guy's mind.

1685
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:50,590
He hate Joe Frazier hated him forever
and they could have just fought.

1686
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,540
They could have just fought, you know,
they could have just did. He could've,

1687
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,210
he could've left all that
racist shit out of there.

1688
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,620
It could have left all that uncle
Tom Shit. Either he chose to do that.

1689
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:01,670
Was he a douchebag? Look, man, I'm just
an observer watching a guy live his life.

1690
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,400
But he was definitely a Douche bag of
Joe Frazier and Joe Frazier was pretty

1691
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:04,971
open about it.

1692
01:35:04,971 --> 01:35:08,180
He hated that motherfucker for a long
time because of that shit used to make fun

1693
01:35:08,181 --> 01:35:11,540
of him even when he had like Parkinson's
and all the other shit about that.

1694
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:15,500
Oh yeah, yeah. Joe Frazier, he taunted
Muhammad Ali's shaking and all that stuff.

1695
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:18,890
I mean he, he was, he was upset
for a long ass fucking time and he,

1696
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,100
when he knocked Muhammad Ali Down with
that left Hook and won that fight,

1697
01:35:22,101 --> 01:35:23,480
that first fight,
make no mistake about,

1698
01:35:23,481 --> 01:35:25,850
a lot of people were fucking
happy than Muhammad Ali.

1699
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:30,851
The draft dodging black man who talks
all that shit got beat and lost his title

1700
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:34,190
to the guy who's like a
good family man who, who,

1701
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:37,750
you know goes to church allegedly a,
he's a fighter. He's a fucking who,

1702
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:40,070
they're all crazy, every, every
fight. It's crazy. You know,

1703
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:42,580
you're fucking throwing bones
at a man for a living, you know,

1704
01:35:42,581 --> 01:35:44,120
it's a nutty way to get by.

1705
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:49,070
But he was the preferable one cause he
was much more humble and wasn't this guy,

1706
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,740
you know, well shook up the
world. He wasn't that guy. He was,

1707
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:55,310
he was a different guy. It
was just a tough guy from
the streets of Philadelphia.

1708
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:58,610
So it totally different situation.
But people definitely hated,

1709
01:35:58,611 --> 01:36:01,640
I'll leave because of his talking shit.
They always hate guys who are confident.

1710
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,040
There's always going to be people that
want a chip you down when you have that

1711
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:08,270
con gone. Flint is Anderson
Silva coming back. Who knows man,

1712
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:12,190
or it's a hard injury to come back
from you. Tell me, is he going well,

1713
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,470
I don't know. Any prediction
you, you know, I wouldn't
have no idea. First of all,

1714
01:36:15,471 --> 01:36:19,160
I'm not a doctor. Second of all, I
don't know what's going on in his head.

1715
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:19,641
You know,

1716
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:24,641
you get the psychology of a guy who loses
twice in devastating fashion like that

1717
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:29,750
once by catastrophic injury in a
fight. The weeds, quite honestly,

1718
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:31,590
losing your boss the
first round and a pretty,

1719
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,660
he was losing that fight in a big way
that first round and that guy was gaining

1720
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:38,320
on him. That guy's scary guy,
that Chris Weidman, he's just,

1721
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:41,510
he's a fucking beast and
he beat Anderson twice.

1722
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:44,720
I saw some videos of him fighting other
people. He's a monster. He's a monster.

1723
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:45,110
He's,

1724
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:49,610
he's a really tough wrestler who grew up
getting his ass kicked by his brothers.

1725
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,410
Those are the most
dangerous motherfuckers.

1726
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:55,010
Those the youngest kids have
a family full of savages.

1727
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:57,920
Dad was like a pro football player,
all stud athletes,

1728
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,900
house full of Stud athlete Dudes,

1729
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,970
you have to be tough as fuck
to be the young brother.

1730
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,810
But they probably broke a bone of his
or her to grow around the metal plate on

1731
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:06,051
his head.

1732
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:09,960
He was relaying all the different times
he was bullied by his brothers and what

1733
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:10,700
happened they,

1734
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:14,060
they created a guy who gives zero
fucks and we'll punch your face in.

1735
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:15,260
I mean that's what it is.

1736
01:37:15,261 --> 01:37:17,840
And Anderson Silva just couldn't
hang with that two times in a row.

1737
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,080
We call over showboating and all that
stuff aside was showboating the first time

1738
01:37:22,081 --> 01:37:23,630
and during the first fight and it was,

1739
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:26,630
but one of the reasons why your show
buttons cause he was getting smashed when

1740
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:27,464
he took him down.

1741
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:31,040
He wanted Weidman to keep that fight
standing where he has the best advantage

1742
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,270
cause he took Weidman,

1743
01:37:32,271 --> 01:37:35,390
took Anderson to the ground early in
the first round and hit him with some

1744
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:39,440
vicious ground and past stung him,
roll his eyes back in his head.

1745
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,480
He hit him with a couple hard shots.

1746
01:37:41,481 --> 01:37:45,980
One very clean right hand that without
a doubt Anderson saw some sparks without

1747
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:49,010
a doubt, and he knew that that
was a real dangerous position.

1748
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:51,020
He couldn't hold this
guy back for very long.

1749
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:54,860
Holding onto him on the ground is tough.
He's too strong, it's too good of a,

1750
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,370
and he hits too hard.

1751
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:59,070
So his best chance was to get
this guy to stand up with him.

1752
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:01,170
So he started getting cocky with them,
talking shit,

1753
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:03,060
trying to get into his head and that's,

1754
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:07,260
that's what it actually cost him would
cost him was him not fighting like a

1755
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:11,880
martial artist was him being like a guy
trying to play psychological warfare

1756
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,250
instead of just fighting
with perfect technique.

1757
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:17,510
He got the guy to stand up with him.
If he can keep that fight standing,

1758
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,650
he should have the advantage.
He's much faster.

1759
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:22,620
His technique is about as good
as it gets in all the land.

1760
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:26,450
There's no better stand up striking
techniques in Anderson Silva's, but in,

1761
01:38:26,451 --> 01:38:28,830
in goading,
that guy into an ego battle,

1762
01:38:28,831 --> 01:38:31,260
he took some chances and
then you got cracked.

1763
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:35,250
So I don't know if he's coming back,
man. Those are two big losses, you know,

1764
01:38:35,251 --> 01:38:37,590
I mean,
he says he's not in,

1765
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:42,510
he's towards the end of his career, not
towards the beginning allegedly. Right.

1766
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,580
You know,
some guys can stretch that shit out.

1767
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:48,120
What's crazy is guys like Bernard Hopkins
who are 10 years older than him and

1768
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,030
Bernard Hopkins has one of the
light heavyweight titles in boxing.

1769
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:54,780
He's the 175 pound champion and
he's almost 50 years old. I mean,

1770
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:55,950
no one's ever done that before,

1771
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:59,550
but Bernard Hopkins fights
exactly the opposite of Anderson.

1772
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:04,080
He's very safety technique oriented.
If you watch how Bernard fights,

1773
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:08,160
he's a master.
I license a master with his footwork.

1774
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,730
He's a master of positioning.
He's always in a good place.

1775
01:39:11,731 --> 01:39:13,170
You're always in a bad place.

1776
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,920
He's just been around for so long and he
knows how to get guys out of their head,

1777
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,010
but the way he gets guys out of their
head is he's, he fights rough with them.

1778
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:23,970
He gets dirty with them. He pulls on
their heads a lot. He leans on them. He,

1779
01:39:23,980 --> 01:39:26,280
he fights rough.
If it's real rough and hill,

1780
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:29,580
he'll force a boxer to get
into his clinch wars with him.

1781
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:32,390
Almost like an MMA fight where
he wears the guy's arms out,

1782
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:34,620
makes them too tired of
punch and then you know,

1783
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:37,860
I mean he did that to a lot of dudes.
He did that to Felix Trinidad.

1784
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:40,170
He Fuck Felix Trinidad.
I remember that fight.

1785
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:41,610
A lot of people didn't see him winning.

1786
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:43,780
Who's an unstuck flag and all that.

1787
01:39:43,781 --> 01:39:47,530
You know they had a green light on him
in New York back in the day. Yo Man,

1788
01:39:47,531 --> 01:39:50,340
Puerto Ricans were like, Yo, the
green light on that again, they were,

1789
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,820
they were literally going
to put like a spirit.

1790
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:56,380
That was hard when he came up here.
He, he squashed all that apparently.

1791
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:59,770
I don't know how,
but I just let it know.

1792
01:39:59,771 --> 01:40:01,960
Once upon a time it was very real.

1793
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:06,550
And then when back in the nineties
if you had beef with a Puerto Rican,

1794
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,930
you had beef with a million of them.
They were not.

1795
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:13,450
It was the 2010 he fuck Tito Trinidad.
I don't remember the exact year, but no,

1796
01:40:13,451 --> 01:40:17,440
it was like two it was like literally
2000 all right. Was it leaking into that?

1797
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:20,840
Remember the Jerry Seinfeld thing?
He had beef with the Puerto Rican.

1798
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:23,350
What was that only Seinfeld Dude?
Yeah. What was it over? It was,

1799
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:27,430
it was over the PR parade. Like th they,
they had like an episode where they like,

1800
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:29,160
you didn't make it in front
of the parade or level.

1801
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:33,520
They then people were calling it racist
and all this other stuff. But yeah,

1802
01:40:33,521 --> 01:40:36,070
it's side. He had to squash the
beef with the Puerto Rican dude

1803
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:40,450
right after September 11th it
was actually September 29th,

1804
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:44,260
2001 the Madison Square Garden.
Crazy. Yeah. He stepped on the flight.

1805
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:45,400
He apologized afterwards.

1806
01:40:45,401 --> 01:40:49,690
He said they actually had to move it
because it was supposed to be September

1807
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:52,990
15th and that was right after September
11th so there was a Madison Square

1808
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:56,540
Garden. Yup. And so they moved it
to September 29th wow. That's crazy.

1809
01:40:56,541 --> 01:40:58,810
And he beat the shit out of
Felix Trinidad. That was,

1810
01:40:58,811 --> 01:41:02,560
I remember that fight boxing performance
masterful. No, I remember that fight.

1811
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:03,610
It was genius.

1812
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:08,320
And then he fought Kelly Pavlick and that
was another genius performance. I mean,

1813
01:41:08,321 --> 01:41:10,840
that was another fight where was a
dangerous fight against a real knockout

1814
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:14,880
puncher and just puck circles around
that kid. He's just so technical, man.

1815
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:18,100
So who's gonna,
who's gonna fight the Wiedemann Dude now?

1816
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:22,660
Well is gonna Fight Vitor Belfort. Yeah.
Yeah. That's an interesting fight. Well,

1817
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:26,590
it's also interesting because there's a
real controversy regarding testosterone

1818
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:31,591
use because Vito has a testosterone
use exemption and he's been fighting in

1819
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:34,360
Brazil,
apparently has low testosterone.

1820
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:39,160
So they give them the license to
take testosterone like all the time.

1821
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:43,150
So he's essentially taking hormones,
taking male hormones,

1822
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,770
and Weidman is not,

1823
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,640
so Weidman is fighting completely
naturally with no enhancement whatsoever.

1824
01:41:48,641 --> 01:41:52,790
Just being a young guy
with normal [inaudible] see
limits and all, all kinds of,

1825
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,480
maybe, I don't know what it
uses. Some guys don't use shit.

1826
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:58,150
There's some guys that fight in the
UFC that don't use a god damn thing.

1827
01:41:58,151 --> 01:42:00,730
They just eat healthy food and
drink a lot of water. And that's it.

1828
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,720
There's quite a few guys
who do that. Right. Um,

1829
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:07,330
some guys take a variety of different
muscle enhancing supplements. You know,

1830
01:42:07,331 --> 01:42:09,970
there's like testosterone
boosters that are legal.

1831
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:12,790
Like there's a one that on
its cells called t plus shown,

1832
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:17,050
the people like weightlifters were showing
that it's a increased their ability

1833
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:21,220
to lift weights in double blind placebo
studies where you're not using, you know,

1834
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,620
using essentially a giant group of people.

1835
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:26,800
They don't know what they're using and
the people that were using t plus got

1836
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:29,890
higher, uh, higher improvement
in their, their weightlifting.

1837
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:32,740
So there's a few things that you can do,
but for the most part,

1838
01:42:32,741 --> 01:42:35,620
most of the guys that get on it,
they get on the synthetic form,

1839
01:42:35,621 --> 01:42:38,170
they get an a on a synthetic
form of testosterone.

1840
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:41,170
So this is like a few different
t plus and there's a couple,

1841
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:45,010
there's a couple of other test boosters
and there's a few routes that are

1842
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:49,420
supposed to work. Like tribulus is
supposed to have us a small effect.

1843
01:42:49,421 --> 01:42:51,430
Then there's some, there's
another, what does it,

1844
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:54,220
Long Jack cat or something like that.
I forget.

1845
01:42:54,221 --> 01:42:56,800
There's another one that's supposed
to have some sort of an effect.

1846
01:42:56,801 --> 01:42:58,000
But for the most part,

1847
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:03,180
it doesn't have any where near the effect
that actually taking testosterone will

1848
01:43:03,311 --> 01:43:08,290
have. So there's guys take it and Vitor
is taking it and they're, they uh,

1849
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,590
there's a dispute as to whether or not
he's going to get licensed in Las Vegas.

1850
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:15,010
And if he doesn't get
licensed to use testosterone,

1851
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,950
then he has to get off of the
testosterone and then fight Wyman.

1852
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:19,900
And if that happens,
man,

1853
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:22,780
that's going to be really fascinating
because his hormone levels are going to be

1854
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:25,880
all fucked up. If he's
used to taking a, an,

1855
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:29,000
an extra natural form of testosterone,

1856
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:31,990
injecting it into a system
and then you stopped doing it,

1857
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:35,740
his body's going to have a much lower
level of testosterone in his training

1858
01:43:35,741 --> 01:43:39,240
camps.
Then even normally a regular human being,

1859
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,350
but he would have a much
lower will drop off. Yeah.

1860
01:43:41,351 --> 01:43:43,390
Because his body's been used
to getting it externally.

1861
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:47,290
His body's not producing it anymore.
So it's really interesting.

1862
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:47,980
You don't have to,

1863
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:50,980
they'll have to kickstart his body's
production of testosterone, which is like,

1864
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:55,190
wow, that's crazy. So it's, it's,
it's controversial in that respect.

1865
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:58,640
But skill wise it's a very
dangerous fight for both guys.

1866
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:02,900
Weidman is a fucking beast, but God Damn
Vito Belfort looks scary as shit. Lately.

1867
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,720
He took out Dan Henderson in
the first round, he took out,

1868
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,690
you mean he took him out in a way that
no one's ever taken Dan Henderson out

1869
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:12,470
like that is his striking is horrific.
It's very,

1870
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:17,260
actually I went to, uh, like a
mixed martial arts competition,

1871
01:44:17,261 --> 01:44:20,530
but like it was like a local one that one
of my friends was supposed to fight in.

1872
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:23,020
Um, but he got injured and
so he didn't find at the end,

1873
01:44:23,021 --> 01:44:26,010
but I ended up watching it and it was
actually pretty interesting. It was in a,

1874
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:30,190
it was like in Long Island. Um,
and it was like a small gym.

1875
01:44:30,330 --> 01:44:33,490
It was full of like a few hundred people.
But it was really interesting.

1876
01:44:33,491 --> 01:44:38,491
Like I saw the difference in kind of how
they run those local spots and now I've

1877
01:44:39,791 --> 01:44:42,040
never actually been to one
of those big MMA things.

1878
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:44,670
Tell me when you want to go, man, I'll
hook it up. Tell me when you want to go.

1879
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:49,860
You heard it. You heard it here.
You just give me a day. Good.

1880
01:44:49,861 --> 01:44:51,940
Just tell me which one you want
to go, then we'll hook it up. No,

1881
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:56,580
I definitely want to see it
on February 22nd holy Shit.

1882
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,220
That's my birthday weekend,
Vegas. There it is.

1883
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:06,240
Oh, you're planning on doing
this. This is what he's feeling.

1884
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:10,350
That's the feeling you get when
you're anticipating a hangover.

1885
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,910
That's what you just did. Do you, what's
the one after that just in case? Well,

1886
01:45:14,911 --> 01:45:16,720
there's a big one in Dallas after that.

1887
01:45:16,721 --> 01:45:20,280
A huge one that's for the welterweight
title and it's a Dallas Cowboy stadium,

1888
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:24,510
so that's, that's a gigantic event.
That one, if you want that one, uh,

1889
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:29,220
I'll give you the exact date of
that. That is, that's in March.

1890
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:31,590
I think it's march.
I want to say 15th but hold on a second.

1891
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:35,010
I'll tell you in one second.
Yeah. Is it March 15th yeah. Yeah.

1892
01:45:35,011 --> 01:45:39,930
That one is going to be gigantic.
That is 50,000 people, man in,

1893
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:41,760
in Dallas at Dallas Cowboy stadium.

1894
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:44,270
That's probably the best one to go
to cause that's going to be historic.

1895
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:45,420
And the title fight.
Yeah,

1896
01:45:45,421 --> 01:45:48,640
there'll be a new new crowning of the
welterweight championship because, uh,

1897
01:45:48,690 --> 01:45:52,410
George stepped down. George Saint Pierre
stepped down. And so the guy who am,

1898
01:45:52,411 --> 01:45:55,860
I thought one the decision,
Johny Hendricks. I thought
it was a bad decision.

1899
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,600
And I'm a huge George Saint Pierre Fan,

1900
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,460
by the way of him as a
person and as a fighter.

1901
01:45:59,461 --> 01:46:03,150
But I thought it with all honesty,
that the decision was incorrect.

1902
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,800
I thought Johnny went
through rounds to two.

1903
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:06,540
So he's going to take on Robbie Lawler.

1904
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:11,310
So that'll be the new UFC welterweight
champion. Dude, you got to come to that.

1905
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:15,600
So he vacated the title and now they're
gonna they're gonna brawl out. Yes.

1906
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:18,870
And there's also Carlos condit
was fighting Tyron Woodley,

1907
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:24,030
which is fucking madness and chaos.
That's going to be an insane fight.

1908
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:27,270
That's an insane, insane fight.
There's a lot of insane fights.

1909
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:31,530
Diego Sanchez fight and miles jury.
That is a great fucking fight.

1910
01:46:31,531 --> 01:46:33,990
Miles jury is a beast.
Real tough young kid.

1911
01:46:33,991 --> 01:46:37,770
And Diego Sanchez is this
definition of the word savage.

1912
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:43,410
This Cuban motherfucker, Hector Lombard.
You ever seen him fight a whole shit?

1913
01:46:43,411 --> 01:46:47,520
Is He scary? I heard of him.
God dammit. He's a monster.

1914
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:52,290
He's a monster dude.
A an Olympic judoka judo specialist who,

1915
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:55,470
who doesn't even use his grappling
just knocks people to fuck out.

1916
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:58,470
He's a super athlete and um,
yeah,

1917
01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:01,410
he just fought Nate Marquardt and put
them away in the first round in the a

1918
01:47:01,411 --> 01:47:03,180
mugging and Nate,
Mark Schwartz,

1919
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:07,170
the former Strikeforce champion and
lumbar just mugged him at one 70.

1920
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,030
He's terrifying.
He thought his whole career,

1921
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:13,590
one 85 is the Bella to champion at 185
pounds, but dropped down to one 70.

1922
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,060
And he's just like a muscle.

1923
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:19,230
I mean the dude is like 6%
body fat and just shredded,

1924
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:23,880
shredded spring of just courted steel.
And he says,

1925
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:27,450
everybody's has tried to get the fuck
away from him. Just throwing bombs at you.

1926
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:31,540
The,
the move did a Wiedemann made vitamins,

1927
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:36,170
Weidman part to, to uh, the weed
man. That's when we'll call it.

1928
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:39,390
You don't weed man homie.
I'm not going to say that he's heard this.

1929
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,410
I'm sure he's heard it a million times.
You know,

1930
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:45,030
people called me that before I
break their fucking legs, homie.

1931
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:47,550
He wouldn't say that. He's a super
nice guy now. He probably is.

1932
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,160
Most things that I know that really,
really got it like that.

1933
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,420
They don't have a star problems.

1934
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:53,850
They just wait to the problems come to
them and they take care of him and they

1935
01:47:53,851 --> 01:47:56,340
keep it moving. Well the guy he's
fighting a super nice guy too.

1936
01:47:56,490 --> 01:48:00,750
Carlos condit is fighting this guy.
Jake shields is a Jujitsu black belt,

1937
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:04,110
so world class grappler. So it's
a real, real interesting guy.

1938
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:07,410
Just beat Woodley in his last fight.
So it's a very interesting,

1939
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:09,520
very interesting fight.
And what about this, uh,

1940
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:13,440
who's going to fight a Jon and Jon Jones?
Jon Jones is going to fight.

1941
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:17,130
He's gonna fight in Baltimore and
he's gonna fight Glover to sharer.

1942
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:21,630
Who's the scariest motherfucker?
All the 205 pound contenders.

1943
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,750
Glover is the fucking
devil. He's scary. He's,

1944
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:29,550
everybody knows that Glover was
on the sidelines for six months.

1945
01:48:29,551 --> 01:48:33,570
He had a visa issue and he couldn't get
to the United States and he was fucking

1946
01:48:33,571 --> 01:48:37,050
people up in small shows cause he was one
to chuck Adele's training partners and

1947
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:41,670
he has been world class like top of
the food chain worldclass for almost a

1948
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:43,410
decade now like Soca Jew before.

1949
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:46,440
So could you make this big splash
and pride was knocking, knocked out,

1950
01:48:46,441 --> 01:48:50,600
little nog knocked out Ricardo Arona
before he did that glow over to sheriff

1951
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:54,630
fucked him up in the WEC.
But Glover had visa issues.

1952
01:48:55,170 --> 01:49:00,030
So for six years everybody
knew that Glover was like
having real problems trying

1953
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:04,290
to fight in America but he's fighting in
Brazil and just beaten the fucking shit

1954
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:07,170
out of people. Man. He's a
beast. What was the visa issue?

1955
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,880
He was resilient and sometimes you know,
you have an issue getting a um, the,

1956
01:49:11,881 --> 01:49:14,460
the visa to fight American money.
He didn't have the money,

1957
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:16,200
he wasn't fighting for the UFC back then.

1958
01:49:16,201 --> 01:49:18,840
He was fighting for a smaller
organizations and you know,

1959
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:21,300
you got to have a visa before
the UFC can even sign you.

1960
01:49:21,301 --> 01:49:25,720
It's funny because we were going to
have a discussion later on today. Um,

1961
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,070
Dan and like chunking,

1962
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:31,950
we wouldn't have a talk about immigration
and we were discussing this specific

1963
01:49:31,951 --> 01:49:35,310
issue about, um, they were saying,
oh, you know, it's the law. The,

1964
01:49:35,311 --> 01:49:38,130
all the critics are saying, oh, it's
the, the law has to be enforced.

1965
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,940
It's not just the law, it's the law for
poor people. Because when you're rich,

1966
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:46,941
apparently some of my friends who are
lawyers that handle immigration cases,

1967
01:49:47,411 --> 01:49:48,100
they'll tell me straight

1968
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,910
up, no, listen,

1969
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:53,230
there are rich families from places in
Asia and the Middle East that when they

1970
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:55,840
want to come here, they buy
a green card. And I was like,

1971
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:58,690
what do you mean by a green
card and lower, it wasn't rich.

1972
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,580
They set up a company in order to,

1973
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:06,160
to employ certain people here it has to
be a certain way. It's like 200, $300,000.

1974
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:07,780
And when they pay into it,

1975
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:11,140
they immediately are given green cards
to manage the business here as long as

1976
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:14,560
they employ a certain amount of
Americans. But like you say, you know,

1977
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:16,920
he probably just didn't have
the people backing him up. Yeah,

1978
01:50:16,921 --> 01:50:20,830
you got to have mad cash to buy or you
make a fake company in order to get green

1979
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:23,360
cards, but it can be
done. We had $1,000. Look,

1980
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:28,440
if you are really wealthy man from Iceland
and you wanted to come to America and

1981
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:31,960
get a green card, I'm sure it could
be arranged. And someone, you know,

1982
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:35,590
guys got a billion Coonara in
front of your money is, you know,

1983
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:38,740
whatever their money is over there.
But my friend Glover,

1984
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:42,820
this a guy who is going to be fighting
Jon Jones who also, uh, um, I,

1985
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:46,380
I'm actually friends with John Jones.
I love that guy. That's a tough fight.

1986
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:49,140
Tough fight for both guys.
Glow Glover is a beast,

1987
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,600
but Jon Jones is a God damn freak athlete.

1988
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:54,620
He's a freak and I think Jon
Jones is going to be old.

1989
01:50:54,621 --> 01:50:58,320
Tra motivated for this fight. I
felt like he, he learned something.

1990
01:50:58,321 --> 01:51:01,740
His last title defense was a tough
fight against Gustafson who's a beast.

1991
01:51:01,741 --> 01:51:04,380
It was a great, great fight.
Really, really close fight.

1992
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:07,110
John One that decision and I think,
you know,

1993
01:51:07,111 --> 01:51:10,440
really realize he was in a
war and his bearing down,

1994
01:51:10,441 --> 01:51:13,200
he's saying all the right things and I
think he's going to try to look to put on

1995
01:51:13,201 --> 01:51:16,920
a show against this clover cat.
But Glover is scary as fuck, man.

1996
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:20,010
What are they going to fight? They're
going to find in Baltimore in April.

1997
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:24,000
Glow over puts people to sleep, man.
He puts people to sleep with one punch.

1998
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:26,430
He fought Ryan Bader and
Ryan Bader heard him,

1999
01:51:26,431 --> 01:51:30,840
Ryan Bader tagged him and wobbled him.
And as Ryan Bader moved into closest show,

2000
01:51:30,841 --> 01:51:34,620
Glover to share shut his fucking
lights off. He's a monster man.

2001
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,060
He's been around a long ass
time and he hits fucking hard.

2002
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:40,470
We had his trainer,

2003
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:45,150
John Hackleman was on the podcast and he
was talking about holding the myths for

2004
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:49,590
this dude. And he's like,
he hits you different. He's
like, Hackleman by the way,

2005
01:51:49,591 --> 01:51:51,000
was a kickboxing champion.

2006
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:56,120
Motherfuckers been around since the
70s doing karate and Campo and he's,

2007
01:51:57,031 --> 01:51:59,160
he's seen it all.
And then some,

2008
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:02,450
and he talks about Glover's like in
this fucking guy hits you. You're like,

2009
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:06,570
you feel the knuckles through your hand,
like you're holding the pads for him.

2010
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:08,790
He's like, I've never felt
it like that. He goes,

2011
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:12,780
I've never had anybody punched me that
hard. He goes, not chocked, not anybody.

2012
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:16,650
And he goes, chuck is up murderous
puncher. This guy punches even harder.

2013
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:20,670
He's like, it's like ridiculous. Like Mike
Tyson style, punching power. He's like,

2014
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,480
he, if he hits you, you're fucked.
And he did that to Ryan Bader.

2015
01:52:24,481 --> 01:52:27,300
Ryan Bader tagged him.
I don't wobbled and covering up.

2016
01:52:27,301 --> 01:52:32,130
And Ryan Bader moved in for the kill and
clover just [inaudible] just dropped a

2017
01:52:32,131 --> 01:52:35,250
haymaker on and he see his eyes
go sideways and his legs give out

2018
01:52:35,850 --> 01:52:38,250
motherfucking. It's hard.
Recently, I forget who it was,

2019
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:41,100
but one person was really wearing
down in his mouth, fuck his leg.

2020
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:42,510
He was just working on the leg,

2021
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,150
beating the shit out of
his leg and then does

2022
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:50,680
hit him with the overhand right.
She knocked dude out. Mike.

2023
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,670
Well this has been a few of those,
you know,

2024
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:56,150
it was at a kickboxing match or was
it a MMA fight? It was an MMA fight.

2025
01:52:56,270 --> 01:53:00,710
Was it the UFC? I believe so. It
might've been a Edson Barboza.

2026
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:04,880
Edson Barboza is one of the most scary
guys when it comes to a leg kicks in the

2027
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:07,130
UFC. He's one of the,
uh, the top lightweights.

2028
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,580
He's actually fighting Donald Serone
that's coming up soon. Caught. Damn.

2029
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:11,780
That's kind of be a good buck.

2030
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:15,450
I guess it's the American Airlines
Center jail there a lot of good. Okay.

2031
01:53:15,770 --> 01:53:20,510
Is there a lot of gambling
at these events? Oh yeah.
In Vegas on 100%. The one,

2032
01:53:20,511 --> 01:53:24,110
if you want to come to the,
uh, Vito Belfort, Chris
Weidman fight, that's in May,

2033
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:28,340
that's May 24th. If you want to come
to that, that's going to be in Vegas.

2034
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:32,750
And I just hope they see if they don't
give Vitara testosterone use exemption.

2035
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:37,130
I mean, I understand what everybody says.
It's not fair. I understand the logic,

2036
01:53:37,131 --> 01:53:38,990
but if they don't give it to him,

2037
01:53:39,070 --> 01:53:43,610
he really shouldn't be fighting for the
title unless he can get his hormones

2038
01:53:43,611 --> 01:53:47,330
back in order. I, if it's been taking
testosterone for a long period of time,

2039
01:53:47,331 --> 01:53:50,840
I don't understand how his body's just
going to start magically producing it

2040
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:53,990
again on its own unless they figure out
something that they could give him that

2041
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:56,870
will kickstart is production of
testosterone. But if that's the case,

2042
01:53:56,990 --> 01:54:00,290
shouldn't have been doing that in the
first place. So I don't know. I mean,

2043
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:02,090
if the guy really does need testosterone,

2044
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:04,160
I hope they give it to
them because if they don't,

2045
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:07,040
he's not going to really be able to fight.
Right.

2046
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:10,160
Not to the same level that he's going
to be able to fight if he's on it.

2047
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:10,900
Honestly.

2048
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:15,900
But wasn't my Tyson taking like pills or
mood on him pills when he fought Lennox

2049
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:18,930
Lewis away, he told me this story.
They said things on antidepressants.

2050
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:23,240
He was taking some sort of medication.
Yeah, that's happened before. Um,

2051
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:28,280
guys kiss on his cheek and all. He's
trying to be nice to him. He said,

2052
01:54:28,281 --> 01:54:32,090
I love you. He said, I love Edm Ma. You
know, not to make fun of Mike Tyson.

2053
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:36,020
You know, he's a monster even now. But
I'm just saying when I look at that,

2054
01:54:36,021 --> 01:54:38,810
I'm like, all right, how could he
not have been affected by that?

2055
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:42,560
And you are mood altering drugs and now
they're asking you to fight for your

2056
01:54:42,561 --> 01:54:43,100
life.

2057
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:47,090
And then at the end of it you put a flower
and then it goes hair and then kissed

2058
01:54:47,091 --> 01:54:50,510
him on the cheek. Yeah. I don't know
what he was on when he fought Lennox,

2059
01:54:50,511 --> 01:54:55,010
but I wouldn't be surprised man.
He was high on drugs during major fights.

2060
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:57,350
He definitely said that,
that he was a,

2061
01:54:57,351 --> 01:55:01,330
he was doing coke all the time
and uh, he even used a, a,

2062
01:55:01,331 --> 01:55:06,320
a fake penis to a avoid detection.
He, one of those fake rubber penis.

2063
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:08,270
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2064
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:12,800
I love the fact that he comes out and
just tell us everything about everything

2065
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:13,940
that he did.
That was crazy.

2066
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:17,720
It makes me more inclined to believe that
he never raped that girl first of all.

2067
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:22,670
And it makes me more inclined to sort of
forgive him for being so fucking crazy.

2068
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,250
The, all the horrible things
that he definitely did do.

2069
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:27,530
It's like the guy was living in a wild,
reckless life.

2070
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:29,000
He's telling you all he did.

2071
01:55:29,001 --> 01:55:31,670
He's telling me he's opening up the
door like this is all the Shit I did.

2072
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:34,290
I was doing coke and fighting
people and people are like, oh,

2073
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:39,460
here's the rubber Dick. Like to
him, Jesus Christ, I think he's,

2074
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:42,980
he's a classic story in my opinion, is
the greatest heavyweight champion of all.

2075
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:46,200
I think so, yes. I put them
at the top of the list.

2076
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,970
I think for a brief moment in time,

2077
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:51,840
people want to consider his whole entire
career towards the end out of prison

2078
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:55,380
after prison post-prison but
I think that before then,

2079
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:57,210
I think when he was in his prime,

2080
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:00,480
the guy that beat Larry Holmes,

2081
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,810
I think the guy that beat Marvis Frasier,

2082
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:05,280
I think that that Mike
Tyson brand heavyweight,

2083
01:56:05,281 --> 01:56:09,120
but he also had small paper champion
dudes that he fought and a bunch of them

2084
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:12,900
obviously not the ones you mentioned, and
then the razor Ruddick fight was crazy.

2085
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:15,500
Those people really gave
him a run for his money. He,

2086
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:19,410
he had to punish them as much as
they were trying to punish him.

2087
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:23,250
But for some of them, for example,
the bus, the dug this thing,

2088
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:26,130
he took that shit lightly.
He walked in like it was whatever.

2089
01:56:26,131 --> 01:56:29,070
And it went over with some other fighters,
but not with buster Douglas.

2090
01:56:29,130 --> 01:56:34,070
Well that was also post-prison. He wasn't
the same guy, right? Wasn't it? No,

2091
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,780
no, no, no, no. I'm wrong. No,

2092
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:39,060
buster Douglas happened before
and all the crazy shit happened.

2093
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,340
Then he went to prison. Right.
And they lost his title in the,

2094
01:56:41,470 --> 01:56:44,250
and then he came back and then he came
back and he fought Holyfield and have

2095
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:47,130
those Holyfield Dubach holes.
Those were fucking crazy.

2096
01:56:47,131 --> 01:56:49,770
When we bid Holyfield's ear, that
was all post-prison. You're right.

2097
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,330
When he was getting, he was saying that
Holyfield was headbutting him. Yeah,

2098
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:55,890
he does all the time.
Go back and you look at all the tapes.

2099
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,110
No headbutts everybody.
But Tyson did it too.

2100
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:03,140
I mean they had buttered each other and
the point being that Tyson like didn't

2101
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:07,950
stay at the same level when custom auto
died. And then Kevin Rooney took over.

2102
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:09,780
I think he maintained that
level for a little bit,

2103
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:13,320
but I think that the fame and
the fortune and the madness,

2104
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:16,860
we're too crazy when you have
your own fucking lions, when you,

2105
01:57:16,861 --> 01:57:21,861
you live in in a gigantic hundred fucking
room house and bought 15 Bentley's,

2106
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:26,410
you know, for every person you've
ever met is, he's a, he's a mad man.

2107
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:31,470
You got a bunch of factory
loading as people. But I
mean again, but I just think,

2108
01:57:31,471 --> 01:57:34,860
I don't think you can keep it up,
but I think that when he was at his best,

2109
01:57:34,861 --> 01:57:38,460
I think he only kept it up for a few
years, like two years, three years.

2110
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,160
But I think during that time he
was the greatest of all time.

2111
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:42,420
That's my personal opinion.

2112
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:47,570
I don't think anybody ever sent shockwaves
through the boxing world the way that

2113
01:57:47,671 --> 01:57:52,350
guy did when he emerged on the scene
and just started starching people with

2114
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:57,500
fucking haymakers that came at the speed
that Roberto Duran would throw them.

2115
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:01,500
Yet it's coming from a guy who's 215
pounds and just launching motherfuckers

2116
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,430
into orbit. That right hook
to the body. White upper.

2117
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:08,800
Cut that with snap your fucking head
back that up because when I see the, the,

2118
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:12,750
the, the old youtube videos of him
fighting upper cut his, the way he merged,

2119
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:16,110
I don't know how someone's
jaw was intact after that.

2120
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:21,000
He was for Russias but you can't keep
it up forever man. It's red lining.

2121
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,340
When you red line and
engine you'd go back,

2122
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:27,240
you'd get that bitch up to 9,000 rpm
and then you kind of shift gears.

2123
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:31,740
You have to, and he didn't ever shift
gears. Somebody red line to to this,

2124
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:36,240
somebody told me we were having this
discussion about like music and I went to

2125
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:38,940
the Berkeley College of music and
I was telling kids like, listen,

2126
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:42,190
people don't generally
get rich off of music,

2127
01:58:42,191 --> 01:58:46,750
which what artists do is they take that
nest egg of money that they do or that

2128
01:58:46,751 --> 01:58:50,050
they get from music and they
invested wisely and something else.

2129
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,150
The richest rappers,
quote unquote,

2130
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:55,420
are people who have made some money in
music and they say, Oh, you know what?

2131
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:00,070
I'm going to start like a construction
company or our contracting company or I'm

2132
01:59:00,071 --> 01:59:03,230
going to buy six waffle houses
or I'm going to get, you know,

2133
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:06,490
a clothing company or whatever it is and
that's how they make that money. What,

2134
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:10,360
what is the twilight for fighters,
Joe? Where do they fall back on?

2135
01:59:10,361 --> 01:59:13,480
The pen is on a fighter.
It depends entirely on the restaurant.

2136
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:17,310
Some guys become commentators like
chill son and he'll eventually be a

2137
01:59:17,311 --> 01:59:19,150
commentator for sure.
He is one now.

2138
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:22,690
Rashad Evans is doing commentary now
while he's fighting. Brian Stan retired.

2139
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:26,800
He became a commentator. Kenny Florian
retired. He became a commentator.

2140
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:29,590
A lot of them are there and
they're also becoming judges.

2141
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:32,830
Ricardo Alomeda as a judge in
New York now and he's also,

2142
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:37,230
a lot of them are coaches.
That's most likely the best path for them,

2143
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:39,070
especially the guys that
still love the sport.

2144
01:59:39,071 --> 01:59:40,360
They still want to be around the sport.

2145
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:43,420
Like Duane Ludwig is the coach of
the year. He won coach of the year.

2146
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:48,280
Congratulations. My friend Dwayne, he won
coach of the year for 2013 rightly so,

2147
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:52,210
because he did a tremendous
job of transitioning between
being a great fighter

2148
01:59:52,211 --> 01:59:56,560
to being an even better coach. I mean an
amazing coach for this team. Alpha male.

2149
01:59:56,561 --> 01:59:59,020
He's just changed that whole fucking team.
I mean they,

2150
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:01,810
they're all striking like at
a very high level now. Much,

2151
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:03,100
much higher than they were before.

2152
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:06,490
So that's a good transition for Dwayne
and he's doing very well with that.

2153
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:09,610
But some guys, uh, they just
quit and go into business.

2154
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:13,750
Keith Jardine open up a coffee company.
He's a caveman coffee. That's Keith.

2155
02:00:13,751 --> 02:00:16,360
And uh, my friend Tate, who
also was former MMA fighter,

2156
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:19,810
they open up a coffee company.
Some guys go into acting,

2157
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,010
you know Gina Gershon is like a
famous actress now. Gina Gershon.

2158
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:27,070
Gina Damn. What's her name? Gina Carano.

2159
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:31,120
Gina Gershon is obviously
a famous actress too. Um,

2160
02:00:31,540 --> 02:00:33,700
there was another rumor that Clinton
fucked her too. That's why it was,

2161
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:38,210
I'd fallen all this. Jesus went
and fucked everybody. Love Him.

2162
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:43,540
Last American presidential, Dick's Linger,
ladies and gentlemen, Dude, what was he?

2163
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:46,320
They say he smashed out
Liz Hurley. Yeah. Yeah.

2164
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,980
This is a picture of
them stare at each other,

2165
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:52,450
looking at each other's eyes and
you're like, oh yeah, for sure.

2166
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:57,520
It's just too romantic. The look I'm
looking at, but it wasn't at times.

2167
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:00,680
Tom Sizemore. That was dry
snitching. He was, yes.

2168
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:04,720
He was a dry snitch up that dirty son of
a bitch. That Nigga was a snitch. He is.

2169
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:07,310
That's what I said. That's the first
thing I said on the Fred. I said,

2170
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:12,010
but this tells me Tom Sizemore can't
keep a fucking secret dude. Yeah,

2171
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:16,510
that's weak.
And you go on throw bill under the bus.

2172
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:20,710
There's the picture. Come
on son. Look at his eyes.

2173
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,210
No one escapes that deck.

2174
02:01:22,211 --> 02:01:26,480
That deck octopus comes out and grabs.

2175
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:31,330
I mean, that is like a
dominant submissive picture.

2176
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:35,560
If ever people were not touching, but
one was encroaching Ludas body language.

2177
02:01:35,561 --> 02:01:39,130
He's leaning towards her. Look at
her. Look at her left shoulder.

2178
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:44,120
Turns slightly away from him. She wants
to lay down right now. Look at her list.

2179
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:49,220
Dirty too dirty, dirty, dirty people.
I love it. I wish I was there.

2180
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:50,960
I beat off in the corner.
I wouldn't say a word

2181
02:01:54,210 --> 02:01:55,740
slick willy tearing it up.

2182
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:00,210
I don't know how we got on that subject.

2183
02:02:00,211 --> 02:02:02,360
We were talking about Mike Tyson
beat the fuck out of people.

2184
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:07,981
Tremendous.

2185
02:02:07,981 --> 02:02:11,280
You'll need to fuck up the picture of
we're putting Hillary and get that picture

2186
02:02:11,281 --> 02:02:12,114
down.

2187
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,470
You don't need to fuck
up all of our minds,

2188
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:16,940
but thinking about the guilt that
he must have suffered right after it

2189
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:23,380
not worth it. Shit. Oh Kiss.
And she knows. She knows

2190
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:29,840
right bag and the one in the back
was like, Yo, look at her. Fuck.

2191
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:33,530
Oh my God. Look at that
woman. Oh Wow. Yeah. Not

2192
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:42,670
they play dress up. Look Paul Revere's
right behind them to his right.

2193
02:02:43,110 --> 02:02:47,320
Look at that as Paul Revere. That
woman. That woman's a hater. No,

2194
02:02:47,321 --> 02:02:50,980
the woman right there. You get up to
her. Look at that. She knows. She knows.

2195
02:02:50,981 --> 02:02:55,750
That is the classic. She's either face
the Dick. I did it. She definitely,

2196
02:02:55,751 --> 02:02:58,630
she definitely knows that
something's going on under the table

2197
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:02,820
car. Her and her husband, she
was like that motherfucker.

2198
02:03:02,821 --> 02:03:06,110
Did you see the way he kissed Elizabeth
early? Oh, he's such a pig. I,

2199
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:11,220
I despise him rush. Limbaugh's
right. Look at him. Disgusting.

2200
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:13,110
You know what's funny though,
when I heard about this,

2201
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:17,490
it was so interesting that I heard
conservatives come out the woodwork.

2202
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:22,200
Um, who was it? I think it was rand
Paul was like, Oh man, this is terrible.

2203
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,870
The president should apologize,
but wait a minute homie.

2204
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:28,410
Where were you when Newt
Gingrich was running for office?

2205
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:32,130
Because didn't he drop his wife and then
deal with another woman and then deal

2206
02:03:32,131 --> 02:03:34,340
with another one and mean,
isn't that the,

2207
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:39,090
that the benchmark of men
that are in power, they're
just looking to play. Gotcha.

2208
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:42,850
All these shit heads. Are they just
using that like it's points on a blanket.

2209
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,590
Nobody ever fuck no, they scored on you.
They caught you, they scored on you.

2210
02:03:46,591 --> 02:03:49,770
They got points now and they just going
to use those points to try to shut you

2211
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:50,850
down and build them up.

2212
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:53,640
But it all just makes everybody
look like a bunch of bitches.

2213
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:56,100
Because if that was going
on amongst your friends,

2214
02:03:56,101 --> 02:03:59,070
let's say if there was 10 of your
friends and one of your friends was not

2215
02:03:59,071 --> 02:04:01,140
particularly happy with
his wife's relationship,

2216
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:04,410
and so he started banging
Elizabeth Hurley and all. Yeah,

2217
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:09,020
guys found out about it. I wouldn't dry
snitch. I wouldn't play Tom Sizemore.

2218
02:04:09,021 --> 02:04:11,010
I'll tell you, you went
out and you, you snitch,

2219
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,580
you have no one would want to hang out
with you anymore. Right. He'd be like,

2220
02:04:13,581 --> 02:04:18,080
what the fuck tech, but oh
man, who's going to party
with Tom Sizemore now? Not me.

2221
02:04:18,081 --> 02:04:20,390
I'll tell you that Tom.
Go Fuck yourself pal

2222
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:23,860
secret.

2223
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:28,630
Keep that motherfucker. I met
Tom Sizemore. He's a cool dude.

2224
02:04:28,631 --> 02:04:32,170
That's why I was, I was shocked.
I did a show called the list.

2225
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,460
He came on and it was like a thing
for VH one. It was pretty cool. Man,

2226
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:40,590
I think was him and a Rob Halford from
Judas priest. We're on the same show.

2227
02:04:40,660 --> 02:04:43,870
Did he, did he know or was
he secretly being recorded?

2228
02:04:44,630 --> 02:04:46,610
Oh, I don't know man. I
don't know. I, I, you know,

2229
02:04:46,611 --> 02:04:49,040
I don't know if he even really said
it. I'm just talking shit. Like I said,

2230
02:04:49,041 --> 02:04:50,370
I met the guy. He's a nice guy. Oh,

2231
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:53,480
so let's set it in some interview
or something like that. Allegedly.

2232
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:55,820
That's what everyone's saying and
there's a picture of him. Look man,

2233
02:04:55,821 --> 02:05:00,140
the dude also did a lot of drugs. He
probably is not thinking so good like his,

2234
02:05:00,141 --> 02:05:02,150
uh, his judgments, quite suspect.

2235
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:05,670
He's not the kind of guy you would want
to have some information if Tom Sizemore

2236
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,930
fines up dead.
Vince foster style on a hill.

2237
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:14,290
No, no blood at the scene
of the crime. Super ugly.

2238
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:18,200
Yeah. Vince, for the strange death
of Vince foster is a fantastic book.

2239
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:21,440
You want to talk about a weird
death that appears to be murder.

2240
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:23,540
This was during the
Clinton administration.

2241
02:05:23,541 --> 02:05:27,770
There's a guy named Vince foster and he
knew some things about some things and a

2242
02:05:27,771 --> 02:05:30,950
bunch of people knew some things
and Vince foster might've been a,

2243
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:32,490
a liability and a,

2244
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:36,770
he wound up dead holding onto the gun
in his hand with the thumb still on the

2245
02:05:36,771 --> 02:05:39,440
trigger,
which they say never happens.

2246
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:42,470
They say that when someone shoots
themselves and you commit suicide,

2247
02:05:42,471 --> 02:05:44,690
you're hand goes,
the gun just goes flying.

2248
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:48,680
Like you don't hold onto
the gun violence of a gun.

2249
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:52,340
It give you've ever shot at gotten,
you know the guns have a kick. Well,

2250
02:05:52,341 --> 02:05:53,360
if you're not conscious,

2251
02:05:53,361 --> 02:05:56,480
you're not going to hold onto that
gun and see where Vince foster has.

2252
02:05:56,480 --> 02:06:01,340
It's his thumb, like trapped in
where holding on to the, to the gun.

2253
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:05,720
He's also lying down in an
area where there was no blood.

2254
02:06:05,870 --> 02:06:09,140
There's more blood missing from his
body then was at the scene of the crime.

2255
02:06:09,590 --> 02:06:11,660
His body was moved.
Somebody moved him there.

2256
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:13,460
It doesn't mean that
he didn't kill himself.

2257
02:06:13,461 --> 02:06:14,960
He's each still could have killed himself.

2258
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:18,290
He could have killed himself with a gay
lover and the gay lover wanting to cover

2259
02:06:18,291 --> 02:06:18,991
up the story.

2260
02:06:18,991 --> 02:06:21,560
So he grabbed the body and dropped it
off somewhere and put the gun in his

2261
02:06:21,561 --> 02:06:24,170
Thomas. Who knows? And I'm just
making that gay little part up.

2262
02:06:24,230 --> 02:06:25,220
I Dunno why I went there.

2263
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:30,830
That's what I did get two of those images
that Brian read bringing up with the

2264
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,370
fucking Greek shit. Whatever the reason
was that whoever killed him, whoever

2265
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:37,930
killed him, it was, it's
most likely that, uh,

2266
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:40,100
whether it was he killed himself
or somebody else killed him,

2267
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:44,840
they moved his body and a, they put a
gun in his Tom, it just doesn't add up.

2268
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:48,070
It doesn't add up. It's a, it's
a strange case because, uh,

2269
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:50,810
that's when the Whitewater
shit was going on, right.

2270
02:06:51,230 --> 02:06:52,700
Water. What was the, what was the,

2271
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:55,130
the land deal that the Clintons
were involved with? Water.

2272
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:59,520
They lost money on the deal. Supposedly
it wasn't white water. The Nixon Shit. No,

2273
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:02,130
no, no, no. What was the
Watergate, Watergate. Nixon.

2274
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:06,290
All this water talk water is a problem
with presence. You know, it was crazy.

2275
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:08,960
I tell you a personal story.
When I was incarcerated,

2276
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:13,550
I was in Pennsylvania and I was
processed through an area. Um,

2277
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:19,220
and there was this a district
attorney named Ray Greek car. Um,

2278
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:22,580
he disappeared. And another people
who are watching from Pennsylvania,

2279
02:07:22,581 --> 02:07:25,670
they knew this story, um, shot the PA.

2280
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:28,970
And the crazy thing is that he literally,

2281
02:07:28,971 --> 02:07:31,360
he was investigating the Sandusky thing.

2282
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:34,380
Yeah. A lot of people don't know that.
They found his fucking laptop without a,

2283
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,280
without a hard and

2284
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,350
he disappeared going,
gone.

2285
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:43,770
And the asa that tried my case
was in disbarred after uh,

2286
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:47,590
like two,
it was like maybe two or three a,

2287
02:07:47,591 --> 02:07:50,710
a case is after me for
tampering with evidence.

2288
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:54,370
It's supposedly there was some shootout
and like he had removed shell casings

2289
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:55,240
from the scene of the fucking room.

2290
02:07:55,490 --> 02:07:56,630
How about that other judge in,

2291
02:07:56,631 --> 02:07:59,930
in Pennsylvania that got accused
of sending kids Jay Holmes,

2292
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:02,750
he was selling and selling them for money.

2293
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:06,980
He made $3 million over the course
of fucking like fucking 10 years.

2294
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:12,320
The guys I had judge and he's making
sure that kids go to jail for paper.

2295
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:16,070
Fuck for money. Oh God, that's crazy.

2296
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:19,490
There's not a whole small enough or
dark enough to shove him and you know,

2297
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,960
you get a kill that guy,
that guy,

2298
02:08:20,961 --> 02:08:25,070
you should put them in a corner and some
parent you give a parent that gun and

2299
02:08:25,071 --> 02:08:27,860
he going to shoot that fucking guy in
the head. And you feed them to pigs.

2300
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:32,150
That's it. So you don't let that
guy rot away and live at jail.

2301
02:08:32,151 --> 02:08:36,530
He chose to take children and put them
in horrendous situations where you know

2302
02:08:36,531 --> 02:08:40,070
they were sexually abused, you know, do
you know they were physically tortured?

2303
02:08:40,070 --> 02:08:43,490
100% and they could have been let free
and they could have enjoyed their lives.

2304
02:08:43,491 --> 02:08:44,360
They could have got their shit together.

2305
02:08:44,361 --> 02:08:47,690
They could have been musicians or
comedians or athletes or whatever the fuck

2306
02:08:47,691 --> 02:08:50,840
they could have been without that horrific
life experience that they were forced

2307
02:08:50,841 --> 02:08:54,410
to endure because of a corrupt shot.
Shoot that motherfucker right in the head.

2308
02:08:54,590 --> 02:08:57,950
Throw them in a box, let the rats
eat them, throw them in the ground,

2309
02:08:57,951 --> 02:09:02,300
let the worms digest his body.
Fuck him. Fuck his tombstone,

2310
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:04,820
no coffin.
Getting that whole stupid,

2311
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:07,880
make him dig his own fucking hall and
then shoot them right in the Dick.

2312
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:14,000
Shit. Fuck him. The
crazy shit is though that

2313
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:18,180
a lot of people never made that connection
between his disappearance and it was

2314
02:09:18,181 --> 02:09:20,020
only something recent that happened.

2315
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:22,290
Still not, they're not
investigating it. You know,

2316
02:09:22,291 --> 02:09:25,260
you don't hear him a word about it?
Well I mean she'd be something

2317
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:30,070
that area and PA's a little like that
Steubenville situation where it's all some

2318
02:09:30,071 --> 02:09:34,930
like you know, local good old boys type
town with, you know, I'll be honest,

2319
02:09:34,931 --> 02:09:36,160
I heard rumors while I was there,

2320
02:09:36,161 --> 02:09:40,030
I can't confirm or deny them and I won't
say that they're true cause I don't

2321
02:09:40,031 --> 02:09:40,864
want to get sued.

2322
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:45,340
But the reality is that I always heard
rumors that the judges in that county or

2323
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:50,400
that two of them in specific would drive
drunk all the time and every single day

2324
02:09:50,891 --> 02:09:54,100
a cop would follow them so that
if they veer too far off the road,

2325
02:09:54,101 --> 02:09:57,100
he would take them out, put
them in his car, drive it,

2326
02:09:57,101 --> 02:10:00,900
and then come back and get his other car
100% I wouldn't doubt it for a God damn

2327
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:05,170
that when then whenever someone that
had like an issue with drug addiction or

2328
02:10:05,171 --> 02:10:05,411
something,

2329
02:10:05,411 --> 02:10:09,100
like they would always clean it up for
like a cop's kid or for the judges child

2330
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:13,540
or something like that. So, I mean when
you talk about a tier justice system,

2331
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:18,640
it's ironic that people say, Oh man,
technique. You make conscious music,

2332
02:10:18,641 --> 02:10:19,750
and I always remind them,

2333
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:22,330
being conscious doesn't imply
that you're going to do anything.

2334
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:24,550
It just means you know
that something's wrong.

2335
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:28,600
But I think that the consciousness of
this society is much more aware of the

2336
02:10:28,601 --> 02:10:31,480
divide and conquer shit that
we were talking about in
the beginning of the show.

2337
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:35,150
That's harder to do today because
I don't have a beef with Canada.

2338
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:38,090
I don't have a beef with Mexico and
have beef with any part of the world.

2339
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:42,740
I've met people in other
places and they've been just
like me and I've talked to

2340
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:46,550
people online which showed us just like
you know when you see a lot of different

2341
02:10:46,551 --> 02:10:47,330
people,
you're right,

2342
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:52,010
but I think that this connection that
we're all experiencing online is a very

2343
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:55,610
different way of experiencing the
world and that the divide and conquer,

2344
02:10:55,611 --> 02:10:56,990
it's almost impossible now.

2345
02:10:57,290 --> 02:11:00,560
It's almost impossible as long as we can
understand each other. Now, let me ask.

2346
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:03,590
If people, for example, they
think that something's fake,

2347
02:11:03,591 --> 02:11:05,870
they think something's not real,
then they're upset about it.

2348
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:11,820
Let's say people found out right now that
the Superbowl was staged just as much

2349
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:14,840
as something like wrestling
would be all right.

2350
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:17,990
Now the injuries are real just
like they say it or I say, hey man,

2351
02:11:17,991 --> 02:11:20,810
you know the wrestling's fake what
the injuries are real. You know?

2352
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:24,470
I think that people would be on the
verge of ripping the place apart.

2353
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:28,250
Well you would, you could fake, you
could fix a Superbowl, but the fake,

2354
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:32,910
the Superbowl would not fake.
But obviously to say, all
right, we want, we would,

2355
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:36,800
we would be more inclined
if this team won or if this,

2356
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:40,130
and I know people would say that's so
impractical. That could never happen.

2357
02:11:40,250 --> 02:11:42,920
The world series has been accused
of being fixed several times.

2358
02:11:42,921 --> 02:11:45,380
This is what you could do.
This is what has been done.

2359
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:50,480
What they can do is they can hire referees
and make sure that the referees are

2360
02:11:50,481 --> 02:11:52,520
paid for and bought off and bribed.

2361
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:57,520
And then if there is a situation where
a questionable call can be made right,

2362
02:11:57,591 --> 02:11:59,600
where they can call it
one way or the other,

2363
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:02,360
especially before they used
to use instant replays. Right.

2364
02:12:02,361 --> 02:12:04,940
I mean the instant replay
thing clears up a lot of shit.

2365
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:08,790
There's a lot of things that, I mean,
if a ball's not in a ball is not in.

2366
02:12:08,791 --> 02:12:10,940
If a dude's foot is out of bounds,
the dude's puts out of bounds.

2367
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:12,860
If you looking at the instant replays,
not much you could say,

2368
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:18,040
but before all that man, God damn, they
must have rigged a lot of games then.

2369
02:12:18,041 --> 02:12:23,041
Then basketball referees didn't was a
fucking bring those and bringing them out

2370
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:27,240
of Philly and what was going on?
What was the story? Uh, they had,

2371
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,230
and I think it was like 12 of them
and they were all referees. Yeah.

2372
02:12:30,231 --> 02:12:33,800
They had it for years. Like they were
just on the payroll and hilarious.

2373
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:36,530
They were connected.
How they got caught is one of the bookies.

2374
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:39,330
They ended up tapping
like a bookies phone.

2375
02:12:39,331 --> 02:12:42,260
And so basically the bookies was
painting. I'm gonna leave a moment. Well,

2376
02:12:42,261 --> 02:12:45,350
it only makes sense when you think
about the amount of money involved in

2377
02:12:45,351 --> 02:12:50,240
gambling. You know, that's a thought about
a fixed fights too. I mean, the, the real,

2378
02:12:50,241 --> 02:12:53,780
the fixing fights, it's not
like, you know, the champions
paying you off to lose.

2379
02:12:53,781 --> 02:12:58,460
Now the fixing fights is someone is
wa wants a bed, a fuck load of money,

2380
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:01,850
a fuck load of money. Like here's a
good example. And people have said,

2381
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:04,790
I'm crazy for thinking this,
but Manny Pacquiao,

2382
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:07,490
when Manny Pacquiao fought Tim Bradley,

2383
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:11,090
Tim Bradley won that
fight in no one's eyes,

2384
02:13:11,091 --> 02:13:15,800
but maybe 10 Bradley's family and a
couple of people at home that really hate

2385
02:13:15,801 --> 02:13:19,190
Manny Pacquiao. Most people saw
Manny Pacquiao boxes face off.

2386
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,940
They saw him not his face off, but he
won that fight. He wanted to fight.

2387
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,100
In my opinion, it was a
terrible, terrible decision.

2388
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:28,710
But when you find out that someone voted,
uh,

2389
02:13:28,750 --> 02:13:33,540
that someone like put the
scores in and that same,

2390
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:37,950
someone put the same like really
ridiculous score in another fight where it

2391
02:13:37,951 --> 02:13:40,320
doesn't make any sense.
And then you watching over and over again.

2392
02:13:40,321 --> 02:13:43,050
You seeing these,
these scores that don't make any sense.

2393
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:46,830
He's seeing these fights that most people
thought the fight one fight or clearly

2394
02:13:46,831 --> 02:13:51,831
won and they have like two fighters are
two judges we'll call it where it's a,

2395
02:13:51,901 --> 02:13:55,110
you know the the one one fires
winning by like six, seven,

2396
02:13:55,111 --> 02:13:58,590
eight rounds and then the other one makes
it a draw and you're like how the fuck

2397
02:13:58,591 --> 02:13:59,400
could that be?

2398
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:02,880
Well the way it could be is because
then it's not a majority decision and

2399
02:14:02,881 --> 02:14:04,200
there's unanimous decisions.

2400
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:07,320
Rather it's an unanimous decision
cause unanimous decision bets.

2401
02:14:07,560 --> 02:14:12,150
So you can bet a huge amount of money
that Manny pack hill is not going to beat

2402
02:14:12,151 --> 02:14:14,460
Timothy Bradley by unanimous decision.
You're going to see,

2403
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:18,750
you're going to bet a fucking that
it's going to be a split decision and

2404
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:21,990
everybody's going to go, are you fucking
crazy? You really to take that bet.

2405
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:25,140
It's like x to one. No one, no one
ever sees split decisions. Well,

2406
02:14:25,141 --> 02:14:27,450
if one judge has paid off just one judge,

2407
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:30,540
all they have to do is say it's a
draw and everybody else is like,

2408
02:14:30,541 --> 02:14:33,870
what the fuck are you talking about?
What did you watch? That wasn't a draw.

2409
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:38,520
But the guy who makes the money is the
guy who paid off the referee to make an a

2410
02:14:38,521 --> 02:14:42,960
jaw or the judge to make it a
draw and they win that bet. Clean

2411
02:14:43,450 --> 02:14:47,980
the odds on to first, uh, scoring
being a touchback safety, safety.

2412
02:14:47,981 --> 02:14:49,920
I mean incredible what God's word.

2413
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:54,340
Like super sick people got rich to
us off of that. Yeah. And I mean,

2414
02:14:54,341 --> 02:14:57,820
I don't know if it's possible
that you could just rig that.

2415
02:14:57,850 --> 02:15:00,310
Is it possible that will be enough.
I mean, that would be enough.

2416
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:04,750
What's possible or what's it? Yeah, you
pay the center off. I mean the center.

2417
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:07,330
And so what does he do?
What does he have to do in his center?

2418
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:11,050
Basically threw the ball over,
you know, the quarterback's head.

2419
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:13,480
Did you do it on purpose
you think? I mean, he did.

2420
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:17,440
He didn't do that the whole season.
Pretty much do it for $10 million.

2421
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:20,680
I mean that's, but then you've got
to account for that $10 million.

2422
02:15:20,681 --> 02:15:22,780
You've got to show why
you have that $10 million.

2423
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:26,620
Who's to say maybe it's $10 million
cash is king. No wash in America,

2424
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,280
go wash it to cash is king.

2425
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:32,620
We all know that a truck load
of pussy shows up at his house.

2426
02:15:35,630 --> 02:15:36,463
Shh.

2427
02:15:38,540 --> 02:15:42,860
They lower that back door like one of
those aircraft carriers where they lower

2428
02:15:42,861 --> 02:15:43,694
the door.

2429
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:48,360
All the girls with keys. Cow. Yeah.

2430
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:56,830
Without a doubt.
We know the judges had been paid off.

2431
02:15:56,890 --> 02:16:00,100
We know that referees has been paid off.
We know that this corruption,

2432
02:16:00,101 --> 02:16:01,090
whenever this game just,

2433
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,580
it gets harder with fighters
because at the end of the day,

2434
02:16:03,730 --> 02:16:08,380
I mean a fighter trains and
harder on them to do. It looks,

2435
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:11,950
you can see it. It's
obvious. Joe has someone,

2436
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:14,770
has someone got paid to throw
a fight and then I may and UFC

2437
02:16:14,890 --> 02:16:18,820
not in the unit. I don't know. I shouldn't
say no. I said I don't know of him,

2438
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:22,120
but I do know of them in
pride. In fact, Eddie Bravo,

2439
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:27,300
they offered him a fight in Japan and
they told him in no uncertain terms that

2440
02:16:28,451 --> 02:16:31,870
they can make so that he wins the fight
and that they can make it so that he

2441
02:16:31,871 --> 02:16:34,600
wins the fight any way he wants to win.

2442
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:39,550
And he thought it was a double cross.
He, the way Eddie, Eddie is like, what?

2443
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:42,220
What are you talking about? Like you
got to fix the fight. First of all,

2444
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:45,220
Eddie would never do that.
He would never compete in a fake fight.

2445
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:47,230
He just wouldn't do it.
He wouldn't be able to live with himself.

2446
02:16:47,231 --> 02:16:49,600
I know him never do it.
No matter how much money they paid him.

2447
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:52,720
And if he did do it, he would tell people
right afterwards I did a fake fight.

2448
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,230
He wouldn't be able to handle it.
He would say, look man, I feel bad,

2449
02:16:56,231 --> 02:16:58,630
but they gave me a half a million
bucks. I had to fucking do it, you know?

2450
02:16:58,631 --> 02:17:01,300
And he would just joke around about how
it happened. He would never fake it.

2451
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:04,030
But what they did was they came
to him and they told him that.

2452
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:07,510
So if that's the case, one of two
things are going on. Either they,

2453
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:10,060
it would be a double cross where he would
go there thing and it was a fake fight

2454
02:17:10,061 --> 02:17:12,430
and that do it. Beat the shit out
of him and he couldn't say nothing.

2455
02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:17,050
That's possible. Or he could go
there and the guy would lay down,

2456
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:21,070
the guy would give up or they would have
what they would call a hard shoot or

2457
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:26,071
like a or a hard work and hard
work is you're sparring real hard,

2458
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:30,130
you're fucking, the guy will kick you
with some leg kicks if shit goes wrong,

2459
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:33,190
you could get your draw broken,
you could get tagged and get knocked out.

2460
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:37,360
I mean there's hard works where a guy
loses that he's supposed to win because

2461
02:17:37,361 --> 02:17:40,840
the guy got injured because something
went wrong. Sometimes things happen,

2462
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:44,530
but if you're skillful you can
make it look like a real fight.

2463
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:48,910
And there's for sure that happened in k
one for sure that happened in pride for

2464
02:17:48,911 --> 02:17:53,680
sure. 100% I know there's some dudes
that told me themselves that they,

2465
02:17:53,681 --> 02:17:54,514
through fights,

2466
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:57,970
they got paid a shitload of money and
they tapped out the Japanese dude,

2467
02:17:57,971 --> 02:17:59,940
they got caught like heel
hooks or something like that.

2468
02:18:00,690 --> 02:18:03,990
And the guy won and he's a hero and
he's like a pro wrestler in Japan was

2469
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:09,570
without a doubt there's been some fan
and he walks away with like yeah million

2470
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,540
dollars in like whale blubber.
It's possible man.

2471
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:15,310
I mean you could come up to some guy,
you know,

2472
02:18:15,311 --> 02:18:18,220
you can take some fighter who doesn't
make that much money and if he doesn't

2473
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:20,440
have strong ethics and you,
you say to him, Hey man,

2474
02:18:20,441 --> 02:18:24,340
look what we want to pay a lot of money
down on you losing by submission to this

2475
02:18:24,341 --> 02:18:27,580
dude. Cause you know the odds of
him submitting you are really small.

2476
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:31,990
So what I want to do is set it up so that
you know, he doesn't even have to know.

2477
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:35,530
You just have to give him a submission.
And so they would, you know,

2478
02:18:35,531 --> 02:18:36,940
they would tangle and you know,

2479
02:18:36,941 --> 02:18:39,700
he would like give up an arm bar or
something like that or give up his neck

2480
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:40,990
shooting on a double,

2481
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:44,050
a real obvious double where he's like
literally lay in there for the gaiety and

2482
02:18:44,051 --> 02:18:45,760
let the guy tap you.
That could happen.

2483
02:18:46,390 --> 02:18:48,500
I mean it could also happen
because a guy makes a brain fart,

2484
02:18:48,530 --> 02:18:51,550
he forgets and he leaves his neck out
there and a dude snatches it up and closes

2485
02:18:51,551 --> 02:18:52,150
it on him.

2486
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:55,480
But it could happen that you give your
neck up and guys do give their neck up

2487
02:18:55,481 --> 02:18:56,950
sometimes when they want out of a fight.

2488
02:18:57,070 --> 02:19:00,820
Chill son is publicly said that he had
some issues with that and his career with

2489
02:19:00,821 --> 02:19:02,470
pressure that he'd be in big fights.

2490
02:19:02,510 --> 02:19:04,330
He wound up losing by
submission and he's like,

2491
02:19:04,331 --> 02:19:07,240
he felt like he gave them the
submission like you wanted out of there.

2492
02:19:07,241 --> 02:19:08,920
He left an arm and a
guy caught the arm bar.

2493
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,830
Like you really felt like he
just couldn't take the pressure.

2494
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:15,990
I was like a subconscious
thing telling you, you know we,

2495
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:20,800
we talked about that before. About how
there's a gentle complacency in failure.

2496
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:24,520
It's sometimes people will say,
you know what,

2497
02:19:25,090 --> 02:19:28,070
I could've done that if I tried harder.
And that's what they always

2498
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:31,460
say as if to say I could have done it.
Like that was a possibility,

2499
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:35,720
but I just didn't try hard enough that
that doesn't make sense for obvious

2500
02:19:35,721 --> 02:19:37,400
reasons.
But at the same time,

2501
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:41,690
that eases a lot of the anxiety and the
tension that people feel because it's

2502
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:42,800
like, all right, you know what?

2503
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:46,970
I had a chance to do this and now I don't
have to feel the pressure of dealing

2504
02:19:46,971 --> 02:19:47,180
with,

2505
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:51,770
or I've found some measure of success and
that's all I really need to deal with.

2506
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:54,560
I don't care about
anything farther than that.

2507
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:57,530
I got what I wanted to get out
of this game and that's it.

2508
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,650
And if I happen to get tons of money,
then fuck it.

2509
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:01,711
Well,
you know,

2510
02:20:01,711 --> 02:20:04,830
there's some dudes that can definitely
find a way to lose and they, uh,

2511
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:06,700
the psychological burden of,

2512
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:10,050
of trying to get your shit together and
when sometimes it's too hard for people,

2513
02:20:10,051 --> 02:20:13,410
so they almost look to lose to get
it over with. That's, that's real.

2514
02:20:13,710 --> 02:20:16,800
Some people can't take, take
pressure. Pressure is a strange thing.

2515
02:20:16,801 --> 02:20:18,510
And pressure of not knowing the future,

2516
02:20:18,511 --> 02:20:21,690
the anticipation of something happening
and not being able to control it,

2517
02:20:22,050 --> 02:20:25,860
especially when it deals
with physical violence. So me
kicking your ass, you know,

2518
02:20:25,861 --> 02:20:28,620
some dudes just turtle up, they
turtle up, try to protect themselves,

2519
02:20:28,621 --> 02:20:31,740
take a beating and wait for the referee
of pull them off. It's happened before.

2520
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:33,810
And then there's other guys
that we'll never do that.

2521
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:36,600
There's other guys that will fight with
their last fucking breath and they're

2522
02:20:36,601 --> 02:20:39,670
just [inaudible] code shit with
it. Just like, Yo, you got to,

2523
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,990
you're going to have to drag
me out of here. Yeah. It's
in the nature of some guy.

2524
02:20:42,991 --> 02:20:44,790
And then there's some guys
that are just real intelligent.

2525
02:20:44,791 --> 02:20:46,510
If they start getting hurt though,
start to happen.

2526
02:20:46,770 --> 02:20:49,260
You know like George George Saint Pierre
did that early in his career when he

2527
02:20:49,261 --> 02:20:52,110
fought Matt Hughes. Matt Hughes
was, or excuse me, Matt Serra,

2528
02:20:52,350 --> 02:20:55,410
Matt Serra was fucking him up and he
was like, Whoa, this is, I got a tap.

2529
02:20:55,470 --> 02:20:59,110
It was just getting mounted and pounded
on. He started to happen, didn't you know,

2530
02:20:59,130 --> 02:20:59,950
lost his title,

2531
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:03,090
lost his title Matt Serra Cause he was
getting fucking pounded on, but he knew,

2532
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:04,860
he's like,
I am way too hurt.

2533
02:21:04,861 --> 02:21:07,590
I'm not getting out of this one and
this dude's going to put me to sleep and

2534
02:21:07,591 --> 02:21:10,800
then it's going to be real bad if I
don't tap. Some guys don't do that.

2535
02:21:10,801 --> 02:21:15,300
Some guys rather go out, some guys rather
get choked out. They don't tap, you know,

2536
02:21:15,330 --> 02:21:18,030
war machine. He's going to be on the
podcast. Wednesday I'd fucking dude,

2537
02:21:18,031 --> 02:21:21,030
his last fight, he got caught in a
rear naked choke, decided not to tap,

2538
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:24,360
just went night night and just went,
got choked unconscious.

2539
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:27,330
The referee pulled the guy off
of him. That's what he said, hey,

2540
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,700
I'll never got a tap. Like, that's it.

2541
02:21:29,910 --> 02:21:33,360
I'm fighting to my last breath and if
he choked me out, he choked me out.

2542
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:38,130
And that, that happens. In fact, his last
opponent that the same thing, war machine,

2543
02:21:38,131 --> 02:21:40,770
put him to sleep, got the guy
in the room naked, put them out.

2544
02:21:41,010 --> 02:21:42,480
I didn't want to tap,
didn't want to lose.

2545
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:46,140
And that's what happens if this guys
like that and there's guys who just tap,

2546
02:21:46,350 --> 02:21:48,720
they go, you got me. And then
they go back to the drawing board.

2547
02:21:48,990 --> 02:21:52,080
It's hard to say who's more
intelligent because, uh,

2548
02:21:52,081 --> 02:21:53,940
I admire the war machine approach,

2549
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:57,480
but I also admire the guy
who realizes if I tap,

2550
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:59,760
I go back to the gym and
I still have a right arm.

2551
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:03,550
If I don't tap my fucking arm gets
snapped, then I have to go through be,

2552
02:22:03,551 --> 02:22:06,660
have they going to put bolts in my arm?
They gonna fucking have this, you know,

2553
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:09,490
put screws in there to
keep torn ligaments,

2554
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:13,650
be fucked for six months at least
it might not ever be the same again.

2555
02:22:13,651 --> 02:22:14,610
Even when it heals up.

2556
02:22:14,850 --> 02:22:17,610
There's guys that have gotten injuries
where they never came back 100% and

2557
02:22:17,611 --> 02:22:21,840
that's just part of the game. That's
part of reality. So it's who's, who's,

2558
02:22:22,050 --> 02:22:23,490
who's more intelligent as the guy,

2559
02:22:23,491 --> 02:22:26,370
more intelligent that taps
or the guy more intelligent

2560
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,510
that says,
you know what man,

2561
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:30,450
I'm going to figure out a way to win
this fight even though I'm in a terrible

2562
02:22:30,451 --> 02:22:33,720
situation. And if he makes it then
he's a hero. And if he doesn't,

2563
02:22:33,721 --> 02:22:34,890
he goes to sleep.
Well,

2564
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:39,950
most intelligent is probably the guy
who who's bribing him to lose. No,

2565
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:43,980
that's the least intelligent cause that's
like $20 million getting into trouble.

2566
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:48,440
He's going to get, where has he gotten
caught yet during that trip and the UFC,

2567
02:22:48,441 --> 02:22:50,400
has anyone got caught?
What did you see?

2568
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:54,930
That Russian snooker player who
got busted for a sneaker and uh,

2569
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,040
excuse me,
English,

2570
02:22:56,041 --> 02:23:00,750
the Russian Russian organized
crime was a bribing the sneaker,

2571
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:02,770
they call it sneaker snowcat pay.

2572
02:23:02,790 --> 02:23:06,210
I was just out there and they
wanted this guy to shots.

2573
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,310
They wanted them to miss
shots. Just, you know,

2574
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:12,270
cause he's a really famous
world champion player. And a,

2575
02:23:12,271 --> 02:23:14,730
I think it was hurricane
Higgins let's say,

2576
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:18,570
but it was a huge scandal because
they love this sneaker in England.

2577
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:23,710
Yeah. You know, I had a great
time when I was out there. Um, I,

2578
02:23:24,250 --> 02:23:29,250
I gotta Say England to me reminds me of
like the same type of enthusiasm that

2579
02:23:30,271 --> 02:23:34,680
people had and like the 90s for hip hop
where they're not afraid to boo somebody,

2580
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:37,320
you know, you go, you
didn't go to New York,

2581
02:23:37,390 --> 02:23:41,480
they'll get like an obligatory clap.
That's a second one.

2582
02:23:41,481 --> 02:23:46,080
It's like this tepid sort of
loose. It's like, it's Kinda like,

2583
02:23:46,081 --> 02:23:49,290
you know when your mom made you shake
hands with your brother and you hated each

2584
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:53,250
other, it's like, hey chick hazard your
brother. I fucked this dude. Say Cancer,

2585
02:23:53,251 --> 02:23:56,430
your brother, I'm gonna smack you in the
fucking mouth. Like, all right, thank you.

2586
02:23:56,490 --> 02:24:00,210
Here you go. I love you bro. Yeah.
That thing where you can't wait.

2587
02:24:00,270 --> 02:24:03,080
You know what I mean? But it's
like the people in New York, Yo,

2588
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:06,060
you go to like an underground hip
hop show. When you go to some shit,

2589
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:09,350
they'll sit through an opener that
they hate. This is something I,

2590
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:12,420
not that I love bullying or
something like that and it's just,

2591
02:24:12,690 --> 02:24:16,190
it's funny to see people, it'd be
like, I really don't want to be nice.

2592
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:20,830
It'd be nice.
I don't know.

2593
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:25,500
I come from an era where they were like,
get him off the stage. Still exist.

2594
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,590
Certain certain shows or like that.

2595
02:24:28,591 --> 02:24:31,230
This is a different says some people's
fans that will not tolerate it.

2596
02:24:31,231 --> 02:24:34,680
Like I saw someone waiting too
long for someone to be on stage.

2597
02:24:34,910 --> 02:24:38,430
I've random fan Joe. He was waiting
for Wu Tang. He jumped on the stage.

2598
02:24:38,431 --> 02:24:43,170
It was like get woo Tang on here.
And the the fucking opener was like,

2599
02:24:43,171 --> 02:24:47,100
oh hold on man. He goes, no
man, you suck Dick Money.

2600
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:52,060
And I was like God damn yo all that. Just
because I'm trying to entertain y'all.

2601
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:55,620
Why these motherfuckers smoking weed in
her back trying to get this set together.

2602
02:24:55,670 --> 02:24:59,650
What kind of Shit? But it
happens all the time, you know?

2603
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:04,410
But in England I just feel like they just
have like a more ruthless approach to

2604
02:25:04,411 --> 02:25:06,600
it. Like I've seen people
get booed to fuck off there.

2605
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:10,560
They really are like enthusiastic about
it. You know, I had, I had a great time.

2606
02:25:10,561 --> 02:25:14,400
It's just weird because when I walk
around there and I meet people,

2607
02:25:14,401 --> 02:25:17,010
they have no idea what I do
if they don't know what I do.

2608
02:25:17,011 --> 02:25:20,760
And then I walked into a cab for example,
and this old man was like,

2609
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:23,260
what you do for a living? He said, yeah,

2610
02:25:23,410 --> 02:25:26,680
you strike me as a type of
man to be an entertainer,

2611
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:30,610
perhaps a a singer or a rapper.
And I was just like,

2612
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:33,250
I looked at him and I want him
to be like you racist. Fuck.

2613
02:25:33,251 --> 02:25:35,920
Like what makes you think that I'm at?
But then I thought about it for a second.

2614
02:25:35,921 --> 02:25:39,370
I was like, no, you know, actually
I just teach, you know, Middle Age,

2615
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:43,660
medieval history and the history of
antiquity. And the guy's like, really?

2616
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:47,560
And you know he lied to that. No, no,
no. Cause Cause I, cause I, I've studied,

2617
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:49,720
I studied with her for years.
So I mean I had,

2618
02:25:49,721 --> 02:25:53,650
I had a passion for learning about the
past like a few years ago where I really,

2619
02:25:53,651 --> 02:25:58,390
really got into it. So technically at some
of the prison programs that I've done,

2620
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:03,310
I've taught, um, the history of antiquity,
like Aye. Aye. Aye. Tell kids like,

2621
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:08,020
all right, the way that you or anybody in
this room will believe in Christianity,

2622
02:26:08,021 --> 02:26:09,730
Judaism or Islam.

2623
02:26:09,790 --> 02:26:14,140
People used to believe in these
creation mythologies of Sumerian and

2624
02:26:14,141 --> 02:26:19,141
Mesopotamian times to give people an
idea and an impression of a world that

2625
02:26:19,481 --> 02:26:24,481
exists beyond there where belief
is not put into a concrete form.

2626
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:26,620
This could be someone's belief,

2627
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:30,730
but your belief doesn't necessarily
signify that that's exactly what the world

2628
02:26:30,731 --> 02:26:33,430
is. It's just what you believe
the world is. You know,

2629
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:37,060
similar to the way people will flip a
penny in the air and they think, oh man,

2630
02:26:37,061 --> 02:26:37,691
it's just 50,

2631
02:26:37,691 --> 02:26:41,530
50 and then take the same penny and flick
it across the ground and it's not 50,

2632
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:42,400
50.
It's 80,

2633
02:26:42,401 --> 02:26:46,720
20 that it's going to be tails because
the face of Lincoln is a fraction of a

2634
02:26:46,721 --> 02:26:49,600
gram heavier than the
actual monument or the back,

2635
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:53,050
or it was on the old copper pennies.
So it would fall to similar to the way,

2636
02:26:53,051 --> 02:26:56,320
if you're holding a TV and spinning in
a circle, you're going to fall forward,

2637
02:26:56,321 --> 02:26:58,780
not backward.
So that's what a lot of them are getting.

2638
02:26:58,781 --> 02:27:02,230
They think they're getting the 50 50
shot from the world, but you're not,

2639
02:27:02,260 --> 02:27:04,900
you're getting spun across the table
from the moment you come out the womb.

2640
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:07,330
You know you're going to be in jail here
and then they're going to tell you, oh,

2641
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:08,860
we want to reintroduce you to society.

2642
02:27:08,950 --> 02:27:10,700
How are you going to be
reintroduced to society?

2643
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:13,990
It will never part of in the first
place. But back to the point I, this guy,

2644
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:17,020
this guy's like, you
know, Oh, you do? I was,

2645
02:27:17,021 --> 02:27:21,250
I going to teach middle aged histories
like antiquity. I was like, sir,

2646
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:26,080
you know what an antiquity is? You know,
Rome, Babylon, Greece, Egypt. He's like,

2647
02:27:26,081 --> 02:27:29,920
Oh yeah. So I feel like he's
tested me on this guy's like,

2648
02:27:30,190 --> 02:27:34,490
and middle-age English history. You say?
I'm like, yeah, you know, I was like, um,

2649
02:27:35,070 --> 02:27:39,730
it's like, whereabouts there? I was
like, you know, Oh, Essex West, Sussex,

2650
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,070
Sussex, Kent, east Anglia
Mercia Northumbria,

2651
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:48,430
which was divided in half along with
Strathclyde when the Scottish king decided

2652
02:27:48,431 --> 02:27:53,090
to pledge fealty to the British king
and they dial Radia and the rest,

2653
02:27:53,230 --> 02:27:57,550
Yo. So the dude's like, oh,
well there you get into that.

2654
02:27:57,910 --> 02:28:01,780
So what made you interested in that
nun? She's, and leaned over to him.

2655
02:28:01,781 --> 02:28:03,700
And I was like, you know, to be honest,

2656
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:07,660
I was just really tired of motherfuckers
mistaken me for some kind of singer,

2657
02:28:07,661 --> 02:28:09,940
actor every time I stepped in some place.

2658
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:13,390
So I wanted to get some
new shit to tell people.

2659
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:15,670
I didn't seem to be totally cool with it.

2660
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:19,360
They got a great sense of humor out there.
I love it. I'm a big fan of England.

2661
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:22,010
I go there, uh, I, to
go there once every year

2662
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,980
or so and do stand up there.
That's a very unique crowd.

2663
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:29,390
Very unique crowd over there. Very
smart, very well read. Real cool people.

2664
02:28:29,420 --> 02:28:31,200
You know,
they hackle like politely

2665
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:36,440
[inaudible] it's not like
they want to be a dick,

2666
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:38,470
but it's just like haven't paid.

2667
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:41,770
I'll give you the alleyoop if you can
throw it back in my face, I'll take it.

2668
02:28:41,771 --> 02:28:43,720
I'll be cool with it like that.
You know what I mean?

2669
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,860
A good Haeckel,
but it's like,

2670
02:28:45,890 --> 02:28:49,450
it's hard to say what's a good heckle
to somebody because the people that suck

2671
02:28:49,451 --> 02:28:51,530
at it are always going to suck at it
and then we were all going to get a good

2672
02:28:51,531 --> 02:28:53,270
one this time and now you're
not going to ruin the show.

2673
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:57,320
Some people can be smart and they know
what to say at the right time and it's

2674
02:28:57,321 --> 02:28:59,780
funny and other people,
they just ruined the whole thing.

2675
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:04,160
But some people plant hecklers,
don't they? No. Well not
that I know of. Not that I,

2676
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:05,720
they do to work off of a,

2677
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:10,190
I have never known a single comedian to
ever plant someone in the audience and

2678
02:29:10,191 --> 02:29:13,910
work off of them if they have,
if I have heard stories of doing it,

2679
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:15,680
it's all been hearsay.
I've never,

2680
02:29:15,681 --> 02:29:20,060
never heard of one person that plants a
guy that I think it would be so obvious.

2681
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:23,720
I mean people have had people in the
audience as a part of a gag, right?

2682
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:26,610
They've set things up like as a Jew,
like Brian Holtzman,

2683
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:29,330
you just always have people in
the back of the whole audience.

2684
02:29:29,331 --> 02:29:31,700
Ask him about his gay son.
It was like a gag.

2685
02:29:31,970 --> 02:29:34,150
It was a bit that he would
do and we would always do.

2686
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:37,520
Tell us about your gay
son and he would go, sir,

2687
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:39,200
there's no need to talk
about that right now.

2688
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:41,630
But since it's been brought up and they
would tell this story about his case,

2689
02:29:41,631 --> 02:29:44,720
it's a fake, you know, just a bit.
But we, that would almost be like,

2690
02:29:44,721 --> 02:29:47,750
that's like the closest to a plant
in the audience I've ever heard of.

2691
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:52,100
Have you ever heard anybody
planting hecklers? Yeah.

2692
02:29:56,960 --> 02:30:01,660
Yeah. I'll think about
it. I've never heard,

2693
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:04,850
I don't know. I definitely not a
single one of my friends ever done it,

2694
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:08,650
but a good heckler will or any good,
bad,

2695
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:12,400
someone that heckles you in the right way
actually gives you fuel as a comedian,

2696
02:30:12,401 --> 02:30:15,050
don't they? They, it makes you
to bounce off of stuff, right?

2697
02:30:15,090 --> 02:30:16,920
Depends on when they do it,
because they could do it in the middle,

2698
02:30:16,921 --> 02:30:19,590
in the middle of the day.
They could do it. I mean,

2699
02:30:19,591 --> 02:30:22,800
I've had guys yell something stupid out
with totally the wrong timing and people

2700
02:30:22,801 --> 02:30:24,570
pile on them,
smack them in the head.

2701
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:28,230
I've seen violence break out because of
hecklers or people got tired of someone

2702
02:30:28,231 --> 02:30:32,250
who keeps yelling shit out. I mean, people
throw in drinks at each other throwing.

2703
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:35,220
I've seen people throw chairs at each
other because of the hecklers from most

2704
02:30:35,221 --> 02:30:37,380
part hecklers or cons.
They're just annoying.

2705
02:30:37,381 --> 02:30:41,460
Shitheads that need attention and don't
deserve it. I liked, uh, what was I think,

2706
02:30:41,461 --> 02:30:45,410
I don't know if he played it the first
time I was here, the Bill Hicks, uh,

2707
02:30:45,470 --> 02:30:46,680
response to the hecklers.

2708
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:51,240
Oh my God.
Cause I'm a cop and he goes,

2709
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:56,560
I can, I don't have a cock.
I could yell at performers.

2710
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:59,770
Did I run into people like that?
It,

2711
02:30:59,771 --> 02:31:04,330
God bless their hearts and 99% of the
people at the shows that I do are total

2712
02:31:04,390 --> 02:31:05,440
soldier supporters.

2713
02:31:05,710 --> 02:31:10,710
And then there's like the 1% that they're
just there to just fuck around and

2714
02:31:10,961 --> 02:31:14,530
play these stupid little games and
it's like they'll put, I'm like, Yo,

2715
02:31:14,531 --> 02:31:18,160
please no flash. And they're like, well,
why not? And I'm just like, listen,

2716
02:31:18,190 --> 02:31:21,840
you take one flash photo with
a day that doesn't bother you.

2717
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:25,820
But if I get up 800 of these
fucking things everyday,

2718
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:29,850
I'm going to go blind tomorrow.
And they're like, well,

2719
02:31:29,851 --> 02:31:32,820
can you just take mine then instead I was
like, no, you're not understanding me.

2720
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:36,060
You're going to turn the flash
off or you're going to leave. Oh,

2721
02:31:36,061 --> 02:31:38,910
well w w w w I'm like, okay, you're drunk.

2722
02:31:38,911 --> 02:31:41,220
It's the countdown to when
my first name becomes,

2723
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:43,890
fuck you get this fucker out of here.
Leave.

2724
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:45,870
And the security is
not here to protect me.

2725
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:48,810
They're here to protect the U
for me because when I flip out,

2726
02:31:49,050 --> 02:31:51,430
I'm going to snap your neck like
a breadstick for fucking green.

2727
02:31:51,510 --> 02:31:54,100
No, this is all violent talk and
I'm not really comfortable with it,

2728
02:31:54,101 --> 02:31:58,660
especially in the [inaudible]
story or drunk fan.

2729
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:02,520
Not trying to have a good time though.
You never beat up a fan right now.

2730
02:32:02,530 --> 02:32:05,740
I've got too crazy. He never beat
him a van. They got too crazy.

2731
02:32:06,070 --> 02:32:09,040
You're fucking lying to you never beat
up a fan. What about another comedian?

2732
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:13,500
No. And that would be to have a comedian.
Never. It doesn't have to go to that.

2733
02:32:13,590 --> 02:32:14,423
It's silly

2734
02:32:15,890 --> 02:32:16,680
bullshit.

2735
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:21,060
Fucking [inaudible] beat up a kid.

2736
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:22,690
Never beat up a fan.
It wouldn't

2737
02:32:22,690 --> 02:32:26,410
do it. This is stupid. I mean, if I'm
fighting someone's defend myself. No,

2738
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,190
I don't want,

2739
02:32:27,190 --> 02:32:30,970
I'm trying to make is 99% of the people
that come to the shows total down or

2740
02:32:30,971 --> 02:32:34,810
totally cool. Damn difference. That
little guy, that would be like,

2741
02:32:34,811 --> 02:32:37,360
if you had a 300 person
show to be three assholes,

2742
02:32:37,630 --> 02:32:39,850
every 300 persons shall be
three people screaming shit out.

2743
02:32:39,851 --> 02:32:41,980
It's more than 99 did
you gotta understand?

2744
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:46,810
Usually those people get kicked out in
the middle of it because I honestly,

2745
02:32:46,811 --> 02:32:50,740
hip hop shows, they have a lot of
ejections. Yeah, I'm still getting,

2746
02:32:50,890 --> 02:32:54,180
my show's going to get kicked out before
I get on stage, you know, get cold.

2747
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:58,390
There'll be heckling the guys on before
me and the the security of the venue.

2748
02:32:58,391 --> 02:32:59,950
We usually get rid of them
before I get up there.

2749
02:32:59,951 --> 02:33:02,810
Do you bring your own openness to
this stuff? Yeah, always. Okay.

2750
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:05,430
If you don't and you get stuck
with Shitty Comedians, Matt,

2751
02:33:05,431 --> 02:33:08,050
and you get stuck with dudes who
will step on your material too.

2752
02:33:08,051 --> 02:33:11,380
That's another thing that like bad comics
will do. Even if they're not stealing,

2753
02:33:11,381 --> 02:33:13,270
like say if you've got
a bit about Mike Tyson,

2754
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:16,960
they'll come up with a new bit about Mike
Tyson and just do it right before you

2755
02:33:16,961 --> 02:33:21,250
so that the subject is already stale by
the time he gets called stepping on your

2756
02:33:21,251 --> 02:33:24,670
material. We call it, we call
it set trippin. Uh, okay.

2757
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:27,340
Like you trip on someone's set,
like you take a piece of what they,

2758
02:33:27,460 --> 02:33:31,570
what they did on this set. Like maybe
it won't be exactly the same thing,

2759
02:33:31,571 --> 02:33:34,810
but you'll do the same call and response
to the audience again and again.

2760
02:33:35,050 --> 02:33:38,350
Or you'll have a verse or a song
about the same kind of thing.

2761
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:42,220
Or you'll give an introduction or a
speech about a song that has the same kind

2762
02:33:42,221 --> 02:33:46,120
of connotation that somebody else will,
and then that person,

2763
02:33:46,121 --> 02:33:48,850
then the headliner gets
on and we're almost like,

2764
02:33:48,880 --> 02:33:52,470
oh well we heard this already with your
kiddos. That was a, that was one man.

2765
02:33:52,471 --> 02:33:56,140
See his tricks and say you should do that.
Right before he would bring guys up,

2766
02:33:56,141 --> 02:34:00,090
he would do their best bits. Like he
did this, this dude Johnny Sanchez man.

2767
02:34:00,091 --> 02:34:03,280
It was a funny dude. He had
this great bit about um, uh,

2768
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:08,320
Iranians po and the been mad at him
for parking in their parking spot and

2769
02:34:08,321 --> 02:34:09,660
yelling at him in broken English.

2770
02:34:09,661 --> 02:34:12,730
He had this funny bit and men
see they were taping at TV,

2771
02:34:12,731 --> 02:34:15,760
show him and see what's hosting and he's
just jacked his bit and did it right

2772
02:34:15,761 --> 02:34:18,280
before him.
So this is closing bit

2773
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,850
and the dude's doing it right before
he goes up there and he's just like,

2774
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:26,770
he's got no weapons is going up there,
unarmed. He's been not only that,

2775
02:34:26,771 --> 02:34:27,610
he's going up there with the,

2776
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:31,630
with the emotional burden at this shithead
just stole a bit right before he goes

2777
02:34:31,631 --> 02:34:34,570
on stage and it was a,
that was what he would do.

2778
02:34:34,571 --> 02:34:36,160
Like you would see him
at the comedy store,

2779
02:34:36,161 --> 02:34:39,850
he would do one of Paul Mooneys bits and
then Moonee would go on later on in the

2780
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:43,060
night and do the same bit
instead of, you know, Mexicans,

2781
02:34:43,061 --> 02:34:45,640
he'd be talking about black people.
They would be the same bit.

2782
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:47,570
We already heard this star.

2783
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:51,910
Take the top and take it out and then
put the other thing in there. Yeah. Yeah.

2784
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:53,290
That's a,

2785
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:57,640
that's a very extreme form of
a stepping on your material,

2786
02:34:57,641 --> 02:34:59,350
but it happens all the time.

2787
02:34:59,350 --> 02:35:02,710
When guys I talked to guys to this day
that are on the road and there'll be the

2788
02:35:02,711 --> 02:35:05,200
headline or in the Middle Act
always wants to be the headliner.

2789
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:06,850
They'll want to one day be the headline.

2790
02:35:06,851 --> 02:35:09,080
They want to blow the headliner
off the stage. They love talent.

2791
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:12,160
People love saying, Oh, this
guy couldn't follow me. Yeah.

2792
02:35:12,161 --> 02:35:16,090
I middled forum in West Virginia and he
couldn't follow me. People love that.

2793
02:35:16,091 --> 02:35:19,330
So they'll, they'll fuck with you.
Like you have to bring your own guys.

2794
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:20,193
You want to bring,

2795
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:25,090
you don't want that sort of competitive
sense that backstab you bullshit.

2796
02:35:25,091 --> 02:35:25,900
That's no fun.

2797
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:30,010
So then you're really arranging is a
package deal for you and the other people

2798
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:34,210
that also ranging that the people go
on before me are really funny that that

2799
02:35:34,211 --> 02:35:36,460
goes without saying.
But the most important part to me,

2800
02:35:36,461 --> 02:35:39,940
because the worst thing you want to
do is go on after someone eats it.

2801
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:43,480
When you go on, after someone's
bombing on stage, it's sucks, man.

2802
02:35:43,481 --> 02:35:46,480
The crowd isn't a bad mommy
about it. Dude, tell me about it.

2803
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:47,770
They don't want to fucking,

2804
02:35:47,771 --> 02:35:51,250
they don't want to believe that they paid
money to see this asshole talk and you

2805
02:35:51,251 --> 02:35:55,690
got to do you. You're not coming in. And
also that associated would shoot as if,

2806
02:35:55,730 --> 02:36:00,130
oh, you brought this person, show me what
the nose suck. Yeah, they think you suck.

2807
02:36:00,310 --> 02:36:03,460
They think, and a lot of comics do
that though, man. They stack the deck.

2808
02:36:03,610 --> 02:36:06,520
They'll bring really shitty opening
acts to make them look like a hero.

2809
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:10,090
They come in and rescue it. A lot of
dudes do that. That bring terrible,

2810
02:36:10,091 --> 02:36:13,990
terrible opening acts
on purpose or people.

2811
02:36:14,110 --> 02:36:17,740
How about people who pay to open up?
Why? No, no, I've never heard of that.

2812
02:36:17,741 --> 02:36:18,970
But I know Tony Hinchcliffe.

2813
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:22,960
It's got to be opening up for a dude
and then the dude stopped using him and

2814
02:36:22,961 --> 02:36:25,030
started using a guy who
was way worse than him.

2815
02:36:25,030 --> 02:36:28,150
And the only thing that made any sense
was that he just thought Tony was too

2816
02:36:28,151 --> 02:36:31,150
strong. This, this guys
that do that, man, there's,

2817
02:36:31,180 --> 02:36:33,760
there's a few guys that do that
kind of shit. They want them,

2818
02:36:33,790 --> 02:36:36,430
they want to make sure they're the
star and then the guy before him,

2819
02:36:36,431 --> 02:36:37,480
it doesn't make it hard for them.

2820
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:41,500
The audience thing I was thinking of
by the way, it was, uh, I think, uh,

2821
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:45,340
Andy Kaufman used to do that.
Oh, did it. And that makes sense.

2822
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:48,330
Any Kaufman was more of a
performance art is a showman. Yeah.

2823
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:52,330
I never thought he was a funny
stand up cause he really wasn't.

2824
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:55,360
He was a really funny guy.
He was a great actor.

2825
02:36:55,510 --> 02:36:58,020
He was a fascinating character study.
You know,

2826
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,530
he did a lot of weird shit like he would,

2827
02:36:59,770 --> 02:37:03,580
he would work at Jerry's Deli when
he was on taxi, he was on tax,

2828
02:37:03,581 --> 02:37:07,870
he was on a hit sitcom and it would
work as a real busboy at Jerry's Deli.

2829
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:11,300
So he would go to Jerry's Deli and
like wait tables and like clean.

2830
02:37:11,550 --> 02:37:14,980
That's probably where he got a lot of
material need to fucking people that are

2831
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:18,950
rambling at some Deli table and some
shitbox place where he's working.

2832
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:21,140
I think it was more of
a performance art piece.

2833
02:37:21,430 --> 02:37:24,800
He wanted people to freak out the fact
that this guy who on the biggest hit

2834
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:26,990
television show on in America,

2835
02:37:28,380 --> 02:37:33,050
he was working washing tables. I
mean it was, it was, uh, he was like,

2836
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:38,360
he would read books on stage. Like he
would go on stage and play a mighty mouse.

2837
02:37:38,361 --> 02:37:41,430
Here I come to save the day over and
over and over again and just stand there

2838
02:37:41,431 --> 02:37:44,030
and go here where I can
call them to save the day.

2839
02:37:44,031 --> 02:37:46,490
And he would do it for like a half hour.
The He,

2840
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:49,670
it was like performance
art more even than it was.

2841
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:53,390
That does sound like some avant
garde bullshit. If I saw that,

2842
02:37:53,391 --> 02:37:57,230
if I paid fucking 24 with my dreams,

2843
02:37:57,530 --> 02:38:00,440
God knows what the fuck he was on.
Who's a d.

2844
02:38:00,441 --> 02:38:04,040
He did a lot of transcendental meditation.
I know that he was a big TM guy.

2845
02:38:04,490 --> 02:38:04,821
He might,

2846
02:38:04,821 --> 02:38:07,700
I think he might've actually been clean
and sober and just into really like

2847
02:38:07,701 --> 02:38:10,370
heavy meditation,
but he did a lot of crazy shit.

2848
02:38:10,371 --> 02:38:12,380
Like the thing he did
wear his wrestling women,

2849
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:19,190
well he would do pro wrestling and get
really slapped down by these guys and get

2850
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:22,820
beat up by these guys. He would challenge
them and then he would wrestle women.

2851
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:27,680
He would like, like say that he was
the Inter gender champion exclusively.

2852
02:38:27,681 --> 02:38:30,380
I'll fight any woman in there and they
would all go crazy thinking he was

2853
02:38:30,381 --> 02:38:33,580
serious. It was all performance
art, but it was, you know,

2854
02:38:33,590 --> 02:38:37,280
in that context it's undeniably genius.

2855
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:40,930
I mean what he did was
incredible stuff because just he,

2856
02:38:41,130 --> 02:38:44,810
he always lost by the way,
and he just made everybody angry.

2857
02:38:44,811 --> 02:38:47,120
I mean it was a performance,
like if he wanted to,

2858
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:49,430
he's scrawny is fucking all that good.

2859
02:38:49,431 --> 02:38:52,190
But if he really wanted to kick
that chick's acids, come on.

2860
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,960
She a small woman.
He's letting her be now.

2861
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:04,670
Well I'm not, and that's Bob's a Moodle.
Who's his friend who was a referee?

2862
02:39:04,690 --> 02:39:06,290
It's a joke.

2863
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:10,320
Let me get in my concerts. I've learned
a lot about it by just doing it,

2864
02:39:10,950 --> 02:39:12,660
but I wanted to,

2865
02:39:12,661 --> 02:39:17,661
can we capture the old days of the
carnivals where any before it in the main

2866
02:39:17,851 --> 02:39:18,570
room,

2867
02:39:18,570 --> 02:39:22,890
wrestlers used to go from town to town
and carnivals and all for $500 to any man

2868
02:39:22,891 --> 02:39:24,720
that could last in the ring
with them for three minutes.

2869
02:39:25,230 --> 02:39:28,560
So I figured if I could offer a
prize and make it like a contest,

2870
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:33,890
it can get, he gets to like grab women and
like, yeah, he's trying to pin her now.

2871
02:39:33,891 --> 02:39:35,090
He's actually pinning it for real.

2872
02:39:35,660 --> 02:39:36,630
But I couldn't probably,

2873
02:39:36,631 --> 02:39:39,180
well challenge men in the audience
because I'd get beaten. Right. Okay.

2874
02:39:39,390 --> 02:39:40,223
Right.

2875
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:45,130
Stronger than me.
So I figured if I challenge women,

2876
02:39:45,880 --> 02:39:49,390
there are enough women who are
almost as big or as big as me,

2877
02:39:49,510 --> 02:39:52,000
who they would have a
good chance to beat me.

2878
02:39:53,630 --> 02:39:58,380
I love that he said that with a straight
face. Joe, what was his alter ego?

2879
02:39:58,381 --> 02:40:00,380
His name?
Tony.

2880
02:40:03,330 --> 02:40:07,960
Tony Clifton. Clifton. Tony
Clifton. Yeah. Which was
actually, yeah, that was his, uh,

2881
02:40:08,070 --> 02:40:10,440
was bombs and mood. It's still
does Tony Clifton, right.

2882
02:40:10,660 --> 02:40:14,160
He still puts on like an outfit. Pretends
he's Tony Clifton says Tony Clifton.

2883
02:40:14,710 --> 02:40:18,450
It is like a whole cult, cult Deb. A
few, but I believe that he's still alive.

2884
02:40:18,451 --> 02:40:19,720
Right? Yeah. People believe crop.

2885
02:40:19,970 --> 02:40:23,360
Well, they believe everybody's alive.
Tupacs so I've Kennedy still alive.

2886
02:40:23,361 --> 02:40:25,100
I've heard Elvis is still alive.

2887
02:40:25,470 --> 02:40:29,050
Nobody late. Bruce Lee. I've
heard that one yet. See, so

2888
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:35,290
did you get in an argument with Tupac
when he was alive back in the day? Well,

2889
02:40:35,291 --> 02:40:39,730
we were teenagers. I wouldn't necessarily
call it an reo when argument, you know?

2890
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:42,120
Okay.

2891
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:45,540
So that's a no, Brian,
luckily. And uh, you know,

2892
02:40:45,541 --> 02:40:48,480
luckily we talked about it before he
passed, so everything is all good.

2893
02:40:48,530 --> 02:40:52,250
That's, that's nice. Yeah.
That's good. That must be an
interesting thing though. No,

2894
02:40:52,280 --> 02:40:55,400
dude like that man, you
know? Right. For sure.

2895
02:40:56,660 --> 02:41:00,500
That's an interesting thing, right?
Think about it. You know that dude,

2896
02:41:00,501 --> 02:41:03,350
and then he vanished one of the
greatest rappers ever. Right.

2897
02:41:03,890 --> 02:41:07,760
And then gone and then still,
no one knows who killed him.

2898
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,760
That's what's really crazy about it.
One of the most crazy things ever.

2899
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:14,410
Yeah. The, the whole thing, the whole
thing, the biggie thing. Like it's like,

2900
02:41:16,400 --> 02:41:19,660
oh, miss and not talking to not be
solved. You know what I mean? Yeah,

2901
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:23,820
yeah. How could it not be solved?
Right. How could it not be solved?

2902
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:24,990
How was it possible?

2903
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:28,410
How's it humanly possible that in
2014 that hasn't been resolved?

2904
02:41:28,650 --> 02:41:31,330
And then what you ever read that rolling
stone piece on the whole thing, right.

2905
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:35,730
Find out the rampart guys were all
corrupt us. Fucking crazy, man.

2906
02:41:36,660 --> 02:41:40,140
It's, it's an interesting
too that that era of, of rap,

2907
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:44,190
like those were the two prominent
personalities. And both of them died.

2908
02:41:44,650 --> 02:41:49,300
Shootouts. You know what a
fucked up situation. Yup.

2909
02:41:49,460 --> 02:41:54,240
Like does he know about, yeah,
we're just talking about that. Yeah.

2910
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:56,040
No,
that's crazy man.

2911
02:41:56,041 --> 02:42:00,690
To think that you know in the
middle of the Strip in Vegas.

2912
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:02,440
Yeah. Yeah. Especially in Vegas

2913
02:42:03,220 --> 02:42:07,460
with all, with all the
surveillance cameras is when
everything was crazy. Yeah.

2914
02:42:07,461 --> 02:42:10,160
It's insane. It's insane to
think that no one caught anybody.

2915
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:13,160
No one caught anybody.
Her read something about the guy.

2916
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,900
I can't recall the guy's name,

2917
02:42:14,901 --> 02:42:18,140
the guy who last year I was
involved with the whole,

2918
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:21,110
he ended up being found in the bear
mountain and he burned them out.

2919
02:42:21,170 --> 02:42:23,930
The former police officer,
some kind of way.

2920
02:42:23,931 --> 02:42:28,931
There was an intermingling with rampart
and that and that whole situation much

2921
02:42:29,060 --> 02:42:29,760
more recent.

2922
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:34,290
He was a police officer after that,
but this without a doubt,

2923
02:42:34,291 --> 02:42:38,280
if there was the kind of level of
corruption that rampart it had,

2924
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:41,910
there has to be something left over.
I mean the idea that they cleaned it off,

2925
02:42:41,911 --> 02:42:46,230
spic and span and nice and pretty
clean and polished it up and the old no

2926
02:42:46,231 --> 02:42:49,260
whatsoever. No having problems.
Now with the sheriff's department,

2927
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:50,330
are they in what way?

2928
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:54,810
Leave Bucca same thing that they have
like an inner culture within the sheriff

2929
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:58,140
and they favored certain police
officers and certain people,

2930
02:42:58,141 --> 02:42:59,160
especially with the whole,

2931
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:02,580
since the sheriff controls the
jail systems in California,

2932
02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:04,170
so a lot of them are getting,

2933
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:07,350
you know what corruption and
bribery and it happens man.

2934
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:12,280
Ultimate power corrupts just nothing.
There's no way around it. Just basically

2935
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,890
Chevrolet Bucca knew about it and
just turn, turn the cheek on it,

2936
02:43:14,980 --> 02:43:18,040
you know what I mean? He did the Joe
Paterno basically. I mean, you know,

2937
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:19,240
and the thing is is they,

2938
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:24,330
they caught like a core of them and
they have like what happened is internal

2939
02:43:25,301 --> 02:43:27,910
affairs hired an inmate
and he's an informant.

2940
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:32,740
So the enemy was getting cell phones,
drugs.

2941
02:43:33,570 --> 02:43:37,480
Oh.
So they actually got an inmate to be yeah.

2942
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:42,430
And basically gave up the sheriff
and they kept finding out.

2943
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:44,860
So they build a whole case it,
you know, a few years about it.

2944
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:48,850
And what they did is the sheriff move
the inmate and they couldn't locate him.

2945
02:43:48,970 --> 02:43:53,860
His attorney or his handler
couldn't locate him inside
the jail system. So they,

2946
02:43:53,950 --> 02:43:54,270
you know,
the,

2947
02:43:54,270 --> 02:43:57,190
if finally the pressure came to sheriff
Lee Baca and he just basically turned

2948
02:43:57,191 --> 02:43:59,800
the cheek and it took them for a while,
like they start harassing him.

2949
02:43:59,801 --> 02:44:02,980
Like he got really, really serious because
his, his handler couldn't find them.

2950
02:44:02,981 --> 02:44:04,990
Like, what do you mean you can't
find them inside the jail system?

2951
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:07,850
Wow. That's interesting man. Yeah,

2952
02:44:07,851 --> 02:44:11,510
I think that's going to be real hard
to do their, their whole culture,

2953
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:15,410
the culture of law enforcement is having
to adapt. Yeah. It's a whole different,

2954
02:44:15,500 --> 02:44:19,400
it has to adapt because people find
out about shit way quicker today.

2955
02:44:19,401 --> 02:44:23,840
It's so easy to spread the news, social
media, camera, camera people like,

2956
02:44:23,870 --> 02:44:28,310
I can't imagine all the
abuses motherfuckers got
away with before this camera.

2957
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:32,940
Think about it as the actual phone that
they snuck in and gave to him and he was

2958
02:44:32,941 --> 02:44:36,010
sending to inmates was where a lot of
that evidence was coming in front of you.

2959
02:44:36,011 --> 02:44:39,360
Cause the phone and he's taking
pictures of everything. Whites. Wow.

2960
02:44:39,361 --> 02:44:41,230
It's already inside,
you know?

2961
02:44:42,530 --> 02:44:43,430
Well,
you know,

2962
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:45,950
it's gonna be harder and harder for
those motherfuckers to do shit like that.

2963
02:44:45,951 --> 02:44:47,360
But if there's any where they're
gonna be able to pull it off,

2964
02:44:47,361 --> 02:44:50,240
it is in prison where they can
control people. So, so in every case,

2965
02:44:50,250 --> 02:44:53,890
the sale and then, you know,
it was when Joe was locked. Um,

2966
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:58,460
he was telling me crazy story that at
that federal prison where he was at,

2967
02:44:58,490 --> 02:45:02,780
they said that there was a scandal
where like the, the guards had,

2968
02:45:02,781 --> 02:45:07,060
the female CEO's have been selling
pussy to inmates. That's so common.

2969
02:45:07,061 --> 02:45:11,190
It's like four or 5,000 a pounds of,
when we had Victor Conte,

2970
02:45:11,191 --> 02:45:13,100
he was the guy who got busted
the ball called scandal.

2971
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:16,100
Remember that with Barry Bonds
and their salaries got steroids.

2972
02:45:16,490 --> 02:45:19,550
He was in prison and they were,
they were all banging this, the,

2973
02:45:19,551 --> 02:45:23,450
the female guards that female
guards returning tricks. Wow.

2974
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:26,540
That's crazy. I love it.
That's American ingenuity.

2975
02:45:26,560 --> 02:45:30,350
You're in the middle of nowhere. You
know, what do those guys need? Pussy.

2976
02:45:30,351 --> 02:45:34,110
What'd she have to sell puts? Hey,
let's make a deal. Let's make a deal.

2977
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:36,920
Husband is somewhere like you
were watching her husband.

2978
02:45:36,950 --> 02:45:39,770
They probably fucking selling
ass both of them together.

2979
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:44,430
They work in the same institution.
Hey, easy. She was just,

2980
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:49,430
what does that bad am I lying?
Joe's no gay people in jail.

2981
02:45:49,431 --> 02:45:52,290
The want a good blow job from
a nice security guy. Oh God,

2982
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:53,270
I'm going to have to frisk you.

2983
02:45:53,271 --> 02:45:56,470
They about probably had like a little game
with their play. Keeping it real goes,

2984
02:45:56,480 --> 02:45:59,350
what are you going to first? What
are your real goals? Way Wrong.

2985
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:02,810
Don't make me suck it. I'm a, I'm
an officer of the law. You suck it.

2986
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:06,770
Give the guy a fat envelope that
he had been hiding up his ass.

2987
02:46:07,220 --> 02:46:10,880
Is that a security is a female
security guard that you have to fuck,

2988
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,000
but you know what? You would take it man.
If you were locked up for a long time,

2989
02:46:14,001 --> 02:46:18,290
that that's better than
nothing. Sure. Yeah,

2990
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:22,520
so girls who would never be able to
sell pussy on the outside on the inside,

2991
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:24,170
it's a valuable commodity.

2992
02:46:25,970 --> 02:46:30,970
Their Miss America text checked out
every too many images in his head.

2993
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:35,090
This was one podcast you could
tell flabbergasted. Shocked.

2994
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:39,680
It's just funny because every time I
turn around you got to get Brian to stop

2995
02:46:39,681 --> 02:46:40,720
putting shit up there.
You're like,

2996
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:45,960
that's part of the fun part of the show
is contracting me to understand society

2997
02:46:48,081 --> 02:46:50,300
craves conflict.
You can't just have a smooth running show.

2998
02:46:50,301 --> 02:46:51,170
You have to have some things.

2999
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:55,580
Brian Interior drunk come and do
the openers for Joe Sometimes. Uh,

3000
02:46:55,581 --> 02:46:58,460
he's still alive now. I have it
don't once in a while. All right,

3001
02:46:58,490 --> 02:47:01,490
so he does comedy on his own. You
bring, you bring your own openers,

3002
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:04,210
your little homies too. Yeah. Okay. Dues.

3003
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:06,510
Do you set them up like
any hecklers and shit like

3004
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:13,040
that shit would be so obvious,
man. No, it wouldn't do, oh listen.

3005
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:16,700
It wouldn't be a smart thing to do first
of all because it would be fake and

3006
02:47:16,701 --> 02:47:19,380
then the, the fake vibe would
get out there somehow or another,

3007
02:47:19,381 --> 02:47:21,620
they would sneak through the
fucking button. If it's part of,

3008
02:47:21,621 --> 02:47:24,950
show me the performance. If you're not
doing it to get to what you're doing.

3009
02:47:25,080 --> 02:47:26,000
It depends on what you're doing.

3010
02:47:26,090 --> 02:47:30,350
I mean you can set up something in the
audience where you have like a fake fight

3011
02:47:30,351 --> 02:47:33,560
with somebody and the whole thing
is like, yeah, you could do it.

3012
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:38,690
But the way I feel about standup when I,
if I went to see Joey Diaz,

3013
02:47:38,691 --> 02:47:39,170
okay,

3014
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:43,850
it was my favorite comedian and if Joey
Diaz had someone go on in the audience

3015
02:47:43,851 --> 02:47:46,500
and fake heckle him and he
had all these canned lines,

3016
02:47:46,550 --> 02:47:48,650
he threw it that and I
thought it was brilliant.

3017
02:47:48,770 --> 02:47:53,060
But then I found out that it was
fake. I would be, I would feel sick.

3018
02:47:53,270 --> 02:47:55,940
I'd feel grossed out if I ever did that.

3019
02:47:55,941 --> 02:47:59,810
I would feel sick if I ever like tricked
a bunch of people to think that I came

3020
02:47:59,811 --> 02:48:03,350
up with a smooth line when when someone
heckles me and I come up with something

3021
02:48:03,351 --> 02:48:06,530
on the fly and it nails them and
then they look really stupid.

3022
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:07,550
That's like an art.

3023
02:48:07,790 --> 02:48:11,270
There's an art to finding the right
thing to say at the right time.

3024
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:12,470
We were in Ohio,

3025
02:48:12,471 --> 02:48:17,120
we had this fucking dude took his shirt
off and he was standing in the crowd

3026
02:48:17,121 --> 02:48:21,140
with his shirt off. I mean it was, you
couldn't, you couldn't plant a better guy.

3027
02:48:21,141 --> 02:48:23,120
I think I saw that as a video.

3028
02:48:23,121 --> 02:48:26,630
The dude was crazy and Brian and I saw
him hours later, like after the show.

3029
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:29,030
I mean I hugged the guy and everything.
I mean he wasn't a violent guy,

3030
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:33,440
but someone decided to like take advantage
of the fact that it was this loud guy

3031
02:48:33,441 --> 02:48:34,730
and they'd beat the shit out of him.

3032
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:37,700
We found him when we were getting to
our car like two o'clock in the morning,

3033
02:48:37,850 --> 02:48:40,990
we were leaving that steak and
shake. Right. We had eight and we,

3034
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,700
we've got to our car and
this dude was fucked up man.

3035
02:48:43,701 --> 02:48:47,660
His eyes bloody blood common all over
his fucking, all over his clothes.

3036
02:48:47,661 --> 02:48:52,100
He was somebody who just beat the shit
out of him, man for heckling. Yeah.

3037
02:48:52,101 --> 02:48:55,280
Well probably this is the guy. Look, you
guys got no shirt on and the audience

3038
02:49:01,190 --> 02:49:02,023
with his finger.

3039
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:08,250
Oh Damn Yard.

3040
02:49:08,350 --> 02:49:09,183
Hey,

3041
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:16,410
that's that is that guy personified.
It's got no shirt on fucking dues.

3042
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:20,760
I wish we got the video of him
fucked up later in the night.

3043
02:49:21,010 --> 02:49:24,720
We should do like a bloody pulp
because it would have been so perfect.

3044
02:49:24,721 --> 02:49:27,210
The perfect way to end that video.
Somebody who gets tuned him up,

3045
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,660
it was a free shot because he was so
drunk they could take advantage of it.

3046
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:32,370
You guys got to leave. We've got
to wrap this thing up. Anyway,

3047
02:49:32,500 --> 02:49:33,900
we're running up the top five,
10 minutes.

3048
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:37,200
I wanted to ask you one thing before
we go. We only have five minutes left,

3049
02:49:37,201 --> 02:49:38,700
but um, you, you were,

3050
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:42,600
you specialized like in ancient
history and you're, you're,

3051
02:49:42,610 --> 02:49:46,020
you're really a big fan
of like ancient cultures.

3052
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:49,210
Have you paid attention to any of this
go Beckley Tepi Shit that they're finding

3053
02:49:49,211 --> 02:49:53,850
in Turkey? What the, the arc? No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go.

3054
02:49:53,851 --> 02:49:57,150
Beckley Tapi is a new
structure that they found.

3055
02:49:57,151 --> 02:49:59,250
It was like a cattle herder
or something like that.

3056
02:49:59,251 --> 02:50:02,110
Found this stone and uncovered it,

3057
02:50:02,220 --> 02:50:05,410
like kicked some dirt around on it and
then started digging around it and they

3058
02:50:05,411 --> 02:50:08,130
realize it's massive.
Called in some people,

3059
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:13,220
they found out that the whole area had
been filled with dirt on purpose at the

3060
02:50:13,501 --> 02:50:16,980
very earliest 12,000 years ago.
Right?

3061
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:21,090
So it's at least 12,000 years old
and that's when it was fully covered.

3062
02:50:21,091 --> 02:50:25,940
That's one was filled in and it's this
huge gigantic structure because I think a

3063
02:50:25,950 --> 02:50:30,480
Iran, all these look like there's some
images of what they've discovered so far.

3064
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:33,180
Why are fucking images loading so slow?
What is it,

3065
02:50:33,181 --> 02:50:36,360
1990 it's just a fucking
geo cities website.

3066
02:50:37,890 --> 02:50:42,090
There's um, gigantic, 19 foot
tall stone columns, the, all the,

3067
02:50:42,091 --> 02:50:45,270
all these reliefs, three d reliefs of
these animals that are drawn on it.

3068
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:48,940
But this whole thing throws
the origins or the, the,

3069
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:51,710
the dates of civilization into a,

3070
02:50:51,711 --> 02:50:55,410
a kind of a chaotic situation
because it's so old.

3071
02:50:55,560 --> 02:50:57,960
It's at a time where they thought
people would just basically hunter and

3072
02:50:57,961 --> 02:51:00,180
gatherers and these hundred gathers,

3073
02:51:00,181 --> 02:51:03,180
created these enormous stone
structures is really complex thing.

3074
02:51:03,330 --> 02:51:07,020
Like all his carvings on it.
And these are three d reliefs,

3075
02:51:07,030 --> 02:51:10,890
meaning that they took the stone away,
they cut it away to make this image.

3076
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:13,680
They didn't carve it into this stone,
which would be the easy way to do it.

3077
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:17,220
They carved the stone out and left
the three dimensional image of these,

3078
02:51:17,300 --> 02:51:21,210
you know, animals and they've
only uncovered 5% of it so far,

3079
02:51:21,211 --> 02:51:25,800
and it's fucking enormous, enormous
stone structure that was covered up.

3080
02:51:25,801 --> 02:51:29,980
So they know for a fact that, and this
is in central Turkey, it's in, uh,

3081
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:34,530
it's an area called Gold Beckley,
Beckley, Tempe. I don't know. Um, I don't,

3082
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:35,513
I know that the,

3083
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:37,020
it was,

3084
02:51:37,020 --> 02:51:41,460
there was a civilization called the
Hittites that lived in central Turkey and

3085
02:51:41,550 --> 02:51:43,800
they had this site Hook Tusha.

3086
02:51:43,860 --> 02:51:48,860
And what I think is interesting about
that is that it was totally in it,

3087
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:52,260
miles and miles away from water.
In other words,

3088
02:51:52,261 --> 02:51:57,261
most of these civilizations take place
near some sort of river near some sort of

3089
02:51:57,631 --> 02:51:59,880
stream.
But the ironic thing about this,

3090
02:51:59,881 --> 02:52:04,470
civilizations existed for thousands of
years in Turkey and yet there was no

3091
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:06,160
water that was physically

3092
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:07,840
near it.
There was like 50 miles away.

3093
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:11,380
So you're going to tell me every single
day someone rode 50 miles to get water.

3094
02:52:11,560 --> 02:52:14,920
And they were saying what was going on
was probably that there was an internal

3095
02:52:14,921 --> 02:52:19,450
spring that allowed for there to be
water inside a city for it to flourish to

3096
02:52:19,451 --> 02:52:22,570
the level it did. Could be, they
also had an irrigation back then too.

3097
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:25,840
Well that is one, one suggestion,
but they didn't have an aqueduct.

3098
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:28,730
The similar to the way
people look at them in,

3099
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:32,800
in Roman times and I guess they may
have diverted water through a stream or,

3100
02:52:33,070 --> 02:52:34,270
or by damming a river.

3101
02:52:34,480 --> 02:52:39,100
But whatever the case may be is I think
people are going to start finding more

3102
02:52:39,101 --> 02:52:41,320
and more of these things
as time progresses.

3103
02:52:41,530 --> 02:52:45,120
And I think what we're talking
about also is that, uh,

3104
02:52:45,250 --> 02:52:48,430
not just on land but also on,
see, you know what I mean? In,

3105
02:52:48,431 --> 02:52:53,230
in the seat when you go underwater.
People found recently that there were, uh,

3106
02:52:53,290 --> 02:52:56,580
ancient Egyptian civilizations are people
in the Middle Eastern Mediterranean,

3107
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:58,210
but it existed for like three,

3108
02:52:58,211 --> 02:53:01,990
4,000 years that have been buried because
in reality there were probably plenty

3109
02:53:01,991 --> 02:53:05,860
of places that were above sea level,
you know, 10,000 years ago. Oh,

3110
02:53:05,861 --> 02:53:07,210
no question about it. The, the, the,

3111
02:53:07,211 --> 02:53:12,100
the tide or rather the ocean's levels
have risen and fallen fruit. No doubt,

3112
02:53:12,130 --> 02:53:14,590
no doubt, no question.
You know, but besides rap,

3113
02:53:14,591 --> 02:53:17,350
I started writing a book
recently and then one of them,

3114
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:21,760
I'm specifically going to be able to deal
with this specific fact and, and the,

3115
02:53:21,890 --> 02:53:26,080
the history of humankind that is
severely underwritten. I mean,

3116
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:29,650
this is what you're writing a history
book and that wouldn't say what's not a

3117
02:53:29,651 --> 02:53:31,390
history book.
It's more like a book of philosophy.

3118
02:53:31,690 --> 02:53:34,090
It's more like a book of philosophies,
you know what I mean?

3119
02:53:34,090 --> 02:53:38,940
And it's a little humorous, you know
what I mean? It couldn't, cause I, I,

3120
02:53:39,030 --> 02:53:44,030
I want to show people the
sort of perpetual hypocrisy
that we're willing to live

3121
02:53:44,171 --> 02:53:47,460
in, that people have always lived
in some ways. I mean, there were,

3122
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:52,090
but not only that we live in, but that
we're willing to live in. You know, it's,

3123
02:53:52,091 --> 02:53:54,460
it reminds me of a quote from Mark
Twain where he's like, you know,

3124
02:53:54,461 --> 02:53:57,670
the difference between writing fiction
and writing reality is that you have to

3125
02:53:57,671 --> 02:53:59,950
make reality seem believable.
You know,

3126
02:53:59,951 --> 02:54:04,480
because it's so preposterous that you
have to include some sort of element that

3127
02:54:04,481 --> 02:54:05,560
brings it home,

3128
02:54:05,650 --> 02:54:09,430
similar to the way that a comedian will
criticize society and then talk about

3129
02:54:09,431 --> 02:54:12,550
how fucked up it is. And at the end
of it say, Hey, well guess what?

3130
02:54:12,910 --> 02:54:13,970
I'm just as fucked.

3131
02:54:13,971 --> 02:54:17,650
And you know how I know it's this fucking
bad because I'm part of this fucked up

3132
02:54:17,651 --> 02:54:21,010
society. And that's the ironic part of the
joke, cause that, you know what I mean?

3133
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:24,900
Oh No, no, no, no. I'm the coca sub
and I'm going to go get a coke now.

3134
02:54:24,901 --> 02:54:27,640
So fuck all the rest of you
because that's just how it is.

3135
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:31,990
I think that when you look at
civilizations in the human development,

3136
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:36,460
you find just a series of,
of,

3137
02:54:36,510 --> 02:54:40,980
of pure savagery and then you
find a nobleman and strange and,

3138
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:44,620
and almost irreconcilable
places within that society.

3139
02:54:44,770 --> 02:54:48,730
So when I look at them over
the course of human evolution,

3140
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:52,420
I really wanted to address that.
And the fact that, you know, yes,

3141
02:54:52,421 --> 02:54:57,421
we're a civilization of talking monkeys
that have achieved some sort of growth

3142
02:54:57,460 --> 02:55:02,050
over the years, whether it's through
grooming because we place a gigantic,

3143
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:05,690
uh, we place a gigantic amount
of value on how were groomed.

3144
02:55:05,870 --> 02:55:09,350
We placed a gigantic amount of value
on our superstitions. In other words,

3145
02:55:09,351 --> 02:55:11,540
if I believe something and you
don't believe the same thing,

3146
02:55:11,720 --> 02:55:15,440
I'm threatened by your belief system,
not you or me specifically,

3147
02:55:15,710 --> 02:55:19,700
but in terms of how we communicate and
how we've communicated over the years.

3148
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:20,180
Now,

3149
02:55:20,180 --> 02:55:23,570
has that always been a positive thing
or has it always been a negative thing?

3150
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:24,021
Well,

3151
02:55:24,021 --> 02:55:28,160
when we were dividing ourselves among
different actual races like homo erectus

3152
02:55:28,161 --> 02:55:29,120
or Homo Habilis,

3153
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:32,570
then maybe it was a positive thing to
not include these people in our society

3154
02:55:32,571 --> 02:55:32,870
because,

3155
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:36,590
or these animals are hominids
in our society because it
wouldn't created a bunch

3156
02:55:36,591 --> 02:55:39,590
of different strand of humanity.
Dude, you need a podcast of your own

3157
