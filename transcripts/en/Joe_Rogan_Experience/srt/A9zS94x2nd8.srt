1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,040
Her low freak bitches to
call this my only master.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,630
The cold is my only teacher.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,860
And the breathing.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,910
When you say you altered
your breathing pattern,

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:11,101
it's like,

6
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,540
what do you mean exactly?

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,510
Like,

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,343
uh,

9
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,170
when I went in at a certain point,

10
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,790
I knew how to be,

11
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,121
you know,

12
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:18,954
very,

13
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,411
uh,

14
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,130
relaxed.

15
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,401
Go,

16
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,310
went in and done latec a cold car,

17
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,370
impact a go within and then begin
breathing deeper and then a certain dance

18
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,900
between the cold and you breathe,

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,860
a breath begins to start up,

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,480
begins to charge your body.

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,380
And after 25 breaths like that,

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,270
very conscious in the cold,

23
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:53,271
the cold is a forest and it has his impact
and you go along with a cold and what

24
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:58,320
it does in the Fisher on the
physiology and you use your breathing.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,350
Now I know what happens physiologically,

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,050
but then those days it was all by feeling.

27
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,400
And after it does happen physiologically
or you become a fully charged,

28
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,861
eh,

29
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,040
the carbon dioxide goes out,

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,600
eh,

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
oh to get begins to roam freely throughout
the body and fields up every cell and

32
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,090
the Ph levels go up.

33
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,380
Now when you,

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,390
when you say you altered your breathing,

35
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:24,471
we,

36
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:26,820
what you're showing me here is just
breathing in and breathing out.

37
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:30,240
Like what is split specifically different
about that than normal breathing?

38
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,710
Eh,

39
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,180
the way I used it,

40
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,453
uh,

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,080
W it was like after 25 breaths,

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,110
Eh,

43
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,780
it was so fully charged.

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,013
Uh,

45
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,363
I,

46
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,160
I could stay like five to seven
minutes under the ice every time.

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,240
Very controlled.

48
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
And that means that there is not only a
whole lot of oxygen inside the body in

49
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,480
the,

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,280
but the Ph levels go up.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,370
Now there's a,

52
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,710
later on I began to
understand by signs by,

53
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,030
by thinking about it.

54
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,500
And then,

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:03,840
uh,

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,050
yeah,

57
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,370
the ducting and all that.

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,870
I,

59
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,890
I saw that,

60
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,813
uh,

61
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,850
that we are able to
tap into the brainstem,

62
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,780
the adrenaline we showed lying in bed,

63
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:18,840
people producing more adrenalin.

64
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,470
Now I know how to show to
people just in a couple of days.

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,000
That means every listener
right now is able to do that.

66
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,190
So we have proven this scientifically
and it showed that people lying in bed

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,250
were able to produce more adrenaline
than somebody in fear going for its first

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,533
Pankaj jump,

69
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,883
bungee jump.

70
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,080
And when you're still,

71
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,170
I'm still confused as to how you're,

72
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,580
you're doing anything differently
other than deep breathing.

73
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,230
You're taking a deep breathe in,

74
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,150
deep breathe out.

75
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,940
And now we retained from
breathing after exhalation.

76
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,970
Retent uh,

77
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,570
we stopped breathing after acceleration.

78
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,370
Breathe in like,

79
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:00,550
well,

80
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,241
show me the method,

81
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,310
like if a view,

82
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,710
if you'll go with me
all right at 30 times.

83
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,703
Okay,

84
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,020
go foully and we're once
again fully in letting go

85
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,620
right on fully and but Latin go,

86
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,240
not fully out chess in Europe,

87
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,323
but fully yet.

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,953
Once again,

89
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,273
I want it to go,

90
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,360
come on,

91
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,470
don't hesitate.

92
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,363
Give it.

93
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,230
It's about changing the
chemistry right now in your body.

94
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
So I'm breathing.

95
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,534
If you keep going,

96
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,470
you'll be cut.

97
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,460
Become lightheaded.

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,120
And at a certain point you're so fully
charged and ph levels go to a very high

99
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:46,990
level.

100
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,360
You're able to stay without eh,

101
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,920
in the long four minutes.

102
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,073
Okay.

103
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,410
Just keep on that
feeling is understanding.

104
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,863
Go on,

105
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,520
Andy.

106
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Plan lighting go deeply yet letting go
deeply in and go 10 times more deeply in

107
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,990
that didn't go deeply in letting go.

108
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,520
I'm going to time it laddering,

109
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,740
go deeply and daddy go have it fully.

110
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,073
Take him in,

111
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,133
letting go.

112
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,393
Take Command,

113
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,200
letting and go take him in ladder and go,

114
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,220
no hesitation.

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,120
I do this with the ovary and Matt
as well and it feels wonderful.

116
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,053
Day Command.

117
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,101
Who are they?

118
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,934
Letting go.

119
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,361
Okay,

120
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,010
five times more deeply and letting go.

121
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,660
Letting go deeply and
let it go two times more.

122
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,620
Letting go and stop.

123
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,320
Okay,

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,120
just top witness without and the lungs.

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,780
You are able to stay much more
than normally that normally.

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,101
Why?

127
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,000
Because we change.

128
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,834
He'll chemistry.

129
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,460
Carbon dioxide went out,

130
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,560
oh two went up,

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,993
failed up,

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,970
all the sounds and the Ph levels go up.

133
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,050
Then we are able to tap into their
central nervous system and that Dan,

134
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,890
that we got the brainstem and that's
the place of the pineal gland.

135
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,910
Hypothalamus,

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,240
pituitary gland and the pineal gland
makes the secretion of Adrenalin in

137
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,410
dangerous situations.

138
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,330
Normally we do not get into it
because of of our shallow breathing,

139
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
but this is the way to get into the most
primitive part of the reptilian brain

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,380
without many and fend off bacteria
getting better into the endocrine systems.

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,850
We talk about it later,

142
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,670
you know pastor one one 10 in
minutes and you're still on.

143
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,870
That shows that the capacity to
fail yourself up with the oxygen,

144
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,890
there's a lot more than we normally
use and as we do not use it,

145
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:27,020
we are not making use of the full
capacity of our faith physiology.

146
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,030
Now we found out we got a different
layers and we never use it and this is the

147
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,950
way to learn to use it to tap in
and bang into the primitive brain,

148
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,780
into the endocrine systems,

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,860
immune systems,

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,110
the way nature has mandate to be.

151
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Everybody is able to do it one
45 and this is only round one.

152
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,210
If it would do like three rounds,

153
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,860
you would go to three minutes,

154
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,750
four minutes without air,

155
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,890
without training.

156
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,990
It only shows the capacity
to store up oxygen inside.

157
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,430
We never use that.

158
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,850
You're doing great.

159
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,060
He is doing already to two five almost
to 10 whenever you feel the urge to

160
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:10,910
breathe,

161
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,661
you don't need to.

162
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:16,070
Force is only learning how to Oksana
Joey's the body and the oldest south.

163
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,291
You're going Greg,

164
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,124
man,

165
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,460
now he's a field.

166
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:21,830
Good,

167
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,663
Huh?

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,600
Yeah,

169
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,901
yeah,

170
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,201
yeah.

171
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,034
That's okay.

172
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,900
Two 30 Oh

173
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,360
yeah.

174
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,650
When you feel the urge to breathe,

175
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,460
you breathe in fully and
keep it for 10 15 seconds,

176
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,750
then that's one round.

177
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,163
Boolean.

178
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,083
And keep it.

179
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,000
And how will you press your belly?

180
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,250
The neck and then the hat

181
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,370
and now you are able to
tap into the brainstem.

182
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,563
Yeah,

183
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,541
yeah.

184
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,374
That's him.

185
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,710
If we would do it again,

186
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,573
you would.

187
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,020
Yeah.

188
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,230
No,

189
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,600
it was very light headed.

190
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,690
What's interesting is that
breathing the breathing in for sure.

191
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,470
So w w two to explain to people at home,

192
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,130
what I'm doing is I'm breathing in
all the ways is deeply as I can,

193
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,870
but I'm not breathing out all the way.

194
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,380
Yeah.

195
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,980
I'm just breathing out a little bit and
then I'm breathing in more and I'm just

196
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:18,800
reading out a little bit and I'm breathing
in more and breathing out a little

197
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,310
bit.

198
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
And if you breathe,

200
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,850
breathe in completely,

201
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,070
you got all the oxygen possible inside.

202
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,680
If you're just allowed to go,

203
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,360
then you get to,

204
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:29,960
uh,

205
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,600
where the exchange of the gasses happen.

206
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,640
And this is the way a bass to
Oksana [inaudible] the body.

207
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,310
So,

208
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,950
uh,

209
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,850
it's a different way to get into the
chemistry of the body and where we have

210
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,684
shown this.

211
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,460
Okay.
