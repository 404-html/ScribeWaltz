1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,150
The joe rogan experience.
How does Larry David handle it?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,900
He's not bad.
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,180
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of,

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,014
oh,
thank you.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
You know?
But yeah,

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,030
I've seen them go through,
because it was,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,420
I saw him become famous,
you know,

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,240
he was on Fridays.
He created Seinfeld,

9
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,060
but that still wasn't the fame that he
has now.

10
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:26,380
So I saw him through curb your
enthusiasm become truly iconic.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,800
So he's had trouble figuring out how to,
people want to take a picture of people,

12
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:33,630
you know?
Well,

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,800
how do I do it?
And it's always changing.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,710
He's never an asshole.
It's truly one of the greatest comedy

15
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:40,000
shows of all time.
Well,

16
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:40,661
thank you.
Oh,

17
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:43,960
100% and I have to say the new season
we're about to film in October,

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,230
the storyline may be my favorite,
and it's really subtle and fun.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,730
It's like one of those things like,
oh,

20
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:52,600
I,
it's like,

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,220
I think people watching it will feel
that they're living a fantasy and after

22
00:00:57,221 --> 00:01:00,280
the first one airs,
I'm happy to come back and talk about

23
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:00,820
it.

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,340
You know what I mean?
Because that premise of where we're

25
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:08,170
going is delightful.
I love how hbo gives him sort of carte

26
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,004
blanche.
They're like,

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,450
you know,
take a couple of years off,

28
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,800
do whatever the fuck you want.
Like,

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,630
you know,
take some pretty great,

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,030
well for Larry,
it's not about the money.

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,180
Of course,
it's about can I do another good show?

32
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,210
And that makes us different than most
shows in history.

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,740
Yeah.
And uh,

34
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:24,610
he,
um,

35
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,910
he only wants to do good work and enjoy
himself.

36
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,810
Otherwise there's no reason.
And uh,

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,330
an HBO is smart that way.
They're genius.

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,460
I mean,
look,

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,460
you think about the show soprano's
fucking game of thrones and now they

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,510
know how to let a show.
I'll be a show.

41
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,540
They,
from what I understand,

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,200
they give a lot of notes on their
pilots,

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,290
but once you become a series,
they kind of leave you alone.

44
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,700
That's amazing.
You know?

45
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:59,701
Whereas when you're doing a network show
or from other pay sources,

46
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,200
I've heard that the notes never stopped.
Well,

47
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,590
when I was on the radio is the easiest
thing to ruin with notes.

48
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,890
Drama can survive notes.
Comedy cannot because it's like the,

49
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:11,831
uh,
you know,

50
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,850
doing comedies.
Like,

51
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:13,291
you know,
the,

52
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,000
the,
the dominoes and if you take one of

53
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:18,580
those and just move it a little to the
left to the right,

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,920
you're screwing up the whole thing.
Dude,

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,300
Tom Cruise is fucking legit.
John Travolta has done some silly

56
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,900
nonsense,
but he's also,

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,050
he's also done pulp fucking fashion.
He did carry when he was like really

58
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,740
good after the Saturday night live face
off dude.

59
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,130
He's a very fit and active,
a terrible movie face off.

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,490
Oh Wow.
That's a great one.

61
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,050
When they cut the face off and put it
on,

62
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,650
the other person dies.
Naked impose structure magically

63
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,060
changes.
And Nick Cage looks like John Travolta,

64
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,820
Tom [inaudible] technologies.
But you're not terrorist.

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,830
It was no way Bro.
Okay.

66
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,100
What did it happen if Brian put on you?
I would think

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,120
you were,
there's a monster here.

68
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,160
First of all,
you head's way bigger.

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,130
So your skin a bit like some 60 year old
lady from Bel Air,

70
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,400
60 year old ladies where their mouth
looks like it's so big a key your head,

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,310
cause they've been pulling,
they're pulling the skin back to their

72
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,010
mouth was like the joker.
They lose that in their face as you get

73
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,660
older.
You remember you used to make fun of me

74
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,030
for taking an acting class and I stayed
in.

75
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,830
That didn't last for eight years longer
than I needed to because I love a train

76
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,680
wreck.
And these two guys did a seed.

77
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,710
Jeffrey tambor was teaching and these
two guys did a scene from faceoff and

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,090
the curtain comes up and,
and one guy is hanging from a chain and

79
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,760
the other guy's torturing him and it's
like,

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,310
and then he goes,
he goes,

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,560
yeah,
and it's all,

82
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,930
and he's hitting him and it's crazy.
And at the end of the scenes like scene,

83
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,150
everybody's like,
and Jeffrey Tambor,

84
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,850
it just takes a sip of his coffee and he
goes,

85
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,570
what was that scene?
And the guy goes,

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,620
face off,
face off.

87
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,280
What is the,
it's a movie.

88
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,350
It's an action movie.
John Travolta in an occasion.

89
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,970
Tell me about
that scene as band forever.

90
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,030
That was it.
Okay.

91
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:19,930
Cook a man

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,910
is desperate for acceptance,
approval,

93
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,080
and affection from women.

94
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh no,
it's different.

95
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,640
This desperation has led to the
compromise of his beliefs and values.

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,350
The desecration of his dignity and self
worth and its inability to stand up for

97
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,180
himself.
There's four Chan,

98
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,014
right?
This

99
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,800
and what he deserves it.

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,130
Human being example,
loyalty,

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,130
fidelity and honesty in a romantic
relationship.

102
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,700
Okay.
Okay.

103
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,590
Look at it.
Look at the example.

104
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,710
The game.
Hold on a second.

105
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,990
I know John's always wanted a
girlfriend,

106
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,110
but since him and Mary started dating,
he's become a cock.

107
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,860
She spends all of his money and flirts
openly without openly with other men.

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,070
I can tell it bothers him,
but he's so afraid of losing her that he

109
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,210
doesn't say

110
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,760
anything that's a cook.

111
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,070
It sounds like a male feminist also.
Can't believe you went there?

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,900
I don't.
Um,

113
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,490
yeah.
The male feminist thing,

114
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,810
I've,
I've known a few that were real creeps

115
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,270
that were fake creeps.
You know,

116
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,220
they're like on the side.
They,

117
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,820
the,
they,

118
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,800
what they're doing was there,

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,353
there

120
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,620
posturing as an alternative to these men
who don't want monogamous relationships

121
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,450
or would break the woman's heart or not
willing to compromise and bend to the

122
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:47,560
will of the woman and that they put
these women on a platform and worship

123
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,500
these women.
And I am the alternative and I'm the

124
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,600
powerful alternative,
and these men are assholes,

125
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,950
and then they try to shit on those men
and take those.

126
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,450
But all it does is make those appear
even more attractive to these women.

127
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:01,610
Secretly,
these men,

128
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,660
these feminists men,
and these women have these weird

129
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,470
relationships where it doesn't work and
they're never sexual,

130
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,750
or if they are a sexual,
the women aren't really sexually

131
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,000
attracted to him,
so they withhold sex and it just,

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,060
it gets super weird.
Obviously,

133
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:20,960
I just generalize a lot about giant
group of people's relationships,

134
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,480
but what I've seen,
it's just,

135
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,140
it's,
they don't run fast.

136
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,360
They can't pick things up.
They're not attractive.

137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,550
So they tried it.
A little weasels to trying to find

138
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,140
another way in.

139
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

140
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,230
I mean,
I think men who,

141
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,010
not all men who call themselves
feminists are male feminists.

142
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,000
So in that,
I think men who ascribed to women being

143
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,590
equal at,
that's a good thing.

144
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,150
Yeah.
I think a lot of guys will say,

145
00:06:46,151 --> 00:06:47,770
yeah,
I'm feminist because they think that's

146
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,430
the right thing to do.
That's the socially acceptable thing and

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,120
right.
That's the way we should be.

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,550
But then the ones who run around and
say,

149
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,020
you know,
really,

150
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:59,650
really push it and make that their
identity and really sell themselves as

151
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,440
male feminists.
Those are the guys I have an issue with

152
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:03,790
because like you said,
they're sneaky.

153
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah.
They and they know what they're doing.

154
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
They're not being honest.
Okay,

155
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,660
well you could almost always tell you
you see them.

156
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,090
Yeah.
They're,

157
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,850
they're a type,
you know,

158
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,740
they're just,
they're an unattractive type.

159
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,790
They're not attractive to women.
And they'd try to figure out a way like,

160
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,480
how am I going to do this?
What's it going to be the way you've got

161
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:27,940
to figure out a way to stand out.
This is the way I'm going to just what,

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,530
what are these women want to hear?
They want to hear that.

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,730
I'm going to say that.
Yeah.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,680
Egalitarians great.
You know,

165
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,990
someone who believes in equality is
great,

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,270
but as soon as you istat like your
proclaiming yourself to be more

167
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:45,271
interested in the opposite gender and
more supportive of them,

168
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,150
then males,
and even though you are a male,

169
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,400
hmm.
That should be a red flag.

170
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,640
That's a giant red flag.
You should be into humans.

171
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,820
I like people.
I like people I like,

172
00:07:57,821 --> 00:07:59,440
I'm gay,
I'm straight.

173
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,630
I like people.
I like when they're nice.

174
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,340
You're nice to me.
I'm nice to you.

175
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,620
That's what I like.
I don't want you to get discriminated

176
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,180
against in any way,
shape or form.

177
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah.
But I don't want to pretend that one

178
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,030
group is better than other groups

179
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,863
groups.
They,

180
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,760
if he'd had no makeup on,
no money in King Lewin who Sacha Baron

181
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:14,690
Cohen is.
Do you know what I mean?

182
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,900
The crazy thing is these people must
have had to sign releases.

183
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,820
Yeah.
And I did hidden camera shit,

184
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,050
so I know how that works.
Yeah,

185
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,750
I've done that too.
How did they get those two ways?

186
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,460
There's money,
which is always the best way.

187
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,810
And you make them sign before.
That's,

188
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,431
that's it.
There's,

189
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,690
there's two ways to get the,
the way.

190
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,650
Yeah.
You'd make them sign,

191
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,040
you know,
we're going to be featuring you on the,

192
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,510
say we did this bit,
Ian Edwards and I did this bit for

193
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,950
comedy central for the show that never
went.

194
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,230
Um,
I don't know if I've ever told you this,

195
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,750
but we,
this bit was so fun to do.

196
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,140
We made a thing called Melanin Mayo
Mayonnaise,

197
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,510
mayonnaise that she,
that made you darker

198
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,063
real shit.

199
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
And we put food coloring in mail.
But we,

200
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,070
it as new Brown Mayo,
it's a new generation of Mayo.

201
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,490
And so we got people in this test group.
We know that real people in a real test

202
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,920
group that go and take tests all the
time and they emanate sample shit.

203
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,830
We put them in a room,
we made them eat the sandwiches,

204
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,350
just fucking mail was male.
They eat the sandwiches.

205
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,820
All these white people eat the
sandwiches.

206
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,910
And then when they're done,
we sent in this black dude owl and she

207
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:17,610
shows them a video.
And it was a pre taped video basically

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
of white people confessionals who have
turned.

209
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,551
We've,
you know,

210
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,790
we photoshop them to have turned more
brown to turn start to turn black.

211
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,490
And we're like in three to five weeks,
you start to see results.

212
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,400
You start to see cultural results,
mental results you're getting,

213
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,650
you're getting more black by culture,
you're getting smarter.

214
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,180
Black,
you're getting cooler black and your

215
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,820
neighborhood to your friends.
Like their faces.

216
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,280
Their faces were perf.
If we didn't have any volume you to

217
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,350
laughed.
Everyone's like,

218
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,920
wait a minute.
No one said we be black.

219
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,930
We'd be turning black.
I mean,

220
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,680
they lost their fucking minds.
People got so scared.

221
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,800
It was amazing.
Uh,

222
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,220
that bit was incredible.
They,

223
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,130
MTV never,
I mean,

224
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
comedy central,
never air to any of that come in central

225
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,530
probably hasn't a fucking vault they
throw away.

226
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,950
Oh my God.
That was one of our favorite bits that

227
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,930
we,
that made us laugh so fucking hard.

228
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,050
Their faces.
There was one woman though,

229
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,160
one woman,
to her credit,

230
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,150
she goes,
she,

231
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,440
you know,
people are freaking out in the room.

232
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,820
People started yelling at him and
they're like,

233
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,350
this is,
I'm going to fucking show you.

234
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,440
I'm gonna and he's black and he's white,
but I'm going to fucking sue your ass if

235
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,100
I'm black.

236
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,370
It's like the funny to watch him go.
It's not as bad as you're making it out

237
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:20,851
to be.
I mean,

238
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,680
I was,
I was born black and I'm liking it a

239
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:24,420
lot.
And one woman goes,

240
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,390
you know,
it's disturbing because it's shocking

241
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,340
just to spring this on me,
but I don't,

242
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm,
I'm not scared I could take on being

243
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,431
black.
I'll just,

244
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,090
let's,
let's,

245
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,140
we'll see what happens.
I mean,

246
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,870
she was like,
turn credits.

247
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,461
She goes,
we'll just,

248
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,290
I'll just live with,
we'll just figure this out,

249
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,124
I guess.
I mean,

250
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,580
it was insane that they bought into it,
but also that that's how we did it.

251
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,880
We fucking made him sign beforehand and
then you pay them out and when it's

252
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,800
over,
we broke them off more money.

253
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,890
So they wouldn't say no because they
still have the legal right to be like,

254
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,810
I'm pulling that up.
You pull it or I'm suing you.

255
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,360
So once it was over,
did they understand that it was for

256
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:00,330
comedy central after,
after everything was said and done,

257
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,030
and then do they laugh?
A few did not laugh.

258
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,960
You laughed.
A few people were not good.

259
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,180
But that was one of my favorite bits.
Melon and Mayo and man,

260
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:14,070
did it work like a charm?
People were like,

261
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:17,460
this man needs is delicious.
It was fucking Hellman's or whatever

262
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,610
with a little brown dye in it.
It's unconventional,

263
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:24,480
but I really like
because it's so stupid.

264
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,890
[inaudible].
