1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,110
So yeah,

3
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,400
you don't have a deep freezer.

4
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,440
We keep pot pies salted.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,651
Like you said,

6
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:13,110
the w the world fought over salt for
ages and amazing to think about it today.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,660
People were forced to work in
salt mines and died in them.

8
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,820
That was like as huge punishment for ages.

9
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,290
And there's a mountain in,

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,183
is it Germany?

11
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,480
There's a mountain of salt.

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,921
Wow.

13
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,270
It's been redeeming audit yet.

14
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,460
There's a book called
salt and it's very good.

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,410
Will you look up the book called Salt?

16
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:29,111
The guy who wrote it,

17
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,390
that and neighbor reducing just
because of the world's need for salt.

18
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:32,511
Yeah.

19
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:32,741
They just,

20
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:32,910
you know,

21
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,140
they dug it all down.

22
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,060
There's two mountains,

23
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,080
one in South America,

24
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,980
I can't remember the other.

25
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,720
And Mexico's it in Potosi and uh,

26
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,970
and there it has salt,

27
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,870
a world history.

28
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,170
You really like it now because he breaks
it down and he shows you the salt mines

29
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,180
and there's pictures of
the Salt Mountain and uh,

30
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,760
and it is unfucking believable.

31
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,091
I mean,

32
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,740
we were talking earlier today,

33
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,940
we were talking earlier today about not
having a smartphone would a big leap.

34
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:58,590
That would be to go back to a flip phone,

35
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,890
but look at the fuck
people fought over salt.

36
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,070
That is so alien and spices,

37
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:05,310
right?

38
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,080
The reason why Columbus was coming there,

39
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:12,081
it is that the reason why a Columbus was
a mountain of salt w w came and when I

40
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,190
always talk about Columbus
and even bloody show that it,

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,361
even Magellan,

42
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,440
and when he went around the world,

43
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,880
he sent five ships.

44
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,541
Uh,

45
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,500
they lost all of them.

46
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,270
They finally came back
with one three years later,

47
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:21,450
right?

48
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,380
Three years later,

49
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,170
but crappy ship with 18 guys sail back in.

50
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:25,651
Well,

51
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,030
it all been underwritten by,

52
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,243
uh,

53
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,670
businessmen from Germany,

54
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,001
right?

55
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:32,070
Who underwrote Magellan's voyage.

56
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,430
There was enough spice in that
ship to pay for the whole trip.

57
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,600
A three year trip and losing 300
guys in five ships or whatever,

58
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:40,290
four ships.

59
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,100
Whoa.

60
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,990
There was it because
they brought back what,

61
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:43,220
like,

62
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,401
why,

63
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,610
don't know what they wanted on that one.

64
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,930
Nutmeg or whatever it was.

65
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,070
And they had to go all the way around
the world to on would east indies,

66
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,070
no electricity.

67
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,040
But she see that was the difference was
Magellan was going to prove you could go

68
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,640
that way.

69
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,473
Right.

70
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,870
Cause usually they went around India and
the horn and so that's how valuable it

71
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:03,301
was.

72
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,230
And that's why,

73
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,450
uh,

74
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:05,880
English,

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,330
uh,

76
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,010
Portugal and Spain were such
giant powers that because spice,

77
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,590
and then when span took
over the new world,

78
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,060
there was a mountains of gold,

79
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,020
one in South American,

80
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:17,130
one amount of silver,

81
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:21,570
I mean a mountain silver that they
made the Indians and killed them all.

82
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,320
Doing it.

83
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,880
Dig Out and all the gold and silver
in Asia is still in circulation,

84
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:30,210
is like Spanish gold dug
out of the new world.

85
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,250
That's insane.

86
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,630
It was a literal mountain.

87
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,210
Two of them,

88
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,760
one in South America and one in Mexico.

89
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,140
Ted's still credible,

90
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:37,974
a mountain,

91
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,550
you know,

92
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,660
the real problem and things,

93
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,870
even the term social justice warrior
is that there are aggressive,

94
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,081
like the,

95
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,040
the thing about social justice.

96
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,290
So it's like what do you,

97
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:49,651
what do you,

98
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:50,760
what do you really want?

99
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,140
You want peace?

100
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,951
Guess where it,

101
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,710
guess what the worst way to
get pieces being an asshole.

102
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:55,950
Oh,

103
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,430
totally.

104
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,040
Being an asshole will almost
that kind of antisocial.

105
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,201
Yes.

106
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,040
There's a sense in

107
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,380
a lot of ways cause they're like,

108
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,580
like they're about doxing
people and aggressively
pursuing actions against them,

109
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,450
trying to get people fired because
they don't share their ideology.

110
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
The weirdest road testing.

111
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,281
Totally agree.

112
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,540
Like the weirdest thing to me.

113
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,390
And I think like people have
started to becoming more like,

114
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,670
I've certainly become more aggressive
just dealing with their shit,

115
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,511
you know what I mean?

116
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,240
Like become less aggressive
believe it or not about them.

117
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:22,681
Like I,

118
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:23,514
I don't,

119
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,490
I don't want to fight with that kind of
shit at all because I think it's just

120
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,240
creates a dust cloud of confused cause
it's counterproductive and it's totally

121
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,074
counterproductive.

122
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,750
And I share their beliefs
on a lot of things.

123
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,530
I just don't,

124
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,510
I don't share their methodology.

125
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,370
I don't share the,

126
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,380
the aggressive tactics and I just think
that what they're doing is like an

127
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,830
insanely short sided.

128
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,450
They think that their
Malcolm x or something,

129
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,830
they think that they're like trying
to fight the system by screaming,

130
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,191
yelling,

131
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,330
fuck capitalism.

132
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,360
And it's Kinda like the people
who are born like after the 60s,

133
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,200
like they were born after the party you,

134
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,250
I'm like,

135
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,950
and then you could tell that
it kind of pissed about it.

136
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,420
My friend,

137
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,960
my friend Andy Sarabia and I
were talking about this and uh,

138
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,040
uh,

139
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,770
we were talking a lot about like
how basically they target you.

140
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,161
Like,

141
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:09,311
all right,

142
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,460
so there are two gay guys who like had
Ted Cruz over just like chat with him,

143
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,830
right?

144
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,200
Because he's like running for president,

145
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:14,771
you know,

146
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,490
whatever.

147
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,630
And these guys were targeted by all of
these like gay social justice warrior

148
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,280
types being like,

149
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,771
just for talk,

150
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,570
just for talking to them
like you're mainstreaming,

151
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,500
his auntie gave you.

152
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,400
And like,

153
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,030
how are we supposed to persuade people
of our views if we can't even like talk

154
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,450
to them

155
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,900
to all of this creeping in.

156
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,840
And there's a concept of moral luck,

157
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,020
which is due to the
philosopher Thomas Nagel,

158
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:35,261
who,

159
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,700
who's done a lot of interesting work,

160
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:36,880
you know,

161
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,710
half of which I really agree with.

162
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,820
And some of it I don't,

163
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,821
but the concept of moral luck is that
it does seem unfair that there are many

164
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:51,121
situations in which people create immense
harms doing stuff that you and I have

165
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,750
gotten away with.

166
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,470
You know?

167
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:56,591
I mean,

168
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:56,951
they're not,

169
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,900
they're not worse people than we are.

170
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,231
They're like,

171
00:04:59,231 --> 00:04:59,441
you know,

172
00:04:59,441 --> 00:04:59,711
they,

173
00:04:59,711 --> 00:04:59,891
you know,

174
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,191
you,

175
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,700
you and I have both driven
when we shouldn't have driven,

176
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:03,971
you know,

177
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,200
we had one beer,

178
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,450
too many or there were
there things that we did,

179
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,020
or you're,

180
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,471
you're looking at,

181
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,430
you look at a text,

182
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,331
you know,

183
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:10,661
and you know,

184
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,340
you should never look at your
phone when you're driving,

185
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:12,720
but you decide,

186
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:12,880
well,

187
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,170
I'm expecting a text.

188
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,190
And you look,

189
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:19,240
and there are people who are looking
at that text right now and just,

190
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,750
you know,

191
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,400
killing some child in the crosswalk,

192
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,821
right?

193
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,740
And their lives are going
to be ruined and you know,

194
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,670
they're going to go to prison and
they're exactly like you and me.

195
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,001
Right?

196
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:28,330
So there's a,

197
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:28,780
there's a,

198
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,640
there's an aspect of luck here,

199
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,270
but that the luck actually propagates
backward into the kind of brain you have,

200
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,010
the kind of upbringing you had,

201
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,090
the kind of parents you had,

202
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:40,421
the kind of,

203
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:40,541
you know,

204
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,590
the fact that you got hit in the head
as hard as you did or didn't and no one

205
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,371
has made themselves.

206
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,204
So,

207
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,110
um,

208
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,070
I'm a little bit more,

209
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,220
I'm less judgmental about some of
these things given my view of freewill,

210
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
but I'm not,

211
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,380
it's not that I'm not interested in
making the interventions that would make a

212
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:00,290
difference in whatever we could have
done to have gotten him to behave

213
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:00,770
differently.

214
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,000
We should have done whatever we should
need to do now to him to make society

215
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,870
better and to make him better and
to get restitution for the woman.

216
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,740
What we should do.

217
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,251
All that.

218
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,870
And so this doesn't tail locking up
certain dangerous people and it doesn't

219
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
tail.

220
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,903
Um,

221
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,361
you know,

222
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,050
we have to keep,

223
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,800
keep ourselves safe from people who
are going to reliably act badly.

224
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,371
And,

225
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,204
um,

226
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,010
and I don't know where he
falls on that spectrum,

227
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,120
but it's just,

228
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,870
it's not,

229
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,520
um,

230
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,550
the difference between the
feeling you get when you hear,

231
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:31,701
oh,

232
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:32,690
it was brain damage.

233
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,690
I sort of have that
feeling about everything.

234
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,501
You know,

235
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:36,750
if,

236
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:36,990
if,

237
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,641
if we,

238
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,900
if he gets a brain scan,

239
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,640
if he goes to trial now he
gets a brain scan and we,

240
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,480
and we find that his brain is just
massively damaged and all the right areas

241
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,910
that would have eroded
his impulse control.

242
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:47,901
Right.

243
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,730
That would seem to let him
off the hook a little bit.

244
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,300
It would,

245
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,660
he would,

246
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,340
he would look like someone who is unlucky
more than he would look like a bad

247
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,174
person.

248
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,960
Right.

249
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,390
And I sort of see bad
people as unlucky to,

250
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,940
I recognize that there are certain people
who are quite classically bad people.

251
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,960
There are psychopaths who you,

252
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,480
not only can you not rely on them,

253
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:08,631
you,

254
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,540
you can rely on them to be bad actors,

255
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:11,751
you know,

256
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:11,951
so you,

257
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:12,091
you,

258
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:12,924
you have to,

259
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,020
you have to be in a posture of,

260
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,820
of self defense with
respect to these people.

261
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,460
But,

262
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,293
um,

263
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,560
I do view them as an unlucky on

264
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,520
some fundamental level.

265
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,850
It's the idea that you're going to arrive
at some point or that you're going to

266
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:28,690
land in this destination that
is called success or happiness.

267
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
And when you get to our age,

268
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:30,931
you realize that.

269
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:31,764
And that's just,

270
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,680
that's an illusion,

271
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,220
right?

272
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,060
It just continues.

273
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:35,290
And you start to think about,

274
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:35,970
you know,

275
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,970
what your life means.

276
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:39,370
What do you stand for
and what is your legacy?

277
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,770
You know,

278
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,140
it's like we're approaching 50.

279
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:41,501
It's like,

280
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,300
what do you know if I die today?

281
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,501
What was,

282
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:44,711
you know,

283
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:45,190
what did I,

284
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,900
what did I leave in my wake?

285
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,171
Well,

286
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:47,711
even that,

287
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,190
look,

288
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,680
the bottom line is whatever you leave,

289
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,370
it's not going to matter because it's
going to matter to some people that you

290
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,050
know and they're going to leave too.

291
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,340
Everyone's going to leave.

292
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,710
But are you enjoying this?

293
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,910
Are you enjoying the moment?

294
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,920
Everyone's working towards
this like ultimate,

295
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,050
like the retirement years,

296
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,140
the golden years,

297
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,560
you're fucking almost
dead when those years.

298
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:08,880
Cotton,

299
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,730
like those little,

300
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,360
you see those people like
holding hands and walking along,

301
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,690
they barely can walk.

302
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:14,524
Their knees hurt,

303
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,610
they're all fucked up.

304
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,500
Like that's not what you work for.

305
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:21,340
You don't work towards this ultimate
point where you don't do anything anymore

306
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:22,270
and that's ridiculous.

307
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,430
The way you should work towards is
doing what you enjoy doing right now and

308
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:32,260
enjoying your life right now and join
your friends right now and join whatever

309
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,850
hobbies you like to pursue.

310
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,720
Whatever,

311
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:34,991
you know,

312
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:39,940
love affairs and friendships and
all that stuff is what life is,

313
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:42,670
is life is the moment being in the moment.

314
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,770
And we somehow have turned it into this,

315
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,640
this weird like journey to
have a very specific point,

316
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,620
specific points of high school graduation,

317
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,300
college graduation,

318
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,790
but good job marriage,

319
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,624
children,

320
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,400
we have all these like milestones that
are supposed to impart happiness in this

321
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,240
race and they,

322
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,411
they're not real.

323
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,000
They're social constructs and we've,

324
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,060
we've created these social constructs and
we've fed into them and pass them down

325
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,830
from generation to generation without
anybody stepping back and going,

326
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,983
whoa,

327
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,470
who set this up?

328
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,610
Who set up,

329
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,960
who set up graduate school?

330
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Who said it?

331
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,513
Who set up,

332
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,110
who set up common core?

333
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,710
Who?

334
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,120
Who are these people like Hawaii?

335
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,954
Why is,

336
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,070
why is it this way?

337
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,820
What does it,

338
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,820
we're just biological organisms trying
to have as much happiness and good

339
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,380
feeling while we're here as we can.

340
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,330
Okay.
