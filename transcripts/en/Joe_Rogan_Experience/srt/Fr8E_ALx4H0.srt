00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,340
Hello Freak bitches.
I also don't know if life can actually

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:10,341
evolve and progress just through pure
logic or pure rationality.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,520
I think chance is very important in life
and I also think being creative and

4
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,900
creative must to some extent involved.
That ridiculousness at least must

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:22,620
involve the question of asking why now
it might get more logical and rational

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,510
as we go forward,
but I'm not sure we're ever going to

7
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:29,511
completely be the perfect mathematical
model that we would want to be A.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm not even sure that if we had perfect
intelligence,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,820
if let's just say hypothetically we
became that perfect intelligence.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,500
We might purposely sabotage ourselves
just so that we always have that element

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,800
of irrationality in our lives to keep us
on the go,

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,080
to keep us moving forward,
to keep us evolving.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,410
So I'm.
So that's the first part of that.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,780
I think the second part of what you're
speaking about,

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,060
the the interesting thing that I always
tell people,

16
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:59,061
because I get asked this question a lot,
is that right now our current perception

17
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,630
of the universe is pretty limited.

18
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,910
For example,
our ISI can only see about one percent

19
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,060
of the light spectrum.
Our ears can hear far less than one

20
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:09,400
percent of the of the sound waves and
what's possible in the universe,

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,660
so our actual ability to determine what
is in the universe is completely

22
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,440
limited,
in fact,

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,890
so limited that were were just basically
getting tiny bits of it.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,850
As we get,
as we progress forward,

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,170
I think we're going to have apps,
a more applications towards getting a

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,040
better perception and our senses of what
the universe really entails.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,400
We'll all have night vision will have be
able to see different types of gases in

28
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,410
the air and we'll we'll have different
types of feelings that are based in with

29
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,390
with this,
these kind of a hypersensitive and that

30
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,560
in itself will give us so many new
experiences and I try to tell this to

31
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,980
people a lot that we're actually going
to become much more complex.

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,880
We think this is our world around us,
but actually if you and I had bionic

33
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:57,240
eyes,
we'd see that there are maybe a billion

34
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:00,630
different organisms in this room that
are also interacting with us.

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,020
And that's something that,
I'm not saying it's gonna maybe take us

36
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,090
down a,
either a smart or a bad path,

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,620
but it's something that could be
different,

38
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,060
that could take us to other ideas and
other ways of experiencing the world

39
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,030
that makes it so it's not either boring
or makes it so it's not.

40
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,864
So,
you know,

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,010
so kinda crazy though.
I,

42
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:18,511
you know,
I,

43
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:23,370
I don't think that humans are ever gonna
end transhumans at least to start with

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,090
are going to give up some of the
ridiculous aspects of their life because

45
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm.
One of the things that motivates us is

46
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:34,410
fun and one of the things in,
in human experience that is fun is being

47
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,244
ridiculous.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,850
So I think you need that creativity.
You need that creative element in the

49
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:42,810
species.
I think that most I've ever done was I

50
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:47,700
think $10,000 to some corporate event.
It wasn't.

51
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,300
People showed up to see me.
I was a Sammy Hagar was on and Steve

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,990
Miller,
I was on.

53
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,440
Wow.
You worked a Sammy Hagar and Steve.

54
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,400
But what does Steve Miller looked like?
Did you even recognize them?

55
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,150
A.
No,

56
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:00,610
because the album was the white horse
lake,

57
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,950
so my whole teenage years of listened
to.

58
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,000
I've never saw what he looked like.
He looked like a dad with a blazer and

59
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,300
jeans and just went out there.
That's the thing about Steve Miller.

60
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:15,040
He is the least recognizable major.
He walk around Rockstar.

61
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,700
He could walk around anywhere and it
seemed like he never tried to become

62
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,840
famous or you're going to out him on the
podcast that Steve Miller.

63
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,770
That's what it looks like now.

64
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,380
Dude.
He had some fucking jams.

65
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,770
Jungalow love that was high school.
That whole album reminds me of high

66
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,530
school.
Take the money alone.

67
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,530
This is a story about Billy Joe.
We thought we thought we were cool too

68
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:43,340
because we're listening to classic rock.
That was technically they were into this

69
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:45,490
stuff,
not this new edition.

70
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,140
You know?
It's really fucking weird,

71
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,110
man.
I went to high school in 1981 and in

72
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:52,510
1981 I started hanging out with these
kids.

73
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:56,650
I just moved into town into a Newton
upper falls and I started hanging out

74
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:01,030
with my friend Jimmy and Jimmy and all
of his friends were all,

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,430
uh,
from the other side of town there.

76
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:05,950
They're all like the north part of
Newton and they were all like,

77
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,280
everyone had doors,
tee shirts and they were all smoking

78
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,300
weed and it was like they introduced me
to all this music that I didn't even

79
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,134
know existed.

80
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,380
But when I think about it now,
the shit was only 10 years old.

81
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,630
Yeah.
Like the allman brothers,

82
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,800
they were,
they were playing like some allman

83
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,280
brothers are some doors.
That shit is from like 1969,

84
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,550
1970.
So at the time we're talking wwe,

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,710
I went to high school in [inaudible] 81.
That was my freshman year.

86
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,521
So this is,
what is it,

87
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,110
12,
13 years old as fuck.

88
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,430
Nothing.
That's like some music from 2001 that's

89
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,110
contemporary,
you know,

90
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:43,111
like a song from 2002.
You could still hear like on a regular

91
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,450
basis that would be on a radio station
that was eighties,

92
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,370
nineties and hits sex and can.
Yeah,

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,110
you can hear that.
You could easily hear that someone could

94
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,840
play that non.
Ironically on a regular radio station,

95
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,280
they wouldn't be saying,
oh,

96
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,920
you remember this shit.
That would be a song that would play,

97
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,850
but that sex and candy song came out and
like,

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,910
like 99 or some shit.

99
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,010
Yeah.
So think about that.

100
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,090
Like that.
We wouldn't say,

101
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,620
yeah man,
that was the classic.

102
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,860
Something fucking happened to time,
right?

103
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,340
Time is not what it used to be 10 years
ago doesn't mean shit anymore,

104
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,090
but 10 years ago back then meant a lot
when I was in high school and then in

105
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:27,091
1981 and 1970 car was a mother fucker.
If you had a 1970 Chevelle or a 1970

106
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:34,420
barracuda,
you add a fucking sweet car.

107
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,970
Oh,
you got a classic muscle car.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,600
It's only 10 years old.
What the fuck happened?

109
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,660
And he does that when it happened.
The acceleration,

110
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,760
just information.
We're pumped.

111
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,830
We're going to the library every single
second.

112
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,990
We look at her phone,
you know,

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,110
that's what's happening,
right?

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,190
That is what's happening.
That's deep.

115
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,260
It's cleaned my bedroom the other day
and I have a pretty big bed,

116
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,090
but underneath the bed it's

117
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,860
like in the middle you'll never get
anything on,

118
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,680
you know,
like if something falls under the bed.

119
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,160
So I was trying to get everything and I
pulled out a single cheeseburger from

120
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,090
Mcdonald's that I guess I was eating and
I like threw,

121
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,550
threw it on the ground or something and
it just went in there and get it to you.

122
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,870
I know you live like I haven't had
mcdonalds in my bed for at least six

123
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:23,210
months and so that.
But when I opened it,

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,120
it looked brand new.
It looked just exactly the same.

125
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,250
You would buy it at perfect apartments,
like the raft of a survivor's stranded

126
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:33,550
at sea.
It's just scattered disarray with

127
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,560
bobbers and nets and one shoe
pirate in the corner for some reason.

128
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,530
Yeah.
That big area in the middle where you

129
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,100
can reach under your bed area is a
problem.

130
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,450
It's disgusting because if you ever do
move your bed,

131
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,130
your bed,
you're like looking at it going,

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,120
that's so gross.

133
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,830
How much would I have to pay you to lick
that center area where you can't reach?

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,700
Just do the whole line on the line from
the head to the.

135
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,530
Keep your tongue down on the ground from
the foot of the bed to the head of the

136
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:04,550
bed.
Like an Imac

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,600
could only take an imac to get you to do
that.

138
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,590
Hello?
Yeah.

139
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,750
Wow.
What about Ipad mini?

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,890
I licked.
I licked the bowl.

141
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,350
I licked the stripper pole at a crazy
girl is a couple of months ago on stage

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,680
because we were doing comedy there and I
just said some hot girl just got off and

143
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,761
I was like,
damn,

144
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,220
that girl is hot.
And I just like licked it as a joke.

145
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,390
Everyone was like,
oh,

146
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,560
but then I thought about it and then I
had like a canker on my time for like

147
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:37,490
three days.
Welcome to the wonderful world of new

148
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:41,420
AIDS canker on your dog.
I was freaked out for a couple of days,

149
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,690
but it was so hilarious.
That is so hilarious.

150
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,630
David Arquette owns that place now and I
told him like he would.

151
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,860
He did kill Tony and I told him about
that.

152
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,020
You just give me a high five.
He's like,

153
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,640
that's great.
That's hilarious.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,080
He owns a strip club.
What a good move for a fucking celebrity

155
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,190
that's just getting divorced.

156
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,800
What an excellent move and that places
a.

157
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,460
They do comedy occasionally there.
Yeah,

158
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,250
they do.
Shows are like music sometimes and that

159
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,510
it's totally not set up for comedy
though because they have like a strobe

160
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,230
light facing the comic.
So you're onstage and you're just having

161
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:17,450
elliptic caesars and you can't see
anything.

162
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,900
Pick seizures,
whatever.

163
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,050
Elliptical seizures.
Epileptic you fuck

164
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,150
wrong
ellipses.
