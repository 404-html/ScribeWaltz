1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,481
Top score.

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,010
Would you want a video podcast as well?

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,630
We'll do a video blog.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:12,231
Oh,

5
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:13,450
after we interview people.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:13,950
When I talk,

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,150
yes.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,750
How was your experience with the podcast?

9
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,560
You get to lift those country Melder
people know what the fuck is up.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,640
Good aboriginal joke just to Jackson.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,301
That's a,

12
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:23,700
yeah.

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:23,850
No,

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,591
they were great man.

15
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,400
They're sent there.

16
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,480
They were sensitive about it,

17
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,430
but it's festival people though,

18
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:29,000
right?

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,250
Once you go back to conquering hero,

20
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,340
they'll forget about all that.

21
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,840
You'll have a 10 minute aboriginal
baby chunk open right over with that.

22
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,963
Yeah.

23
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,873
Just something again,

24
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,993
something.

25
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:39,831
Did you let it go?

26
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,690
And I look on Australia,

27
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,533
but the trip is,

28
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,050
the flight is horrifying.

29
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,680
Terrible your body too,

30
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,553
right?

31
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,990
I'm still not over the return.

32
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,830
Really?

33
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,041
Dude,

34
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:53,390
I'm waking up at seven 30 and eight you
last time I got up at seven get a job.

35
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:53,901
Probably like,

36
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,171
yeah,

37
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:54,671
I mean it's,

38
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:54,860
it's,

39
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,693
I've never,

40
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm home a week now.

41
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,460
And what time you usually go to bed?

42
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,530
I usually go to bed like around one
is probably what time you wake up.

43
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,920
If I do that on a normal thing,

44
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:06,120
it would,

45
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,840
I would be up at like 10 or 10 30 normal.

46
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,171
If I,

47
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,480
if I go to bed at one
it's a nice and leisurely.

48
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,900
Yeah.

49
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,733
Fuck yeah.

50
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,633
Comedy style,

51
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,680
comedy style bitches.

52
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,070
Just their reason for alarm clocks.

53
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,431
Yeah.

54
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:18,290
Well I knew if we catch flights,

55
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,360
that's the only time I get up for shit.

56
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,110
That and radio.

57
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,580
Do you write your best stuff at night?

58
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,240
Do you write at night?

59
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,700
Yeah.

60
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:23,860
Yeah,

61
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,231
me too.

62
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:24,891
What is that about?

63
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,400
Why is it?

64
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,731
I don't know,

65
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:26,660
but I can't do mornings,

66
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:27,320
man.

67
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,561
I know.

68
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:28,880
I try and I've tried to,

69
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,801
I get up in the morning,

70
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,220
I'll have a cup of coffee
and just start writing.

71
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,881
Sometimes I,

72
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:34,580
sometimes I can edit things in
the morning because my talent,

73
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:35,690
my and impatient.

74
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,060
So sometimes like man,

75
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,903
too wordy.

76
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm good at editing things.

77
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah.

78
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,600
Cause I want to cut to the quick,

79
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:41,840
you know,

80
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,320
I just can't,

81
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,990
I find sometimes I'm like whatever,

82
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,560
some thoughts and boost of
inspiration after I've laid down,

83
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,513
I'll lay down.

84
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
So I'm thinking about something.

85
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:51,411
It wasn't going to sleep.

86
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:51,801
And I'm like,

87
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:52,340
Oh shit.

88
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,260
And I get up and start writing.

89
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,620
I made myself get up to,

90
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,261
or I have a,

91
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:57,531
I'm,

92
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:00,050
I keep my phone right by
the bed alarms on my phone.

93
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,140
Oh,

94
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,251
there.

95
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,610
And I have the little voice notes.

96
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,680
I'll just make a little voice note of it.

97
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:03,870
Yeah.

98
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,220
Yeah.

99
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,640
That's a good,

100
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,451
that's a good way to do it.

101
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,284
Actually,

102
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,700
I started using the voice note thing.

103
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,940
I was a little crazy to
fantasy wine tasting thing,

104
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,241
man.

105
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,000
Tell him stuff.

106
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,540
It was great.

107
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,490
A lot of wine tastings,

108
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,310
romantic,

109
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,001
romantic.

110
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:21,000
But the only weird thing is like
the whole city is based on wine.

111
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,580
So everyone's ever getting wasted
and drunk and it's all couples.

112
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,260
But at 10 o'clock it's a ghost town.

113
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,423
So we want,

114
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,600
would you want swingers clubs?

115
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,501
I thought there'd be like,

116
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:28,710
you know,

117
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,910
people hanging out on the street.

118
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:30,151
No,

119
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,230
not one car.

120
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,130
Not One person.

121
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,000
Every hotel though.

122
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,630
No vacancy.

123
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,463
No vacancy.

124
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,000
So it was packed with people,

125
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,190
but everyone's just passed
out by eight o'clock.

126
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,670
So what part of the country
was his Sylvain California.

127
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:42,504
It's a north.

128
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,010
About 40 minutes north of Santa
Barbara and ate mushrooms instead.

129
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,570
We ate mushrooms.

130
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:48,960
Yeah.

131
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,760
And did you learn anything
while you're eating mushrooms?

132
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,683
Yeah,

133
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,210
antique hotels are very scary.

134
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,044
I'm not sure.

135
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,420
It just feels scary.

136
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,820
Spooky like old wallpaper and old like

137
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,120
stuff everywhere.

138
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,350
It's just memories in that stuff.

139
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,980
Yeah.

140
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,800
This guy named Rupert Sheldrake and
thinks that there's memory and everything.

141
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,380
It seemed like that in your own town,

142
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:08,830
Brian.

143
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,663
Yeah.

144
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,391
No,

145
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,320
I mean I love Joe because
Joe just like me stoned.

146
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,640
Really think about it like it's like
me if I ate a handful of mushrooms,

147
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,474
right?

148
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,460
Like,

149
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,293
like,

150
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,463
you know,

151
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,870
Dr Grew and I talked
about this many times.

152
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,480
You like ideas and I love
people that like ideas.

153
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,501
Not so much.

154
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:33,970
Jokes are not so much,

155
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,420
you know,

156
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,380
catch phrases,

157
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,750
but I DHEAS and uh,

158
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,830
you Dick Ideas.

159
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,520
I do.

160
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,353
Thanks man.

161
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,460
Thanks for being
[inaudible] and gentlemen.

162
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,131
That's right.

163
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:43,964
Glitches.

164
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,130
I get the a list here.

165
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,820
I don't come in a long running tradition
of people leaving shit behind on the

166
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:50,630
podcast.

167
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,300
Adam Corolla has left behind his glasses.

168
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh my goodness.

169
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,120
Adam,

170
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,440
I have your fucking glasses.

171
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,080
I also have nick Swardson's sweater.

172
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,770
Um,

173
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,990
I had bill burrs comb
for the longest time,

174
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,240
so we gave it back to Belvoir.

175
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,203
And what else did we get?

176
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,490
A magical leavers iPhone here.

177
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:07,861
Oh,

178
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:08,580
his iPad.

179
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,740
And I got him back to his IPAD.

180
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,640
That was the one we
should have kept the most.

181
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,340
I got your glasses,

182
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,370
John Heffrons in the motherfucking house.

183
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,720
A half from when you're doing these days.

184
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,650
What's going on in the squares?

185
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,350
Uh,

186
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,183
you know,

187
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,120
neuro linguistic programming,

188
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,650
reading psychology books,

189
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,911
right?

190
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:29,850
Technology boats,

191
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:30,750
Raymond scripts.

192
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,400
What does technology look around again,

193
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,070
a cognitive therapy and standup comedy.

194
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,360
How did not take,

195
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,740
so how to find the humor,

196
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,730
the crappiest thing that
staff needs to do that.

197
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,570
Interesting.

198
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,120
Do you think that sometimes you will
sabotage your life just to create more

199
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,700
material?

200
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,533
Not Possible.

201
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,371
I think,

202
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:47,940
uh,

203
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,620
I think it helps because nobody,

204
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,730
nobody wants to hear comic.

205
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,660
When he got on stage going,

206
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,410
wow,

207
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,480
traffic was awesome getting
here and made it right to,

208
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:54,781
man,

209
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:55,560
I have a lot of money.

210
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,530
Boy Am I in shape.

211
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,690
I went to vacation with my wife,

212
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,553
everything was awesome.

213
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,510
That's a boring show.

214
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,720
So you have to be every year
that's conflict and paste
that on top of top of the

215
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,790
actual conflict and painted
life would normally give.

216
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,850
Do you think you create some just for
material or did you take that you just so

217
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,980
happened to be lucky in that you're
blessed with a fucked up chaotic life that

218
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,160
lends itself to a good comment.

219
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,920
I say that you probably create more
than anything you create more than any

220
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,950
therapy world is exactly
how you want it to be.

221
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,610
That's right.

222
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,443
Yes.

223
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,720
This is like the secret we're
giving you like two minutes.

224
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,720
We explain the power of positive thinking,

225
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,040
the law of attraction.

226
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,433
All right.

227
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,723
Yeah.

228
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,370
Oh.
