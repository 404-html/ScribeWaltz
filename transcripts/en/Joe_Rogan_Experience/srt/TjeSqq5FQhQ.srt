1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,490
What was the general good experience?
Will there's diversion,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,930
highlight knockouts,
one of the most ridiculous nightmare of

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,950
all time.
When you stand there with your hands

4
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,190
down,
step forward and it's like he was a

5
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,860
comic book scene.
It's like the way you knocked him out.

6
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,290
Like I said about you being a bad guy in
a movie.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,440
It seemed like you were a bad guy in a
boxing movie,

8
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:20,280
but it didn't make any sense.
You were the guy.

9
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:24,570
Like if I was say if there's someone was
I was a coach of a good guy and I was

10
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,400
sitting ringside and I was watching you
do that,

11
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,330
we'd be like,
Shit,

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,790
okay.
I'm tell you.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,110
Stood over them like that.
I was outside of my body.

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,800
I could see me and him standing there
like I was a third person.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,660
I can't explain it,
you know?

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,980
And then when I started throwing the
punches,

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,130
like I went back into my body and start
welding on the little whatever,

18
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,890
I can't.
I can't explain that feeling

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,290
so many different things that happened.
That was a big one too because I got

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,550
shared so much online.
Millions and millions of people saw that

21
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,211
online.
They're like,

22
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,290
what in the fuck is this guy got in his
head and that's when they started.

23
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,240
Who is this guy?
While we haven't heard about this

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,290
before?
It's like everybody's waking up to the

25
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,720
heavyweight division.
All of sudden it was so true and it was

26
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,010
the perfect convert.
There it is.

27
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,570
I did play it from the beginning.
Jamie.

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,110
Here it goes.
Come on.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,390
Straight box skills.
I,

30
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,390
I got boxing skills.
You know,

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,520
when the first photo I showed it,
I stayed disciplined.

32
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,780
I didn't abandoned the game plan,
you know,

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,410
and I show people that I could box.

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,360
Yeah.
And he knows probably the only time I

35
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,010
just really just stay super disciplined.
Not despite,

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,490
but this first one,
this part,

37
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,320
right?
This one right here.

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,500
I went outside of my body right here.
I'm standing.

39
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,780
Then I came back.
I kid you not.

40
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't know what the hell was going on
with me.

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,880
That was ridiculous.
It was ridiculous.

42
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,280
He said,
no he didn't.

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,451
Yeah,
he was,

44
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,370
uh,
he was quite upset that the strangest

45
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,380
little concoction.
He's got dreadlocks.

46
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,960
They're little like tape.
Yeah,

47
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:00,300
that seems like that would get in the
way to keep it up.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,480
You know,
the Asians believe in it too.

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,670
That was,
that was sweet too.

50
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,330
Then the referee gave me,
I don't

51
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,850
know,
it would have been funnier.

52
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,410
The railroad let go when he wrote to the
other corner,

53
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,750
talk about a movie that would have been.
But you know,

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,260
that fight right there was the real
start of it all,

55
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,150
you know,
in terms of public perception.

56
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,560
Exactly,
exactly.

57
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,080
I knew I was really going somewhere with
that,

58
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:33,081
especially when it went viral and then
coming back with Ortiz made it cause

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,770
people would have made it that much more
interesting to see what I'm going to do

60
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:41,190
now because people tune in now whether
they they love me or hate me,

61
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:43,290
they tuned into seeking.
I'm not next personnel.

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,710
Yeah.
No.

63
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,710
At this point in time,
trt bell TRT Vito Belfort forever.

64
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,090
That was when he was on trt.
He was a different kind of human being.

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,020
He was just completely different than he
is in every circumstance.

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,220
Oh yeah.
Looking back,

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,980
you can

68
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,461
see that.
I mean,

69
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,500
because when I fought him,
I fought him on trt.

70
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,200
You found him when he was at though the
super victorious.

71
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,930
Absolutely.
Looked like fucking the incredible hulk,

72
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,330
but muscles on his fucking eyebrows.
Yeah.

73
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,420
Looking back you can see that,
you know,

74
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,160
but at the time as a fighter you got to
be.

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,260
You can't think like that,
you know what I mean?

76
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,310
What are they looking at it?
That doesn't even do it just doesn't do

77
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:23,380
it justice that's supposed to be before
and after.

78
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,460
And
I'm just recovering from a cold or the

79
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,010
week.
I'm a little congested so I keep

80
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:31,150
coughing.
The real,

81
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,600
the real key.
It's a better one.

82
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,000
That's better.
That's way better.

83
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,920
That's much more accurate.
And he's

84
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,620
the guy who was known to take things,
took things early in his career.

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,710
Remember when he fought randy when he
was 19,

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,130
he was 240 pounds.

87
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,410
Yeah,
exactly his next start at the top of his

88
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,960
head.
But um,

89
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,860
yeah,
I remember there was a picture of us

90
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,390
both on the scale in Brazil and you
know,

91
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,610
looking back now years,
Holy Shit,

92
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,820
you know,
anyone else with the guys kinda big blah

93
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,910
blah blah blah blah,
but you don't think like that the time

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,400
you can't as a fight,
if you start having those thoughts,

95
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,220
those doubts start looking at fight his
physique and thinking,

96
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,270
oh,
he looks good.

97
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,350
You've already lost,
you know.

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,020
But in hindsight,
you can look back and say,

99
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,270
holy fuck,
what was I thinking?

100
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,400
You know,
this guy's fucking body out of his mind.

101
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,250
I remember on there,
I was trying to get a rise out of him

102
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,210
and he kept putting his hand in my face.
I'm not a religious guy and you know,

103
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,260
God bless anyone that is,
you know,

104
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,900
I mean that I respect everyone's
opinions,

105
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,590
but I'm not in as we know,
veto is heavily religious.

106
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,720
And he kept sticking this thing in my
face.

107
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,280
He was pissing me off.
Come here,

108
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,210
come here.
And he leans in.

109
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,040
I said,
there is no Jesus

110
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,400
made.
Maybe there is,

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
maybe there isn't,
you know,

112
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,140
me getting a job with a head kick in the
second round,

113
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,430
but maybe that was God the watting may
who knows?

114
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,300
What did he say?
Some fucking project is bullshit.

115
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,210
So the drug actually prolongs were
intensifies the depression,

116
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,171
you know,
maybe.

117
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,870
Okay.
For very short term use of very severe

118
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,850
depression,
but these are not things you want to go

119
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,670
on and stay on for a length of time.
What's fascinating to me is when I talk

120
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:13,810
to people that are on them that want to
talk to you,

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,490
like they're on some cancer medication
or they're on something that cures

122
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,580
polio,
like they,

123
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,620
they make it seem like you're
insensitive to the possibility that

124
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:24,900
there's other solutions.
Right.

125
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,360
And there were many other solutions.
We have really good evidence for the

126
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,730
antidepressant effect of physical
activity.

127
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,130
Yes.
Both to prevent and treat.

128
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,720
We have very good evidence for
supplemental fish oil or omega three

129
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:42,721
fatty acids to permit and CBDS.
Well and the microbiome looks like it's

130
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,550
involved in our mental states as well.
So,

131
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,980
you know,
there's so many different ways.

132
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,160
Yes,
CBD for sure.

133
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:51,580
So again,
gets back to inflammation it and it gets

134
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,990
back to in an integrative approach and
not just relying on a single thing like

135
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,440
a pharmaceutical treatment.
Yeah,

136
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,910
I've talked to intelligent people that
are on Ssri in one form or another and

137
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,030
even ones that have struggled were on
one for a while and then it stopped

138
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,520
working and then they tried another one
and they're combining ones and they're

139
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,540
on this weird sort of chemical
rollercoaster and they reject any

140
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,130
possible notion that there's other
alternatives.

141
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,440
Especially when you bring up the
exercise one,

142
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,090
right?
I bring up the exercise one,

143
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,571
they go,
oh,

144
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,450
this fucking meathead exercise.
We just stop and I'm like,

145
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,350
I'm telling you.
We did this thing with my friends called

146
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:31,490
sober October and what we did is we no
alcohol,

147
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,730
no anything for the month of October,
but also we did this fitness challenge

148
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,820
and we got really carried away and we're
all competing against each other with

149
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,660
this heart rate app.

150
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,070
So we're working out three hours,
four hours a day.

151
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:43,760
It was crazy.
But what was interesting about it to me

152
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,210
was not just that your body sort of
adapts when you force it to work that

153
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,180
many hours,
but that your mood is phenomenal.

154
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,350
I felt so good.
Yeah.

155
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,920
And I was telling everybody,
if you could take what I like,

156
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,100
I don't feel that good right now.
I mean I felt great,

157
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,490
but I don't feel as good as I did during
October because I was working out four

158
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,680
hours a day.
It was.

159
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,090
If you could get that in pill form,
you would take it every day if there was

160
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:12,680
no side effects because it literally
removed anxiety.

161
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,100
All the internal chatter,
all the negative chatter,

162
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,290
it was gone.
Everything seemed amazing.

163
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,270
True.
And there are side effects of physical

164
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,680
activity are great.
You know,

165
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,530
it revs up immune function,
improves the gesture and sleep,

166
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,660
all that you mentioned,
the anxiety,

167
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,440
the by far and away,
the most effective treatment I found for

168
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,580
anxiety is simple.

169
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,550
A simple breathing technique,
regulating the breath.

170
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:38,750
I've seen this work for the most extreme
forms of panic disorder and the drugs

171
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,590
that we use for anxiety or the worst.
The benzodiazepines are highly

172
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,180
addictive.
Mess with your mind.

173
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,450
Yeah.
I have a good friend who has an issue

174
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,200
with anxiety medication and he takes it
all the time and when he does take it,

175
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,800
apparently it has that rebound effect
exactly right.

176
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,960
He gets horribly anxious.
Well,

177
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,740
these are handed out like candy and
nobody warns people how addictive they

178
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,260
are.
Worse addiction than an opiate.

179
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,290
Addiction.
Xanax really?

180
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,540
Well.
I did not know that.

181
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,160
Harder to get off of the opioids.
Wow.

182
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,460
Because out of all those voices,
as long as you're not personally trying

183
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,480
to figure it out and filter it yourself
with your own,

184
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,410
which is completely impossible,
but if you could just look at it

185
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:25,250
objectively from afar,
this is going to work itself out in a

186
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,900
far better way than has ever happened
before.

187
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,930
In our past.
There's never been this many voices and

188
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,930
our pastor has been like you were
talking about a select few voices.

189
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,440
The Walter cronkite's,
the whoever it is at the top,

190
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,060
and then everyone else sort of had to
wait for the narrative to be spelled out

191
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,040
for them.
That's not the case anymore.

192
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,060
That's right.
And,

193
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,950
and again,
I think it's the best of times in the

194
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,650
worst of times,
the best of times because all these new

195
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:53,651
voices are bringing all sorts of great
perspective and insight and intelligence

196
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,340
to the story that wasn't there before.

197
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,740
And that's great.
The problem is,

198
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:03,741
is if the infrastructure that used to be
there to kind of bring us all Paul bring

199
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:09,201
us all up to kind of basic level so that
we understood the facts disappears so

200
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:10,830
they,
we don't have anything that kind of

201
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,710
makes it so that we all understand
what's at issue and what's at stake and

202
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:18,030
what the facts are so that we can act as
a democracy in a sensible way.

203
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,510
Then the question is how do we run a
democracy?

204
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,040
You know,
because if we could have all these

205
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,300
different,
you know,

206
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,030
I like to think about the difference
between the culture channel and the

207
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,860
democracy channels.
So in the culture channel,

208
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,270
this is the best of times by orders of
magnitude and the stuff on television

209
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,680
today is a billion times better than
anything from the 19 seventies in 19

210
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:38,510
eighties.
Yeah.

211
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,310
And it's,
that's a product of this incredible

212
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,990
competition and the fact that you can
have anything and any niche market and

213
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:49,170
as long as it's enough,
it makes sense to do it and that's

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,033
what's great.

215
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,050
But when you turn to the democracy
channel,

216
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,890
the same fragmentation,
the same niche market,

217
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,660
the same reality of us all living in
these different universes means we can't

218
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,440
address problems as a democracy with
even the same facts.

219
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,300
And that's a real problem because if we
all live in our own fact universe,

220
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,230
but we have to same face,
the same real problems in the same real

221
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,600
earth,
then we're not going to decide them in

222
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:18,750
any sensible way.
And how you solve that problem is really

223
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,400
hard.
Like we're not going back.

224
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,770
Thank God we're not going back to the 19
sixties.

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,980
It's just not going to be the case that
there are three channels we get to

226
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,300
watch.
That's just not gonna happen.

227
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,411
Um,
and,

228
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,870
and it's a great thing because we've got
all this amazing culture,

229
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:34,620
but what do we do on the democracy side?
How do we build a democracy,

230
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,250
recognizing that everybody's not going
to spend all their time geeking out

231
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:40,620
about campaign finance reform
legislation.

232
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I.
And that's why I think we need to think

233
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,530
about these other ways to bring people
to some sensible understanding.
