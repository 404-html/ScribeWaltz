00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,340
Hello Freak bitches.
What?

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,130
So how long have you been raising bees?
Probably only,

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,750
maybe four years.
What,

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,300
how'd you get started in that?
How do you start raising beings?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,930
Start with one.
We'll actually start with to really

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,830
know,
um,

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,440
they're not like rabbits,
but they do produce quite quickly,

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,290
you know?
Uh,

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,160
my dad raised bees,
uh,

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,590
I just,
we always saw boxes out in the corner of

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,330
the house.
We grew up in la here and you know,

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,100
the weather's so great.
So there's lots of activity that's the

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,740
bummer about being unveiled now.
Not a lot of,

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,800
not a lot of b action going on.
It's too high.

15
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,370
It's too cold and certain vegetables
grow there,

16
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,950
but not a lot.
But uh,

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,210
in California,
the ranch love,

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,470
I love it.
I got it.

19
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,040
I had a friend who in his backyard,
he,

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,870
he probably had six hives and he had
this one really intense kind of rogue

21
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:01,830
hive where maybe the queen had some kind
of strain of it,

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,840
a africanized or something.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,320
And her wife could not,
his wife could not go out in the

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,810
backyard without being attacked,
you know.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,970
So he says,
Hey,

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,740
can I go put my bees on your property so
they can cycle this queen out,

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,390
you know,
they got some breeding in.

28
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,810
It was just off Jesus Christ.
So he,

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,250
he brought it out to the ranch,
he pinched the B and then a pinch.

30
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,320
The queen pinched it.
What do you mean killed it?

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,770
And then she's crying.
It's a nice euphemism.

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,640
You didn't have to shoot it or nothing.
Hold still.

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,130
So he just grabbed the queen and killed
her.

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,010
Well has pinched it could because she
was reproducing.

35
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:43,050
I mean they lay a million eggs in their
lives.

36
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:45,240
It's insane that,
I mean,

37
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,560
I,
I basically,

38
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,740
I could sit here and talk a whole hour
about bees because they're so

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,450
interesting.
Let's do it.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,120
Alright,
well the listener,

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,550
I'm not scaring,
you know,

42
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,610
they'll listen.
They'll listen.

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,990
Trust me.
It's interesting stuff.

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,310
So yeah,
put it,

45
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,540
put a new queen in there.
And they,

46
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,040
they cycled through all of the other BS.
I mean they only live a month.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,030
So what is a no,
so informal reaction when people go in

48
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,760
the yard would be,
they would just disinterest.

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,920
They wouldn't care about you as long as
you're not interrupting the hive.

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,650
Exactly.
But your wife would go out there and

51
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,870
they would just get crazy.
Yeah,

52
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,240
it was,
oh yeah,

53
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,170
this wasn't me.
This was my friends while.

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,013
That's right.
Um,

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,063
but,
uh,

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,520
yeah,
I mean,

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,180
but he,
he's kind of used to it and she was not.

58
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,520
She was out to go swimming or go out
there and they would,

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,590
they would get crazy with him,
but he's like,

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,580
it just doesn't bother me.

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,020
But she was like,
fuck this queen.

62
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,670
Fuck this hive.
Yeah.

63
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,690
Yeah.
Pretty much.

64
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,330
And there are certain things if we're,
we're in black,

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,720
they all attack you.
They think you're a bear.

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,400
You know what's,
yeah,

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,550
uh,
if you've just eaten banana's,

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,140
there's some,
there's some,

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,560
I don't know,
a smell or something in it that is

70
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,010
similar to their attack pheromone that
they set off.

71
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,020
So there's a few things I've learned
over the years.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
Tony Bananas and don't,
don't wear black.

73
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,380
Exactly.
That's all you gotta do.

74
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,010
But I learned this stuff being in the
bee club.

75
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,380
You're in a prison.
I was in the bee club.

76
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,311
Yeah,
in,

77
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:12,701
uh,
in,

78
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,810
uh,
in the bay area.

79
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,160
Yeah.
We'd meet down at the,

80
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,010
uh,
American Legion's Paul and have a

81
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,110
monthly meeting,
you know,

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,610
one of those dorks like me and my buddy.
Oh my God,

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,290
we would just sit there and kind of
laugh about them.

84
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,330
But we're sitting there,
we're here to learn some stuff.

85
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,130
But there were people up there that,
okay,

86
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,980
we inseminated the queen with this and
you know,

87
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,840
there were counting bs,
you know,

88
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,130
we put little numbers on every B and
we've caught their flight pattern and

89
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,700
how many were reproducing this.
And I mean it,

90
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,270
it's all,
you know,

91
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,030
it's all a,
like they're,

92
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,470
they're,
they're doing research on how to make

93
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,200
the stronger because the bees are going
away.

94
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,483
But,
um,

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,330
you know,
it's,

96
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,740
this might this little Varroa mite
that's killing a lot of them too,

97
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,720
along with the pesticides and
herbicides.

98
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
But,
uh,

99
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,770
you know,
people that are so into it and we're

100
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,230
just gonna sit in there going home,
man,

101
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,960
what have we gotten ourselves into?
But it's Kinda,

102
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,870
you know,
it's funny in a certain way,

103
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,960
but I'm glad that it's happening.
But uh,

104
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,200
you know,
I get it at the end of the season,

105
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,520
you get like 500 pounds of honey and
you're handing them out to your friends

106
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,840
and everyone's loving it.

107
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,480
Five hundred pounds of honey.
That's insane.

108
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,050
And we're bottling it up.
My kids are filtering it,

109
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,720
we're bottling it up and it,
dude,

110
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,350
it's just straight from the hive into a
bottle.

111
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,980
I mean,
after you filtered it and it really

112
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,960
helps with allergies.
It helps with,

113
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,040
uh,
you know,

114
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,100
the whatever,
getting the pollens and then nectars

115
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,770
from the area.
So when you take that in and it helps

116
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,900
build your immune system.
Yeah,

117
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,060
I've heard that.
So you've experienced that personally?

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,000
Absolutely.
And I think being stung by bees helps

119
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,720
you to,
it helps with,

120
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,660
with something getting your,
your immune system built up.

121
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,480
It's supposed to be really good for
arthritis.

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,040
They,
they take people like literally take

123
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,110
bees,
people that are,

124
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,310
that have serious arthritis in their
hands and they sting their hands.

125
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,430
Right.

126
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,230
That on purpose.
I think there's some people that do it

127
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,430
for their lips here in la.

128
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,850
Well,
I think you need people that are so

129
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,511
deep,
deep,

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,690
deep into the pe world because you're
not going to do it.

131
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm not going to do it,
but if someone's just so far gone,

132
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:29,270
they're measuring all their bs and
monitoring their flight patterns and

133
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,780
checking their DNA.
I'm just fascinated that there was a

134
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:37,781
clear differentiation between a normal b
and the way these bees were behaving

135
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,490
that you could tell that the queen was
kind of a free.

136
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,830
But I tell you,
those freak beast,

137
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,000
the Africanized or whatever,
now there's a Zombie bee and we can,

138
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:49,100
we can get into that too.
But uh,

139
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,780
they are,
they are aggressive and an aggressive,

140
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,820
you know,
it's like any society,

141
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,790
they do well,
they,

142
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,410
they get most,
they produce a lot of honey and they,

143
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,940
they,
they're very,

144
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,420
very prolific in what they do,
you know?

145
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,490
Yeah.
I've had killer bee honey.

146
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,340
They make killer be like,
oh,

147
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,960
what sounded good on it?
I don't know if he knows any better.

148
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,390
If it's a killer bee honey is better
than regular honey,

149
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,270
but just pretty dope to have killer bee
honey around your house,

150
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,661
you know,
that.

151
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,160
And the uh,
uh,

152
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,720
uh,
Gosh.

153
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,370
Oh,
what's this stuff called?

154
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,860
I mean,
there's lots of really cool healing

155
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:29,840
properties in,
in like even the,

156
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,560
the,
the kind of glue that they use to plug

157
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,580
up holes and you know,
uh,

158
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,490
the Royal Jelly,
which is,

159
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,950
you know,
comes from there,

160
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,470
like the brain and it,
that's how they produce a queen.

161
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,630
I mean there.
So Royal Jelly is.

162
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

163
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,630
It's from their brains.
Brain juice,

164
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,620
man.
Holy Shit.

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,930
How does it come out as it come out of a
hole somewhere?

166
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,170
A,
what do they have to scoop it out of

167
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:56,600
their fucking heads?
I haven't seen it that close,

168
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,590
but
they injected into the,

169
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,710
injected,
into the queen cell or there's a cell

170
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,780
that they make when a new queen is being
made.

171
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,380
So all the bees that are flying around
that you see out here,

172
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,180
you know,
they're all females.

173
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,460
It's a huge,
it's all female society,

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,220
so the drones that are in there,
which are the males,

175
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:19,490
they're there just to reproduce and then
they get kicked out in the wintertime

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,340
and they all die.
Yeah.

177
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,030
Whoa.
Yeah,

178
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:24,410
man.
It's hard outside.

179
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,750
Brutal.
Brutal for us men in the B world.

180
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,090
So if they all die,
how do they continue to reproduce?

181
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,050
Well,
there's some,

182
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,760
I guess the couple stay on.
They,

183
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,663
they,
they,

184
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,480
the queen makes more.
Wow.

185
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,720
So those guys are just dead.
The Queen makes more on the new ones.

186
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,490
Takeover the new boys.
Yeah.

187
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,990
Yeah.
And they're just doing work.

188
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,710
They're just there.
They're just fertilizing.

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,330
That's what they're doing.
They're just there to fuck.

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,910
And then everybody else is doing all the
real word fuck and go die.

191
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,910
That's what you get to do this brutal
world.

192
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,930
That's what a fucking crazy world.
And then the queen goes around the hive

193
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,640
and finds the females,
other,

194
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,910
other potential queens and stabs them
while they're in the hive.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,110
Pretty much.
Yeah.

196
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,380
Well they're,
they're all females or all female except

197
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:11,750
for those drones.
And then if there's,

198
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,840
if they're making a,
you know,

199
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,390
she knows she's going to die or they're,
they're kind of pissed off with her.

200
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,460
She's not reproducing as much as she
should.

201
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,810
She will take off with like half the
hive and that's why you see a swarm.

202
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,990
So she'll go and form a new hive and
then these ones have a little queen cell

203
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,940
that they've laid eggs and start to make
a new queen.

204
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,530
So that's how they reproduce.
And if there's three or four queen cells

205
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:38,780
in there,
the first queen that's born,

206
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,910
she comes out and she kills all the
other Queens so she can rule game of

207
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:47,480
thrones type shit.
That's fascinating.

208
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,680
And you're going to get bs.
I can tell him I'm right now looking at

209
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,720
my head,
I'm just looking at websites in my hand.

210
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,290
I'm like trying to find out where to get
the bees.

211
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,390
Yeah,
that sounds like an amazing way to get

212
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:59,490
honey.
I mean it just sounds like a really cool

213
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,410
thing to do to a taste.

214
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,910
So good.
And we've got,

215
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,350
you know,
we,

216
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,770
we,
we have a place in Hawaii,

217
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
so we've got Hawaiian flavored Hawaiian
flavored.

218
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,560
Well there's stuff,
you know,

219
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,550
that they,
they,

220
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,470
uh,
get the nectar and pollen from over

221
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,780
there and you know,
Hawaii's nonstop.

222
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,550
Yeah.
So you're getting honey year round.

223
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,280
What island and Maui.
Oh Man,

224
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,530
I love Maui.
That's a beautiful spot.

225
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,540
So when you,
how do you know that a b is Africanized?

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,820
Because that was the big thing that
everybody was worried about.

227
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,190
You remember it was like the early
nineties.

228
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,150
Everybody's like,
did we say,

229
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:36,960
found an African killer bee and no next
echo or something.

230
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:38,010
It was like,
it's coming up,

231
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,390
it's going to,
it's going to swarm.

232
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,600
They going to take over the country.
And inside of a few years there was a

233
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,890
big hysteria about that,
right?

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,581
Yeah.
Well,

235
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,950
and there are,
there are states where there are more

236
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,710
prevalent than others and they're just
more aggressive or more aggressive and

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,553
they're,
they're,

238
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,540
they're,
they're very protective.

239
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,490
So you'll get stung if you're messing
with them.

240
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,070
So that's all it is.
There's nothing so.

241
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,310
But we,
there was a big concern that they were

242
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,070
going to take over and that it was going
to be that these bees,

243
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,500
we're just gonna come here and outbreed
the regular bs.

244
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,400
And you're laughing.
Remember possible?

245
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,350
Oh yeah,
for sure.

246
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:13,530
There's some great movies about that to
the killer bees.

247
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,570
But there's no way to tell by looking at
them.

248
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,340
I don't know.
I don't think so.

249
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,930
I'm somewhat into it,
but I haven't investigated that part

250
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,080
yet.
So these bees that came over from the,

251
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,600
perhaps africanized bees that when they
killed the queen and then introduce

252
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,450
those bees to the rest of the bs that
everybody chill out.

253
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,910
Yeah.
So it was just that one crazy bitch.

254
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,720
Well,
yeah,

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,900
she,
you know,

256
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,390
she's laying the eggs.
She's passing on the whatever DNA.

257
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,640
Uh,
but those,

258
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,140
the uh,
the uh,

259
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,870
the forager bees,
the ones that you see out and about,

260
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,990
they only live a month so they will die
out.

261
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,940
And how long did she live?
She can live between one to five years.

262
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,680
Wow.
What a bizarre culture.

263
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,540
Really,
really cool.

264
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,550
And without them,
I mean you're,

265
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,460
there's lots of,
you know,

266
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,530
orange almonds,
all kinds of stuff,

267
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,200
especially here in California and the,
you know,

268
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,610
in the,
uh,

269
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,010
in the center,
a center of California,

270
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,110
all that farming,
if there's no bs,

271
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,310
there's,
there's no fruit.

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,220
Yeah.
What a bizarre sort of symbiotic

273
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:27,150
relationship that we have with some one
weird insect pollination.

274
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,640
I mean,
you would have thought that that would

275
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:32,310
have been taken care of some other way
and it wouldn't be that a b has to do

276
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:32,851
it.
Well,

277
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,860
there are others that do it.
What,

278
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,490
doing butterflies and certain,
I'll tell you,

279
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,530
not just honey bees,
but there's,

280
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,150
there's probably over 3000 different
kinds of bees there.

281
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,160
They don't have,
they don't have a hive society like the

282
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,210
honeybees do,
but all these other bees are like

283
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,770
loners.
They live in the ground or something and

284
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,620
they just,
they just get enough pollen for

285
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,430
themselves.
So they're kind of lone lone wolves out

286
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,100
there.
But the honeybees are the ones that have

287
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,550
more of a society.
I raise chickens and um,

288
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,030
this chicken thing with us happened.
We just got a couple of chickens and

289
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,750
next thing you know we have this giant
fucking chicken house at 23 chickens and

290
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,370
they're running around my yard.
Is it the same way with the leg?

291
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,810
Just kind of like slowly step into this
and then get deeper and deeper?

292
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,270
Yeah,
I mean just like getting your first

293
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,030
tattoos,
like.

294
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,950
Yeah.
Wow,

295
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,150
that's cool.
I want more.

296
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,560
Right.
And uh,

297
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,780
yeah,
you just start to appreciate it.

298
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,870
I think when I come off tour it's like
my head is like ricocheting around and

299
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,530
there I go and I sit and watch the bees.
Just watch them go in and out,

300
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,620
in and out.
There's like this frigging landing strip

301
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:49,090
that he come in and they look so busy.
It relaxes me.

302
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,410
I know.
It's like,

303
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,610
wow.
Okay.

304
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,780
I'm not that busy.

305
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,950
Yeah,
just chill.

306
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,610
No.

307
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,540
Whey do you like a glass wall in any way
where you can see into the.

308
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,820
Have you ever seen those hives where
they make them?

309
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,800
Do you have it like that?
We can look in there.

310
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,930
Yeah.
I've got one of the.

311
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:07,650
Yeah.
Well,

312
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,000
oh that's like a display one we bring
into schools and stuff.

313
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,670
See I don't have one of those,
but I got a couple different kinds of

314
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:17,250
hives and it's fun to see,
you know,

315
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:22,251
sometimes you have the frames that I'm
already kind of prebuilt and then they

316
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,850
deposit their stuff in it or you'll
watch them grow their own comb from

317
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:30,390
nothing and it's pretty amazing.
How do you get them to stay there

318
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:31,950
though?
Like how does it work?

319
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:36,510
Like I see those boxes and I know that
bees do have hives in those boxes,

320
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,970
but how does it initially start?
Well,

321
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:40,470
it's the queen.
Wherever the queen is,

322
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,460
that's where they go.
So she decides to be in that.

323
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,250
So how do you get her to stay in that
box?

324
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,760
You have a place for her to lay eggs.

325
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,970
I mean that's,
that's it.

326
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,480
Yet.
And she will stay and if she's there,

327
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,680
you know when they go off to to swarm to
go find a new hive.

328
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,680
If you've ever seen a swarm up in a
tree,

329
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,820
just like a giant,
like football size or even bigger,

330
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,480
a shape of just bs at Queen is right in
the middle and they're all just around

331
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,690
her and then they send off the scouts to
find a new spot.

332
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,011
They come back,
say,

333
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:16,140
hey,
it's over here to do their little wiggle

334
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:19,560
dance and that shows them how to get
there and they all go there.

335
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,730
We had an incident one time

336
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,010
once on fear factor where we covered
these people with bs.

337
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,690
There was like a beekeeper there and he
had his hive and a local hive came over

338
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,560
and a group of bees came over and met
with these bees and we had to clear the

339
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:33,720
area out and they had to have a
conversation.

340
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,040
Literally what happened,
they were in the air just floating

341
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:42,240
around and then they worked it out and
then the Arby's came back and they went

342
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:44,460
back to the hive and their bees went
about their business.

343
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,290
They were just like,
what the fuck's going on?

344
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,390
You guys moving in here?
Like,

345
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,960
what are you doing?
Territorial?

346
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,490
Somehow or another they worked it out
though.

347
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,100
There was no death.
There will

348
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,870
be fucking braveheart war.
It just.

349
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:56,960
They figured it out at a good
negotiator.

350
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,190
I wonder what do they communicate with
any living they using pheromones.

351
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,270
Like how are they?
Smells.

352
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,310
Smells and dances.
Dances,

353
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
yeah.
Some B will find it.

354
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,060
Like,
hey man,

355
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:15,380
I found like a garden somewhere and
they'll come back and they'll see him do

356
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,830
the little wiggle thing.
It's like how many wiggles his way and

357
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,720
then they turned left and then turn that
that's,

358
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,220
that's like a half a mile this way and
then that,

359
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,670
that way.
And then they all learn it and then they

360
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,690
go,
hey,

361
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,550
I found some water.
Here's a place to go.

362
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,040
So they literally can tell them where
something is,

363
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,380
but the movements,
holy shit,

364
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,590
that's crazy.
So it's almost like a,

365
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,360
like a body language.
Pretty much.

366
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,040
Yep.
And they all know it somehow.

367
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,060
Instinctively.
Yep.

368
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,350
Wow.

369
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,540
Yeah.
It's pretty bizarre.

370
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,970
There's a lot,
a lot to learn about those things.

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,570
That's really bizarre.
Yeah.

372
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,340
I didn't know that they can tell each
other where something is just by

373
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,490
wiggling,
like they have like this means a mile.

374
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,250
That means go left.
Wow,

375
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,091
man.
I can get.

376
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,230
I'm going to get deep and bs,
man.

377
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,860
What the fuck have you done?
All right.

378
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah.
And there's,

379
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,230
I'm sure there's probably a feel of
like,

380
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,753
wow,
I'm,

381
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,150
I'm,
there's a whole society right here in my

382
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,210
yard and I'm,
I'm overseeing it,

383
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,520
you know,
there's probably a sense of importance.

384
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,140
Uh,
but you know,

385
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,280
I,
I lay off him.

386
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,570
I mean there are people that are
checking them all the time and this and

387
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,610
that and oh,
you got to put the,

388
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,860
the like certain pads in there to kill
the Mites and you gotta do this and

389
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:31,130
that.

390
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,280
It's like another natural man.
They've been around longer than we have.

391
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,680
So just let them go.
They know what they're doing.

392
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,190
I don't know who's to say I know what
I'm doing with them.

393
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,510
Do they need specific types of plants
around them in order to survive?

394
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,463
Yeah.
Well,

395
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,470
something that they can pollinate and
you know,

396
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,370
it's from a,
it's good to plant,

397
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,650
you know what I've planned,
I planted stuff that,

398
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,641
you know,
okay,

399
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,880
it blooms in the spring and then there's
other stuff that blooms in the summer

400
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:03,320
and then there's other stuff that blooms
in the late summer so they've always got

401
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,150
something going on.
But they hibernate.

402
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,260
They hibernate in the winter.
No kidding.

403
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,330
Was like bears.
Yep.

404
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,170
So when you are in Vail and you,
uh,

405
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,810
you have obviously a really cold weather
in the winter,

406
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,820
what do they do?
They just shut down and stay in the hive

407
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,410
and don't move.
Well,

408
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,180
uh,
I don't have bees unveil yet and I'm

409
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:21,620
going to try and figure out how to do
that.

410
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,740
But uh,
they mean just like cattle,

411
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,770
you know,
your winter room down in the lowlands.

412
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,970
So,
uh,

413
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,030
I haven't found a place to,
to have bees go where there,

414
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,350
you know,
there's less.

415
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,790
No,
but I'll,

416
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,950
I'll figure something out because it's
something I love doing.
