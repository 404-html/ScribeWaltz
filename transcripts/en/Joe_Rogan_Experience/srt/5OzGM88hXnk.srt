1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,300
The joe rogan experience were bananas.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:03,781
It's crazy.

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:05,010
And then you know what it is though.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,000
Here's the real victims of ending the
drug war would be all those prisons that

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:12,100
would no longer be full
of young black men.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,411
You say this,

7
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,990
but what if your business
is running prisons,

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,801
right?

9
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,020
I mean it's your business
is prison guards.

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
I mean that's

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,440
someone think of the prison,

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,620
the prison industrial complex prison
guards lobby against drug legalizations

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
cause do it because they
want to stay in office.

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,200
They want to keep their jobs and how many
lives has to be ruined in the process.

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,910
Fucking crazy to vampire system.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,480
So horrible vampire system and it's
a system that's brought out of it's,

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:45,670
it's based on these reverberations
are these vibrations from the past.

18
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:48,960
It's all like this scramble
when a people were retarded,

19
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,870
when they came over on boats and
this is just how they did things.

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,970
They throw in a jail,

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,650
he'll fucking scoundrel.

22
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,940
You were smoking marijuana or whatever.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,990
The rule that you broke is that
they realize that they can do it.

24
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,560
So they do do it and they throw you in
some fucking cage in 2014 the fact that

25
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,340
that's still going on and that people
are actually profiting from it.

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,090
This is,

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,000
these are more things that the Internet
has a huge fucking problem with.

28
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,630
Cause the Internet's guys like you is
young fellas that are very smart and

29
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,060
unconventional and seeing
the system and being like,

30
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:18,481
you know what?

31
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,314
I don't buy it.

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,230
I think a,

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,100
there's shit that people I knew
growing up that were adults,

34
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,530
I knew they were fucking idiots and
they knew they made bad choices.

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,150
And now I'm looking at the,

36
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,300
the repercussions of this everywhere.

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,530
I'm looking at an item saying,

38
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,130
no,

39
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,760
this is dumb.

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,630
This is,

41
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,920
so this is one of the things,

42
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,830
especially talking to college
students that I love bringing up,

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,821
which is that,

44
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,520
and I'm the first to admit that like
I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.

45
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,300
99% of the time eat.

46
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,550
Especially when I got started,

47
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,630
I still don't know.

48
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:45,931
And I've,

49
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,990
I've come to realize like I've got,

50
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,970
I've got been lucky enough to
meet some pretty like successful,

51
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:51,661
impressive people.

52
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:53,400
But like you dig under the surface,

53
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,270
we're all just hacking it.

54
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,163
Like we're all just figure,

55
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,741
expertise,

56
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,461
experience those things.

57
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,180
I'll help.

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,460
But like every one of
us is a fallible human,

59
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,840
all the conventions and rules and
status quo we know were created by other

60
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,010
fallible humans.

61
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,230
And there's no reason not
to look at that and go,

62
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:07,740
Huh,

63
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,820
does it have to be that way?

64
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,960
Or why is it that way?

65
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,610
And if the reason why is low,

66
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,390
that's the way it is.

67
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,710
Well that's a terrible reason,

68
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,701
you know?

69
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,534
And,

70
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,730
and when you see the world
as being that hackable,

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,593
so to speak,

72
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,830
like you start to realize,

73
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,011
all right,

74
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,431
well let's just,

75
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,660
let's actually question stuff.

76
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:21,970
And,

77
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,650
and for,

78
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:22,861
you know,

79
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:27,750
I remember I was a freshman at Uva when
nine 11 happened for this generation of

80
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,584
millennials coming up.

81
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,240
We mow nearly all of us.

82
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
One of our first really vivid memories
of the world was nine 11 this awful

83
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:34,914
tragedy.

84
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,850
And then we get into these two wars and
then think of all the authority figures

85
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,470
we've had in our life since that moment.

86
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,430
They've all at one point,

87
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,540
other either misled us,

88
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,250
this sort of deceived us.

89
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,431
Um,

90
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,690
you've got the financial crisis,

91
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,310
you've got the housing bubble,

92
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,540
all these conventions.

93
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:48,721
Oh,

94
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,291
trust us,

95
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:49,801
we know what we're doing.

96
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,371
This is the thing,

97
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,570
the American dream is buying a home,

98
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,553
go to college,

99
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,640
take on that student loan debt.

100
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,241
Don't worry,

101
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,380
there's a job waiting for you.

102
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,371
Every single one.

103
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,120
These conventions from,

104
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,560
from all these people in
power have not held up.

105
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,360
And so I think in particular,

106
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:01,810
millennials,

107
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,970
millennials look at that very
skeptically cause we're like,

108
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:04,121
all right,

109
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,954
you know what?

110
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,150
So the conventional stuff
didn't work out for anything.

111
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,680
Like we have no choice but to realize,

112
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:08,980
you know what,

113
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,791
we're all just hacking it.

114
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,270
So let's,

115
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,930
let's really,

116
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,100
let's dive into the passion.

117
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,610
Let's,

118
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,260
let's figure out a better
way to do something.

119
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,540
Not Settle for the way it always been.

120
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,740
I think you're completely right.

121
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,281
And I think,

122
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:18,970
um,

123
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,110
first of all I'm slightly annoyed by this
new statement and I'm forced to absorb

124
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:23,770
millennials.

125
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,960
I know it's terrible for you.

126
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,630
I'm sorry.

127
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm sorry.

128
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,871
I'm not buying,

129
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:27,880
you can rebrand this.

130
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,983
I think we should,

131
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,611
I really do.

132
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:29,861
This is,

133
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,480
I think there's a divisiveness or there's
a separation that comes when you start

134
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,350
labeling people by like
what era they were born in.

135
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,780
It's a state of mind
more than anything else.

136
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,261
Yeah,

137
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,861
I think so.

138
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,880
But I think it's horse shit,

139
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,190
generation x generation to fuck up.

140
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,111
It's just human.

141
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,300
It's like there's this idea of putting
things in a label generalization.

142
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,580
The human brace is evolving.

143
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,030
Watch father knows best and
then watch game of Thrones.

144
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,660
Okay,

145
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,400
shit's different now.

146
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,930
We don't have to come up with names for
the generations and your generation y

147
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,110
and there was fucking Jamie
from the laugh factory.

148
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,520
Tried to tell my friend,

149
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,030
uh,

150
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,270
uh,

151
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,000
Todd Parker,

152
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,060
Todd Parker's a standup comic
that I started out with.

153
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,500
Jamie was like,

154
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:11,890
body,

155
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,750
you have to be generation x guy.

156
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,950
This is what you would do.

157
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,600
You'd go on stage and everything.

158
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,790
My generation,

159
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,670
generation x,

160
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,560
think that's going to be your hook.

161
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,650
And I remember him trying to explain
it to change and I'm in the background

162
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,484
going,

163
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,360
did you hear what he told Tony to do?

164
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,870
What he tell tidy?

165
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,080
You must always wear a cowboy hat.

166
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,500
That was just thinking.

167
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,530
He would just look like woody from
toy story cause he needed the hat.
