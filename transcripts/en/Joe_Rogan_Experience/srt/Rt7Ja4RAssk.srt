1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,780
The Joe Rogan experience,
a lot of times,

2
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:04,220
man,
people don't think about it that way

3
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:06,710
because you think of morning is like
when you have to go to work.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,450
It's human male.
Is this what?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,010
Talking about human nature and I was
just playing.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,790
Come on.
How could that be possible?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Let me see that box.
Taste it.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,070
Taste it.
It's on that box.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,990
It's right on the box.
Oh,

10
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,824
it fell off.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,810
No,
it's missing.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,710
It's probably who.
Wait.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,570
Who was here last?
Oh,

14
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:42,590
it's probably dunkins

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,080
nails.
You imagine if you're.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,230
Do you want a podcast with someone?
You watched them trim them.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,780
How's your doing?
As you're doing like what the fuck are

18
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,390
you doing with those gross thing and
then it will be over somewhere in this

19
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,900
area.
Scanning the rest of the table.

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,350
Now I'm trying to find that one
who smokes joints with random strangers.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,810
Who knows what kinds of fucking weird
fecal herpes you're passing around.

22
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,860
When I put a toenail on my friends bond,
once he hit it and it smells.

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,760
That's not a friend.
You're an enemy posing as a friend.

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,250
You're a terrible person.
It burnt and smelled like hair.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,650
Once you go to Mexico,
you call going to Mexico.

26
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,570
Yep.
Be Down there.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,530
So you want to get home and that's part
of it too,

28
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,600
right?
Part of it too is like the disconnect,

29
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,160
unplug,
unplugging,

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,660
and then,
you know,

31
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:39,490
recharging your brain and being out
there and the desolate surroundings

32
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:42,010
going 140 miles an hour over bumps.
What gives you.

33
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,930
There's another side of it too that
gives you appreciation.

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,330
I have a kid now,
but I know my brother says to you on

35
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,550
there,
you also see the people,

36
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,470
how they live.
There are kids,

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,740
amazing kids and they live in chicken
coops,

38
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,210
the Bluetooth coupon by a host.
They live in chicken coops.

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,400
And I'm not kidding,
I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop.

40
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,240
That's what it is.

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,860
And there's kids,
and I actually call,

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
this is my little story,
but I,

43
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,040
there's,
there's,

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,820
there's,
um,

45
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,860
the kids that never grow up always come
out of Ohio.

46
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,330
So there's a little road after you've
turned down to blue date,

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,640
the Blue Gate on the right hand side,
there's a blue chicken coop and it looks

48
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:18,220
like every year for 10 years the same
kids come out.

49
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,290
They never get older.
They don't have shoes.

50
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,420
They're smiling.
We hand them stickers.

51
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,260
I stopped them,
give them.

52
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,880
I give them candy.
I talked to him.

53
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,920
The he signs autographs,
you take pictures,

54
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,200
you go back the next year they look the
same age and they they live job telling

55
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,940
you chicken coop.
I can draw it for you,

56
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,890
right?
It's a fucking chicken coop.

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,590
It looks like it's.
It's a chicken coop,

58
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,600
but it's not funny.
But you appreciate.

59
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,420
You come back and sometimes you look at
your kids and other people have kids

60
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,290
make.
You have no idea how easy your habit.

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,530
Yeah.
And then sometimes the kid,

62
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,360
that chicken,
we'll go to the dump and that's where

63
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,930
they find metal and they find scrap and
they take the aluminum cans and they get

64
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,850
their money and they're happy to.
They're happy.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,960
They don't.
They're not negative.

66
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:59,890
They're not pissed off.
I think part of the reason was lucky

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,880
is I try to put myself in a position to
get lucky,

68
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,420
which is by playing more and believe it
or not,

69
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,090
it's van Halen that influence that on
me.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,500
They were playing more than everybody.
They played three blocks from my house

71
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,690
in the backyard.
Now Monte,

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,290
I paid $1 to get in,
you know,

73
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,880
the singer Roth was blowing a tube
inside of this guy's drums.

74
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,130
And I'm going,
whoa man,

75
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,720
these guys are,
you know,

76
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,670
I was,
I thought they were great and everything

77
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,980
and they were playing cover songs and
they played a couple of originals I

78
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,830
think.
But what I was more impressed by at

79
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,740
least at that time was how often they
played.

80
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,100
They played every single night.
And I go,

81
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,500
we got to do that if we're going to have
any chance,

82
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:45,400
you know,
because my thinking was if we play more

83
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,290
than everybody might have to play free a
lot,

84
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,220
but if our name,
you know,

85
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,030
we might be able to brainwash people
into thinking they're supposed to like

86
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,864
us.
You know what I mean?

87
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,520
So,
and that's what happened though.

88
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,280
It was that persistence,
it was that playing free,

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,300
getting our name out.
We just happened to be at the whiskey

90
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:09,301
one night playing at during the week,
not even a big night or anything.

91
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,580
And the right guy was in the crowd that
law.

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,260
And he came up,
gave us his card.

93
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,220
And before you know,
we're,

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,590
we're recording,
we're,

95
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,470
we got airplay.
We don't even have a record deal.

96
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,800
I mean we,
our record deal was literally borrowing

97
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,870
15 grand from some guy named Fred.
Hey Fred.

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,900
Got 15 grand.
Yeah.

99
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,920
Okay.
So.

100
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,770
But we had a distribution deal.
So.

101
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,000
But this manager we had called Ellen
Devon.

102
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,730
He was from England.
He used to work for virgin records.

103
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:44,731
He had signed Berlin.
He signed motley crew and a year before

104
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:48,880
this and I'm the.
Then they would sell these bands off to

105
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:53,881
big labels.
Well he got us on Camy t when we had no

106
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:59,521
deal and no local bands were on Kamia
team Kayla West with no deal.

107
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,830
It was just unheard of and,
but that,

108
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,850
I don't know what kind of connection.

109
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,690
So it was just a matter of you being
persistent and planning all the time and

110
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:12,710
this guy saw that's such an important
lesson for young people who are thinking

111
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,120
about doing something.
Sure,

112
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,050
Opportunity presents itself when you
just fucking buster and dream it and

113
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,790
dream it.
So this is one of the things,

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,670
especially talking to college students
that I love bringing up,

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,580
which is that,
and I'm the first to admit it,

116
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,360
like I have no fucking clue what I'm
doing.

117
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,420
Ninety nine percent of the time,
especially when I got started,

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
I still don't know.
And I've,

119
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:34,850
I've come to realize like I've got,
I've got lucky enough to meet some

120
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,530
pretty successful,
impressive people.

121
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:39,110
But like you dig under the surface,
we're all just hacking it.

122
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,580
Like we're all just figure,
expertise,

123
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,910
experience those things all help.
But like every one of us is a fallible

124
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,450
human.

125
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,710
All the conventions and rules and status
quo we know were created by other

126
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:51,620
fallible humans.
And there's no reason not to look at

127
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:52,520
that and go,
Huh,

128
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,800
does it have to be that way?
Or why is it that way?

129
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,020
And if the reason why is that's the way
it,

130
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,550
well,
that's a terrible reason,

131
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,070
you know,
and,

132
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,600
and when you see the world as being that
hackable,

133
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,670
so to speak,
like you start to realize,

134
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,270
all right,
well let's just,

135
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,490
let's actually question stuff.
And for,

136
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,520
you know,
I remember I was a freshman at Uva when

137
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,400
nine slash 11 happened for this
generation of millennials coming up.

138
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,080
We,
most nearly all of us,

139
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,950
one of our first really vivid memories
of the world was 9:11 this awful

140
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,130
tragedy.
And then we get into these two wars and

141
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,310
then think of all the authority figures
we've had in our life since that moment.

142
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,380
They've all at one point another either
misled us,

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,240
this sort of deceive this.
Um,

144
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,180
you've got the financial crisis,
you've got the housing bubble,

145
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,590
all these conventions.
Oh,

146
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,670
trust us,
we know we're doing.

147
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,380
This is the thing,
the American dream is buying a home,

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,510
go to college,
take on that student loan debt.

149
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,220
Don't worry,
there's a job waiting for you.

150
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,900
Every single one.
These conventions from,

151
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,390
from all these people in power have not
held up.

152
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,640
And so I think in particular,
millennials,

153
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,830
millennials look at that very
skeptically because we're like,

154
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,664
all right,
you know what?

155
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,980
So the conventional stuff didn't work
out for anything.

156
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,710
Like we have no choice but to realize,
you know what,

157
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,070
we're all just hacking it.
So let's,

158
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,960
let's really,
let's dive into the passion.

159
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's,
let's figure out a better way to do

160
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,370
something.
Not Settle for the way that always been.
