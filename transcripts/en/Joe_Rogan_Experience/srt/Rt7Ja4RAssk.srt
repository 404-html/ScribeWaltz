1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,000
The joe rogan experience.
Well,

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,520
a lot of times man and people don't
think about it that way because you

3
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:06,710
think of morning is like when you have
to go to work.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,830
It's matter.
Human male is this,

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,930
what are you talking about?
Come on.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,800
How could that be possible?
You see that in the box?

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,360
Taste it.
Taste it.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,120
It's on that box.
It's right on the box.

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,643
Oh it fell off.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
I know it's missing.
It's probably who.

11
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:41,450
Wait,
who was here last?

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,630
Oh it's probably Dunkins.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,350
Trump does now cause you imagine if you,
what do you want a podcast with somebody

14
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:50,910
who watched some trim?
The how's your doing as you're doing

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,580
like what the fuck are you doing with
those gross thing and then it would be

16
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,900
over somewhere in this area is scanning
the rest of the table.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,610
No,
I'm trying to find that one.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Who smokes joints with random strangers?
Who knows what kinds of fucking weird

19
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,360
fecal herpes you're passing around.
When I put a toenail in my friends bond

20
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,860
once and he hit it and it smells.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,760
That's not a friend of a friend.
You're an enemy posing as a friend.

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,470
You're a terrible person.
It burns,

23
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:24,700
smelled like hair.
Yeah.

24
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,650
Once you go to mechy call going to
Mexico.

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,581
Yup.
You down there,

26
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,530
see when I get home.
And that's part of it too,

27
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,570
right?
Part of it too is like the disconnect,

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,160
unplug,
unplugging,

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,690
and then,
you know,

30
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:39,460
recharging your brain and being out
there and the desolate surroundings

31
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:42,010
going 140 miles an hour over bumps.
It gives you,

32
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,930
there's another side of it too that
gives you appreciation.

33
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:44,321
Not,
you know,

34
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,370
I have,
I have a kid now,

35
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,500
but I know my brother says it to you.
See you down there.

36
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,750
You also see the people,
how they live there.

37
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:52,720
Our kids,
amazing kids and they live in,

38
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,740
um,
chicken coops,

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,740
right?
The blue chicken coop down by a a hose.

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,210
They live in chicken coops.

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,430
And I'm not kidding,
I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop.

42
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,860
That's what it is.
And there's kids and I actually called,

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,540
this is my,
my own little story,

44
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,680
but I,
there's,

45
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,431
there's,
there's,

46
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,350
um,
the kids that never grew up always come

47
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:10,490
out of Ohio.
So there's this little road after you

48
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,090
turned down to blue date.
The Blue Gate on the right hand side,

49
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,590
there's a blue chicken coop and it looks
like every year for 10 years the same

50
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,090
kids come out.
They never get older,

51
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,550
they don't have shoes.
They're smiling.

52
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,960
We hand up stickers.
I stopped them,

53
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,100
give him,
I give him candy,

54
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,960
I talked to him.
The heat signs,

55
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,920
autographs,
you take pictures,

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
you go back the next year they look the
same age and they,

57
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,980
and they live job telling you chicken
coop.

58
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:34,120
I can draw it for you,
right?

59
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,890
It's,
it's a fucking chicken coop.

60
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,580
It looks like it's,
it's a chicken coop,

61
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,600
but it's not funny.
But you appreciate,

62
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,420
you come back and sometimes you look at
your kids and other people who kids

63
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,290
make,
you have no idea how easy your habit.

64
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,530
Yeah.
And then sometimes the kid,

65
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,360
that chicken,
we'll go to the dump and that's where

66
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,930
they find metal and they find scrap and
they take the aluminum cans and they get

67
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,850
their money and they're happy to,
they're happy.

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,960
They don't,
they're not negative.

69
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:59,860
They're not pissed off.
I think part of the reason was lucky

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,880
is I tried to put myself in a position
to get lucky,

71
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,420
which is by playing more.
And believe it or not,

72
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,090
it's van Halen that influence that on
me.

73
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,500
They were playing more than everybody.
They played three blocks from my house

74
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,700
in a backyard.
Now Mani,

75
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,290
I paid $1 to get in,
you know,

76
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,880
the singer Roth was blowing a tube
inside of this guy's drums.

77
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,230
And you know,
I'm going,

78
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,040
whoa man,
these guys are are,

79
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,260
you know,
I was,

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,680
I thought they were great and
everything.

81
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:30,250
And there are plenty of cover songs and
it played a couple of originals I think.

82
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:35,251
But what I was more impressed by,
at least at that time was how often they

83
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,900
played,
they played every single night.

84
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,630
And I go,
we got to do that if we're going to have

85
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,920
any chance,
you know,

86
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,940
because my thinking was if we play more
than everybody might have to play free a

87
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,050
lot,
but if our name,

88
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,930
you know,
we might be able to brainwash people in

89
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,780
thinking they're supposed to like us.
You know what I mean?

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,260
So,
so,

91
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:58,780
and that's what happened though.
It was that persistence.

92
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,750
It was that playing free,
um,

93
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,470
getting our name out.
Um,

94
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,870
we just happened to be at the whiskey
one night,

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
uh,
playing,

96
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,690
uh,
during the week,

97
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,820
not even a big night or anything.
And,

98
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,390
and the right guy was in the crowd that
lie and he came up,

99
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,620
gave us his card.
And before,

100
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,454
you know what,
we're,

101
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,590
we're recording,
we're,

102
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,470
we got air plague.
We don't even have a record deal.

103
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,220
I mean,
we,

104
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,220
our record deal was literally borrowing
15 grand from some guy named Fred.

105
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,630
Hey Fred,
you got 15 grand?

106
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,464
Yeah.
Okay.

107
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,690
So,
but we had a distribution deal.

108
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,620
So,
but this manager,

109
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,320
we had called El and Nivon,
he was from England.

110
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,590
He used to work for virgin records.
He had signed Berlin,

111
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:45,490
he signed motley crew and a year before
this.

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,400
And,
um,

113
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,690
then they would sell these bands off to
big labels.

114
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,120
Well,
he got us on Camy t when we had no deal

115
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,650
and no local bands were on Kamia and
Keller West with no deal.

116
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,260
It was just unheard of.
And,

117
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,900
but that,
I don't know what kind of connection he

118
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:05,150
had.

119
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,690
So it was just a matter of you being
persistent planning all the time and

120
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,150
this guy saw,
that's such an important lesson for,

121
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,610
for young people who are thinking about
doing something.

122
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,050
Sure opportunity presents itself when
you just fucking buster and dream it and

123
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,790
dream it.
So this is one of the things,

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,700
especially talking to college students
that I love bringing up,

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,590
which is that,
and I'm the first to admit it,

126
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,830
like I have no fucking clue what I'm
doing 99% of the time,

127
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,470
even especially when I got started,
I still don't know.

128
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,030
And I've,
I've come to realize like,

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,850
and I've got,
I've got been lucky enough to meet some

130
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,500
pretty successful,
impressive people.

131
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:39,140
But like you dig under the surface,
we're all just hacking it.

132
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,990
Like we're all just for expertise,
experience,

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,910
those things all help.
But like every one of us is a fallible

134
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,420
human.

135
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,710
All the conventions and rules and status
quo we know were created by other

136
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:51,620
fallible humans.
And there's no reason not to look at

137
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:52,520
that and go,
Huh,

138
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,800
does it have to be that way?
Or why is it that way?

139
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,020
And if the reason why is low,
that's the way it,

140
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,580
well,
that's a terrible reason,

141
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,080
you know?
And,

142
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,600
and when you see the world as being that
hackable,

143
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,670
so to speak,
like you start to realize,

144
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,301
all right,
well let's just,

145
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,840
let's actually question stuff.
And,

146
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,730
and for,
you know,

147
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,590
I remember I was a freshman at Uva when
nine 11 happened for this generation of

148
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,080
millennials coming up.
We mow nearly all of us.

149
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,320
One of our first really vivid memories
of the world was nine 11,

150
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:22,130
this awful tragedy.
And then we get into these two wars and

151
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,340
then think of all the authority figures
we've had in our life since that moment.

152
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,410
They've all at one point another either
misled us,

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,270
this sort of deceived us.
Um,

154
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,180
you've got the financial crisis,
you've got the housing bubble,

155
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,590
all these conventions.
Oh,

156
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,670
trust us,
we know what we're doing.

157
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,410
This is the thing,
the American dream is buying a home,

158
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,480
go to college,
take on that student loan debt.

159
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,250
Don't worry,
there's a job waiting for you.

160
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,930
Every single one.
These conventions from,

161
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,420
from all these people in power have not
held up.

162
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,610
And so I think in particular,
millennials,

163
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,830
millennials look at that very
skeptically cause we were like,

164
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,664
all right,
you know what?

165
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,010
So the conventional stuff didn't work
out for anything.

166
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,810
Like we have no choice but to realize,
you know what?

167
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,100
We're all just hacking it.
So let's,

168
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,960
let's really,
let's dive into the passion.

169
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's,
let's figure out a better way to do

170
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,160
something.
Not Settle for the way they've always

171
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,770
been.

172
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay.
