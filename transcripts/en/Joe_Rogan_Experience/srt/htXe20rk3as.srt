00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,270
Hello Freak bitches to play
devil's advocate or the,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,611
you know,

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:06,660
the argument against it.

4
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,620
Like what about things like,

5
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:07,891
you know,

6
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,180
the serious situation,

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,910
I believe it was Chevrolet had um,

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,750
some ignition issues that they knew
about where cars were cutting out and it

9
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:20,490
caused a bunch of deaths and a lot
of people were aware of this issue,

10
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,780
but they knew that a recall would be
incredibly expensive and they drag their

11
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,350
heels and they didn't do anything about
it for a long time and now it's just a

12
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,590
fucking complete disaster and
they're getting sued like crazy.

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,120
I got,

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,330
what about that kind of situation?

15
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,940
Like it's kind of important to have wars.

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,790
I mean,

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,730
obviously the balance,

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,043
it's like,

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,510
do you have an army?

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
Yes.

21
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,330
Do you invade Canada?

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,553
No.

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,390
Do you have police?

24
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,373
Yes.

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,490
Do they shoot every person darker
than them walking down the sidewalk?

26
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,683
No.

27
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,550
Do you have lawyers?

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,473
Yes.

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,360
Do you have shitloads of
lawyers that are suing everyone?

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,560
All the time?

31
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,400
No.

32
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,641
Like,

33
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:03,660
so there's,

34
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,190
you know the balance.

35
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,270
There's reasons to sue.

36
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,710
Yeah.

37
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,880
You,

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,900
you know the Ford Pinto,

39
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,050
I had two of my best friends died about
three miles from here in a pinto station

40
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,400
wagon that was in an accident
and burst into flames.

41
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah.

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,050
Does the classic story
that we had all heard.

43
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,510
Yeah.

44
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,700
You actually knew people like

45
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,870
Robert [inaudible] from way back,

46
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,970
fuck going to Csun,

47
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,460
God damn car carpooling together.

48
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,030
Crazy like 18 just rear ended,

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,700
two cars banged up next to him,

50
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,660
like couldn't get out.

51
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,280
Whole car just went up.

52
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,263
Fuck.

53
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,223
Yup.

54
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,341
It's crazy.

55
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,174
Right?

56
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,590
He always wonder like what,

57
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,160
what would have those guys gone on to,

58
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,960
what could they have done?

59
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,380
And it's also weird that even though
they died when they were 18 they're still

60
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,130
always my age,

61
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,540
whatever age I am,

62
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,060
which is a weird thing.

63
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,500
It,

64
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,670
it was in and it's one of those,

65
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:20,671
in that case there needed to be
lawyers and Ford knew about it.

66
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,144
And for dot,

67
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,983
you know,

68
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,510
let Robert and Lenny died.

69
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,950
It'll be cheaper than recalling,

70
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:27,784
you know,

71
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,220
2.7 million units or whatever,

72
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
whatever it was.

73
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
And outfitting them.

74
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,520
I think just whack.

75
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,011
We'd,

76
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,670
there's Mexican dirt weed to Shitty weed.

77
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,003
Thai stick.

78
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,590
Yeah,

79
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,640
but it's all weed.

80
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,570
But he gave me some,

81
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:42,730
and I play golf with my grandma,

82
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,090
my aunt the next day and apply whole five.

83
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,440
I was like just coming down.

84
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,130
I realized when we were hitting the
guard and she's a conservative person,

85
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,810
her husband is like a lawyer and like
it's conservative so that it's like once I

86
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,531
realized I was high,

87
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:59,470
it was like keep your mouth shut dude.

88
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,270
But if you get that wave right,

89
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:05,410
like the other night Aubrey
and I were playing pool and um,

90
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,850
I don't really play that much anymore,

91
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,001
man.

92
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,601
I don't get a chance.

93
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,010
I don't play in tournaments anymore.

94
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,690
I don't get a chance to play too many.

95
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,290
Like sometimes dom Arrera nine we'll
get together or Greg Fitzsimmons place

96
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:14,651
pretty good.

97
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,120
We'll get together.

98
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,890
You played pretty good and we'll get
together and knocks the balls around.

99
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,810
But I'm not like playing
like real players.

100
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,370
I can tournaments or anything anymore.

101
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,561
And so I think,

102
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:26,620
but every now and then like you get
high and you remember what to do.

103
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,970
You remember how to do it?

104
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,983
The other day I got into,

105
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,570
I got zone for like five,

106
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,920
six shots in a row.

107
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,670
I started like,

108
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,820
I started running out like this table
I should getting out over and over and

109
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,310
over again and the way that I really
shouldn't be able to do because I'm really

110
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,660
not practicing that much,

111
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,250
but I just got into the zone.

112
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,120
It was very temporary.

113
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,811
I couldn't hold it,

114
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,040
but I knew it was all the weed.

115
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,761
I knew it.

116
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,380
I know like I know how to
play pool a little bit,

117
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,900
but I'm in this crazy sensitive zone.

118
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,910
Why know how to control that ball better?

119
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,680
It's two ways it can hit you by two on
basketball and sometimes in basketball

120
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,990
it's like someone will throw you
a pass and Walton the area go,

121
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,470
okay,

122
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,400
what am I options here?

123
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,420
When the ball gets to me,

124
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,590
I got him cutting.

125
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,680
I could pass the him,

126
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,870
I could shoot,

127
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,030
I could pass it back and it's like,

128
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,361
all right,

129
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:07,661
I'm ready.

130
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,190
I think I'm right and then
the ball comes to you.

131
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,110
Other Times that ball
just hits you in the face.

132
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,670
I was like,

133
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,710
why are you playing high?

134
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,860
It's so true.

135
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,121
Where cats,

136
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:22,611
our pets,

137
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:22,820
he's,

138
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,720
you stop smelling cats' litter boxes.

139
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,560
I just put down my cat that I talked
about last time I was on the show and for

140
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,510
my first time in 17 years,

141
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,660
I get to have a house that has no litter
box and I don't even know what that's

142
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,000
like.

143
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,950
You're lazy too.

144
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,784
I don't think you can

145
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,603
do it every day.

146
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,060
Oh yeah.

147
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,420
It's like,

148
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:40,631
oh,

149
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,171
once a week.

150
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,660
Just throw it new litter box.

151
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,411
Oh my God.

152
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,550
See that's the problem.

153
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,540
You have to do that every day.

154
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,710
Otherwise you're breathing shit.

155
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,460
Did you hire a maid penalty fumes?

156
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:49,741
I,

157
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:51,220
I've had a maid right now.

158
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:51,700
I don't have a man.

159
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,370
You've got to get a maid watching one
of those top was made so they have one

160
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,061
that you did that.

161
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,471
I tried that.

162
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,700
I told you that you did try that?

163
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:56,950
Yeah.

164
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,310
How'd it go?

165
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,031
It's not good.

166
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,680
It's really bad.

167
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
It was like a older woman and his,

168
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,220
her daughter I think.

169
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,890
And you can't choose who you get to.

170
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,611
Not Topless.

171
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:07,090
Why?

172
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,421
I don't know.

173
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,650
There's like a few different companies,

174
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,221
but when I did,

175
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,491
I just,

176
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,950
there's a van parked down my street so
I just called it and I can just gawking

177
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,520
guy like you rub maps,

178
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,540
massage pose,

179
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:16,870
right.

180
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,540
Why wouldn't you at least
do a fine Yelp review?

181
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,740
It said 99 bucks.

182
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,590
I wasn't really thinking into
it and like I didn't think like,

183
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,100
oh wait,

184
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,730
I have to watch them clean because I
made it and I'm like one of the guys that

185
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,110
hides cause I'm so ashamed.

186
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,080
But then like you just kind of
stand there in the kitchen going up.

187
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,973
If she's topless,

188
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,941
this is stupid.

189
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:34,774
What am I doing this?

190
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,900
She really cleaning or do a bad job.

191
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,061
No,

192
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:38,270
they're,

193
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,591
they're,

194
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,400
they're just doing,

195
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,820
they're just regular mates
that are getting an extra
20 bucks to take their top

196
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,260
off I think because these are,

197
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,550
these are people that are like,

198
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,640
they seem like they were related
and it seemed like just normal mate.

199
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,360
It was very,

200
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
very uncomfortable.

201
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,750
I kind of like it.

202
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,810
I felt very bad

203
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,960
because it was like sad.

204
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,530
This was an older woman,

205
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,364
like how old?

206
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,320
50 and maybe hit her daughter.

207
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,430
That's was maybe,

208
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,200
are you sure with your daughter?

209
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,090
It seemed like a mom and daughter.

210
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,710
It was really fucked up.

211
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,573
That's tough.

212
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,511
Well,

213
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:08,751
you know,

214
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,720
you gotta think if you know someone that's
really fucked up and they have a kid,

215
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,900
that kid's going to grow
up with a fucked up parent.

216
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,850
Like if someone's like
really crazy or you know,

217
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,970
if someone is a top was made for living
and they don't think there's anything

218
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,350
wrong with it and then you know,

219
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,550
your daughter hits 18 she's like,

220
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:22,881
mom,

221
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,330
I want to join.

222
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,530
The top was made business.

223
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,131
You're like,

224
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:25,371
hey,

225
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,210
it's good enough for me.

226
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,320
Why isn't it good enough for you?

227
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,770
Yeah,

228
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,670
the mom was a little,

229
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,150
oh true.

230
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,750
Very true.

231
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,100
Then mine was a little overweight,

232
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,820
but she had humongous Mexican tits
and when she took her bra off,

233
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,970
it had the most horrific stretch
marks from our broad digging into her

234
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,380
rotations.

235
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,780
It was,

236
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,330
it looked like talk to her like
when she took her tits out.

237
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,020
No,

238
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,240
I just sat there and they
both just put it in a bucket.

239
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,680
Like they just put their clothes.

240
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,190
They didn't,

241
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,100
we didn't list it like they
didn't talk or anything.

242
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,911
They didn't say like,

243
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,600
hello.

244
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,890
They said hello when we came in,

245
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,740
but they were like,

246
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,470
not any English or like,

247
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,990
I just like the kitchen living room.

248
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,940
I hadn't cleaned the kitchen
living room in the bathroom.

249
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:05,840
I namely let them go and you should
have said huge Mexican tits or something

250
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:06,350
like that.

251
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,820
They speak uncomfortable.

252
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,750
They speak English,

253
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,160
right?

254
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,520
Uh,

255
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,071
barely.

256
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:10,730
They like,

257
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,670
I remembered that they asked
where the vacuum cleaner wasn't.

258
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,210
It was very like,

259
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,740
oh that's cool.

260
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,990
Have you looked under your huge Mexican?

261
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,030
I would always wonder like,

262
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,050
what does that life like?

263
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,310
I would have to ask them questions.

264
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,250
I would give them extra money
just to be able to ask questions.

265
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,851
I'll say,

266
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,890
I'll pay you for a whole extra hour if
you sit down for another five minutes.

267
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,420
Just let me,

268
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,900
how was the,

269
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,250
how was the daughter attractive?

270
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,540
The daughter wasn't bad,

271
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,320
but it she was a little chubby or also
like they were both a little chubby but

272
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,930
the mom's boobs were weird cause they had,

273
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,310
she had the huge like hanging ones and
she was cleaning the kitchen and I just,

274
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,200
I would like just kind of
walk in and just be like,

275
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,310
oh this is going on in here.

276
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,780
And it hurt just dirty boobs.

277
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,040
Like touching the oven.

278
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,770
Oh,

279
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,020
while she's cleaning it.

280
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,090
You have made it sound very sad.

281
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,963
There's nothing,

282
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,801
it was horrible.

283
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,060
I do not recommend it.

284
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,940
I just would want to talk to them
and find out what that's like.

285
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,250
Like the guys like try to attack you.

286
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,140
Like that seems like a dangerous kid.

287
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,360
I hope that's why they do it
though because there's so,

288
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,050
they weren't very appealing and it was
sad that I think it was like a onetime

289
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,770
thing.

290
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,760
I would rather pay.

291
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
It was a one time for them.

292
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,280
I think once you get it,

293
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,410
you're not going to have
them come back ever again.

294
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:15,831
You know what I mean?

295
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,040
It's like,

296
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
it's almost a joke.

297
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,010
Almost mean a one time thing for you.

298
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,420
Yeah,

299
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,310
I want to talk to them for that.

300
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,170
Would you?

301
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,630
I would rather do for 20 extra bucks,

302
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,411
get regular made,

303
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,950
but I could be bottomless and
they would not like get mad at me.

304
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,840
Like I would just sit in there with
normal mates and just have no pants on.

305
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,521
That'd be better.

306
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,354
Right.

307
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,370
I think that's illegal unless you make it.

308
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah,

309
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,531
that's what I'm saying.

310
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,221
The agreement is,

311
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,780
I don't have to have where parents,

312
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,171
well,

313
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm sure someone can do that,

314
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:43,791
Brian.

315
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:43,971
Sure.

316
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,840
That's a great,

317
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,210
well,

318
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,990
you have to want to have
your pants off with them too,

319
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,750
so they'd have to be like
these somewhat attractive.

320
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,050
Right.

321
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,810
You're allowed to stroke
and just follow them around,

322
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,980
but they can't call it.

323
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,943
That's rude

324
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,301
in a way,

325
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,790
in your little narrow hallway
and accidentally come on them.

326
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,210
I don't know.

327
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,250
Like clean it up in this city.

328
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,240
You could definitely work.

329
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,390
Workout your fantasy.

330
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:04,650
Yeah.

331
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:04,800
Yeah.

332
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,990
That's a minor request.

333
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,261
Yeah.

334
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,230
You could work out some pretty
crazy shit in this town.

335
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,850
Yeah.
