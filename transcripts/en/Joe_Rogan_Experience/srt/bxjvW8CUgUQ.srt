1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,300
Now we're live,
I,

2
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,070
for one,
want to express outrage at that

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:13,970
Kellyanne Conway woman,
not just putting her feet up on that

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:16,880
couch,
but being the only woman in the room

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,460
having a feet up,
or do you think it a sexual posturing

6
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:21,050
thing?
I don't know if you know.

7
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:26,051
There's a lot of men in the room.
I'm in a weird position.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,410
It could just be instinct.
Yeah,

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,060
look at her.
Look at it dudes.

10
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:32,120
There's a lot of black dudes.
Is that the Black Caucus?

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,170
Black College?
Is this the leaders of the black

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,880
historically black colleges and
universities and look at her.

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,500
Do you think that that's what's going on
there?

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,190
I think that's very sexual.
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,560
I mean it looks sexual dude.
She's got the vagina curtain thing going

16
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,180
on.
She's got her legs spread.

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,860
Yeah,
she's looking at her phone.

18
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,240
Maybe pictures of decks.

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,410
She's actually on tinder,
which is weird.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

21
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:01,220
She's swiping everyone,
right?

22
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,410
Yes.
Come get some.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,570
There's so many great memes about this.
Like I saw one of them that was in

24
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,230
quotes.
What is a train question mark?

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,310
Fantastic.
That's fantastic.

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,460
We live in a fucking dream and we really
do.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
This is so weird to see donald trump's
smiling,

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,290
like if you like knocked me over the
head 10 years ago and put me in a coma

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,590
and then woke me up today and then.
And then I was like,

30
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,400
well,
what's going on?

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,690
Who's the president?
And you're like,

32
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,381
well,
check this out.

33
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,360
I'd be like,
get the fuck out of.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,410
Oh yeah,
yeah.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,140
It's like you remember that scene in
back to the future when he's like,

36
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,360
who's the president in 1985?
Ronald Reagan,

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,210
the actor.
That's exactly what it's like.

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
It's crazy.
Yeah,

39
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:46,300
it's crazy.

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,170
It's great.
Put that picture back up.

41
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,690
So much going on there.
No one's ever done that before.

42
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,591
Like,
before this,

43
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,540
she's like,
we got to do a photo with the blacks,

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,490
you know,
like he's just the kind of things he

45
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,630
says we gotta get more images of the
blacks that with me because every time

46
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,310
really important,
really important.

47
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,370
Every time he takes a photo into the
Oval Office,

48
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:08,690
it's like 12 white guys.
I wish I could do an impression of him.

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,033
I mean,
yeah,

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,500
there's a lot.
Yeah.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,770
To me it's just talk like A.
I can't though.

52
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:17,760
I don't like my voice doesn't make that
noise like whatever noises,

53
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,840
voice bank,
very gravelly or something.

54
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,740
I don't know what it is.
Yeah,

55
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,100
very bad things.
Bad debts said.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,230
Very best.
Said that sad thing.

57
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,410
It's hilarious.
The word sad after tweets because

58
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,810
fucking everybody's doing it now.

59
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,220
So funny though.
The Internet is funny man.

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,170
The Internet,
the Internet,

61
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,940
you have to like I always look at
comedy,

62
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,250
like music,
you know,

63
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,240
and I always say like,
like I know how to do,

64
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,850
I know how to play Acoustic Guitar,
which is like stand up,

65
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,410
you know what I mean?
And then how to like write I've written

66
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,970
for TV shows that it's like playing the
piano,

67
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,800
instagram,
twitter,

68
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,250
like it's like that's like the saxophone
man and I'm like I'm trying to learn the

69
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:55,270
music but it's funny man.
It's kind of common.

70
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,960
Yeah.
And people are good at it.

71
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,230
Like some people are just good at it and
like you said,

72
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,690
you see a meme every now and then,
like my girlfriend,

73
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,450
sometimes it'll be in a,
you know,

74
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,420
like whatever is in the bedroom or
something and I'm here hysterically

75
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,740
laughing and I come in and she just
shows me and I'm like,

76
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,960
you know what,
that's pretty funny,

77
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,750
you know,
and it's just a still image with three

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,230
words on it and it just works.

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,990
Well.
Memes are a new form of comedy,

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,780
like these images with text attached to
the end.

81
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,340
That's just so perfect.
Totally.

82
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,330
And there's a way to do it and there's a
way not to do it because you can't be

83
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,830
met at about it.
You can't be like,

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,113
oh,
uh,

85
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,170
you know,
you,

86
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,840
you have to embrace it.
You can't think you're above it.

87
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,703
Like you can't go.
Like,

88
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh,
here's my me,

89
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,980
my memes about how means you're stupid.
It's like,

90
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,814
Nah,
I'm not kidding you.

91
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,510
Everybody hates you.
Names are awesome.

92
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,440
They're great.
Yeah.

93
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,900
It was like you just have to embrace it
and go like,

94
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,580
no,
that's a funny form of comedy that I

95
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,810
needed to thievery going on with memes
to.

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh yeah,
you know,

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,580
a lot of people like that fat Jewish guy
that just take everybody else's memes

98
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,620
and he doesn't even like put repost.

99
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,320
He just puts their name in it.
Like that's enough.

100
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,640
Like he puts their name somewhere in
the,

101
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,680
in the post.
Yeah.

102
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,590
He's one of those dudes were,
I don't know anything about them,

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,030
but it just,
it's hard to like not interested.

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,060
And I thought,
Oh man,

105
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,750
I was at a party.
The Fat Jewish was there,

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,340
like you should stop this story.
Right?

107
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,720
Because they'll think about this.
That's interesting to me.

108
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,020
It just,
for too long he was doing what he knows

109
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,660
is wrong.
And then he started just adding people's

110
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,590
names to the memes,
but it doesn't like if I've repost so

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,850
many stuff,
I write re,

112
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,460
I'd put the repost thing.
I use repost so everybody knows.

113
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,760
It says in the first letters repost.
Right.

114
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,840
So okay,
this is rory is eat.

115
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,350
He put it or this is,
you know,

116
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,770
rory is instagram post.
He's not doing that.

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Nope.
Yeah,

118
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,770
it's just,
it's,

119
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,010
it's,
there's a funky thing.

120
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,530
But also I got to be honest,
I've been sent some things.

121
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,660
I don't know where the fuck they came
from and I put it up just because I

122
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:41,670
thought it was hilarious.
Yeah.

123
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,640
I didn't try to say it was mine and I'm
not making a living off of doing that.

124
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,970
I just wanted to share something that's
funny,

125
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,200
but you can do that and go.
I don't know where this came from,

126
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,230
but it's really fun.
It is.

127
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,100
But it's weird because somebody must
have made it.

128
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,050
And how the fuck do you find who made
it?

129
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,170
I don't know.
I mean I,

130
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,030
I've only made one instagram thing that
like did.

131
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,230
Okay.
Which was a,

132
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,890
it was a picture of um,
Ivanka trump and that silver dress.

133
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,150
And I was like,
oh,

134
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,490
right.
When she released it,

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,090
I was like,
oh,

136
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,140
I got to do something about this.

137
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,490
And I said to my girlfriend,
but what does this look like?

138
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,960
She's like a chipotle,
a Burrito.

139
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,850
So I found like a chipotle,
a burrito wrapped in tin foil it and I

140
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,970
was like,
who wore it better?

141
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,850
And it did really,
it was like the only time I did

142
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,550
something on instagram because a lot of
times I put a joke on instagram and like

143
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,800
get ready Internet about to break you
and then nobody likes it.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,280
But that one.
But that one I actually saw other people

145
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,170
posting without crediting me.
And I was like,

146
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,920
Hey,
what do you mean you don't really

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,193
trust?
This?

148
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,000
Looks like it looks just like she looks
like a Burrito.

149
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,830
He's an odd look and fellow too.
There's something about the man that

150
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,120
named Jared cushner commissioner?
Yeah,

151
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,730
something about him where I'm like wow,
this guy's like,

152
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,490
he's like a character in a Kubrick movie
or something.

153
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,380
And he to me is like,
like,

154
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,290
you know,
I'm a New York Italian Jew but I grew up

155
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,180
with dudes like jared cook.
But he's like the rich version of where

156
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,540
I grew up.
Like he's like,

157
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,390
like a,
a rich Jewish kid from the city,

158
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,900
like went to a private school and then
like got in that world.

159
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,300
And now he's,
now he's like running the country.

160
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,430
I feel like I could have gone to camp
with him.

161
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,280
I mean he really is running the country.
He's one of the guys.

162
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,860
He's one of the main people,
but I don't know that I've read stuff

163
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,694
that like,
you know,

164
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,700
he,
he doesn't have as much say as one might

165
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:23,240
hope manager would have a little bit
more.

166
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,060
Yeah.
I mean I would imagine the big boss is

167
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,730
the dad.
And then Bannon is trump and then

168
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,564
bannon.
Yeah.

169
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,340
But he's doing trump's bidding.

170
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,860
You mean he's,
it's,

171
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,060
he's the brother in law under the sun
law.

172
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,890
He's got a.
he's got a big part.

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,940
He does look at that dark darks.
Got a big part of running the country.

174
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,850
So it does fucking scored though.
Congratulations sir.

175
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,710
You've made out.
Well he,

176
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,040
he stepped in a big pile of shit.
She's hot as fuck too.

177
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,120
I bet she's probably.
I bet she's probably pretty cool.

178
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,210
Reasonable person too.
She seems like she seems like shit.

179
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,410
I think she's probably a little bit like
what's going on.

180
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,250
I feel the same way about Melania.
I think Melania is.

181
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,970
I did not sign up to be the first lady.
Yeah,

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
well she's not even doing it.
Yeah,

183
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,100
she's not.
Except for that one day she read the

184
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:12,320
Lord's prayer off of a piece of paper.
Oh,

185
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,260
well how about the one day she
plagiarized Michelle Obama speech?

186
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,093
Yeah.
Yeah.

187
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,350
That was the thing when I started
reading the Lord's prayer.

188
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,570
I'm sure it's out there,
but like my instinct was like,

189
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,350
did she think Michelle Obama wrote the
Lord's for herself?

190
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,810
So she's reading,
but I'm sure that that joke was made a

191
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,070
thousand times,
but let's be honest,

192
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,950
Michelle Obama probably didn't write
that speech either.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
It's probably a speech writer.
No,

194
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:32,700
no,
no,

195
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,990
absolutely not.
But I do think that if you're going to

196
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,490
steal from a first lady,
do it from one,

197
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,800
from like know years ago,
don't do it.

198
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,250
The one who is still first lady.
Well,

199
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:44,180
do you remember when Joe Biden got
caught for stealing Kennedy's speeches?

200
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,010
That was surprising to me when everyone
started talking about,

201
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,750
oh,
like everyone got so excited.

202
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,280
Biden might run for president.
And I was like,

203
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,870
am I the only one who has been like
paying attention to Joe?

204
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:57,590
But he's constantly doing those trump
things.

205
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,550
He's the guy who's like,
Hey,

206
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,570
get up,
come on,

207
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:00,990
stand up.
And the guys that are wheelchair,

208
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,630
he's like such a buffoon,
you know,

209
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,780
he's an odd guy.
And the,

210
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,670
the memes about him were fucking genius.
That Joe Biden means at the end of the

211
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,640
term,
the goodbye means that's what I'm

212
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,620
talking about.
Like that's funny,

213
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,920
you know,
that's what I.

214
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,620
for me it was like,
you know,

215
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,970
the daily show when I used to be at the
daily show was like we were doing stuff

216
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,340
and it always felt like we were the
fastest ones doing it.

217
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,490
Now with memes and stuff,
you're going,

218
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,363
they're instantaneous.

219
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,580
You have a broadcast time.
There's no way you could keep up.

220
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,540
I mean it's,
it's an the speed by which things are

221
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,110
launched and are good,
that they're not crappy.

222
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,130
Like the mockups are funny and the
graphics are funny and like people are

223
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,410
like,
I don't know how fast people are editing

224
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,770
photos on their phone or like photoshop,
but instantaneous.

225
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,170
Well,
they happen during podcast while we're

226
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,540
doing podcasts.
I'm going to make a meme about something

227
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,910
said on the podcast.
It'll be up before the podcast is over.

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,450
For me,
the moment for me,

229
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,170
like it was the summer,
I was at the nightly show and I started

230
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,890
to go,
we're in a little bit of trouble here.

231
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:10,530
It was when that dude was climbing trump
tower when the suction cups and it was

232
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,150
like,
fuck,

233
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,040
it was like 5:00 and we tape it like
six.

234
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,940
We did tape it six and a,
so we were rewriting that night show

235
00:09:16,941 --> 00:09:20,610
when I made a little joke just to one of
the researchers about the Suction Cup

236
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,510
dude,
like what's he climbing?

237
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,360
Michael Phelps back because it was the
Olympics and Phelps was getting such a

238
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,480
stupid joke,
but the kind of thing for a late night

239
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,800
show,
top of show,

240
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,341
hey,
what's up?

241
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:29,991
Everybody?
Welcome to job.

242
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:32,040
Before we get started to take a look at
this show the dude and go,

243
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,270
can we why?
Now I'm on that,

244
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,650
and then you see him climbing felts
back.

245
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,840
I said that went back into the rewrite
room.

246
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,390
Open twitter that joe can already been
made.

247
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,690
The graphics were impeccable and they
have been retweeted like 60,000 times

248
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:48,540
and the dude was already.
It was still on the tower that fast and

249
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,374
that's what I'm like,
we're in,

250
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,890
we're in trouble.

251
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,950
This shows a trouble.
Comedy Writers and Comedians as well,

252
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,780
like to think that they're the only ones
who are funny.

253
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,990
It's almost like you're a neurosurgeon
or a race car.

254
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,150
You have some skill that no one else
has.

255
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,310
People are funny.
There's fucking funny people that are

256
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,570
dentists.
There's funny people.

257
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:07,230
Like one of the funniest people I've
ever met in my fucking life is my former

258
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,370
boss,
Dave Dolan.

259
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,720
He was a private investigator.
The dude was fucking hilarious and his

260
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:16,380
cousin was build down to own the comedy
connection in Boston.

261
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,480
And uh,
when I was working for him,

262
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,490
he,
he lost his license from drinking and

263
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:22,040
driving and he needed a,
uh,

264
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,070
uh,
an assistant in quotes who,

265
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,950
who did basically it was a driver.
This guy,

266
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,560
my thought you meant that Pei,
Pei,

267
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,170
Pei,
Pei lost his license.

268
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,290
And so I started working for them and
we'd get it.

269
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,600
We'd have to get up at like 5:00 in the
morning and like show up at people's

270
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,580
houses to catch them working when they
were supposed to.

271
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,640
You know,
you doing a pie assistant work.

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,370
How is that not a TV show?
Joe Rogan,

273
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,540
Pii assistant,
you know,

274
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,360
I don't want to know.
Maybe it could be.

275
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,900
I'm not gonna do it though.
So still the idea anybody's listening to

276
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
this guy was fucking hilarious.
He just had a comics mind.

277
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,080
He would just start talking about,
look at this scumbag,

278
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,390
you know the fuck he's doing.
He said he started saying crazy shit

279
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,920
like writing life.
Really?

280
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,030
I mean I would be crying like tears
rolling down my eyes laughing and

281
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,340
thinking like I'm the one that's a
fucking comedian and this,

282
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,680
my boss is way funnier than me.
Yeah.

283
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,250
All the guys that grew up with her.
I mean,

284
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,850
like I grew up in like with funny
people,

285
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,100
like some of my friends are very,
very funny.

286
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,860
Uh,
but they just didn't know who the hell

287
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,730
thinks to do this and do stand up.
That's what people asked me that when

288
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,710
they say,
what's the hardest thing about doing

289
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:26,341
standup?
I'm like,

290
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:31,080
it's admitting you're an asshole.
It's like you like if you walked into a

291
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,300
party and it was full of people and they
were all hanging out and we're like,

292
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,320
hey,
quiet down everybody.

293
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,300
I got funny shit to say.
They'd be like,

294
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,860
who brought the.
So they'd be like,

295
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:38,550
wait,
I'm not done.

296
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,840
Not only do one,
I want you to talk.

297
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,850
I want you to pay me for my thoughts and
ideas and put a light on me,

298
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,430
a letter and if you talk I'm going to be
an asshole about it to you because it's

299
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,730
my.
But it's the whole impulse to do that is

300
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,500
very much like not only do I think I'm
funny,

301
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,220
I think I like,
you know,

302
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,990
and you know,
and then every now and then you meet a

303
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,510
comedian who,
who wasn't funny when they were growing

304
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,344
up.

305
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,490
What were you thinking?
The only reason I did this is because I

306
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,370
always was like,
if I was good at baseball would've been.

307
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,890
I would've been tried baseball,
but some guys are just funny and then

308
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:12,670
they just become accountants will,
everybody said something funny at one

309
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,460
point in their life and one of the weird
things about being a comedian as it

310
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,030
does,
it's,

311
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,210
it's a special skill that doesn't look
like it's a special skill.

312
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,040
Like if I walked up to somebody who's
like a mma,

313
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,020
you know,
making us,

314
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,730
making a sculpture or something like
that,

315
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,110
I'd be like,
oh wow.

316
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,120
How are you doing that?
Like,

317
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,270
what are you using?
Oh,

318
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,110
well,
what tools?

319
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,150
Like how you,
how you start it.

320
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,820
Like what do you map it out on paper?
Like how you do it.

321
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,830
Like it would be confusing to me.
You know,

322
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,840
I'd want to know,
like what's the process?

323
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,990
If I see a guy go on stage and start
talking,

324
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,910
I go walk and fucking do that.
I guys just standing there like

325
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,100
literally standing.
He's not Cirque du Solei and he's not

326
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:45,880
juggling.
Yeah.

327
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,150
He doesn't have a Hulu,
but it doesn't have a poodle with no

328
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
spitting fire.
Like Gene Simmons.

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah.
Everything seems really straightforward.

330
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:52,961
Yeah,
yeah.

331
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,651
Yeah.
And so it's,

332
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,910
one of the things is so deceptive about
it and then you watch someone who's like

333
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,330
really good at it,
he's got like,

334
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,760
it's like,
well that seems so effortless.

335
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,571
Yeah,
this guy's up there,

336
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,590
kill him like this.
But it's like,

337
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,670
it's the year I always feel like the
years of it or,

338
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,530
or,
or being on stage,

339
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,170
it's like,
it's like you have to become as close to

340
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:14,740
you as you can be in front of a group of
people.

341
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,240
A bunch of strangers.
Yeah.

342
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:16,840
And,
and you're,

343
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,950
everything I,
you know,

344
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,510
I,
I always found in the beginning of the

345
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:23,200
hardest stuff about it was you don't
realize like how much super human

346
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,870
hearing and stuff you have when you're
on stage.

347
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,620
It's all these things like,
you know,

348
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:29,740
it's like a.
I was trying to think of the analogy.

349
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:30,570
It's like when,
when like,

350
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,040
like you'll never see it like a movie
where someone discovers they have super

351
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,990
powers but they're overwhelming.
Like it's like that.

352
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:38,680
It's like you start get onstage and you
hear like a fork drop in the back of the

353
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:41,230
room stuff nobody else is hearing.
And when you're a rookie,

354
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:41,831
you're like,
Hey,

355
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,280
hold on to your fork.
And people like what we said,

356
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,120
you know what I mean?
Like only you hear it,

357
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,810
you know,
hey,

358
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,940
hey sneezy people like did the guy's
knees,

359
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm not,
I'm watching you.

360
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,740
So it's like you learn.
But that for me in the beginning was

361
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:56,590
like an issue.
Like I remember like emceeing clubs and

362
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,580
like thinking I was like being sharp.
You know,

363
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,240
when people have been like we didn't,
we did not experience that same

364
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,850
sensation you experience because
learning how to relax,

365
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,290
learning how to actually be yourself in
front of all those people.

366
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,690
Like it's fascinating to me.
Like I have a buddy of mine who's

367
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,950
thinking about doing stand up now and
I've known him forever and he's been

368
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,160
working on is his act.
He's to z 39 these journeys for the

369
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,860
first time.
That's not tate tate Fletcher.

370
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,010
He's a successful actor.
He does a lot of movies.

371
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,340
He's in everything in John Wick.
Every time I see him he's in a movie

372
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:28,210
getting shot.
Yeah,

373
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,590
he's in a ton of movies,
right?

374
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,230
If he's in John Wick,
he's getting shot in the head,

375
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,010
got stabbed to,
I don't know,

376
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,480
he got killed in Jurassic Park if the
killed by dinosaurs,

377
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,270
but he's always getting killed.
But the point is,

378
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,550
he was in Westworld.
He got killed by already killed himself

379
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,070
with a rock,
smashed himself in the head.

380
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,280
I know that guy.
So He's been writing comedy and I'm

381
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:48,581
like,
well,

382
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,230
you do it.
Like why do this to yourself?

383
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:51,340
He's like,
I want to do what I want to see.

384
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,610
We could do it like,
I'm like,

385
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,150
Oh God,
I'm totally fascinating because the

386
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:00,650
process of trying to figure out how to
relax and like ready,

387
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,880
set,
go.

388
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Tait Fletcher and he gets

389
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,104
up on stage.

390
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,030
Has he done it yet or no,
he hasn't done it yet,

391
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,580
but it's going to be interesting to see
because it's the,

392
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,910
the whole process of like learning,
like becoming so comfortable that you

393
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:19,740
can relax while you're on stage in front
of all those people.

394
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,550
Just see that's what takes the time.
It's,

395
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:22,790
it's the,
it's the,

396
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,620
uh,
being comfortable,

397
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,950
you know,
it's like the Malcolm gladwell thing,

398
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,230
it takes 10,000 hours to master
something that's 10 years.

399
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,370
It's like you've got to be on stage a
lot of hours to be yourself and be

400
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,930
comfortable and not and even eat it,
you know?

401
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,450
And then when you watch yourself back,
you,

402
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,210
especially in the beginning,
you don't realize you're doing stuff.

403
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,160
I remember watching myself back early on
and be like,

404
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,880
am I touching my nose the whole time?
Wait,

405
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,590
why isn't anyone telling me I'm touching
my nose?

406
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,453
You know?
And it's like,

407
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,480
people must think I do coke,
you know?

408
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,311
I'm like,
hey guys,

409
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:55,490
but I don't probably do to do right back
in the day,

410
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,420
but I never did.
I've never had.

411
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,750
But it's like those are the little
nervous ticks you develop and you have

412
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,590
to learn over time.
Like,

413
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,150
just got to be,
you know,

414
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,260
but it's hard.
How are you,

415
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:03,661
you,
you,

416
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,020
you,
you've transitioned from doing the daily

417
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,280
show.
Don't take transition,

418
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:08,540
Joe.
It's 2017.

419
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,190
People are just now going to think that
Oh,

420
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,060
it's coming.
You know?

421
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,410
Yeah.
It's a weird term now.

422
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,880
You can't,
you can't say transition,

423
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,280
right.
In terms medical officer,

424
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,220
he can't say transition,
transition.

425
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,830
Joe,
you're on your journey now to say that

426
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,040
like what kind of journey?
A journey of sexual experimentation.

427
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,550
You can't ask me about it because you're
not supposed to and you can't answer.

428
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,730
You have to accept a lot of um.
Well,

429
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,900
okay.
I was going to say something but on the

430
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,900
transition from going to throw somebody
under the bus,

431
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:41,580
but it was no need to um,
the,

432
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,400
the,
the,

433
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,770
this whole journey of like going from
like you started off as a comic and then

434
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,070
you worked for the daily show for so
long and you kind of miss comedy.

435
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,990
I did comedy while you were doing it a
little bit,

436
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,480
like a half hour special when I was at
the daily show,

437
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:57,870
but it was weak because I was putting
working 95 percent of my energy and that

438
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:00,970
the daily show yet.
But now you're out now you're like,

439
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,180
well,
I left the daily show in like 2013 last

440
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,400
time I did your podcast.
I was,

441
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,800
I was living out here in about to go
back to do the nightly show and the

442
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,240
nightly show was I said yes because I
didn't want to produce anymore.

443
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,140
I wanted to perform,
but the deal for the nightly show was I

444
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,350
got to be on it,
you know.

445
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,920
So that's Larry Wilmore to Larry wilmore
show.

446
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:19,860
Yeah.
So I went back to,

447
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,890
at the time it was called the minority
report,

448
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:26,891
but then it became the nightly show
because of fox lawsuits and what's the

449
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,850
loss?
Because remember the minority report,

450
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:31,910
the Tom Cruise movie,
which is like a Philip k dot dick book

451
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,980
and Fox had just bought.
Oh,

452
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,200
you said Fox.
I automatically think Fox News.

453
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,093
I know.
Well,

454
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,880
associate parent company,
the parent company should change your

455
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:42,090
fucking name.
Yeah.

456
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,011
You know?
Yeah,

457
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,400
you're right.
Because even when you see it come up,

458
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:45,891
you're like,
oh,

459
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,560
is this going to be pointless?
I was working for the UFC.

460
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,090
Still do,
but I don't do the Fox things anymore.

461
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,460
And when I was doing the Fox things,
they were like,

462
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,750
oh,
so you're,

463
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,340
you're working on Fox now.

464
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,290
What's that like?
Are they like super right wing?

465
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,190
I'm like,
that's so funny.

466
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,750
No,
it's fucking cage fighting,

467
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,320
dude.
I'm a cage fighting commentator.

468
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,360
Yes,
they are right wing.

469
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,410
But that's not what this now it's still,
it was fox didn't always used to be

470
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:10,050
right when they're actually not and not
everybody is right wing.

471
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,450
But now there is a place where it's
weird.

472
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,950
I've noticed with the,
uh,

473
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,000
with Fox where it's like if somebody,
they like the right likes,

474
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,820
says something anti-trump,
then they just want them off the

475
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:21,830
network.
Like,

476
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,190
yeah,
that happened twice.

477
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,370
Shep Smith said something about trump.
He said something recently that was

478
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,010
really good and people we have,
but he went on a rant about it and then

479
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,540
people were like,
that's sort of my favorite thing right

480
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,360
now is there's a group of people calling
another group of people snowflakes for

481
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,700
over sensitivity,
which I love that term.

482
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,010
Yeah.
Which I think is very funny and I agree

483
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,770
there was a lot of snow.
You can get in trouble right now for

484
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,930
saying anything and I'm sure like just
this conversation,

485
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,060
people are mad,
but if some fucking liberal guy on

486
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:51,750
twitter that was like in all caps,
stop calling people snowflakes and

487
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,201
you're like,
well,

488
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:53,430
now I want to do it more.
It's,

489
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,700
it's tantamount to psychological torture
for these young children.

490
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,370
Like,
oh,

491
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,450
fucking snowflake.
I got into trouble with,

492
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,700
uh,
when,

493
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,250
when trump won because they kept showing
all this footage on the news.

494
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm like,
grown men crying.

495
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,670
So I just said like,
I don't know,

496
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,520
maybe I'm immature,
but to me every time if I see a grown

497
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,700
man crying on the news,
it's not if he's crying because his kid

498
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:17,970
died.
Just like if you lost the election and

499
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,350
you're a grown man and you're crying.

500
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,580
And so I made a joke about it.
Like,

501
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:21,870
how?
I think that's funny.

502
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,220
Every time people got so mad,
oh,

503
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,710
men can't cry.
I'm like,

504
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,370
oh no,
men can cry over that pussy.

505
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,283
I don't know.
It's like,

506
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,590
people were like,
Oh,

507
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:32,550
why?
Why is it funny?

508
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,480
Because it's a man.
I'm like,

509
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,180
yeah,
I guess because he's crying over an

510
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,780
election and he's a man,
like I don't know where I grew up.

511
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,190
That's funny.
It's still funny to me.

512
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,310
It is funny because that's not a guy who
can keep it together.

513
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay.
This is not a national disaster.

514
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,690
It might become a national,
wasn't at the time it was just a loss.

515
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,690
Certainly a moment for concern.
Sure.

516
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,590
But,
and I get it.

517
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,341
And then people were like,
well,

518
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,240
what if,
what about,

519
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:54,991
you know,
gay man?

520
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:55,441
And I go,
yeah,

521
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,700
I get it.
A lot of people are scared.

522
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,110
They're gonna lose your rights.
They're scared.

523
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,320
I get it.
But man,

524
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,520
I got scolded for grown men crying.
It's funny to me,

525
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,300
not like,
I'm like,

526
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,690
I guess it's not.
I don't know if there's so many people

527
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,610
making a grown man.
Crying is not funny.

528
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,920
What's funny is a grown man crying when
he shouldn't be crying.

529
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,030
Yeah,
that's what's funny.

530
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,720
Yeah,
absolutely.

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,201
Yeah.
And it's,

532
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,120
you know,
it's like there's still an instinct.

533
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,440
You still have like a kind of a knee
jerk instinct to things sometimes that

534
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,100
just makes you laugh.
And then if you share that feeling at

535
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,260
the,
at the wrong time,

536
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,430
you're immature.
Yeah.

537
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,800
And then they'll use charts and then the
flip side is,

538
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,520
is the right man,
they're killing everybody.

539
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,310
Snowflakes.
And then you say one thing that they

540
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:35,120
don't want to hear and they want you on
Fox News talking about snowflakes to

541
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,850
like why chef Smith teaching go with
Meghan Kelly the m and the lame stream.

542
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,170
NBC Indigo.
You.

543
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,660
Doesn't that make you a snowflake?
Now the same thing happened with Chris

544
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,710
Wallace.
Shepherd interview with rents,

545
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,850
Priebus,
and people were like,

546
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,560
get him Outta here.
Oh really?

547
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,371
Yeah.
Chris Wallace,

548
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:52,060
his,
you know,

549
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,640
his dad was Mike Wallace.
He's actually a journalist.

550
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,540
It's crazy.
Well,

551
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,570
it,
it's a weird time when you see

552
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,510
journalists getting excluded from press
gaggle.

553
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,900
So when you get the New York Times and
uh,

554
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,230
who else was it?
It was never a times la times.

555
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,760
And then there was another big one.
Oh,

556
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:07,594
CNN,
CNN,

557
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,850
fuck the fuck man.
What the fuck.

558
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,260
Do you remember when Obama was
considering removing Fox News from

559
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,670
something?
Because Fox News is essentially

560
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:18,130
propaganda.
If you listen to Sean Hannity,

561
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,100
I've heard Sean Hannity is a wonderful
man.

562
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,180
I've heard he's a really nice guy.
When you meet them with that

563
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,230
motherfucker is spewing straight hot
propaganda.

564
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,120
He was the best point man.
After the grab my pussy shit came up.

565
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,100
He was the best because he just went
fucking straight to Bengazi.

566
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,000
He went straight to the email scandal
and he fucking hammered it constantly to

567
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,020
the point where,
you know,

568
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,580
locker room,
talk aside,

569
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,900
he circled.
We could certainly say that was

570
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,670
inappropriate.
Let's get to the facts.

571
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,740
Your let's get to what's important and
just Bam.

572
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,520
Bam is a big trump ally.
Oh,

573
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:53,070
but he's good.
He's good at what he does now.

574
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,610
He is very good at what he does,
but I mean when that was going on with

575
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,070
against Obama,
they were like,

576
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,800
look,
why the fuck are we having these people?

577
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,810
Even why we even pretending they're
press.

578
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,750
This is not journalism.
These,

579
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,800
this is a propaganda network.
And it was like,

580
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,970
Whoa,
whoa.

581
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,690
You remember?
It's like 2009 in Obama almost had them

582
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:11,900
removed,
but people protested.

583
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,371
He's like,
all right,

584
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,020
fine.
Not Trump.

585
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,880
Know he's like,
not only that,

586
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,650
I'm not even going to the press
correspondents' dinner.

587
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,800
That to me is he talked about being a
pussy dude.

588
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,300
Like you're like,
you're scared,

589
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,550
you're scared to get made.
That's him being scared.

590
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,920
And I was thinking the whole time like,
oh,

591
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:29,080
what comedian gets to do that?
That's a great gig.

592
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,270
Fuck that Gig.
That guy will go after you.

593
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,990
That's the problem is you make fun of
that dude and then like you'll all of a

594
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:39,040
sudden like you have like,
you're getting all of this more than

595
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,100
audited men more than audited.
They're probably search your emails and

596
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,770
find some incriminating shit that you
might've did when you were in high

597
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,270
school,
but then.

598
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,420
But then part of me is like kind of
worth it to get standup.

599
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,150
Kind of kind of stand up on the stage
next to trump and just be like,

600
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,440
dude,
come on.

601
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,260
Yeah,
you would definitely get mad press for

602
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:57,390
doing well.
But he,

603
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,120
yeah,
he would.

604
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,340
He would go,
I don't know.

605
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,020
He doesn't handle it well.
Do you remember when Obama was roast him

606
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,530
and he just sat there and stared in his
face?

607
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,890
Yeah,
I know it's,

608
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:08,050
it's,
it's a weird time,

609
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,510
man.
That was like when Obama said,

610
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,320
we have video of my actual birth for the
first time,

611
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,510
we're going to release this and they go
to the lion king,

612
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,730
lion king cartoon.
Hilarious.

613
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,370
Obama was fucking good at that.
Pretty funny,

614
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
funny president.
Yeah.

615
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,650
You mean I,
I just,

616
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,510
I still to this day I think that he's
probably as far as like as a human

617
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,750
being,
not not as like I hate presidential

618
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:38,350
speeches because I hate,
I hate that whole political talk.

619
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,530
I hate the way people talk right now.
Like they're not a real person and he is

620
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,830
like the king of the pause is a big
fake,

621
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,830
stupid artistic five second pause.

622
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,100
Yeah.
Well I mean he's just good at that kind

623
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:55,070
of shit and there's a thing too that I
don't particularly like that but I get

624
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,260
it.
But I mean as far as like being like a

625
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,050
representative of the country,
the guy was intelligent.

626
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,360
Well read,
forget his policies aside.

627
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,520
There's something about who the guy who
is in charge is what it says about the

628
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:10,970
rest of us and what it says about the
rest of us now as it were,

629
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:13,820
a disorganized mess.
And that's really what it says.

630
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:14,960
Yeah,
it's,

631
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,840
it's definitely a.
I could tell you this though.

632
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,730
Trump is not wrong about CNN hating him.
Like he's not wrong.

633
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,250
No.
If you watch the election and everything

634
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:28,130
leading up to the election,
they did not like him.

635
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,170
Even the,
even the images they use of him and they

636
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:34,320
were pretty openly against him and look,
I was,

637
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,750
like I said,
I worked at the daily show.

638
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,120
I watched a lot of CNN,
I watched a lot of MSNBC.

639
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,470
There's problems.
I have problems with all of those cable

640
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:42,340
news now.
Good for you because you and,

641
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,240
and I really think that like the cult of
personality media thing.

642
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,210
My,
my biggest issue with cable news is that

643
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:53,180
there are in the same rating system as
like the Big Bang theory.

644
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,390
You know what I'm saying?
And it's like they're trying to get.

645
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,600
No,
but they're trying to get numbers.

646
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,980
Man,
that's all they're trying to do.

647
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,550
Obviously the goal of Sean Hannity show
or,

648
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,780
or ac three 60,
any of these shows is to get people to

649
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:11,540
watch so they can sell ad time because
so they can make money.

650
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,090
So that's my issue with it more than,
you know,

651
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,450
they're like,
a lot of them were bad at journalism.

652
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,284
I mean,
you know,

653
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,270
I,
it's hard for me to forget things like

654
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,300
balloon boy when we were at war in
Afghanistan and Iraq and like they think

655
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:29,960
a kid stuck in a weather balloon and we
have like seven hours of coverage of a

656
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,640
weather balloon floating down the street
with a live chop recovered.

657
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,950
And then it turned out the kid was
hiding,

658
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,180
the dad was a prankster or whatever for
whatever the point is done.

659
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,520
Why?
Why did I have to watch that for four

660
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,660
hours?
You know what I'm saying?

661
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,510
So it's like if a shiny thing happens,
they run towards the shiny thing they

662
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,930
do.
They're immature,

663
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,820
they're looking for ratings,
they're looking to be the first.

664
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,670
They never talked about.
There's like flint,

665
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:53,850
Michigan,
right.

666
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,950
What,
when was the last time,

667
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,150
like people that don't have water still
and they live in America still,

668
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,590
but the media is not talking about it.
You know,

669
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,590
they're talking right now about Kelly
conway putting their feet,

670
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:04,620
feet,
feet,

671
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,570
feet,
shoes on.

672
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,730
It's what I want to know,
but in another words,

673
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,290
God Damn White House,
couch pitch.

674
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,580
So if they get,
they get,

675
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,730
they get.
That's what people are mad about that

676
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,090
like they're like disrespect,
disrespectful.

677
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,550
If the guy was sitting like that.
But you got to imagine this scotch

678
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,240
guarded.
That shit.

679
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,670
If Obama was sitting like that on the
couch,

680
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,530
do you want me to.
Gay rumors would come out about him.

681
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,010
Shell Obama was sitting like that
anywhere.

682
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,190
Oh yeah.
People be so angry.

683
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,730
I would say about the things people say
about Michelle Obama.

684
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:31,160
She has her shoes on.
Oh boy.

685
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,600
That is just UNAMERICAN shit.
Bubble gum all over the fucking White

686
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,140
House couch.
Dare You lady dog shit.

687
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:42,320
And bubblegum.
It's a real problem with what the news

688
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,160
is because it's not really the news.
It's an entertainment show featuring

689
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,820
events in the news and it's.
There are 100 percent bias.

690
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,090
There's no real journalism on television
when it comes to TV news.

691
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,920
PBS is they're pretty liberal,
but they're also very boring.

692
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,170
In other words,
they're not trying to Zazi you know,

693
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,280
they'll look,
here's what's happening.

694
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,490
That's what we need though.
You need to be able to formulate your

695
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,100
own opinions and when you're being
steered in one way or another,

696
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:12,750
whether it's steered by bill o'reilly or
steered by someone on the left,

697
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:15,750
it's the who the fuck is like a big
reporter for CNN.

698
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,160
I don't even know who.
Anderson Cooper.

699
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,910
That's it.
We'll put it.

700
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,820
We'll put her.
I saw a wolf blitzer the other day in

701
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:22,140
Vegas.
I ran into him.

702
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,060
I was going to say hi,
but I'm like,

703
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,630
maybe he doesn't like me.
He hit his head for hookers with him.

704
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:30,390
He's walking into the did and high five
them.

705
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,050
Nobody wants to smoke a joint.
The only thing I will say about Fox is

706
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,930
like their opinion guys,
o'reilly Hannity,

707
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,190
that kind of have them under opinion.
Yes.

708
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,410
Versus like Anderson Cooper is like
news,

709
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,370
you know,
so it's like,

710
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,480
it's like,
why do you think Anderson?

711
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,490
I think Anderson Cooper,
like my take on him is clearly,

712
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,020
he's very left wing.
Right?

713
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:53,960
He's a gay guy,
you know?

714
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,750
I mean he's a,
he's a,

715
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,680
but he's also a vanderbilt.
Oh yeah,

716
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:00,930
that's right.
And he also worked for the CIA when he

717
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:02,220
was in college that I did not.
No,

718
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:02,610
he didn't.
No,

719
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,111
no,
no.

720
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:03,590
Yeah,
yeah.

721
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,590
That's the big concern is that Anderson
Cooper is embedded CIA journalist.

722
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,730
Yeah.
That's the big CIA conspiracy theory.

723
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,391
You didn't know that?
No,

724
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:15,150
I did not know that.
I would imagine that once you work for

725
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,790
the CIA,
you're in the fucking CIA.

726
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
Imagine you always have a little
contact.

727
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,540
Yeah.
I have a friend who used to be in the

728
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,750
CIA and I still consider him and the
CIA,

729
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,723
you know,
I mean,

730
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,521
I know,
uh,

731
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:29,580
another guy whose dad was in the CIA,
fucking dad still in the CIA

732
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,060
essentially.

733
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,220
We'd figure you got to know a couple
people over at this.

734
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,970
Like,
I don't know,

735
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,950
I don't have any CIA context.
You know,

736
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:36,720
it's like I used to work there,
you probably have a few,

737
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,860
and this is the shitty comparison,
but if I left the UFC I'd still be with

738
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,450
the UFC.
You know what I mean?

739
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:43,261
Like there's,
there's like,

740
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:46,950
there's this,
there's a giant bond that you've got to

741
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,890
have with the fucking Central
Intelligence Agency.

742
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,540
You know,
you don't fuck with those guys.

743
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,260
You don't fuck them over and if they
call you,

744
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:55,070
you answer the Goddamn phone hook.
Yeah.

745
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:55,904
You,
yeah.

746
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm still like,
I,

747
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,460
I,
that's why I really got rid of that when

748
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:01,190
trump was being so hard on the
intelligence.

749
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,581
I'm like,
dude,

750
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:05,160
like I don't know man,
like all of those guys that the

751
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,310
intelligence community,
like they're the reasons we're safe.

752
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
And when I say we're safe,
I live in New York City.

753
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,920
Okay.
So my attitude on terrorism is if you

754
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,390
live in New York or a city,
you know,

755
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,760
I always take issue with people and I
traveled to stand up and you know,

756
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,950
I make a joke about isis or something
and people go,

757
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,420
Ooh,
in small towns.

758
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,320
But in big cities they laugh and they
go,

759
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,940
it's amazing to me that people in
Kentucky,

760
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,560
I think that there's someone in the cave
like we've got to get Louis,

761
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,080
like it's not right.
But you know what I mean?

762
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,180
Like,
so there's this weird thing that starts

763
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:39,900
to happen where people are using.
I keep seeing people post nine slash 11.

764
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,360
The World Trade Center is fire go.
This is why the Muslim band makes sense.

765
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,200
I'm going like,
I was their man like you,

766
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,280
you can't just,
you don't get to use that like you.

767
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,660
Like there's something very odd to me
about,

768
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,140
um,
about you.

769
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,160
Like everyone hates New York,
not everyone,

770
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,980
but like real America doesn't consider
New York real,

771
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,690
but the terrorist attacks,
they were,

772
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,630
were like,
it's a very odd thing that's happened in

773
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,100
the country and I know what you're
saying.

774
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,050
It feels like divided in the sense of
like,

775
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,940
we hate everything you guys are about,
but we'll use that thing that impacted

776
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,600
your lives as a way to gain our,
make our point.

777
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,880
That's hilarious what you're saying
because you're saying we hate everything

778
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:17,950
you're about.
That sounds just like the terrorists,

779
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,813
right?
That's true.

780
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,620
So you're talking about someone from
like,

781
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,120
you know,
a very conservative part of the country

782
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:25,810
saying we hate New York because New York
is the liberal elite and then you say,

783
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:29,320
well the terrorists on the side of the
terrorist,

784
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,550
he fucked her.
That's a good point.

785
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,840
I mean it's kind of weird.
It was weird and there was a.

786
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,810
There was a weird thing happening right
now,

787
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,340
but I do.
I do feel like the country is divided to

788
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:42,820
a point of like it.
I don't know.

789
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
We're not going to be honest.
Again,

790
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,090
it's not.
It doesn't see it on the Internet.

791
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,860
It's bad.
I got my.

792
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:52,861
I got my news a lot from the daily show.
What I would watch the daily show and I

793
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,070
see.
I feel like John Stewart obviously I'm

794
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:59,020
very left leaning guy,
but he's also a very smart guy and a

795
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,840
very funny guy.
And when he would talk about like events

796
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,260
in the news and mock them and show clips
and mock the clips,

797
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,770
that to me is a way better version of
what I would get.

798
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,670
Like I can discern what's a joke,
I can discern how he's making fun,

799
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,660
but then I will also get the actual
information of these events from him as

800
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:17,200
well.

801
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,310
That to me is a way better version of
news entertainment than what fucking CNN

802
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:25,450
is doing because with CNN is doing is
having what are essentially actors like

803
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,720
really boring people that are reading
some stupid shit off a teleprompter.

804
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,450
Like you take fucking Anderson Cooper
away from the news.

805
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,980
What?
Who was Anderson Cooper?

806
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,270
What do you.
Interesting Dude,

807
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,190
you know,
let's have him talk.

808
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,850
Have him give a speech somewhere.
Have him talk to people,

809
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:42,250
have him,
have him do a standup routine.

810
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,150
He's boring as shit.
I bet you know what I'm saying.

811
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:47,440
I mean if you're watching an
entertainer,

812
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,330
give you the news,
which is essentially what CNN is doing.

813
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,900
Right?
Fucking John Stewart should be on CNN.

814
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,610
Yeah.
But then he'd have to like go to work

815
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,510
everyday.
Didn't want to do that.

816
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,180
Is that what his deal is?
He doesn't want to work,

817
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,720
you know,
he,

818
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,990
I mean he doesn't want the daily show
after so many years.

819
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,150
I mean,
I was there for a long,

820
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,640
I talked to John a lot.
I think a lot of it is just the feeling

821
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,660
of like,
you know,

822
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
doing a talk show four nights a week
every day and calling through all that

823
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,700
news.
Like we were giving people the little

824
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,410
golden nuggets that happened throughout
the day.

825
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:19,270
But like we have to watch it.
Like,

826
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,370
you know,
we were absorbing a lot of radiation

827
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,740
from all that stuff.
Like you know,

828
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,300
like the closer you are to the
radiation,

829
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:28,570
the more you know your,
your hair gets great and your soul hurts

830
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,980
after a while.
And I think for John,

831
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,520
I mean I think him leaving when he left
was a good way to do it.

832
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,110
You can just make a bunch of money and
say,

833
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:35,740
ah,
that's it.

834
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,700
No,
it wasn't even the money.

835
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:38,200
I think it was just,
he felt like.

836
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,980
And he said it on the last.
I wasn't there for the,

837
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,870
I,
I'd stopped working there before he

838
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,600
retired,
but I think you just got to a point

839
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,850
where he said like,
I'm not doing this at the level I could

840
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,580
do it at anymore,
therefore someone else should do it.

841
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,330
Like,
um,

842
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,163
he was,
he was,

843
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,670
he was just kind of,
he did it,

844
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,530
you know,
and I think if you waited through this

845
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:55,580
election,
which people are like,

846
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,810
I wish he was still on.
It's like,

847
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,940
yeah,
but now trump would be in and then

848
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:00,200
everyone would be like,
you can't quit now.

849
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,243
You know,
like he'd be,

850
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,930
he'd be stuck in it forever,
you know,

851
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:06,170
and I think he just wanted to walk away
like on the top,

852
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,160
you know,
like the way,

853
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,800
you know,
like retire after a super bowl win kind

854
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:10,930
of thing.
You know,

855
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,710
people forget that he wasn't the
original hosts.

856
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,790
Isn't that fascinating?
Yeah.

857
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,640
Kilborne was what happened to that guy.
I don't know,

858
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,530
I,
I never worked there with Gilbert and I

859
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,650
started like six months after John
Stewart started and uh,

860
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,590
so I've heard a lot of like funny
kilborne stories.

861
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,810
Like he was a good dude and he was
really funny guy,

862
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:30,410
but like definitely much more of a read
the teleprompter.

863
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,570
He read what they put in the prompts or
kind of ragging Ron Burgundy style.

864
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,450
Fuck yourself,
San Diego.

865
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,870
Uh,
John,

866
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,370
when John came on and he was like,
really a writer,

867
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,850
producer mind.
That was definitely a sea change that

868
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,060
the show of like the writers wrote.
The original writers go like,

869
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,890
what the hell?
Hey Buddy,

870
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,330
don't ruin our little show.
And he was like,

871
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,980
man,
I don't know if you understand how this

872
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:56,060
is gonna work,
you know,

873
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,380
there was a little hole,
there was like a clash a little bit,

874
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:58,940
a little bit.

875
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,760
What was their vision that he was just
going to read whatever they wrote.

876
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,623
Yeah.
Period.

877
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,680
Yeah,
I think so.

878
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,440
But he's a really funny comic.
Why wouldn't they want him to contribute

879
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,970
and make it funnier?
I don't know.

880
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,950
I mean,
it worked out in his favor and his

881
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:12,290
contributions ended up making the show
pretty obviously.

882
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,330
But Egos are a motherfucker,
man.

883
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,490
It's an odd thing.
Yeah.

884
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,710
Comedy writers are,
like you said,

885
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,400
there's definitely a thing with comedy
writers where it's we have this special

886
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:24,470
unique skill and it is a skill and it's
hard.

887
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:25,304
I,
I,

888
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,810
I've done it,
I do it like,

889
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,240
it's hard,
but you know,

890
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,750
a lot of people are funny,
you know,

891
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,680
the Internet to me taught me that,
like the Internet was when it really

892
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,780
became the Internet the last 10 years.
Like,

893
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,660
oh,
yet like there's just some funny dudes

894
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,840
who live in the middle of nowhere and
there's as funny as anyone I've ever met

895
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,400
and they just never had access to this.

896
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,400
They never had access to la or tv or
even knew how to the wildest dreams.

897
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,760
How do you get into this business?
It doesn't seem like we don't have to

898
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:56,510
anymore.
The whole idea is just to get your

899
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,930
message out or get your comedy out and
you could just do that on instagram now.

900
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,970
Yup.
I was super lucky in that.

901
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,960
Um,
I was on a really unusual sitcom in news

902
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,620
radio and not unusual in that.
It was funny,

903
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:09,710
but unusual in that Paul Simms,
who is the executive producers,

904
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,780
he has almost zero ego and so if Dave
Foley came up with a funnier line or

905
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,370
Stephen root came up with a funnier
line,

906
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:16,851
it's like,
oh yeah,

907
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:19,880
go with that.
Like instantaneously would drop whatever

908
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:24,881
the old line was and go with their line.
So my whole take on comedy on television

909
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:30,521
was poisoned like early on by dare,
generosity and lack of ego.

910
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,600
So like when I would,
when we would do that show,

911
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,500
like Dave Foley would rewrite whole
fucking scenes when we do genius genius,

912
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:40,040
secret producer of that show in a lot of
ways in.

913
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,790
But they wanted him to do it.
They're like,

914
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,520
let's just make the best show we can and
everybody would contribute.

915
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:47,340
So there was never any.
So I would do other things and when I

916
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,700
would do other things and when someone
would have a better line and the right

917
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:50,340
it's got.
Yeah,

918
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,390
let's stick with the first one.
I'm like,

919
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,070
that aligns way better.
I'm like,

920
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:54,300
what the fuck's going on here?
Like they don't,

921
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:56,010
you don't want to try that line.
I was like,

922
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,140
oh,
there's some weird ego shit going on

923
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:02,880
here were the writers didn't want to be
replaced by some standup comic who is on

924
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:06,060
it,
you know that some David spade type

925
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:09,880
character or whatever they've been had
been rendered irrelevant at that.

926
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,350
Nobody wants somebody else to come in
and do the thing they think that they

927
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,340
need to be doing.
They want to protect their existence.

928
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,730
So yeah,
I mean every show like for me at the

929
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,560
daily show and then the nightly show you
I was running,

930
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,200
I didn't start running the daily show.
I started as a PA,

931
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,530
but like I ultimately ended up being the
executive producer before I left and

932
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,100
same with the nightly show.
My attitude with all of those shows was

933
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,520
all I cared about was the show being as
good as it could be.

934
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,740
I don't care.
I didn't really care where the idea came

935
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:38,730
from or that the goal was every night,
the best show possible now.

936
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,170
What was your experience doing?
The nightly show?

937
00:36:40,171 --> 00:36:41,490
How long did you do?
Before we did it,

938
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,290
we were.
We were on the air for a year and a

939
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:43,500
half.

940
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,190
My experience there was awesome.
I loved the people.

941
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:46,140
What happened to the show?
What?

942
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,780
I mean?
I think it didn't work because,

943
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,910
well there's a lot of reasons.
I think it didn't work,

944
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,210
but mainly it takes a talk show a while
to figure out what it,

945
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,320
what it is now.
And so if you watched the last six

946
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:01,980
months of the show,
we really like started nailing it.

947
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,490
Like we really had something special and
we figured it out.

948
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,350
Like we got the groove down.
We figured out what the,

949
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,320
what the acts were,
what were the kind of stories we were

950
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:14,100
tackling and it takes that long.
But in figuring that out,

951
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,640
you know,
Jon Stewart left the daily show.

952
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,450
So our lead in and uh,
you know,

953
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,160
this is another new trevor,
but our leading was now a new host of

954
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,770
the show.
So I think the audience gave us a chance

955
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,840
which any audience would when we first
aired.

956
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,050
And the show wasn't quite there yet as
no show is,

957
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,560
but they gave us a chance.
And then when John Left,

958
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,140
I think they had already given us our
chance.

959
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,370
So by the time we found the show,
like meaning within the show,

960
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:43,650
but by the time we made it good and
really figured out what it was,

961
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,820
the audience was like,
Guy,

962
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,410
now we already tried that yet we don't
like it.

963
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,200
And to come back now and try it because
it's better now.

964
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,520
You know,
it was a ratings issue.

965
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,560
Yeah.
Ratings,

966
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,460
ratings for both shows.
I mean,

967
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,600
late nights.
Tough right now man.

968
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,320
And also don't forget,
like the nightly show was on 11 slash

969
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:59,000
30.
It replaced co bear.

970
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,670
But coverity didn't go anywhere.
He just went to a bigger show at 1130.

971
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,120
So now you have an unknown dude,
Larry.

972
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,890
One more who's amazing?
But he wasn't.

973
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,200
He do now.
He's just didn't know.

974
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,520
What does he do?
See a comic.

975
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,640
Larry was a producer,
he was a comic originally and it

976
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:16,470
producer,
he created the Bernie Mac show.

977
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,200
He created it.
He's been producing and writing

978
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,360
television like every show you've ever
liked.

979
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:22,260
He's it,
you know.

980
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,340
So how did he get behind the camera?
Because he was on the daily show,

981
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:31,341
he was our senior black correspondent,
so he would come in like once a month

982
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:35,830
and do like a thing about racial issues
in America and then really stewart

983
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,410
really wanted to do a show about race
because,

984
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
you know,
Ferguson was going on,

985
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,580
all that stuff was happening,
so he wanted to do a show that was more

986
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,100
of a conversation about race minority
report.

987
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,740
And when John called me I was like,
oh,

988
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:48,401
that sounds fun.
He goes,

989
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,990
and I want you to be the token white
guy.

990
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,720
You know what I mean?
Like meaning I could be the dude on the

991
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:57,721
panel who's either playing the defensive
role or the aggressive role in talking

992
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,940
about some of this stuff,
but it ended up being a lot more of a

993
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,260
daily show kind of show.
Like we had like much more of an act one

994
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,570
footage news.
Uh,

995
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,330
we did a lot of sketches.
Like for me it was a great experience.

996
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,160
I got like,
I have a real now,

997
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,061
you know,
am I real?

998
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,680
It's on my website.
It's like me,

999
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,250
I was wearing mustaches.
I was doing accents,

1000
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,480
like I was playing w we,
we started doing fuse.

1001
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:24,510
What for me was my dream of comedy,
which was the daily show topics with the

1002
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:27,730
Conan O'brien and absurdity.
So we would do stuff like,

1003
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,460
um,
like one of my favorites was when that,

1004
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,830
uh,
San Bernardino shooting happened and

1005
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,240
they were trying to get in that guy's
phone,

1006
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,370
Larry notes that everyone in the news
was going,

1007
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,320
we've got to get back door access,
backdoor access,

1008
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,850
backdoor access,
backdoor access.

1009
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,000
So we did a bit where I was a backdoor
access expert,

1010
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,740
you know,
and it was like just a creepy dude in a

1011
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:47,230
basement with like a mustache and like a
mesh shirt.

1012
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,220
And I was like,
yeah baby,

1013
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,930
you want to get in the back door,
Larry,

1014
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,580
you can't come at it so hard,
you know,

1015
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,270
those kinds of things.
So we were talking about real issues and

1016
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:58,570
then playing with like sketch.
So it really got funny and good.

1017
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,440
But I think by the time it got funny and
good comedy central was like,

1018
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,580
ah,
we got other problems.

1019
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,710
Are you happier now just doing standup?
Yeah.

1020
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,290
Now when I ran into you in Denver,
which was a fucking fun night,

1021
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,040
that was fun,
man.

1022
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,460
It was a fun night of Roy was there the
night that Chappelle showed up at my,

1023
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,140
uh,
late show on Friday night.

1024
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,840
And by the way,
I was watching you so sick because I

1025
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:19,960
knew we were going to go on afterwards
and have some drinks and chat and then

1026
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,840
Chappelle came in and at the comedy
cellar in New York,

1027
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:25,060
Chappelle comes in a lot,
but when he comes down with a seller,

1028
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,673
it's like,
well,

1029
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,060
he'll be on stage for seven hours.
You know what I mean?

1030
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh yeah.
He'll go on stage sometimes for like

1031
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:34,120
five hours and five hours.
Five hours.

1032
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,790
Yeah,
like regularly.

1033
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,610
Not regularly,
but it happens to the point where like

1034
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,330
some dude in the back of sweeping up,
you know what?

1035
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,540
It'd be crazy.
Yeah.

1036
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,380
He's just on say smoking butts doing
this stuff.

1037
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,000
But uh,
so when he first got on stage,

1038
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,660
I'm like,
oh no.

1039
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,730
I looked at my girlfriend go,
we're never going out with joe tonight.

1040
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm like,
we're going to be watching Chappelle's

1041
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,800
separate in the morning.

1042
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,633
You know,
but he,

1043
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,810
you know,
he did this like what,

1044
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:53,920
20 minutes or something.
It was cool.

1045
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,290
He didn't do that much time and it was
the end of the show,

1046
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,280
you know,
it was late.

1047
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,220
I guess maybe you would assume that
Denver people don't have the stamina

1048
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:03,160
that New York City people have to think.
So when he just five hours,

1049
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,920
how many people are still there after
five hours of never there.

1050
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,990
So I couldn't tell you.
I have to leave after like an hour.

1051
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,210
But uh,
he,

1052
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,760
uh,
you know,

1053
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,200
people will stay through the whole
thing,

1054
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,060
but like not everybody,
you know,

1055
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,530
it's so weird.
Yeah.

1056
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,360
But he's,
I mean he know he's,

1057
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,210
I don't know,
I could watch Chapelle for the guys at

1058
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,950
such a good dude,
but he definitely,

1059
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,660
like,
I've never really hung out with them.

1060
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,150
I've talked to a bunch but never hung
out with.

1061
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,420
And everyone's like,
dude,

1062
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:27,280
how can I chappelles the best?
And that night I was like,

1063
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,920
I don't think he likes me very much.
I don't know.

1064
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,140
We were just hanging out,
but we don't think you like to.

1065
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,880
I just got this and we all went out.
Yeah.

1066
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,510
No,
I didn't,

1067
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,900
you know,
it was one of those things where I'm

1068
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,010
like,
every time I say like,

1069
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,750
he definitely liked my girlfriend,
you know what I mean?

1070
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,350
Like what?
He was talking to her when I just meant

1071
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:43,550
like,
he was definitely like,

1072
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,890
I was like,
so you ever have that where you can't

1073
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,320
get a rhythm with someone?
I was talking to him and be like,

1074
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,900
all right,
well that story's not going to fly.

1075
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,240
Like I had that,
like I couldn't get like a.

1076
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,980
that's weird.
That's your perception.

1077
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:58,160
That's interesting because I don't see
that generally speaking that nobody ever

1078
00:41:58,161 --> 00:41:58,560
likes me.

1079
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,390
I've seen my perception was it was a fun
night.

1080
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,580
We went barhopping,
we went to these.

1081
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,550
I've been to Denver.
That's speakeasy was greater times.

1082
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,830
Yeah.
We went to these places that you go down

1083
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,780
an alleyway,
you pass a dumpster,

1084
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,170
you go through an unmarked door and
we're in this weird secret bar and I'm

1085
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,810
like,
what is this bar man you remind me of?

1086
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,380
It was like that scene in goodfellas
where he's like,

1087
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,500
you want some dresses?
Karen?

1088
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,334
She's like,
no,

1089
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,600
go down a couple more garage doors.
Make a left.

1090
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,330
And then she just drives away.
That's what it was.

1091
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:29,871
Everyone was like,
yeah,

1092
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:32,140
there's a bar.
Just keep going to make a left where

1093
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,630
like down this alley here,
the hackles on the back of my neck,

1094
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,780
the
UFC legend Joe Rogan,

1095
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:40,640
or I'm not going to this bar.
I was going to run.

1096
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:40,930
Dude.

1097
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,280
You stuck.
I'm not taking a pike.

1098
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,760
I'm thinking of running and leaving you
guys behind it.

1099
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:47,620
So yeah,
it was,

1100
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,770
it was cool though.
Was Fun.

1101
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,190
We got kicked out of two places for
smoking weed to two different places

1102
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,790
that we couldn't smoke.
Weed will just spark up a joint in a

1103
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,110
regular.
People just light up a cigarette in a

1104
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:02,090
restaurant like that is,
that's a weird thing that just like a,

1105
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,610
he's like missing A.
I don't give a fuck.

1106
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,440
He's like,
he's out.

1107
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,610
He's got a gene like,
and I don't give a fuck gene.

1108
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,640
He's like missing a give a fuck.
I know it's not fair.

1109
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,563
And,
and,

1110
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,770
uh,
the,

1111
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,690
you know,
the best comics to me are the ones who

1112
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:18,650
don't give a fuck and that dude triple
doesn't give a fuck.

1113
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,040
So that's why he's so good on stage
because he really doesn't give a shit.

1114
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,780
We were out to like,
well,

1115
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:26,450
after 4:00 in the morning and there was
a dj,

1116
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,870
we went to some place,
there was a dj and a Dj starts playing

1117
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:35,210
and there's like literally like 10 of us
in this apartment houses place staying

1118
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,160
open.
So they were just happy to have

1119
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:40,190
chappelle there.
I think Chappelle even went up to the DJ

1120
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,650
and was like,
and then plugged in his music,

1121
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:43,790
he was like,
I got this.

1122
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,400
He plugged into the Chapelle was
fucking,

1123
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,610
it was such a trip.
Well,

1124
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:53,000
Dave brings these two huge,
uh,

1125
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,170
they're like,
um,

1126
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,453
you know,
those uh,

1127
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,500
Bluetooth speakers,
a JVC,

1128
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,890
Bluetooth speakers,
he's got these big boxes.

1129
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,300
He brings two of them.
They're huge.

1130
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,490
They're like the size of bigger than
football,

1131
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,130
right?
So he brings two of them and their sync

1132
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:09,380
together.
So one's left and one's right and he'll

1133
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,980
put them on opposite ends of his Green
Room and blare music.

1134
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,270
And I was asking him about like,
well,

1135
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,410
why do you carry this fucking things
run?

1136
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:16,340
He goes,
Joe,

1137
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,150
my only socializing I do is in green
rooms.

1138
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,910
It's like the only socializing.
That's the only time I hang out with

1139
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,840
people.
I go,

1140
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:24,560
what do you do?
Others there?

1141
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,700
I'm by myself.
I mean,

1142
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:26,870
I live in Dayton,
Ohio.

1143
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,530
He lives in the middle of nowhere and
fucking foreign or form.

1144
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,210
What a cool dude though.
He's hilarious.

1145
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:35,310
He's a really unique guy and a lot of
ways.

1146
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,960
He's also,
he's also just,

1147
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,420
um,
it's,

1148
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,470
it's very impressive to see somebody
who's that like kind of legendary at

1149
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,280
stand up and walk into a place and
people are like,

1150
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,860
Oh shit,
you're even whatever level comic is

1151
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:50,461
that?
Oh Shit.

1152
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,280
Chappelle's here.
And then him also just be cool.

1153
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,990
Like in other words,
he doesn't have to be cool.

1154
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:55,381
Well,
yeah,

1155
00:44:55,381 --> 00:44:58,440
when he's not aloof at all,
super friendly.

1156
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,330
Yep.
But I think he definitely has like a

1157
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,250
little bit of a wall up for guys like
you.

1158
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,110
That's why when you came up to me like,
Hey,

1159
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:04,944
what's going on buddy?
He's like,

1160
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,110
because I'm like,
I'm wants my phone number.

1161
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
And I'm like,
yeah,

1162
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,680
exactly.
And I'm like,

1163
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,820
I definitely don't want your phone
number.

1164
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,180
We're just going to be getting hammered
together.

1165
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,490
We'll talk a little bit.
Yeah.

1166
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,510
Yeah,
we,

1167
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,400
we,
uh,

1168
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,110
we pulled it out until like I left him
there,

1169
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,340
I left there like before I left,
like four or 4:30.

1170
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,100
I was like,
I gotta go to Denver is a fun town.

1171
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,910
But I know I did,
I did a show before I was there

1172
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,730
Thursday.
I did it that show Thursday and then

1173
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,160
they did it because I was showcasing my
hour.

1174
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,070
So they made,
they created a shell before your show.

1175
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,060
So I did my hour at like 6:00 or
something like early,

1176
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,950
like they made an early show which they
had never done.

1177
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:45,120
And I was like,
I'm like,

1178
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:47,160
I gotta showcase for somebody at like
6:00.

1179
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,020
But man,
that club comedy works,

1180
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,960
the room was full.
It was like 6:00.

1181
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:53,370
I like killed.
I couldn't even believe it.

1182
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:54,790
I was like,
this something be like a lunchtime show.

1183
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:55,800
It's going to be brutal.
Nope.

1184
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,200
Filled it up.
And everyone came.

1185
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,880
It was.
I've never,

1186
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,480
I've never been more impressed with a
comedy club in my life than being able

1187
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:06,930
to pull off a show early and good.
And then.

1188
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,050
And then you had two shows after but
you,

1189
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:11,170
you got to meet Wendy.
The owner of the common ones.

1190
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,220
She's,
she's the reason why there's a scene in

1191
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:16,680
Denver.
I mean she is the scene and she

1192
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:19,090
literally is responsible for that plate.
That's the only one.

1193
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,270
That's why I worked that club.
The last time I was there.

1194
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:24,090
I sold out the bell coach,
like 6,000 people.

1195
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,520
I still work our club.
It's just like I,

1196
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,220
I can't not support that place.
That place is fantastic.

1197
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:30,390
It's,
it's so important too,

1198
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:35,391
because she brings people up from open
miker to hosting to middling,

1199
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:37,650
to headlining.
Like she has like local headlines.

1200
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,450
She farmed.
She has like a foreign team,

1201
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,790
a real farm team.
Man.

1202
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,860
She's really legit and there's.
There's a community in Denver.

1203
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:45,960
Look,
there's legit professional comics that

1204
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:49,080
work in and around Denver.
She'll have local headliners headline

1205
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:50,730
for the week and they'll pack the place.
Yeah,

1206
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,460
she's got a great system man.
I mean she's just,

1207
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,800
man,
she's just really put it together and

1208
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,310
they're all top quality standups.
Like there's no hacks is no,

1209
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,620
there's no bullshit.
She doesn't tolerate thieves or any

1210
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,550
bullshit club owners who really curate
and pay attention to their club,

1211
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,990
always have the best clubs.
It's just,

1212
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,390
you know that that's one of the reasons
the comedy cellar so amazing.

1213
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,560
Like see who runs it.
Like sure.

1214
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,670
Writes it like she's not like,
even if you get past,

1215
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,680
they're like,
that doesn't mean your work in there all

1216
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:17,760
the time.
Like she's,

1217
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,630
she's always got an eye on.
Everyone is like,

1218
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,870
you,
you have to be consistently good there

1219
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,870
to stay,
you know?

1220
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,290
And I've seen guys come and go at that
place and that place comes up.

1221
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,130
She will drive comic crazy.
Like because they're so

1222
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,870
excited to be in and then they like
panic,

1223
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,070
you know,
I've seen and then they're like moving

1224
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,970
and like every time I come in there like
three tables further away and we can get

1225
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:42,250
into further from the tape and then
there are moods that falafel place next

1226
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:42,551
door.
I'm like,

1227
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:43,840
you're not going to be working there
anymore.

1228
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,970
That place,
you know,

1229
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:48,940
drives people.
A little con can drive a little crazy

1230
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:52,150
because you want to succeed there and
you want to be a part of it and you want

1231
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:52,950
to be accepted.
You know,

1232
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:57,520
in my first year or so in that place I
was like that for sure.

1233
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,390
You know,
before I was like,

1234
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,224
okay,
like um.

1235
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,200
Well in the 19 eighties there was a
bunch of communities all over the

1236
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,000
country.
San Francisco had a community.

1237
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:06,250
Boston had a big community,
New York,

1238
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,110
of course,
in La I've always had communities.

1239
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:11,620
Texas had a community.
It's a big community in Houston is huge.

1240
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,840
Austin always had a community.
Austin's got a good scene,

1241
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,880
but you know,
there's been a few things that have

1242
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:19,600
happened that are good and bad.
The good thing is like these Improv's

1243
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:23,020
have opened up everywhere and so you,
you get that Improv experience

1244
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:25,510
everywhere you go.
You get these big clubs that are packed.

1245
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,940
Everyone super professional that shows
are packed.

1246
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,290
Everything's great,
the food's great,

1247
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,670
the drinks are great services,
great.

1248
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,350
But they don't have that sort of xannies
and Nashville feel.

1249
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,220
You know what I mean?
I just zany Chicago to a week ago and

1250
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:41,840
I'm going to Nashville like in the same
sort of love.

1251
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:46,600
One of my xannies Chicago is like,
I just it just because it's like a old

1252
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:48,740
gritty club shots everywhere.
Yeah,

1253
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:50,050
yeah.
Well the head shots are like half the

1254
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:51,310
people are dead,
you know,

1255
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:52,900
you look around and like Richard,
Jenny,

1256
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,980
oh this guy,
that guy,

1257
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,440
you know,
but those clubs they have like,

1258
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,080
there's a more,
there's a more organic sort of a,

1259
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,660
what's the word?

1260
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,580
Craft beer sort of feel to them.
They feel like more authentic in some

1261
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:07,510
sort of a weird way.
Like,

1262
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,430
I love working at the Improv,
don't get me wrong,

1263
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,400
but there's something about those
Improv's that like,

1264
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:15,940
Houston used to have like a big scene.
They used to have the laptop stop in

1265
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:18,640
river oaks was a huge scene.
Kennison started out there,

1266
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:20,320
Bill Hicks was there,
all those guys were there,

1267
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:25,321
like Hicks did one of his early dvds at
the laptop and then it became,

1268
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,410
the Improv was in town,
the laptop went under,

1269
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,650
they moved locations and they went under
and then the Improv opened up and then

1270
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,840
it was like a headliner club where,
you know,

1271
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,180
Tracy Morgan wanted to be there or this
guy would be there,

1272
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:40,030
but it would always be big name
comedians and that was it.

1273
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,220
And so like the local scene sort of
dwindled.

1274
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,200
I've heard it's sort of started making a
comeback,

1275
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,320
but the windled but the,
uh,

1276
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,090
I'm trying to think when you're saying
because I feel like I'm doing.

1277
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh No,
I'm doing laugh out loud in San Antonio.

1278
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,690
So.
Oh,

1279
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,800
I haven't been there.
Yeah,

1280
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,360
that's what you're touring everywhere
now.

1281
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:55,841
Yeah.
Well,

1282
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:57,700
yeah.
I'm hopefully taping an hour in the

1283
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,180
spring.
So yeah,

1284
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,300
for who?
Um,

1285
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,950
I don't.
Um,

1286
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:02,520
I don't know if I'm allowed to say or
not can say an official.

1287
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:03,750
I don't know because it's,
I mean it's,

1288
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:04,930
it's.
Well,

1289
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,890
here's what you're saying with,
with,

1290
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,170
you know,
how this business works.

1291
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,000
Like until I see it on the thing,
you tell him like I don't believe I have

1292
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:16,240
anything until I have it until you sign.
Well yet we're even just like,

1293
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,330
once it's like taped and I'm sitting at
home and I go everyone turn on Blah Blah

1294
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,310
Blah Blah,
you know,

1295
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,450
this business always feels like you're
one head of a network getting fired away

1296
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:27,170
from not having the thing you thought
you're going to have.

1297
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:28,004
So I try

1298
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,190
to be very,
not only superstitious but just like,

1299
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,170
you know,
but it looks like one way or the other.

1300
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,030
Ob tape tape in my era in the spring.
But yeah.

1301
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,740
So I'm just down the road.
That's what I mean.

1302
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,430
When the nightly show ended,
I was bummed.

1303
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:41,420
I obviously,
I wanted the show to be on for 10 years

1304
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:44,030
or 20 for everybody who worked there,
but personally speaking,

1305
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:47,770
my goal with the nightly show was never
to stay there as the executive producer

1306
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,310
forever.
My goal was to launch it and get it

1307
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:52,220
going,
sort of teach everyone how to do it

1308
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,530
because it was the daily show model that
we were,

1309
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,690
you know,
and I know how to do that very well.

1310
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:02,020
And then my hope was I would just be on
the show and like slowly relinquished my

1311
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:05,930
authority of running it to other people
so I could work from like noon to three

1312
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:08,490
and then just do stand up goal a three
hour,

1313
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,640
three hour workday and being on time,
you know.

1314
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,650
But uh,
but not my,

1315
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,850
that wasn't my goal yet.
My goal was to get the show successful

1316
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:18,950
before I did that.
So when it got canceled I was,

1317
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,960
I was pretty bummed and I was pretty
disappointed.

1318
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,220
I put a lot of time into it,
but,

1319
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,290
you know,
for me it was like,

1320
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,970
all right,
well I want to go on the road anyway.

1321
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,940
And uh,
and I had my whole fall book so I didn't

1322
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:30,690
really know how I was going to manage
both anyway.

1323
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:31,221
So I was like,
all right,

1324
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,440
well there you go.
And I got my real and got my own camera

1325
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:35,600
real.
Which to me is just the thing you need

1326
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:37,010
to say,
w when you're pitching something to

1327
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:37,790
somebody,
they go,

1328
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,420
what are you going to be in this?
Have you ever been on TV?

1329
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:39,810
You're like,
yeah,

1330
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,643
no,
I got it.

1331
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:43,580
Like you just need proof of your ability
to do it.

1332
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,760
And I got that,
you know,

1333
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,720
that's the fucked up thing about doing
anything on a network because you have

1334
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:51,040
to get someone to agree.
I agree to use you agree to this,

1335
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,550
agree with that.
There's all these people that aren't the

1336
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:55,370
creative people but they have the money
yet and they're the ones that you have

1337
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,540
to talk to about it,
you know?

1338
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,920
Well,
well we've got this idea.

1339
00:51:57,921 --> 00:51:59,120
Oh,
let me see your right there.

1340
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:00,800
Yeah,
I give you a money.

1341
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,800
Maybe I should give you the covet at
8:00 PM slot.

1342
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,650
Maybe not yet.
I don't know.

1343
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,800
Kiss my ass.
But that gatekeeper model is dying,

1344
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,420
it's over,
it's over.

1345
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,900
And what you need now is a room with a
camera.

1346
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,260
I mean it's literally all you need is
the space to fail and whatever you're

1347
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:22,190
filming the,
the budget to afford cameras and the

1348
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:25,050
ability to stream and upload things that
you just need to adjust it.

1349
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,440
A little venture capital.
I mean I just did this thing even need a

1350
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:28,550
venture capital.
No,

1351
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,430
I mean you just need somebody to give
you like 100 grand unless you have it,

1352
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,230
you need a 100 grand to do what?
Well,

1353
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:34,580
I'm just saying,
depending on what you're looking to

1354
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:35,391
shoot,
you know.

1355
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:37,130
Okay.
But I'm saying if you want like a sag

1356
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:39,440
aftra level thing with like good camera
guys.

1357
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,350
Like you have a bunch of your friends
and you write it and you use a fucking

1358
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:44,480
camera,
like one of these things that you don't

1359
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,390
need any of this feel like this is a
strange time when it comes to that

1360
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:49,160
stuff.
Like there's a lot of people that are

1361
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,550
still treating it as if it's like you're
filming some movie.

1362
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,320
Well,
their television show,

1363
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:57,170
the big budget.
I also find too like the digital spaces

1364
00:52:57,171 --> 00:52:59,720
now or being taken over by the old
guard,

1365
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,530
so in other words,
all of a sudden like if you,

1366
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,900
if you want to pitch something to like
see,

1367
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,260
so it's like,
well it's a branch of NBC.

1368
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,380
NBC is NBC,
NBC Business Affairs has to get,

1369
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:10,880
you know,
like,

1370
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,100
and you're like,
well now I know I'm right back to where

1371
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:15,200
I started when I don't want to just
pitching this to NBC,

1372
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,710
but they're doing a lot of standup
specials and standup specials for guys

1373
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:22,250
like Stan hope and ideas and people that
are.

1374
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:25,060
Who else just did one recently who just.
Someone was just on the head of CSOS.

1375
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,643
Fuck,
was it?

1376
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,890
God Damn it,
Jamie.

1377
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,970
Somebody had one.
Jesus Christ.

1378
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:35,250
I can't remember as too fast.
All right.

1379
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:36,660
Whatever.
There's too many people.

1380
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,040
Yeah,
there's a lot of governments there.

1381
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,670
They're doing a lot of good standup
comedy specials on CCS.

1382
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,410
That's great.
It's great that that exists.

1383
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,690
Nick Depaulo.
That's right.

1384
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,520
I'm glad I remembered that.
Yeah.

1385
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,200
Nick's has just,
just came out on CSO and CSO.

1386
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,730
You know,
I mean that's,

1387
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,600
it is a branch of NBC,
but they're uncentered and they're doing

1388
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,440
great stuff.

1389
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,940
You know,
I just think that.

1390
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,550
Well,
here's a crazy statistic that I just

1391
00:53:59,551 --> 00:54:00,720
read yesterday.
Ready for this.

1392
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,820
Netflix takes up one third of the
bandwidth of the United States of

1393
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,860
America.
One third one.

1394
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,950
All of the Internet bandwidth.
One third of the bandwidth it's being

1395
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:13,860
used in the United States of America is
through Netflix.

1396
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,380
Wow.
Wow.

1397
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,990
Holy Shit.
That's insane.

1398
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:21,240
It's so crazy.
With the other third,

1399
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,370
like Pornhub,
it's all two thirds corn,

1400
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,020
one aboves feet as buzzfeed dead.
Is that the one that got killed by Hulk

1401
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,640
Hogan?
Gawker.

1402
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,410
Gawker killed by.
I forget which one.

1403
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,690
Which one of those salacious sites.
So funny.

1404
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,590
Yeah,
well that's it.

1405
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:41,810
I mean it's like those sites,
like tmz is probably like one eighth pmc

1406
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,450
man juggernauts almost those little news
stations and you know,

1407
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:48,960
youtube is probably a big chunk to
facebook to people love facebook,

1408
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,360
man.
Third Man,

1409
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,680
a third one that.
Yeah,

1410
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,780
that's nuts.
Like if you looked at a pie of the

1411
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:56,910
Internet,
one third is Netflix.

1412
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,520
That's what a lot of it's got to be
because you're streaming video,

1413
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,650
another word that that takes up a lot of
bandwidth,

1414
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,470
so it's not necessarily that that many
people are using Netflix,

1415
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,780
it's just that that the stuff that
they're using on Netflix,

1416
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,180
is that thick?
For sure.

1417
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,000
It's definitely both.
I mean it's definitely a lot of people,

1418
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:14,040
but it is definitely.
I mean it's growing constantly.

1419
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,850
Netflix is a goddamn snowball rolling
down.

1420
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,770
It has completely revolutionized and re
re invigorated.

1421
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:22,920
This whole entertainment industry.
I went and met with those guys while I

1422
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:26,240
was out here because I've been out here
for like a month and a book.

1423
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,460
You want to talk about the difference of
you take a meeting at like like a viacom

1424
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,210
type place versus like a Netflix type.
Like netflix.

1425
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:35,570
It's like they just moved into a new
office building.

1426
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,570
Like they're like,
you want a water?

1427
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,460
You're like,
sure you go in the back.

1428
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,030
It's like,
what kind of water do you want?

1429
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,700
They've got like snacks everywhere.
Like people like pogo,

1430
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:43,410
stick it around.
Like everyone's so happy,

1431
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,370
you know,
like it's just,

1432
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,700
it's like the building is new.
There's like a valet in front.

1433
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:49,350
He's like free of charge.
I'll pocket Carla.

1434
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:53,190
Thank you Mr. Netflix,
like everything about it is so nice.

1435
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,620
Everybody's so nice.
Everybody's in a good mood.

1436
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,250
You gotta think MTV for a meeting.
They were like,

1437
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,220
get us.
Help us

1438
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,730
what to do.
Yeah.

1439
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,290
They have $9 a month is what it costs.
Right?

1440
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,500
And how many millions of people do they
have on Netflix now?

1441
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,380
Something that did $93.
Million people today is what I heard on

1442
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:17,610
the way in here.
So 93 million people.

1443
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,444
What is that?
Right.

1444
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,260
But what does that mathematics close to?
$900 million a month.

1445
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,020
It's close to a billion dollars a month.
Yeah,

1446
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:27,400
it's in the neighborhood.
It's closing in on a billion dollars a

1447
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,030
month.
That's hilarious.

1448
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,100
That's so much money.
Printing money.

1449
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,940
I did my first comedy special on Netflix
in 2005.

1450
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,390
That was my very first special was on
Netflix.

1451
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,740
Getting a comedy special on Netflix now
is near impossible because it's

1452
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,290
Chappelle and Chris Rock and,
you know,

1453
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,700
I just didn't want it.
Yeah,

1454
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:48,310
but I'm saying,
but you're famous.

1455
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,330
But I mean,
um,

1456
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,410
I mean I think they're doing some.
I mean they,

1457
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:54,220
they,
they,

1458
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,550
they buy some to look if you do want and
then you could sell it to them like they

1459
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:59,030
bought Tony Hinchcliffe slash.
I know,

1460
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,870
but now it's.
Now that it's harder now,

1461
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:03,310
now it's a bit harder.
Yeah.

1462
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:04,144
And,
and uh,

1463
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,070
once again for me,
I mean,

1464
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:08,590
I think you'd probably have to have a
bigger name.

1465
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,080
We'll say here's the trailer for the new
will Smith movie.

1466
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,820
Netflix reportedly paid 90 million for
run that shit.

1467
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,230
Let's to plant A.
No,

1468
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,530
we can't play it.
What'll happen?

1469
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,420
They'll kick us off.
Okay.

1470
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,000
Okay.
Good stuff.

1471
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,770
But you can watch it well to kick us off
youtube.

1472
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,390
Yeah,
because it's their trailer.

1473
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,190
They just put it up.
Can I call somebody like,

1474
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,290
come on guys,
I want to.

1475
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,900
You will try to hook you guys up.
But he has a sword.

1476
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,150
That's what I'm trying to hook them up.
That's exciting.

1477
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,810
It seems like a movie you'd like Joe.
I like all will smith movies except for

1478
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:36,610
the one where he's the homeless guy with
his son.

1479
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,370
I couldn't watch that.
What about the one with the scientology

1480
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:41,140
one?
Whereas with his son.

1481
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,000
Who was that one?
What's that one word?

1482
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,590
A scientology movie?
Yeah.

1483
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,320
Ron Hubbard book.
That one.

1484
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:47,691
No,
no,

1485
00:57:47,691 --> 00:57:47,980
no,
no.

1486
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,150
It's,
it's like a space.

1487
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,750
Him and his son are stuck on a planet
that's l Ron Hubbard.

1488
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,250
I think that's it.
That's his.

1489
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:57,750
Remember when John Travolta did a pedal
battleship or

1490
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,400
battlefield earth.
And he's like,

1491
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,790
take human animals.
So that,

1492
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:04,390
that's also an l Ron Hubbard book.
So this is,

1493
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:04,771
uh,
the,

1494
00:58:04,771 --> 00:58:06,400
the,
we're watching this right now.

1495
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:10,210
Will Smith.
It plays a cop in La and there's works.

1496
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,450
It's like a futurist.
Oh Wow.

1497
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,500
Shit.
This looks dope.

1498
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,590
There's got a sword in the future.
There's orcs that's an ORC.

1499
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,680
Whoa.
This doesn't end well.

1500
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,140
David era directed at the guy that did
suicide squad training.

1501
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,460
Oh,
this looks good.

1502
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,960
Yeah.
Where is that coming out?

1503
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,160
December.
Goddammit it.

1504
00:58:27,161 --> 00:58:29,980
Why you make me wait til December.
December is a year from now.

1505
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:31,750
You fucks.
It's Goddamn February.

1506
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:33,550
That's not cool.
This is bullshit.

1507
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,841
Yeah.
He said,

1508
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:35,800
well,
Smith said he always.

1509
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:40,210
He was always the genre he liked to do
because those were the.

1510
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,070
Oh yeah.
The highest grossing movies.

1511
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:44,520
Every time I am legend.
Legend.

1512
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,420
So grateful.
So grateful at anytime.

1513
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,610
It's a dude and like a German shepherd
alone.

1514
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:49,420
I'm like,
this is good.

1515
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:51,370
I think they should go over.
I am legend though.

1516
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:55,510
And reduce some of those scenes like the
ones with the lions in New York City.

1517
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:56,111
Like,
come on.

1518
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:58,360
Those lines looks so fucking fake.
Well,

1519
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:00,180
you know,
the CGI wasn't where it needed to.

1520
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,890
Now redo it,
Redo it,

1521
00:59:01,891 --> 00:59:04,070
and don't tell anybody after earth after
earth.

1522
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:05,650
Sure.
After earth is an l,

1523
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:08,200
Ron Hubbard book is that him and his son
is of the deal.

1524
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,330
See Jayden.
Okay.

1525
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:12,760
Find out.
Jaden seems completely insane.

1526
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,500
Up Famous Willow Smith saying has a new
song that's out then.

1527
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,240
I'm not going to lie.
It's a good time.

1528
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,710
Well,
that's not good.

1529
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,010
How old is

1530
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,150
she?
Oh,

1531
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,620
oh,
for sure.

1532
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:29,490
Don't release your kid's music until
they're 21 who wrote the shovel on

1533
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,400
flickr and it wasn't good.
I said and wrote,

1534
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,600
bye.
Oh,

1535
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,430
okay.
Same thing.

1536
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,770
So it's both the fucking hookers.
This one.

1537
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,190
Here's the twist on this one.
It wasn't good

1538
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,150
night.
Shop twist,

1539
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,550
watchable.
He made one good movie and then fucked

1540
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:48,370
us all repeatedly.
He can't.

1541
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,700
They can't stop giving them movies to me
like you.

1542
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,760
How many chances do you get?
How is the new one's supposed to split?

1543
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,360
Personality one.
This is supposed to be in a good.

1544
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:57,590
Good.
Pretty good.

1545
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,513
Did you see it?
Yeah.

1546
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,550
Okay.
What did you see the one with mark?

1547
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,650
Mark markets chased by the wind.
I think it was plants that were trying

1548
01:00:03,651 --> 01:00:06,490
to kill him.
I thought it was the wind might be of.

1549
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,110
That's one of the greatest bad movies
I've ever seen in my life.

1550
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,310
It's just,
it's just more Walberg running around.

1551
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,111
He's like,
he's like,

1552
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:13,310
yeah,
I get in the fucking house.

1553
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:14,670
You know,
it's the second house.

1554
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,220
It looks like a branch closes.
I got a second wind.

1555
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:22,010
You know,
there's a guy in that movie who runs

1556
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:26,000
himself over with his own lawnmower,
it's mowed his lawn and then they cut

1557
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:28,140
away and they looked back and he's under
this.

1558
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,550
The wind got them tickets.
So the wind's targeting individuals,

1559
01:00:31,551 --> 01:00:33,860
but when wants you to kill yourself,
I think is what it is.

1560
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,710
It's unbelievably nature wanted you to
kill yourself.

1561
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:37,910
Right.
There was like a smell that it was

1562
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:39,230
putting out or something like that.
I don't know.

1563
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:41,930
All I know is there's a scene where he's
running in a field and he's panicking

1564
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,880
and the only thing that's happening is
grasses.

1565
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,650
If nature to.
Have you ever seen some of those giant

1566
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,630
storm clouds?
They photograph over the Kansas

1567
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,430
Cornfield and shit that are as big as
cities and these like,

1568
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,920
why wouldn't nature just do that thing
that it already does?

1569
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,390
Why does it have to do some targets?
Lawnmowers makes them run over asshole.

1570
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,320
Like people are always trying to find
some new hook,

1571
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:13,070
like the village or these people,
they think that it's 16,

1572
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,060
12,
but it's really 2015 and they're living

1573
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:19,840
in the middle of a place where they're
not allowed to fly planes.

1574
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,850
They can't fly planes over this area.
There's a no fly zone works.

1575
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,090
How big is this fucking no fly zone
because I don't know if you know this,

1576
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,010
but planes fly everywhere.
You can't.

1577
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,920
Even if they're outside the zone,
you probably still here one.

1578
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,970
But here's the stupid thing.
They walk in a,

1579
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,160
in a short amount of time.
They're at a road and then cars drive

1580
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:40,950
by.
Remember that?

1581
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:42,590
Alright.
I don't think I ever saw the village and

1582
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:44,150
you should say it.
I was fucking terrible.

1583
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:47,060
I was taking a break from [inaudible]
for awhile and it took a little shy,

1584
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,370
a little shovel on hiatus.

1585
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,180
But he did devil the one about a haunted
elevator.

1586
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,170
No,
she did that.

1587
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,063
Yeah,
it was him.

1588
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,870
Yeah.
He can't stop haunted.

1589
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,550
Elevated the health insurance.
I mean,

1590
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,810
you know what you should do if,
if,

1591
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,960
uh,
uh,

1592
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,270
Jordan peals horror movies supposed to
be incredible.

1593
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:06,510
I haven't seen it yet.
Yeah.

1594
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,170
I feel like I tried doing a comedy,
you know what I mean?

1595
01:02:09,171 --> 01:02:13,040
Why not mix it up,
try taking a nap break,

1596
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,250
take a break.
He made one good movie that's six slash

1597
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,900
movie was good though.
That's good movie.

1598
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,010
But often that happens with people like
how

1599
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,970
many bands have come out with one great
album and then they follow up is dog

1600
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,240
shit most statistically I would say most
bands,

1601
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,230
comedians do the same thing.
Some comics have one great special and

1602
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:33,080
then they like,
I always put a nut.

1603
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,000
I'm a huge tennis fan,
but I always pointed out to him he's the

1604
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,520
best example of a guy who came out of
the gate,

1605
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,090
like with the greatest of all time or
one of the greatest of all time.

1606
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,360
I think priors the greatest of all time.
But kennison is right up there like

1607
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:46,230
number two.
It's funny because people don't bring

1608
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,170
him up in those conversations enough.
Yeah.

1609
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:52,170
I'm saying when you have the WHO's the
best conversation about standup kinisons

1610
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:53,490
name isn't even like,
yeah,

1611
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:57,360
they go with Carlin and all due respect.
I just don't think they're comparable.

1612
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:02,570
Carlin was a great comic and his body of
work is fantastic and he just did a new

1613
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,290
hour every year for decades and.

1614
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,760
But he had a lot of duds,
you know,

1615
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,720
in the later.
The later years were tough.

1616
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,310
I'm a big fan of his later specials were
a lot less.

1617
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,700
He was a lot less charming and he was
doing a lot more like we're all going to

1618
01:03:18,701 --> 01:03:20,540
die.
You are.

1619
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:21,870
Yeah,
we definitely do it.

1620
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,490
You,
you're older and have been watching you

1621
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:26,250
for years and it doesn't look up,
but I love but I love to.

1622
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,950
I mean it jamming in New York to me is
one of the best hours of.

1623
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,760
Oh yeah,
no,

1624
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,010
he's got fantastic work.
Don't get me wrong,

1625
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,790
but it's not as funny as kinesis.
Best work.

1626
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,370
Kinisons best work.
When he was doing like that bit about

1627
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:42,200
the homosexual necrophilia acts are
paying money to spend a few hours of

1628
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,370
undisturbed,
but the freshest male corpses

1629
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,910
is.
Imagine that you're lying down.

1630
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,731
You're like,
wow,

1631
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:48,780
I'm dead now.
I'm gonna.

1632
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:53,781
Go meet cheeses and hey,
what the fuck is it feels like some

1633
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:58,290
guy's got his dick in my ass.
I need life keeps fucking even after

1634
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,124
your dad

1635
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:06,650
who is fat and like,
like the whole thing about him was like,

1636
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:10,330
you were an overcoat and he had a baret
with a comb over.

1637
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,910
He was just.
The whole thing was chaos.

1638
01:04:12,911 --> 01:04:13,840
He was just,
it was.

1639
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:17,620
He was actually think jamming in New
York is dedicated to Sam Kennison.

1640
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:18,663
Wow.
Yeah.

1641
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,280
Well he was.
I mean look Carlin's and all time.

1642
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:22,031
Great.
Don't get me wrong.

1643
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:23,410
I mean if he,
if there's a top 10,

1644
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:25,540
he's in there,
but I really think these days,

1645
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:28,150
birds up there to his special.
His,

1646
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,280
his,
his recent specialist have been.

1647
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,090
He's doing stuff in some of his
specials,

1648
01:04:32,091 --> 01:04:34,270
but I'm like,
I can't even believe you can do that.

1649
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:38,260
Like it was all the same way.
He doesn't think about hitting women and

1650
01:04:38,261 --> 01:04:41,260
you're like,
how is he going to stick this landing?

1651
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,450
It's like 2,500 people pull back.
He goes,

1652
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,480
I feel you're pulling away and you're
like,

1653
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:47,280
Holy Shit.

1654
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,790
What?
I love the one who does about Arnold

1655
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:49,410
sports that.
Yeah,

1656
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:51,670
that's a nice man.
He's a great man.

1657
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,820
Gold digging whores tucked out a great
man.

1658
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:56,560
It's the same.
It's the same hour,

1659
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,710
the same hour.
Yeah.

1660
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,770
Yeah.
It's,

1661
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,810
yeah,
there's a lot of great comedy going on

1662
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:02,970
right now.
For sure.

1663
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,193
For sure.
Yeah,

1664
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,430
it's a fun time.
It is a fun time.

1665
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,600
Oh,
you live in New York?

1666
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,411
Yeah,
I'm living there.

1667
01:05:08,411 --> 01:05:09,490
I mean,
I've been out here for a month.

1668
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:09,710
I,
I,

1669
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,160
I got cast in this little,
like digital series thing.

1670
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,740
What's a digital series like?
What is it like a 10 episode,

1671
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,010
little Saifai comedy thing that I got
cast and then I didn't even audition

1672
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:19,260
for.
I think they just saw my nightly show

1673
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:21,130
reel and they're like,
we need someone to play a Douchey guy in

1674
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:24,380
like
a Psi Phi.

1675
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,780
It's like a weird Saifai called,
uh,

1676
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,850
it's called stellar people.

1677
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,860
It's like a dinner,
I mean it's like a dinner.

1678
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,720
I've just finished it.
It was really fun though because I've

1679
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:35,170
never done single camera acting before,
which is a different.

1680
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:38,590
A lot of work,
but it's a lot of like there's a dude

1681
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:40,060
five inches from your face and they're
like,

1682
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,520
don't look at them and look,
but I want to.

1683
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,200
It's right in my face.
I'm not professionally trained.

1684
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,041
They'll like,
look over there.

1685
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,100
I'm like,
put your right to the Lens.

1686
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,090
So close as long as to ours because it
was super low budget,

1687
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,620
but it was a sad thing and it was.
Yeah,

1688
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,710
we were shooting like 11 pages a day
like it was,

1689
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,130
but the dudes shooting it were so sharp.
They were so good and they were young.

1690
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:01,870
They were.
I didn't realize until the wrap party

1691
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,940
how young they were.
We were at the wrap party the other

1692
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:04,060
night.

1693
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,270
I'm like,
how long you guys been doing this?

1694
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:05,591
They're like,
oh,

1695
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:06,520
we got a feature coming out.
I'm like,

1696
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:07,060
oh,
cool.

1697
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,380
How old are you guys?
Twenty six.

1698
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,250
I was like,
Shit.

1699
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,470
And it kind of made me.
I was inspired.

1700
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:13,870
I was like,
couldn't you guys just be with me all

1701
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:17,080
the time because 26 and you're funny and
you're talented and you know how to

1702
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:19,300
shoot and edit and everything they shoot
looks good.

1703
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,820
Well,
and there's still 10 years ago they were

1704
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:24,700
in high school,
so like 10 years ago this whole thing

1705
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:25,660
was kicking off,
you know,

1706
01:06:25,661 --> 01:06:29,230
10 years ago you look into 2007.
That was really the launch of the

1707
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,400
digital space,
you know,

1708
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:33,100
like I said,
my netflix specials in 2005.

1709
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:38,130
Nobody had netflix in 2005 and it was
looked at as like a joke and that's sort

1710
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:41,140
of where at 2006,
2007 things start ramping up.

1711
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,180
And then digital became more and more of
a big deal.

1712
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:47,710
I remember people there was um,
NBC had a different thing before cso

1713
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:49,630
that they were doing.
God dammit.

1714
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,730
What was the name of it?
There was another name.

1715
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:54,420
We had actually a deal with them.
Burley bear was what?

1716
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,140
That was like a college thing they had
years ago.

1717
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:56,710
No,
no,

1718
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,010
it was a crackle,
crackle still around,

1719
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:01,650
isn't it?
Is it.

1720
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,700
I will if it's NBC anymore,
sometimes I see crackle come up on

1721
01:07:04,701 --> 01:07:05,190
thanks.
Oh,

1722
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,570
I dunno.
Maybe,

1723
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,480
maybe I'm wrong,
but when we had a deal with them,

1724
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:13,090
but a bunch of shit fell through and
they want to just give me money for

1725
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:13,960
nothing.
That's good.

1726
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:14,471
Nothing.
Yeah,

1727
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:16,240
nothing.
It was one of those weird things where

1728
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,630
like nothing happened but.
But you got paid.

1729
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:19,540
He gave me money.
I'm like,

1730
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,530
okay,
that's pretty cool.

1731
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,533
All right.

1732
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,200
I could go for one of those.
Critical if you're.

1733
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,510
If you're out there.
Yeah.

1734
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,410
It was like an interview show we were
going to do.

1735
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:30,490
It was like similar to like a podcast,
but like in a weird location just

1736
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:33,550
sitting down with people,
which by the way is not the best move.

1737
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,690
The best move is have like a place like
this where it's quiet and you just sit

1738
01:07:37,691 --> 01:07:40,390
down and talk,
but everybody wants to like how about we

1739
01:07:40,391 --> 01:07:44,030
do it in a park when people feel weird
in to park and there's birds chirping

1740
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,740
and
fucking drive by in the background.

1741
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:50,500
Sirens,
joggers and shit dog.

1742
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,610
I remember I did a show with Neil
Brennan for Sundance a couple of years

1743
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:58,000
ago and uh,
they had never done a show like it was

1744
01:07:58,001 --> 01:07:59,170
a,
it was a studio show,

1745
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,470
but they wanted to shoot it in a loft,
you know,

1746
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:03,304
and I was like,
well,

1747
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,560
we could get a studio and then make it
look like a loft and that way it sound

1748
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:08,710
proof,
you know what I'm saying?

1749
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:09,180
They're like,
well,

1750
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,280
we really want it to feel like a lot
firm.

1751
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,601
Like,
you know,

1752
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:12,940
the friends,
they weren't really in a loft,

1753
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:13,840
right?
That was like,

1754
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:14,500
no,
no,

1755
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:14,810
no,
no,

1756
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,800
no.
I saw it.

1757
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,070
They were

1758
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,200
so desperate for like it to feel and I
was like,

1759
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,270
you're going to have the loudest,
most unsuitable show if you go find a

1760
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:25,760
loft in Soho,
you could just wire it with lights.

1761
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,970
So we ended up getting a studio,
but it's like that.

1762
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:31,970
That's a bad instinct doing stuff
outside of a professional area.

1763
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,250
Someone said to me,
let's do a podcast at starbucks.

1764
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,650
How about you just know and.
No,

1765
01:08:36,651 --> 01:08:38,360
but we just get starbucks.
I go to a studio,

1766
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,080
why would you want to go to starbucks?
So you want to take the chance and

1767
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:46,790
people next to you having arguments with
their agent on the phone or screaming at

1768
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,970
their dog walker or whatever.
If you can't find fluffy like that,

1769
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:51,950
that's all going to be on your podcast.
Is that cool?

1770
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,610
Like you don't have the best
conversations in public places like

1771
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:55,820
that.

1772
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,070
That's not a good move,
but everybody wants to do something

1773
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:59,960
crafty and creative and different,
you know?

1774
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,230
Yeah.
I mean I always think I find that too is

1775
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:04,620
like with standups.
A lot of times younger stand ups will

1776
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:07,280
say like,
I'm really trying to be outside the box.

1777
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:08,220
I'm like,
get a buck first.

1778
01:09:08,221 --> 01:09:10,190
Have a fucking box.
You need a box first.

1779
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:10,701
You know,
like,

1780
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:12,860
like Jackson pollock knew how to paint
the bowl of fruit.

1781
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:13,903
You know what I mean?
Like go.

1782
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,110
I think he did.
I don't know,

1783
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:19,250
like in other words,
you got to start with some sort of basic

1784
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:22,190
skillset before.
Like now it's like start a podcast.

1785
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,600
You hit a sore spot with me,
buddy.

1786
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,220
Really?
You're not as Jackson pollock fan?

1787
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,140
Nope.
Yeah.

1788
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,310
I'm not saying it.
I'm not saying I'm a fan of his.

1789
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,210
I'm just saying he was a painter before
he started splattering shit.

1790
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,770
Well,
I watched that movie,

1791
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:36,320
the Ed Harris Movie,
and I was like,

1792
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,030
okay,
well this,

1793
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:38,690
there's nothing exceptional here going
on.

1794
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,180
Like this guy's throwing paint around
and I'm watching a movie about a guy

1795
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:44,210
throwing paint around and it's got some
trials and tribulations.

1796
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:44,601
I,
yeah,

1797
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,340
I get it,
but I'm not.

1798
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:50,270
I mean it's not the worst looking art.
It's kind of cool to have like in the

1799
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:54,000
lobby of a hotel or something.
I'm not a fan of it personally.

1800
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:56,300
I like community by like if you bought a
Jackson pollock,

1801
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,740
you're spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars,

1802
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,980
millions of dollars.
That would be millions,

1803
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:01,813
millions,
millions first.

1804
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,640
If I know the artist's name,
it has to be worth millions of dollars.

1805
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,450
Okay,
here we go.

1806
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,530
Here we go.
I'll fuck you.

1807
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,220
Fuck you.
For every one of these,

1808
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,010
if you have to pay a million dollars for
every one of these,

1809
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:13,910
click,
click on that one.

1810
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:15,290
Where your cursor is right there at
Jamie.

1811
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,410
Fuck you.
This is chaos.

1812
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,060
You could go to the Jackson pollock
house.

1813
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,010
It's out in east Hampton.
And uh,

1814
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,620
my nephews went,
the Jackson pollock house,

1815
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:26,600
the house he painted and it's like,
it's like a museum now,

1816
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:30,950
but for little kids you can paint the
Jackson pollock and my nephew and my

1817
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:33,230
nephew did one and it looks exactly
like,

1818
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:35,100
probably looks better than he was five.
And he did it.

1819
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:40,180
I went to my old agents house.
My old agent had this beautiful house in

1820
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,090
Aspen and he had this thing on his wall
and I go,

1821
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,520
is this something your kid did?
And someone goes,

1822
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:48,120
no,
that's a world war.

1823
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:49,510
I go,
what?

1824
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:50,780
What are you talking about?
And they're like,

1825
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:52,730
do you know anything about modern art?
I go,

1826
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,170
no,
and I go,

1827
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,420
what is this?
And the guy explained it to me that that

1828
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:58,880
was probably like a $35,000 painting.
I go,

1829
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:02,420
get the fuck out of here.
I mean it was literally like 12 by 14.

1830
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,660
It looks like a little kids first grade
class project.

1831
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,210
So I thought like,
oh this is cute.

1832
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:09,380
He puts up his kids artwork.
It's like in a nice frame.

1833
01:11:09,381 --> 01:11:11,180
Yeah.
It was like some tissue paper that was

1834
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:14,070
glued to some other paper and some paint
splattered

1835
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,903
on it.
Like,

1836
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,740
yeah,
moderate.

1837
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,400
Let's look more of that.
Just fascinating to me.

1838
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,140
And people get so upset if you don't
like what they like.

1839
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:28,200
Like if I've talked about Jackson
pollock before and you get these Jackson

1840
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,990
pollock fans and believers and they're
like,

1841
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:34,920
you don't understand this.
The layers of paint and the way his

1842
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:39,921
vision was manifested on to canvas
sounds,

1843
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,500
it sounds like the aliens from galaxy
quest,

1844
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,960
that's actually kind of cool.
I'll give him 500 bucks for that.

1845
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,730
Yeah,
I mean again,

1846
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:51,130
I'm not a fan of it but I try as hard as
I can with stuff too.

1847
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,340
Especially now to go like,
you know what that looks like.

1848
01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:54,610
But like what they like,
I don't know.

1849
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:57,510
When the dude goes to the hospital and
they find that he has like intestinal

1850
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:59,700
worms and they pull them all out onto
the operating table.

1851
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,480
That's what it looks like.
Those are like white intestine warm data

1852
01:12:02,481 --> 01:12:03,690
is actually a cool painting.
Now.

1853
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:06,690
I'm trying to change my opinion here
because that one is actually kinda cool.

1854
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,490
What about that one up above it?
That green one?

1855
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,350
What does that one to the right?
No,

1856
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,520
right above it.
Yeah.

1857
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,510
That looks like it.
Yeah.

1858
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,620
What is that?
That's Jackson pollock to.

1859
01:12:16,621 --> 01:12:18,900
I'd be pissed people like what is that?
It's a pollock.

1860
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,620
No,
it's not.

1861
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,010
So even splattery we've done.
No,

1862
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:24,120
no it is,
but that one looks like he was splatting

1863
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:25,690
something.
Yeah.

1864
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,410
That was like that one I liked was on
different pills.

1865
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,540
Alien.
Look at him.

1866
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,810
Weird looking guy.
He's so weird looking guy to betty.

1867
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:36,170
She will.
She Wolf.

1868
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,500
That's what it's called.
Is that a wolf?

1869
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:40,110
I guess there's teeth and the tongue
down the lower left hand corner.

1870
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,120
I bet he banged a lot of confused older
ladies with money.

1871
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,460
The older.
Yeah.

1872
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,350
I feel like.
Yeah,

1873
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,790
probably.
I think younger.

1874
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:50,580
Two younger two.
I think there was like a lot of 50 year

1875
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:52,230
old hot ladies that would by his
paintings.

1876
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:55,410
He would fuck them in the.
But that's what I think happened.

1877
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,270
He may have done some 50 year old,
but fucking

1878
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,410
was that in the movie?
I didn't watch the movie.

1879
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,740
No,
but it was like,

1880
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:07,130
I'm not going to do any of the bud
fucking look at that $140,000,000.

1881
01:13:07,131 --> 01:13:10,620
I told you the intestinal worms.
One hundred and 40.

1882
01:13:10,621 --> 01:13:12,780
How much is she wolf?
How much does she will go for?

1883
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,210
He made that in 1948.
Wow.

1884
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:19,380
Holy Shit.
It doesn't say wow.

1885
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:21,240
What year is that?
She will 43.

1886
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,870
Jesus Christ.
That is really interesting though,

1887
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:28,800
because back then you know like this,
you're talking about a completely

1888
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:31,300
different time.
This is World War II.

1889
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,970
Yet to think about like dudes are like
jumping out of planes in,

1890
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,480
in Germany and he's like splatter
painting in the Hamptons,

1891
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,450
you know,
making cash and banging war widows.

1892
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:48,360
Now he's banging divorcees of heads of
industry now.

1893
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,420
Like the,
the amount of money that you would have

1894
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:55,590
to have to spend $140 million dollars on
some splattery paint.

1895
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,180
Yeah.
You have to have netflix money.

1896
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:00,900
A billion a month.
The netflix executive.

1897
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,130
The head guys probably putting one up
right now at his house in Brentwood.

1898
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:08,370
I think he's putting it up for him,
for his painting hanger is putting

1899
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:09,870
enough.
Get painting hangers for sure.

1900
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,470
Yeah,
definitely.

1901
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,100
He's probably

1902
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,590
got white maids.
No,

1903
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:16,960
that's money.
It's real money.

1904
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,490
Real.
You must.

1905
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,570
You must.
You must get a lot of you must you say

1906
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:24,910
things.
I feel like why I like you so much is

1907
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,840
you are not a partisan person.
You do the thing I tried to do with

1908
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:31,000
politics and everyone thinks because of
the daily show,

1909
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:35,020
I'm very left.
I get accused of being all right lately.

1910
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:35,650
Yeah.
But it's like.

1911
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,560
But it's like it's just having an
opinion is like.

1912
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:39,680
So I always try to have an opinion per
issue almost.

1913
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:45,070
I really got confused when this country
went to a place where you have to be all

1914
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:46,080
in,
on either side.

1915
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:46,660
I,
I,

1916
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,430
I feel like most people aren't,
you know,

1917
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:53,431
like some people are pro choice and also
okay with guns like well it's just the

1918
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:57,370
people that are pro one way or the other
way or very laughed the loudest.

1919
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:00,170
There's a lot of us that are just
scattered across the board.

1920
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:00,760
Yeah,
just like,

1921
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,140
I dunno,
like there's some things that are

1922
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:03,580
reasonable and some things are
unreasonable,

1923
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,200
but you are one of those people who sort
of.

1924
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:10,000
I find this on the road a lot now,
like if I'm making fun of like in my

1925
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:12,000
hour and I've really tried to structure
my hour that I,

1926
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:16,120
I hit everybody in and like it's like
it's like hit both sides and then like

1927
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,380
some Dick Jokes,
you know what I mean,

1928
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:21,430
like wrap up and Dick Jokes and uh,
but when I hit the left people on the

1929
01:15:21,431 --> 01:15:23,470
right and then the minute I'm like,
all right,

1930
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:27,910
now let's talk about you guys
within 12 seconds,

1931
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,460
within 12 seconds of love this guy love
this guy,

1932
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:31,510
love this guy.
I hate this guy.

1933
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,370
He now.
And it's the same thing that's happened

1934
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:33,971
with,
like I said,

1935
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:34,540
Fox News.

1936
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,880
It's like Dave said,
something I disagree with.

1937
01:15:36,881 --> 01:15:39,080
I can no longer watch that person.
And it's,

1938
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:41,230
it's a weird time to be doing comedy for
that reason.

1939
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,920
It's a great time to be doing.
Comedy is so much chaos because you can

1940
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,600
point all that nonsense out.
Yeah.

1941
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,900
I think it's going to San Antonio in two
weeks and I'm like,

1942
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,120
it's going to be fun,
but there's definitely like a chunk of

1943
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:53,930
my act and I'm like,
there's got to be to cut heads.

1944
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,050
Like there's a guy on stage talking
about Jesus,

1945
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,520
like I don't like it and I wouldn't be
like,

1946
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,430
I gotta go.
I gotta go out the back door.

1947
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,380
Your last name?
Yeah,

1948
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:03,490
because I'm A.
I'm half.

1949
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:04,620
I'm a half breed.
Is that a.

1950
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,910
is the last name?
Albany's is a town.

1951
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:08,620
Yeah.
My Dad's so Roman Catholic.

1952
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:09,970
Italian.
They should be cool with it.

1953
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:11,200
Yeah,
but I talked about being a Jew.

1954
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,570
Put your mom was Jewish so that you were
raised Jewish because you really don't

1955
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:15,440
know the mother.
Yeah.

1956
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:17,410
And therefore it was chosen by God,
you know?

1957
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,300
That's how it always is.
Yeah.

1958
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,380
It was one of the best people.
He chose us.

1959
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:21,243
Yeah.
Nice.

1960
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,260
Yeah,
it was pretty cool.

1961
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:27,730
It's pretty funky.
Converted and his name is Salvatore

1962
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,980
Digerlando and he converted to do Judy
Judaism.

1963
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:30,711
Yeah.
Why?

1964
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,400
Why did he do that?
Married a woman who was,

1965
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,310
as you fell in love with a nice Jewish
lady and he wanted to come in.

1966
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:40,270
You gotta got to go in.
My Dad just converted.

1967
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:44,250
Converted,
converted at 68.

1968
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:45,760
To your mom?
Yeah.

1969
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:46,750
To,
to Judaism.

1970
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:49,060
Well,
your mom's religion with your mom or

1971
01:16:49,061 --> 01:16:50,150
with my.
No,

1972
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:50,531
no,
no,

1973
01:16:50,531 --> 01:16:50,860
no,
no.

1974
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,450
With my mom.
But he'd never.

1975
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:54,730
But he never went in.
No until now.

1976
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,630
Until now.
Wow.

1977
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:56,950
He's getting close.
He's like better hedge.

1978
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:58,180
My Bet.
You never know.

1979
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,310
You never know.
Might really be the chosen people.

1980
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:05,620
I got to the fucking big gates papers.
I was living with one for 50 years.

1981
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,290
That's exactly what that,
that is.

1982
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,910
And you know that they did.
They do a,

1983
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:13,970
I want to talk about it,
but they do like a.

1984
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,590
They give you a little poke in the penis
to like they got draw blood from your

1985
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:21,840
penis to Jesus fucking told me that.
I was like,

1986
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,420
no,
we're going on with people.

1987
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,610
Ticks cutting decks and make digs,
bleeding,

1988
01:17:26,611 --> 01:17:30,900
cut and baby dicks and shit.
Circumcisions is weird.

1989
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,020
It feels like the kind of thing you
should have a say in,

1990
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,730
you know,
like you should go,

1991
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,200
you should get on the phone,
you know,

1992
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:37,430
you can't,
you can't.

1993
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:41,810
It's just they just take this thing that
you needed or away and they don't even.

1994
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:42,741
Well,
not only that,

1995
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:46,520
it's being done now for purely aesthetic
reasons and people say something about

1996
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:50,150
aids.
Bowls of [inaudible] crucis was fuck

1997
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:50,984
you.
It does.

1998
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,070
It does not.

1999
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:55,130
That's not true.
It's absolutely a lie and that's just

2000
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:58,370
some nonsense that people have said to
make up for the fact that it's still

2001
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:02,300
this horrific fucking practice and by
the way is probably money in it.

2002
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:05,750
Believe it or not,
there's probably a significant business

2003
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:09,350
and cut and baby dicks,
so they're probably trying to protect

2004
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,010
that significant business and also
trying to justify the baby.

2005
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:14,090
Dick's,
they've cut in the past,

2006
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:16,820
so if they have three sons and they've
cut all the sons Dicks,

2007
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,511
they're like,
well,

2008
01:18:17,511 --> 01:18:19,880
it's really important to prevent aids.
Let me tell you something.

2009
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,860
If you're going to get aids,
you're not going to get it from having a

2010
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:23,060
dirty for skin.
Okay?

2011
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,170
Okay.
We're good.

2012
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,400
Yeah.
Fuck you.

2013
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,230
There's no,
no one's getting aids from dirty forest.

2014
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,940
I don't know anything about the disease
is,

2015
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:32,820
but I do know that uh,
just as a guy who wears button flies,

2016
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,740
it would be nice to have one more layer
protecting my penis from just smacking

2017
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:37,574
around my jeans.

2018
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,840
Don't wear underwear.
You weirdo.

2019
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,250
Yeah.
Well I do wear underwear,

2020
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,970
but it doesn't matter about me undies
some time with me undies,

2021
01:18:43,971 --> 01:18:45,010
man.
Love them.

2022
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,870
Yeah.
Pull up tight to your package suite

2023
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,840
place.
I'll take a look at maybe with micromole

2024
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,530
doll.
Got this fresh.

2025
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:53,600
I got this pair of boxers from the thing
we were doing because there was a scene

2026
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:55,510
where my dick gets pulled off in this
show,

2027
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:59,540
gets pulled off of a robotic penis.
I don't want to spoil it,

2028
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,800
but already put the,
put the.

2029
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,380
I don't know if anyone's going to see
it,

2030
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:04,490
so it's okay.
But uh,

2031
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,300
but they gave me a pair of underwear so
I didn't have to wreck my own underwear

2032
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:10,820
and it.
And it was the most comfortable

2033
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:11,720
underwear ever wore.
I was like,

2034
01:19:11,721 --> 01:19:13,910
this is amazing.
And then my girlfriend came out to visit

2035
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:15,470
me,
she sends me a text and she goes,

2036
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:18,140
why is there a pair of ladies' underwear
in your suitcase?

2037
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:18,973
And I was like,
there is,

2038
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,470
and it turns out this underwear that I
thought was the best underwear,

2039
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,960
it's like ladies underwear.
And I was like,

2040
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:26,350
I was at belt to buy like 50 pairs of
it.

2041
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,530
Who Decides?
I mean,

2042
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,400
I don't know,
but I'm on it.

2043
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,620
Like it just felt because they were like
this,

2044
01:19:33,621 --> 01:19:34,454
like,
um,

2045
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,080
I guess they're like a leggings
material,

2046
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:38,720
I don't know,
but it just made my penis like float.

2047
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,360
Like it was like in limbo.
Like it was like it was in Jello.

2048
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:45,710
It was very nice.
And are they designed for a vagina and

2049
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:46,970
not for a penis?
I don't know.

2050
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,890
All I know is I wore them and I was
like,

2051
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:51,120
I got to get more of these.
And then she was,

2052
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,310
she was like my girlfriend.
No,

2053
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:54,590
she didn't get mad first.
Just thought I was cheating on her.

2054
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,290
And then she's like,
this is the ladies line at target,

2055
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:57,920
you know,
it was,

2056
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,790
oh,
well there you go.

2057
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,850
Now I know where to get it.
That's what I said.

2058
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,640
I'm like,
cool.

2059
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,840
Go pick me up.
Six pairs.

2060
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,520
Yeah.
There's certain things that are like,

2061
01:20:04,521 --> 01:20:06,550
uh,
they don't have a gender associated like

2062
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,080
tube socks.
Yeah,

2063
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,260
right.
Unless you have like the little palm

2064
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:11,990
palm and the back of the heel.
Yeah.

2065
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,410
That's the only way,
you know,

2066
01:20:13,411 --> 01:20:17,100
like little ankle socks for a while.
Ankle socks were only chicks.

2067
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,550
Only chicks were ankles.
So you're right.

2068
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,760
Doozy and wear ankle socks in the
eighties and nineties.

2069
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,550
That was a chick thing.
It was this little tiny socks.

2070
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,630
Yeah.
And then,

2071
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:25,411
uh,
yeah.

2072
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:27,750
Now it feels weird to wear shorts with
socks.

2073
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,670
Doesn't.
To me it does.

2074
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:30,840
It feels weird.
Line.

2075
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,340
I don't know,
I just don't like the way it looks.

2076
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:35,940
It just feels very.
Like I wear socks that they're not

2077
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:38,190
totally ankle socks and people mock my
socks.

2078
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,930
Like these socks.
I check these out.

2079
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:43,230
See they go above the ankle.
Like what are you doing?

2080
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:47,160
I see an extra inch,
but will you wear those shorts?

2081
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,990
Do you know what?
I don't give a shit.

2082
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:50,910
I'm married and wear a fanny pack.
Yeah,

2083
01:20:50,911 --> 01:20:51,990
that's true.
I'm almost 50.

2084
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,530
I don't give a fuck.
Yeah,

2085
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,200
yeah.
What's going to happen to me?

2086
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,640
Nothing's gonna like me less because you
don't like good.

2087
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,550
I,
I'm trying to cut people out of my life.

2088
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,680
If you have a problem with me because of
my socks.

2089
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:05,520
My socks are an interesting that I have
to talk to fuck off with your shitty

2090
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:08,090
ideas.
There's just too many people with just

2091
01:21:08,091 --> 01:21:10,650
like weird,
rigid ideas about what people should and

2092
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:11,740
shouldn't do in this life.
I mean,

2093
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,950
and it's,
it's,

2094
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:15,780
it's constant.
You're constantly being told like that.

2095
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:16,850
We don't say that anymore.
I'm like,

2096
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,300
when did that happen?
You know,

2097
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,070
I can't keep.
That's my biggest problem is I can't

2098
01:21:20,071 --> 01:21:22,590
keep up.
What was the latest one people told you

2099
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:23,440
not to say anymore?
Well,

2100
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:24,660
uh,
Eskimo,

2101
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,310
but that's not true.

2102
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,040
See in certain parts of the country and
the world,

2103
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,280
Eskimo is what they prefer.
Okay.

2104
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,390
See,
I believe in you.

2105
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:35,460
It is in certain parts of the world they
prefer.

2106
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,510
But ask him,
oh,

2107
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,010
is what they prefer.
And other parts of the world,

2108
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:39,750
like people that say that Eskimos the
slur,

2109
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,990
that is not always true.
You might decide it's true for your

2110
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:45,600
area.
Steve Rinella was explaining this to me.

2111
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:50,610
I believe in Canada.
Eskimo is the correct term,

2112
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:53,970
but in Alaska they prefer to see if
that's correct.

2113
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:56,160
Jamie.
Make sure we get that right.

2114
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,300
But that's just people deciding that.
That's what I mean.

2115
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,210
Like I didn't,
I've never,

2116
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,210
you know,
trying to be disrespectful to you.

2117
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,430
It's our Eskimos,
you know,

2118
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:05,360
it's just a problem when you decide all
of a sudden that something's

2119
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,490
disrespectful after people have been
using like language is supposed to

2120
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:09,750
always convey intent.

2121
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,220
That's it.
That's how it's supposed to be about.

2122
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,500
So when you just make these hot button
words,

2123
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,060
you know,
we're not talking about like,

2124
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,680
like,
like japs,

2125
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:20,520
the japs that was a derogatory term used
in world war two and people throw it

2126
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:24,240
around wildly and they didn't realize
it's pretty offensive and that makes

2127
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:25,110
sense.
Like,

2128
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:25,561
oh,
okay,

2129
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:27,930
I get it.
This is a term from World War II that

2130
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:29,940
was used like geeks.
It was an interim.

2131
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,230
It makes sense.
Yes,

2132
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,520
yes,
all those things make sense,

2133
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:35,290
but when you get to things that don't
like,

2134
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,590
there's certain expressions that don't
make sense.

2135
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:40,380
Like how the fuck is it still the
National Association for the advancement

2136
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,490
of colored people.
I know,

2137
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:42,340
yeah.
Come on,

2138
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,690
I talk about that.
It's,

2139
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:46,650
it's tough to give a donation to that.
In Canada,

2140
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:50,820
the term Eskimo has largely been
supplanted by the term in Hewitt while

2141
01:22:50,821 --> 01:22:54,720
in you it can accurately be applied to
Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland

2142
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:58,710
is not true in Alaska and Siberia and
Alaska Determined X.

2143
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:01,290
Eskimo is commonly used because it
includes both.

2144
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,610
You pick an inupiat,
so okay.

2145
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:08,900
In Alaska in youit is not accepted as a
collective term and is not used,

2146
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:11,020
especially in Japan,
so.

2147
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:13,630
Okay,
so in Canada you're supposed to use the

2148
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:15,250
term nun.
In Alaska,

2149
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:19,150
you can still use the term Eskimo and
they want you to use it because it does

2150
01:23:19,151 --> 01:23:22,840
not refer to a certain type of a native
person that lives up there.

2151
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,270
Those are fucking.
Those are the real natives,

2152
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:26,140
man.
I mean,

2153
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:28,570
if you really think about it,
those are the people that not only did

2154
01:23:28,571 --> 01:23:31,900
they cross the bering strait but they
fucking stayed in the cold spot.

2155
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,040
Yeah,
[inaudible].

2156
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,360
They got there and they're like,
yeah,

2157
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:36,880
this is good.
What's interesting is how do you not

2158
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:39,340
keep traveling?
Those people don't have any access to

2159
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:42,820
vegetables and yet they lived almost
entirely free of cancer until we started

2160
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:45,670
importing cigarettes and booze up there
that I did not know.

2161
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,310
They had an incredibly low instances of
cancer and what they're basically living

2162
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:54,400
off his fat.
They're living off seal fat and they

2163
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:58,660
would take seals and they would take
frozen fish and they would dip frozen

2164
01:23:58,661 --> 01:24:01,480
fish in hot seal oil and eat the frozen
fish.

2165
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:04,750
So they take a frozen fish and they
would slice like,

2166
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:07,810
almost like Carpaccio thin pieces of
this frozen fish.

2167
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:11,320
Then dip it and seal oil.
And that's how they to this day

2168
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,140
facilitate.
Well,

2169
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,600
it's not a fondue.
It's like a,

2170
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,281
you know,
like,

2171
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,130
uh,
I don't know.

2172
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:20,260
I could shabu shabu shabu shabu ever.
It's like a Japanese thing where you

2173
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:25,261
take meat and dip it in thinly sliced
meat it on oil or something like that,

2174
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:29,530
something along those lines,
but but somehow or another that diet is

2175
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,570
really good for you,
which is really strange.

2176
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,210
Like I would think you'd have to have
some fucking vegetables in your life.

2177
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,710
Yeah,
but it can't be good for your heart if

2178
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:37,420
you're eating a lot of seal,
seal fat,

2179
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,310
so that's where you're wrong.
See,

2180
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,700
that's a common misconception and it's
one of the things we've addressed ad

2181
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:44,080
nauseum on the show,
unfortunately,

2182
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:48,340
but I'll get to see the short short
version of fat versus carbohydrates.

2183
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:53,170
In the 19 fifties,
the sugar industry paid scientists to

2184
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:57,190
write about saturated fat and to blame
saturated fat for heart disease and

2185
01:24:57,191 --> 01:24:59,590
heart attacks.
That's not the case at all.

2186
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:03,640
It's a lie and it was all created by the
sugar industry to take the blame away

2187
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,140
from sugar,
sugar,

2188
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,780
processed sugar,
and simple carbohydrates like breads and

2189
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:10,630
pastas and all the things.
Those things are terrible for you and

2190
01:25:10,631 --> 01:25:13,930
that's where you get your fat.
That's where you get fat bodies.

2191
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:16,900
That's where people develop like
hardening of the arteries and fucking

2192
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:20,170
clog this and that and all as long with
genetics and a lot of other things but

2193
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:25,530
were saturated fats become dangerous is
when you mix saturated fats with sugars,

2194
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:31,450
saturated fats and sugars together
somehow or another accentuate like you

2195
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:34,270
know,
like fried foods and sugary foods like

2196
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,840
sugary drinks like and fried chicken and
fried deep fried fatty things.

2197
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:42,940
That's where things get really dangerous
apparently,

2198
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:47,941
and this is like a a recent study that
connected saturated fat mixed with

2199
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,500
simple sugars and processed sugars as
being especially dangerous,

2200
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,890
but on their own.
Saturated fats are the precursors for

2201
01:25:56,891 --> 01:26:01,720
hormones and in fact a diet high in
saturated fats and cholesterol actually

2202
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:04,670
raises your hormone levels and it's
healthier for your body.

2203
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,300
Not only that,
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol in

2204
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:12,020
particular food you eat,
cholesterol from food doesn't raise your

2205
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:15,800
blood cholesterol at all.
It barely moves the needle on blood

2206
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,560
lipids.
It's all super confusing because we grew

2207
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:21,110
up with this idea that when you eat
cholesterol,

2208
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:24,690
you get high cholesterol.
It's not the case in factoring.

2209
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:27,050
In fact,
there's a lot of evidence that way where

2210
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:29,530
you're really getting this bad,
uh,

2211
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:32,900
extra fat and your body is from,
from process sugars.

2212
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:35,120
Yeah.
Because your body can't get rid of it.

2213
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,220
Everybody's not net.
It's not.

2214
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:40,280
You're not supposed to ever be able to
take a spoonful of sugar and shove it in

2215
01:26:40,281 --> 01:26:42,530
your mouth.
It's doesn't exist in a Mary poppins.

2216
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:44,270
Do that dirty bitch,
bitch.

2217
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,320
Take the spoon full of sugar.
I'm going to say no.

2218
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:48,251
No,
that's great.

2219
01:26:48,251 --> 01:26:50,060
Yeah.
I don't know that much about nutrition

2220
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,710
fell,
but it's an here man.

2221
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:53,570
I just say Mexican food.
Well,

2222
01:26:53,571 --> 01:26:54,680
that's a good move.
I'll take you to.

2223
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:56,060
I wish we had some time.
I take.

2224
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:58,700
There's a legit Jamie,
I gotta to take you to this place right

2225
01:26:58,701 --> 01:27:01,430
down the street.
The most legit Mexican place you'll ever

2226
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:04,280
find.
They're playing Mexican TV with soccer.

2227
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,980
They have tongue and uh,
Cabeza.

2228
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:09,830
They have head Tacos.
Shouldn't make it to a dude.

2229
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:11,870
I'm telling you,
this place is the bomb.

2230
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,280
I had a,
um,

2231
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:15,100
a tongue case idea,
language,

2232
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:15,973
case,
idea.

2233
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,710
It was fucking fantastic.
Really.

2234
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,450
I don't know if I'd eat it.
So everyone's speaking Spanish,

2235
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:22,070
they barely understand you when you're
ordering.

2236
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,290
If you try to order in English.
God Damn.

2237
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,210
It's good though.
It's legit as fuck.

2238
01:27:26,211 --> 01:27:27,830
This little strip mall area.
Don't.

2239
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:30,200
Don't give the address.
I don't want trump to take him out.

2240
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:32,750
I know man.
There's not a legal person that joined.

2241
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:35,090
I went down with my family the other day
and I was like,

2242
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:38,330
baby.
Then a legal person that have your

2243
01:27:38,331 --> 01:27:41,210
license at the ready.
Bring a passport when you go.

2244
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,350
I really do think food is the key to
making people like each other.

2245
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,760
I really do.
If that's the case,

2246
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,620
why are people kicking out Mexico?
That's what I'm saying.

2247
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:51,260
Like I,
I keep wanting to send like the west

2248
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:52,880
coast.
I was in Arizona doing shows,

2249
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,570
food,
Mexican food down there was so good and

2250
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,750
I wanted to just send like a little case
of Dhea triangle to trump with a note,

2251
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,100
you know like,
are you sure?

2252
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,020
You know like take a nibble dude because
it got so hot.

2253
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:07,020
Cold bowls they made.
You ever see that picture of with the

2254
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,410
Taco Bowl.
I love Hispanics and I was like,

2255
01:28:09,411 --> 01:28:11,230
what?
So weird.

2256
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:12,450
Yeah.
No,

2257
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:15,260
but I feel that's how I feel about.
That's why I think New York,

2258
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:18,560
we've got so many different cultures.
They were at so many different foods

2259
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,810
that you like always eating.
Yeah.

2260
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:22,120
I don't know.
I don't get rid of those people that

2261
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:26,450
this is the best falafels in town.
I know there's certain spots where you

2262
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:28,010
can go.
There's the best trucks.

2263
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,900
Authentic.
Like it's like you said,

2264
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:34,700
like anytime you go into a place that
has that race of people in it,

2265
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:35,420
eating there,
I'm like,

2266
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,530
Oh,
I've chosen wisely.

2267
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,130
There's a good Indian food.
Everyone said there's an Indian place

2268
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:43,580
that I go to as well that is in like an
Indian supermarket.

2269
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:46,610
It's an Indian supermarket that has all
these bizarre smells.

2270
01:28:46,611 --> 01:28:49,550
You go in as a weird curry,
smells and shit and then in the back

2271
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,120
they have like a cafeteria and
everything was an Indian.

2272
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:54,950
Like I didn't know what the fuck they
had.

2273
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:57,320
So the lady was very patient with me and
talked me through all this stuff.

2274
01:28:57,321 --> 01:29:01,010
Everything is vegetarian and everything
is all in Indian and it was fucking

2275
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,020
fantastic and everybody came in in full
Indian garb like you would think you

2276
01:29:06,811 --> 01:29:08,100
were in India,
you know,

2277
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:10,410
it was really weird.
They were all dressed like they lived in

2278
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:13,830
India and just me like looking at me and
he got in one of those big musical

2279
01:29:13,831 --> 01:29:14,281
numbers.
No,

2280
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:16,530
but they had the music plan.
They did have Indian,

2281
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,720
like legit Indian music plan.
That's awesome.

2282
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,780
He ain't gonna find these little spots
and where you can get like real

2283
01:29:21,781 --> 01:29:23,940
authentic food from people that you
know,

2284
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,290
came from there and say,
look,

2285
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,370
this is what we miss.

2286
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,070
So we're going to set up shop here and
just make it a little India,

2287
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:29,993
you know?
Yep.

2288
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,910
I like that.
That's why I like living in a city.

2289
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:33,270
You.
Oh,

2290
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,120
there's some good spots in la too.
There's a great little.

2291
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,610
You ever been to little Vietnam.
There's a little,

2292
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:41,940
a little Vietnamese area that has some
fucking awesome little Vietnamese

2293
01:29:41,941 --> 01:29:44,640
restaurants and that's.
I always find it fascinating how people

2294
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:47,010
pull pool up in groups.
You know,

2295
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:50,310
they get together and,
and then they all sort of buy property

2296
01:29:50,311 --> 01:29:52,890
or rent property in this one,
but is it zone?

2297
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,470
I never like to me like China town in
New York.

2298
01:29:55,471 --> 01:29:57,800
I always felt like zoned.
I don't think it is because he can

2299
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,450
happen organically like that,
but all the Chinese people over here

2300
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:03,710
like a little Italy.
I,

2301
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,220
I,
I always assumed so,

2302
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,780
I mean I,
I guess I could read about it and the

2303
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:08,650
upper east side is like,
was no,

2304
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,180
they're like put some Jews uptown.

2305
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,490
Um,
but uh,

2306
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,340
yeah,
I mean I think that,

2307
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,640
you know,
it's always,

2308
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,070
it's always a weird thing to me to like
put that cities have that and it was,

2309
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:20,790
it still feels weird.
It feels antiquated,

2310
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,650
but at the same time like Chinatown in
New York,

2311
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,040
it was fantastic.
Yeah.

2312
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,070
Like you go down there looks great.
Restaurants,

2313
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:28,800
there's like little alleyways,
you can track it down,

2314
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:33,510
you can get different cuts.
The only sort of food resources you

2315
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:34,730
could get in China.
Like you know,

2316
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:36,450
like you said,
soup markets that have.

2317
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,050
You've never seen anything in store
before because you're not from China.

2318
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,370
Bucket of dried fish heads.
What the fuck is this big barrels of

2319
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:45,270
things and you're like,
what is,

2320
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:48,060
what is that guy scooping out of that
barrel and why is it moving?

2321
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,400
You know what I like?
I like those restaurants where they

2322
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,630
reluctantly,
right?

2323
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:55,470
The name below the Chinese name,
they reluctantly write something in

2324
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:56,830
English,
you know,

2325
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,320
half moon villa above it is.
He's picking it up.

2326
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:04,690
Please let her know we're not gonna.
We're not going for spelling for a half

2327
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,660
to right here.
You know,

2328
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,090
there's places where you have to um,
like in,

2329
01:31:08,091 --> 01:31:12,210
in Quebec and come back.
You have to write in French like you

2330
01:31:12,211 --> 01:31:14,070
have,
you have to have laws.

2331
01:31:14,071 --> 01:31:16,320
We have to write things in French.
Gotcha.

2332
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:17,580
You can't just do it.
You can't go.

2333
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,190
I don't think you can.
I don't think it's allowed.

2334
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,500
I think Rebecca is,
they're very,

2335
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:25,620
they're,
they're clinging strong to their French

2336
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:28,200
heritage,
which I completely understand because

2337
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:30,960
they,
they mean they have a long history of

2338
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:33,570
French speaking people living in Quebec.
Yeah.

2339
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:36,000
No,
it's a really unusual part of Canada.

2340
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,310
And a lot of people don't understand.
You think of Canadians like,

2341
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,400
uh,
you take off a little,

2342
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,100
Eh,
what is this about?

2343
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,650
You know,
that's not Montreal.

2344
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:45,780
Montreal is very much like a European
city.

2345
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:47,700
It's really interesting in that regard.
Yeah.

2346
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:49,650
Canada,
I like Canada.

2347
01:31:49,651 --> 01:31:52,710
I've never had a bad experience in
Canada doing shows or I feel like the

2348
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:55,350
people up there or there,
I,

2349
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,670
you know,
it feels like it's like,

2350
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:57,913
you know,
I don't want to.

2351
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,060
This isn't diminishing Canada,
but there's like a component of it's

2352
01:32:01,061 --> 01:32:03,170
like America.
But like people would just seem like

2353
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,140
friendlier.
Like I think about that with Chicago.

2354
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:07,340
Like I just did gigs in Chicago and it's
like chicken.

2355
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,640
I was like New York,
it's like this big dirty,

2356
01:32:09,641 --> 01:32:11,710
smelly city.
But everyone there is nice because

2357
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:14,390
they're from the mid,
like they're just nicer pa.

2358
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:19,300
It's interesting like there they're
friendly and they and they like say hi

2359
01:32:19,301 --> 01:32:21,250
to you.
And we went over this on a recent

2360
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:22,270
podcast that Canon has.

2361
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:26,380
So few people.
There's actually 36 million people in

2362
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:29,050
Canada.
Thirty 9 million people in California.

2363
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,750
Jesus,
clearly entire country of Canada has

2364
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:36,400
less people than just the state will.
Australia has a but like $25 million

2365
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:39,280
people and it's as big as the
continental United States,

2366
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:41,900
but a lot of it's uninhabitable though.
Was challenged.

2367
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:44,980
Dangerous as fuck my friends go to Adam
Green trees.

2368
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:48,160
Uh,
my friend Adam Green tree on instagram.

2369
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,800
Adam.green.
Tree bowhunting.

2370
01:32:50,801 --> 01:32:53,410
I think it is a fucking snake to
Australia.

2371
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:55,210
So dangerous.
He lives into Australia there.

2372
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,200
Always trying to get me to go there.
A fucking snake literally ate a snake.

2373
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:04,230
It's own size and he had it and couldn't
swallow it and died because of this.

2374
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,760
So look,
this is a snake crawling out of a snake.

2375
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:09,580
It's own size.
See that snake's mouth shit?

2376
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:12,580
Yeah.
So a fucking snake ate a snake.

2377
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:16,000
It's own size.
And he filmed the one snake that tried

2378
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:16,900
to eat it dying.

2379
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,020
And then the other one wiggles out of
its fucking body.

2380
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,820
Whoa.
Like what in the hell,

2381
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:24,460
man?
I mean that is the craziest Shit I've

2382
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:27,220
ever seen in my life.
You want to talk about a hard scrabble

2383
01:33:27,221 --> 01:33:29,230
world when he first put it up,
I thought,

2384
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,150
oh,
is that a skin thought?

2385
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,043
It was.
No.

2386
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:34,900
That's a full ass fucking snake at
eight.

2387
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:38,020
Another snake that is essentially the
same size as it.

2388
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,970
That's insane.
If someone pulling it out or how.

2389
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,170
I think it's.
I think it's just coming out.

2390
01:33:44,171 --> 01:33:44,951
Yeah.
Died.

2391
01:33:44,951 --> 01:33:46,380
Trying to eat it.
It's this one.

2392
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,680
Is the other one dead though?
No.

2393
01:33:47,681 --> 01:33:48,750
The other one's pulling.
I.

2394
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,740
I don't.
I can't tell if someone's pulling it

2395
01:33:50,741 --> 01:33:51,910
out.
I don't think it is.

2396
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:54,580
It might be.
That's crazy.

2397
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:56,710
I've never been to Australia.
Oh,

2398
01:33:56,711 --> 01:33:58,360
there it is.
There's another is another picture of

2399
01:33:58,361 --> 01:33:58,601
it.
See,

2400
01:33:58,601 --> 01:33:59,470
there it is right there.

2401
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:05,980
The stuff of nightmares.
I killed a snake in the yard gate this

2402
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:09,130
morning and as it died,
a snake came out of it's mouth.

2403
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,100
Let me repeat.
A snake came out its mouth.

2404
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:17,950
Holy Shit.
Have you never been to Australia?

2405
01:34:17,980 --> 01:34:18,940
Oh yeah.
I've been a few times.

2406
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:19,900
I love it.
I love it.

2407
01:34:19,901 --> 01:34:21,070
There.
Australia is awesome.

2408
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,140
It really is.
All the deadliest stuff in the world.

2409
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:28,141
Is there even a way like their shells on
the beach and like,

2410
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,670
Eh,
they don't pick up those shells,

2411
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:32,380
you know,
like there's always a little bit you'll

2412
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:35,460
come out there and kill ya if that Sam
gets underneath your skin,

2413
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,730
it'll kill you.
My,

2414
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:37,660
yeah,
that's all it is.

2415
01:34:37,661 --> 01:34:39,230
All date yet,
you know,

2416
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:41,380
like you did like,
it's crazy.

2417
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,030
But they have just.
Schools have these jellyfish.

2418
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,240
They'll just murder you instantly just
touching you.

2419
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:50,230
You're dead.
You're dead jellyfish.

2420
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:54,070
It's crazy for like in the springtime,
people open up their barbecues or

2421
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:56,950
whatever.
There's always like black widow spiders,

2422
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,650
shit.
And um,

2423
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,483
and like,
you know,

2424
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,710
spiders that can kill you.
Here's another one.

2425
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:05,740
There's a video.
Look up a spider killing a brown snake

2426
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:11,030
because it's evil snake the brown snake
in Australia.

2427
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:12,170
Again,
by two you're dead.

2428
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:16,700
Dead is fine.
And then the spider kills the fucking

2429
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:19,040
snake.
Like an evil spider snake.

2430
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:23,030
It's like what is going on in that part
of the world?

2431
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,970
And what's really fascinating about that
part of the world is they didn't really

2432
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:30,710
have animals there other than like
Kangaroos and wallabies and shit.

2433
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:33,350
There's a lot of the animals that they
have there were important.

2434
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:36,920
Well they are also one of those
countries that did that thing where they

2435
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:40,730
were being overrun by a certain plant
and then they put like rabbits out there

2436
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:42,280
to eat the plant and then the rabbits
went,

2437
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,213
went rampant.

2438
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:49,100
Fox is to get the rabbit and the Fox is
fucked them up in different cat cats.

2439
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:51,470
Like the,
they tried to fix shit,

2440
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,890
you know,
and they made a disaster out.

2441
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,090
Did you hear about the uh,
the thing in the Galapagos Islands with

2442
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:57,680
the goats?
Goats?

2443
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,120
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2444
01:35:59,130 --> 01:35:59,581
Yeah.
Yeah,

2445
01:35:59,581 --> 01:36:01,100
yeah.
It's the same kind of thing.

2446
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,980
Exactly.
Try to like manipulate the environment,

2447
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:04,960
the environment.
Like there it is.

2448
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:10,040
So this fucking spider is closing in on
this evil snake and that that's how

2449
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:15,041
crazy or spider webs that you caught it.
You can't even see the web and it's so

2450
01:36:15,231 --> 01:36:19,580
strong that it's containing this snake.
I mean I just got him by the head too,

2451
01:36:19,581 --> 01:36:21,380
like he knows how to contain it.
Oh yeah.

2452
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:23,480
He's moving in on him.
He's like closer,

2453
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:25,530
closer.
Who I'm trying to eat you.

2454
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,133
Alright.
What's that?

2455
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,000
I can't show this video on youtube.
Oh,

2456
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:29,950
okay.
Don't worry.

2457
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:30,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2458
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:34,140
All our nature videos when every time we
try to show a nature video,

2459
01:36:34,141 --> 01:36:36,630
we get yanked off youtube.
But for the people want to watch it

2460
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:38,820
because people have rights.
They own it.

2461
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,280
They own the video and they want all the
hits and I get it.

2462
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:42,520
So what is the name of the video

2463
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:44,790
people can.
This one actually got one version?

2464
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:46,500
I tried to find it got taken down off
youtube.

2465
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:50,100
It said for breaking youtube guidelines
for a graphic content.

2466
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,450
Well,
what does it say?

2467
01:36:51,451 --> 01:36:54,020
Redback spider attacks that again?
Yeah.

2468
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:56,380
Redback spider attacks and kills Brown
snake.

2469
01:36:56,381 --> 01:36:59,050
I just typed in Brown,
spider kills Brown snakes.

2470
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:00,490
I,
uh,

2471
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,950
I,
I had that happen to me with my nightly

2472
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:04,880
show.
Gets canceled.

2473
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,320
Like quickly cut my real and my best
stuff.

2474
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,510
Stuff.
I put it on Youtube.

2475
01:37:08,511 --> 01:37:08,990
I'm like,
Eh,

2476
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,590
whatever.
People,

2477
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,850
maybe it'll live there.
People will see it.

2478
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,820
An hour later,
Viacom flight.

2479
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,390
I was like,
you guys are such assholes.

2480
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:19,160
Just cancel the show.
I can't even have it under youtube,

2481
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:21,290
vimeo.
And then through my,

2482
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,690
uh,
other than through my website,

2483
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,300
like it's,
it's funny how quick they are though,

2484
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:28,580
a new contact Viacom's since you were an
employee and get permission,

2485
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,380
I don't know,
I mean you to go through proper

2486
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:32,120
channels.
It just seemed like a lot of,

2487
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:34,520
a lot of work.
I get it though because this is the

2488
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:35,420
wild,
wild west.

2489
01:37:35,421 --> 01:37:39,260
I mean we have a lot of websites that
are taking our clips from this podcast

2490
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:41,750
and they put it up and then they put
advertises on it and then they make

2491
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:42,080
money.

2492
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,140
They're making money off it.
Yeah.

2493
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:43,740
Yeah.
It's,

2494
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:46,100
it's,
it's really weird right now because

2495
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:48,560
they're trying to figure out what's
legal and what's not legal to do.

2496
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:52,160
Like there's entire channels that are
just dedicated to this podcast and then

2497
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:54,830
they take clips from this podcast and
they make money off of it.

2498
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:58,200
It's real sketchy.
And then there's websites that now are

2499
01:37:58,201 --> 01:38:00,630
popping up that have taken clips off the
podcast.

2500
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:03,540
They put them on their website and then
they have pop up ads and Google ads all

2501
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:06,300
over their website.
So the only content that they have is

2502
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:09,620
content that I've created,
but yet they're making money off it so I

2503
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,100
get with.
But to me it's like,

2504
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:15,000
well you canceled the show,
so obviously you're not making money on

2505
01:38:15,001 --> 01:38:15,631
it,
but they are.

2506
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:18,010
They're going to sell it somewhere.
They'll definitely sell it someone.

2507
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:18,960
But the nightly show.

2508
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:20,430
Yeah.
Well there's nothing to sell it because

2509
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:24,390
they to every episode they have,
they'll sell those episodes 100 percent

2510
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,150
and plus if anybody wants to use them in
something,

2511
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,100
do you want to use one of those clips?
They'll have it.

2512
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:30,780
It's intellectual property.
I get it.

2513
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,090
I mean how much do they spell it?
Here's the other thing,

2514
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:35,730
if you do a show for a year and a half
and it gets canceled,

2515
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,670
they lost a fuck load of much.
They sure did 100 percent.

2516
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,540
So they were like,
look,

2517
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:43,470
we're going to figure out a way to stop
this bleeding and then to just try to

2518
01:38:43,471 --> 01:38:45,810
patch up something.
There's no way around it.

2519
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:46,170
Nelson

2520
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,370
just happening.
It's going on.

2521
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:50,400
Actually right now.
Youtube is going to be putting tv shows

2522
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:52,470
on youtube,
like they're going to make some sort of

2523
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:56,130
deal where you're gonna be paying less
than you pay for direct TV or Hulu.

2524
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:59,610
You're gonna be able to get TV shows
just like you're getting now and other

2525
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:01,140
services directly on you

2526
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:02,690
two.
Is that red too though?

2527
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,210
Is that going to be a cheaper version
than you?

2528
01:39:05,210 --> 01:39:06,620
To Brad?
Because Youtube Red's about nine,

2529
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:07,191
nine,
$9 a month.

2530
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,720
It's like the same price as Netflix

2531
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:09,401
and.
Okay,

2532
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:12,250
so you're saying like current television
shows that are out now

2533
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,400
is literally happening right now.
Like it says,

2534
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:16,470
that's inevitable.
That's inevitable.

2535
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:17,650
That makes sense.

2536
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:19,190
Jimmy Kimmel and cold bear will be able
to.

2537
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:23,100
Something like that's death.
No,

2538
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:25,580
this is the fucking death bell I'd be
happening right now.

2539
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:27,590
Is the death bell to the networks,
right.

2540
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:31,200
They're climbing
this.

2541
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:33,950
This is going to be historic,
this kind of shit,

2542
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,140
because he was going to be no reason to
have television.

2543
01:39:36,141 --> 01:39:40,160
Now if once this happens,
they will literally be no reason to have

2544
01:39:40,161 --> 01:39:42,680
television if this becomes universal.
Agreed.

2545
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,100
Yeah.
Except for sporting events like you want

2546
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:47,000
to watch the basketball game starts at
seven,

2547
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:49,610
you got to watch it.
They're like tv might become the live

2548
01:39:49,611 --> 01:39:50,930
sports network.
Yeah,

2549
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,420
that's.
I mean that's really all you need and

2550
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:54,040
news maybe news.
I mean it's,

2551
01:39:54,041 --> 01:39:55,910
it's,
it's very similar to the model of what

2552
01:39:55,911 --> 01:39:58,730
you're doing with the podcast.
It's like you drop the podcast and then

2553
01:39:58,731 --> 01:40:00,050
people listen to it when they want to
listen to it.

2554
01:40:00,110 --> 01:40:03,290
Look at this.
Youtube reveals viewers watch a billion

2555
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:08,290
hours of video a day as firm prepares to
unveil it's unplugged TV service.

2556
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:10,610
Wow.
Well,

2557
01:40:10,611 --> 01:40:13,340
once they make a deal with networks like
that,

2558
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:15,170
man,
fucking hey,

2559
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:17,330
but that's really interesting for all
those people,

2560
01:40:17,331 --> 01:40:20,210
like the Poodie pies and the Philip
Defranco's and all these people that

2561
01:40:20,211 --> 01:40:23,090
have shows on youtube,
it's going to blow them up even bigger

2562
01:40:23,091 --> 01:40:26,960
because they're essentially now on a
network because the network is just is

2563
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:30,200
just as well connected as Jimmy Kimmel
is now.

2564
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,260
So in other words,
you're watching Kobe or on youtube and

2565
01:40:32,261 --> 01:40:34,700
then the next thing that comes up is the
rory Albany's show.

2566
01:40:34,701 --> 01:40:37,220
You're fucking sitting there smoking
weed in your underwear.

2567
01:40:37,221 --> 01:40:38,770
Your girl's underwear.
My ladies,

2568
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,880
ladies,
ladies boxes.

2569
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:42,110
Yeah.
Your wife's yelling at you in the

2570
01:40:42,111 --> 01:40:42,944
background.

2571
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,460
I'm on TV.
It says my.

2572
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:51,580
This is my.
This is my show shot up that says this

2573
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,130
is how I live.
I'm taking it back.

2574
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:56,590
Yeah.
They got to fix that.

2575
01:40:56,591 --> 01:40:59,410
We'd probably New York.
How's New York still not have legal

2576
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:00,244
weed?
I don't know.

2577
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,730
It's crazy.
What is going on now and put Batman.

2578
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:04,780
That's one thing I've got to say about
Denver because it's not.

2579
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:06,880
You don't even need.
You don't need to hear anymore.

2580
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,190
You don't need to.
You could just get as recreational here.

2581
01:41:09,191 --> 01:41:12,210
Now
we can just walk anywhere.

2582
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:14,950
I didn't know that dude.
We have a photo of a photo that I have

2583
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:17,590
to put up on the wall of the moment that
we found out.

2584
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:21,120
Bert Kreischer.
We we're doing a podcast during the no

2585
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:23,010
idea and we did an end of the world
podcast.

2586
01:41:23,011 --> 01:41:26,020
It was me,
Bill Byrd Dug Stan hope.

2587
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,550
Bert Kreischer,
a bunch of people,

2588
01:41:27,551 --> 01:41:32,320
and we were onstage in the comedy store.
The moment that we'd passed recreational

2589
01:41:32,321 --> 01:41:35,650
weed pass in California and Bert
Kreischer takes his shirt off and he's

2590
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:38,800
swinging his shirt in front of the crowd
and the whole crowds got their arms up

2591
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:40,870
in the air and they're going crazy.
I had no idea

2592
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,810
crush that.
That actually wasn't the exact moment.

2593
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:47,140
That was an exciting moment of the show.
When that actual moment happened,

2594
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:49,120
I was sitting next to Burton.
He didn't have his shirt off yet.

2595
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:50,870
I have a photo of that moment when
everyone is like,

2596
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:52,820
someone told me that,
but I was going to ignore that,

2597
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:54,210
but it's okay.
I mean it's a really.

2598
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:55,750
It looks.
It was pretty close to happen right

2599
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:56,584
afterwards,
but

2600
01:41:56,660 --> 01:42:00,070
dammit,
fuck over there and

2601
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:03,590
that is the fact,
but that makes it even.

2602
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:05,450
I really didn't know that.
I thought you still needed a jerk.

2603
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:06,430
No card.
No,

2604
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:09,490
you can totally get it.
I don't think that you can't smoke in

2605
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:11,350
public.
You can't just be smoking.

2606
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:12,580
Is it like Denver?
You walk in,

2607
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:15,010
they can buy edibles.
Because I had that experience I had in

2608
01:42:15,011 --> 01:42:18,580
Denver was unreal saying th.
They're called bud tenders and that

2609
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:20,980
alerus it's so jamie.
Tell about that place that you went to

2610
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:22,840
yesterday.
It's like the genius bar.

2611
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:24,300
Is that a place like.
It's actually,

2612
01:42:24,301 --> 01:42:26,370
it's on Santa Monica and you're like
crescent heights.

2613
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,520
There's most of the stores here and even
like in Denver you can't see anything

2614
01:42:29,521 --> 01:42:32,640
you can't see inside from the street.
This is like big glass windows.

2615
01:42:32,641 --> 01:42:36,570
You can look right inside and it's like
an apple store tables with ipads on them

2616
01:42:36,571 --> 01:42:39,480
with all the different strains on it.
A little jar to like look inside.

2617
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:42,660
You can smell it and you walk up to the
thing and they'd bring it out from the

2618
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:45,030
back like your race or your quarter if
you remember the name of this joint.

2619
01:42:45,031 --> 01:42:46,190
It's called Med men,
I believe it was.

2620
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:47,610
What was Med med men

2621
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:50,600
like?
Mad men or something like that.

2622
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:55,390
There's a cool store where they have it
set up in Denver.

2623
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:57,080
It's like you're getting a little line
and then they're like,

2624
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:59,830
next place and then you go up to La.
She's like,

2625
01:42:59,831 --> 01:43:01,870
hi,
what are you looking to do?

2626
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,470
You know?
You're like,

2627
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:03,640
oh,
I guess get high,

2628
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,830
you know,
and then she helps you through your

2629
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:09,070
journey.
I got my first medical marijuana card,

2630
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:13,120
I think it was in like 2000 or something
like that.

2631
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:15,860
I forget what year it was,
but I used to go to a place called

2632
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,280
Inglewood wellness center.
It was the only place where you could

2633
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:21,490
get legal weed that I knew about because
of my connections.

2634
01:43:21,491 --> 01:43:25,750
I would go down to Inglewood de Hood,
d a h o d do it.

2635
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:30,340
And I was going there for a while until
one of the guys that was working there

2636
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:31,390
got shot.

2637
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,800
They got robbed and he got shot in the
stomach while,

2638
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:37,690
um,
while I was a patron there,

2639
01:43:37,691 --> 01:43:41,020
I wasn't there the day that it happened,
but it was the place that I was going.

2640
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:41,790
I was like,
okay,

2641
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:45,460
looks like I'm getting my wheat in a
different spot now called doc man,

2642
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,313
because they,
you know,

2643
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,730
they were getting,
they weren't allowed to buy things with

2644
01:43:48,731 --> 01:43:51,230
credit cards.
So you would go there and you would have

2645
01:43:51,231 --> 01:43:53,150
to use cash and I guess,
you know,

2646
01:43:53,151 --> 01:43:55,160
they had a bunch of cash on hand and
people getting shot.

2647
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:57,260
I'm going to actually,
if they were allowed to use credit cards

2648
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,880
back then,
but now you can.

2649
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,890
I mean now it's essentially like full
out,

2650
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:02,840
but in Denver,
um,

2651
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:07,100
they're having real issues still because
they won't let them deposit money the

2652
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:10,760
same way.
Like you have to get cash for a lot of

2653
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:11,120
the places.

2654
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:15,590
We're only allowing them to get cash and
then you have to bring this cash to safe

2655
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:18,190
deposit boxes and stuff.
And it was like,

2656
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:20,750
it was like real sketchy.
They were hiring Merck's,

2657
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,790
they were hiring mercenaries to carry
the cash around.

2658
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:27,130
So they have these former,
a shit.

2659
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:32,270
Karen [inaudible] walking around with
bags of cash worried about being robbed

2660
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:35,230
and people did get robbed.
That's crazy sketchy stuff.

2661
01:44:35,231 --> 01:44:36,080
I mean,
my experience there,

2662
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,810
it was like,
because I edibles were something I never

2663
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,580
really liked.
I did them once when I was like in

2664
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,680
college,
like the end of college and I was in

2665
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:45,050
Amsterdam and I ate space cake.
You know,

2666
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,570
and it was great.
I had a great time and then the next day

2667
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,430
we were leaving,
I was with my friends and we were

2668
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:53,540
getting on a train to Brussels and I and
I ate two space cakes because I was like

2669
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:54,530
yesterday,
space cake.

2670
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:55,463
Really,
man,

2671
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,740
dude.
I was on a train for like four hours in

2672
01:44:57,741 --> 01:45:00,190
a tunnel,
like a Gimme.

2673
01:45:00,191 --> 01:45:01,630
I'll just look at trade.
Yeah.

2674
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:04,130
I vividly remembered.
I was like,

2675
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,240
I will never do this again.
And then when,

2676
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,170
but now they're like,
it's portioned out.

2677
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:10,490
You know,
like when you go to Denver,

2678
01:45:10,491 --> 01:45:14,430
she's like one gummy bear dry,
like 10 milligrams of marijuana try.

2679
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:17,240
I think they have a rule now.
They sell them to you in these,

2680
01:45:17,241 --> 01:45:18,650
in when I was in Denver,
um,

2681
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:22,330
I bought these tubes and the tubes,
10 gummy bears.

2682
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:24,370
Yeah.
And each one was 10 milligrams.

2683
01:45:24,371 --> 01:45:25,910
Yep.
And so if you eat the whole one,

2684
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,740
you go to space,
the whole tube.

2685
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:30,590
He goes space or you can do it like one
company at a time.

2686
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:33,050
You actually weren't gum gum drops.
They weren't bears.

2687
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:34,280
Yeah.
But that's what it is.

2688
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:36,240
That's exactly what that night I was out
with went chappelle.

2689
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:38,460
I had a pocket full of those.
I gave you one of those,

2690
01:45:38,461 --> 01:45:41,120
so in those tubes I had a bunch of them
sitting back there.

2691
01:45:41,121 --> 01:45:42,000
I'm like,
I'm not going to take these.

2692
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:43,940
Yeah,
and I also had a.

2693
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:46,880
The little caramels to those things are
good.

2694
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,250
You just got to get them from a reliable
source.

2695
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:52,310
You get them from a reliable source and
they're consistent.

2696
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:54,740
Then you're okay,
but you take some big chances when you

2697
01:45:54,741 --> 01:45:56,200
take an edible from somebody.
He'll kidding.

2698
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:57,830
I never do it.
I want people like,

2699
01:45:57,831 --> 01:45:58,641
oh,
I made brownies.

2700
01:45:58,641 --> 01:45:59,790
I'm like,
fuck dude.

2701
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:02,210
Good luck.
Especially as somebody who makes them

2702
01:46:02,211 --> 01:46:07,211
themselves,
you anytime anyone makes something

2703
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:08,630
themselves for some reason.
I'm always like,

2704
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,000
kitchen look like,
you know,

2705
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:14,420
I went to a Chinese restaurant kitchen
the other day.

2706
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:15,800
It was a really good restaurant.
I'm like,

2707
01:46:15,801 --> 01:46:17,720
where's your bathroom?
They go in the back and I walked through

2708
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:19,370
this hallway and past the kitchen.

2709
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:19,940
I was like,
well,

2710
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,860
not eating here again ever.
Jesus.

2711
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,720
That happens a lot of comedy clubs,
right?

2712
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:26,830
You go through the kitchen to get to the
green room and then they're like,

2713
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:27,630
what do you want it for?
Food?

2714
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:29,060
You're like,
anything deep fried,

2715
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:34,800
something that's been murdered.
All the fucking bugs that possibly could

2716
01:46:34,881 --> 01:46:37,560
be torched away by boiling oil.
Yes,

2717
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:38,890
exactly.
Yeah.

2718
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:40,790
Yeah.
And then you're just eating shit.

2719
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,560
When you go on the road,
do you bring food?

2720
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:44,030
Like do you bring your healthy shit with
you?

2721
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:44,740
Well,
if the,

2722
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:48,340
if the hotel room has one of them little
mini refrigerators at,

2723
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:52,500
I go to a whole foods and I'll get like
Kombucha and healthy food and snacks and

2724
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:54,420
stuff like that.
But I'm pretty strict with my diet.

2725
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,700
I don't know,
just don't eat too much shit.

2726
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:59,760
I will allow.
I do what I call it 80 slash 20 diet

2727
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,100
again,
I give myself 80 percent healthy food

2728
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:05,340
and 20 percent of the time I'll fuck off
so I'll fuck off like one day a week.

2729
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,800
So one thing you want,
I'll eat cheeseburgers,

2730
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:10,020
fries a,
a milkshake,

2731
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:12,790
but it's only like one day a week and I
just,

2732
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,870
it's just not worth it.
I've done it too many times where I've

2733
01:47:15,871 --> 01:47:18,840
eaten bad on the road and then by the
time Sunday rolls around and you're

2734
01:47:18,841 --> 01:47:19,591
like,
oh,

2735
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:22,140
the road is tough though.
It's hard because you have to like,

2736
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:23,430
do you bring vitamins?
Yeah.

2737
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,890
You do?
Yeah,

2738
01:47:24,891 --> 01:47:26,130
I do.
I bring vitamins,

2739
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:29,220
I bring probiotics.
My company on it has this thing called

2740
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:32,070
total gut health.
So I bring these packets of probiotics.

2741
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:35,460
I think that's super important and it's
all live stuff that exists off the

2742
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:38,460
substrate that's in the capsule so that
you can actually get real live

2743
01:47:38,461 --> 01:47:42,540
probiotics and then I eat probiotics to
all that stuff is really important if

2744
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,510
you want to maintain your immune system.
Yeah.

2745
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,960
Yeah.
So that stuff.

2746
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,240
And then just that's what I've been
struggling with salads.

2747
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:51,450
I get like I get like right now,
like I'm not sick,

2748
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:53,490
but like I always have like I'm always
fighting off,

2749
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:57,390
got a sore throat or you know,
because I'm on planes to work out on the

2750
01:47:57,391 --> 01:47:58,390
road.
Uh,

2751
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,520
not really.
That's the thing too,

2752
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,470
man.
GotTa Force yourself somewhat about

2753
01:48:01,471 --> 01:48:03,270
being on the road.
It's like I'm just laying in bed,

2754
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:06,690
eat sandwiches,
like don't you feel a little drained

2755
01:48:06,691 --> 01:48:08,190
from the flight itself?
It was like,

2756
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:09,840
oh,
gross.

2757
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:10,440
Yeah.
And then,

2758
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,221
uh,
yeah.

2759
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:12,031
And it's like,
by the way,

2760
01:48:12,031 --> 01:48:14,940
that's the other thing too,
like with America right now,

2761
01:48:14,941 --> 01:48:17,670
like I never posted a picture of food in
my entire life.

2762
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:22,200
I posted a photo of a Jimmy John's
sandwich when I was in Chicago just

2763
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:23,490
because we don't have Jimmy John's in
New York.

2764
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:24,180
So I was like,
oh great.

2765
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:25,040
Jimmy John's,
I lived here.

2766
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:27,820
People were like,
you can't eat Jimmy John's he's at

2767
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,660
today.
He's the Guy Jimmy John's into hunter.

2768
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:31,290
And he said,
Nah,

2769
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:32,130
I'm like,
Jimmy,

2770
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:33,630
John's a bad guy.
Apparently.

2771
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,010
Apparently John Do,
I guess,

2772
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:36,300
I don't know.
It's find out.

2773
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,730
He's like,
goes and hunts like big game,

2774
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:41,310
big.
He's a big game like elephants and shit,

2775
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:42,510
that kind of stuff.
Let's pull it up.

2776
01:48:42,511 --> 01:48:43,680
Let's find out what he's doing.
And He,

2777
01:48:43,681 --> 01:48:44,670
uh,
and he,

2778
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:46,380
uh,
and then people were going and then

2779
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:50,230
somebody goes and he's a Republican.
I go look at the big game hunting thing

2780
01:48:50,231 --> 01:48:51,730
I'll give you,
but if I,

2781
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,790
if I can't eat food made by a
Republican,

2782
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:56,550
which good luck finding a good steak,
what you're talking about.

2783
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,880
Think those ranchers are,
but I love that people think that that's

2784
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,770
evil being a Republican.
It's like what?

2785
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:03,240
It's crazy,
Ron.

2786
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:04,074
Paul wasn't evil.

2787
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,890
There's a lot of people that are
republicans that would fit into a lot of

2788
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,710
people's ideas of what would be a
reasonable politician.

2789
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:13,830
It's just we think of Republican.
We think of the right wrist of the right

2790
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:15,780
wing.
The hardest of the hard sell.

2791
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,410
I mean,
to me the biggest issue is,

2792
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:18,660
is the environment,
you know,

2793
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,560
that's huge.
Well he just farming and human and

2794
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,780
people having rights.
Yeah.

2795
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:25,230
That's my biggest fear about right now
is like gay people.

2796
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,330
Like I'm worried that they're gonna be
able to get married,

2797
01:49:27,331 --> 01:49:29,610
you know,
like the word gay people aren't gonna be

2798
01:49:29,611 --> 01:49:31,410
able to get married,
pull up to that microphone a little bit

2799
01:49:31,411 --> 01:49:33,660
closer there.
I'm worried that like that could go

2800
01:49:33,661 --> 01:49:34,500
away,
you know,

2801
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,220
like.
Yeah,

2802
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,240
I think that can happen.
Well,

2803
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:38,130
I mean,
I think gay people would be psyched,

2804
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:39,370
like,
hey,

2805
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,370
that bitch,
I'm tired of paying.

2806
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:44,370
I just feel like rights to me are the
one thing that you can't fuck with,

2807
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:46,230
you know,
and that's one.

2808
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:48,400
Right.
I just hope I wish they'd make straight

2809
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:51,160
marriage illegal.
Jimmy John's Gore may sandwiches.

2810
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:52,330
Whoa.
He kills leopards.

2811
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,820
Okay.
Well the ram on the upper left hand

2812
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:57,910
corner got no problem with that because
you eat rams and they're delicious.

2813
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:01,510
They're sheep and then also you spend a
lot of money to hunt one of those things

2814
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:04,510
and that money directly goes to
conservation.

2815
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:06,550
The bear.
That's a grizzly bear.

2816
01:50:06,551 --> 01:50:08,380
It's a brown bear.
You don't eat those,

2817
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,190
but you do have to kill some of those.
There was an issue in North America

2818
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:14,290
where they have too many grizzly bears
in certain areas.

2819
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:15,970
Like in Alaska,
you actually have to kill.

2820
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,850
You have to kill a certain amount of
them in order to keep the Moose

2821
01:50:18,851 --> 01:50:22,220
population stable because the bears eat
all the moose calves.

2822
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:24,880
What are you assuming that that's the
brown bear?

2823
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:26,140
No,
that's definitely a brown bear and that

2824
01:50:26,141 --> 01:50:28,270
looks like Alaska.
I'm assuming that's what that is.

2825
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,340
Well,
most places that you killed brown bears,

2826
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:32,500
if it is legal,
if he's killing that bear legally,

2827
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,300
which I assume it is because he's taken
a photo of it.

2828
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,370
You have to have.
I mean there's.

2829
01:50:36,410 --> 01:50:38,950
There's.
You spend so much money to kill those

2830
01:50:38,951 --> 01:50:41,890
things and that money directly goes to
conservation.

2831
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:45,790
It's a real catch 22 because the only
reason why those things are alive and

2832
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:50,140
exist in high populations and aren't
decimated and then their wildlife

2833
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:53,440
habitat is protected,
especially protecting habitat and

2834
01:50:53,441 --> 01:50:56,500
wetlands for birds,
for migrating birds.

2835
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,450
All that stuff comes from conservation
money,

2836
01:50:58,451 --> 01:51:01,570
which all comes from hunting.
Hunting is absolutely the number one

2837
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:05,830
biggest source of conservation for
wildlife in the United States of America

2838
01:51:05,831 --> 01:51:07,960
by far.
No debate about it,

2839
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:10,720
but then you see them in the upper right
hand corner has got a leopard.

2840
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:14,920
Okay.
That's real tough to defend because he's

2841
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:17,530
not eating that fucking leopard.
And you shooting that liberty to

2842
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:19,090
shooting it for a trophy.
Yeah,

2843
01:51:19,091 --> 01:51:22,450
I mean it's just so fucked up to me that
anybody would do okay,

2844
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:27,100
but the deer in the law in the middle,
low bottom zero problem with that food.

2845
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,750
Not only that,
$2,

2846
01:51:28,751 --> 01:51:31,090
million car accidents in the United
States every year,

2847
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:31,841
excuse me,
one point,

2848
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:35,100
5 million car accidents.
The United States every year from people

2849
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:40,110
hitting deer and 200 people die because
of accidents involving people hitting

2850
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:44,680
deer with cars and unless you want to
bring in wolves and mountain lions and

2851
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:47,920
overpopulate the suburbs with them,
you're going to have a problem with deer

2852
01:51:47,921 --> 01:51:50,350
populations unless you have hunters.
That's just a fact.

2853
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:54,370
And in places like the Hamptons,
they're actually hiring snipers to go

2854
01:51:54,371 --> 01:51:56,410
out and shoot them.
He killed a fucking rhino that's so

2855
01:51:56,411 --> 01:51:57,141
fucked.
They killed it.

2856
01:51:57,141 --> 01:51:59,690
Elephant look at it with a double thumbs
up with an elephant will.

2857
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,320
Yeah.
So I found out about that and I can't

2858
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:03,670
have sandwiches anymore,
you know?

2859
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,640
Oh,
we killed a fucking giraffe and he just

2860
01:52:06,641 --> 01:52:09,880
kills everything.
First he killed a rhino.

2861
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:11,410
Is that alliance?
Yup.

2862
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,430
Jesus Christ.

2863
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,240
It's all real sketchy stuff,
man.

2864
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,030
It's real sketchy stuff because in
Africa,

2865
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:24,060
which there's a great documentary that
Louis Theroux did a about African

2866
01:52:24,581 --> 01:52:27,370
hunting farms,
these a wildlife sanctuaries that they

2867
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:29,290
have in Africa where they just hunted on
them.

2868
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:32,680
They big high fence operations.
Africa was on the verge.

2869
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:36,010
These animals were on the verge of
extinction just a few decades ago and

2870
01:52:36,011 --> 01:52:38,560
now they're thriving and unheard of
populations,

2871
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,250
but it's only because people are paying
to go over there and hunt them so they

2872
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:44,620
protect these animals and then what's
even more fucked up.

2873
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,970
They use the term poacher all the time.
You know,

2874
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:50,120
these people are poaching.
Most of the time you think of poaching

2875
01:52:50,121 --> 01:52:52,160
you think will.
Poachers are bad because poachers are

2876
01:52:52,161 --> 01:52:54,020
the people that are killing elephants
for their ivory,

2877
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:57,620
that killing rhinos for their horns.
But a lot of what poaching is poor

2878
01:52:57,621 --> 01:52:59,630
people that are just trying to eat
right.

2879
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,040
And you know what they do?
Those poachers,

2880
01:53:01,041 --> 01:53:03,440
they fucking murderer man.
They shoot them onsite.

2881
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,470
So if someone's killing like,
um,

2882
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:07,610
you know,
a black buck or something like that,

2883
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:09,890
one of the,
the game animals that they have the eat,

2884
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,860
they're shooting at these people,
they're shooting and killing them left

2885
01:53:12,861 --> 01:53:13,910
and right.
And that was crazy.

2886
01:53:13,911 --> 01:53:15,590
They're leaving their bodies for the
hyenas to eat.

2887
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:18,270
Did you see the tiger thing that
happened the other day with the,

2888
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,500
with the.
I didn't even understand that when I was

2889
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:22,610
reading about it that they were like,
oh,

2890
01:53:22,611 --> 01:53:23,820
that's a tiger farm.
I'm like,

2891
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:24,673
well,
those.

2892
01:53:25,950 --> 01:53:27,140
That bummed me out,
man.

2893
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:29,360
Well,
people in.

2894
01:53:29,450 --> 01:53:30,830
Do you know this?
This is a fact.

2895
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:33,020
We'll,
we'll close on this because from my last

2896
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:34,250
netflix special,
but it's true.

2897
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,760
There's more tigers in captivity in
Texas than there are in all of the wild

2898
01:53:37,761 --> 01:53:38,594
of the world.

2899
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:39,780
What?
Yeah.

2900
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:44,660
More Tigers in people's backyards.
In private collections in Texas.

2901
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:48,290
Then the rest of the people who own pet
tigers.

2902
01:53:48,350 --> 01:53:50,300
Yep.
Texas has no rules.

2903
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:54,650
Texas is a really fucked up place for
people that think that the government

2904
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:57,320
shouldn't own land.
Like there's a lot of people that think

2905
01:53:57,321 --> 01:53:59,720
that the state,
federal government shouldn't own land

2906
01:53:59,721 --> 01:54:01,790
that should give it to the state.
The problem with that is a state will

2907
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:05,330
then sell it off.
And a good example that is Texas of what

2908
01:54:05,331 --> 01:54:08,090
could happen is Texas has very little
public land.

2909
01:54:08,330 --> 01:54:12,200
Texas is almost all private land,
so I called a lot of the hunting in

2910
01:54:12,201 --> 01:54:15,980
Texas is all on private ranches.
And then these private ranches,

2911
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:17,660
you can kind of do whatever the fuck you
want.

2912
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,880
And they bring in all these animals from
all over the world.

2913
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:20,893
Like there's,
um,

2914
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:25,580
there's a,
an animal called a symitar oryx and Orix

2915
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:26,960
in Africa.

2916
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,780
I think there are Asian animal,
I forget where they're from,

2917
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:33,770
but wherever they're from,
maybe India or wherever they're from,

2918
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,260
they're very endangered.
Not In Texas,

2919
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,290
in Texas is fucking thousands of them.
They're all over the place.

2920
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:42,620
And these ranches.
So you can go and hunt what in its

2921
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:46,340
native country you wouldn't hunt because
there's small populations of them,

2922
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:50,450
but in Texas they encourage hunting of
them because they have overpopulation.

2923
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:52,940
That animal right there,
symitar horned oryx.

2924
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,000
Wow.
So you can go to these places in Texas

2925
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:58,400
and you can fucking shoot those and
they're delicious.

2926
01:54:58,420 --> 01:54:59,930
Where?
What's his name died?

2927
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:01,950
Uh,
a justice.

2928
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:03,800
The Supreme Court with those name.
Oh,

2929
01:55:03,801 --> 01:55:04,700
Yay.
Died.

2930
01:55:04,701 --> 01:55:07,310
They think they lacked dumb little think
they whacked him.

2931
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:09,350
Well,
he died with a pillow on his face.

2932
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:11,690
It was like,
there was,

2933
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,640
it was a little bit of like,
is that what happened?

2934
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:15,520
You know,
in the naked gun when he throws a pillow

2935
01:55:15,521 --> 01:55:16,354
out of them?
Yeah.

2936
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:19,010
Tell you what.
It wasn't even really old.

2937
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:21,110
He was like 70.
Wasn't that old?

2938
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:24,910
He was snoring and his wife.
Just you fucking car.

2939
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,360
I think it was alone enough.
Yeah.

2940
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,160
He probably just had a heart attack.
He was kind of fat.

2941
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:29,930
What was his name?
Justice Scalia.

2942
01:55:29,931 --> 01:55:30,950
Scalia.
Scalia.

2943
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:31,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

2944
01:55:31,731 --> 01:55:34,310
He was kind of a Dick though.
Wasn't always super right wing Guy,

2945
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:34,650
right?
Yeah.

2946
01:55:34,650 --> 01:55:37,730
Well,
but that just right when you look below,

2947
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:39,860
there's the dead with a pillow over his
head.

2948
01:55:39,861 --> 01:55:40,820
Ranch over.
Well,

2949
01:55:40,821 --> 01:55:43,260
he might've put that pillow over his
head because people are talking the

2950
01:55:43,261 --> 01:55:44,040
other room and he wanted to be

2951
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,090
quiet and then he.
Yeah,

2952
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,430
I've put pillows over my head before
people were talking,

2953
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,060
we discovered a judge in bed,
a pillow over his head.

2954
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:53,100
His clothes were unwrinkled,
so then he probably just died.

2955
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,280
30,000 Acre luxury ranch.
El Presidente Day.

2956
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,520
Sweet.
He's 79.

2957
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:01,470
Yeah,
30,000 acres.

2958
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:02,550
Fuck,
that's huge.

2959
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:04,050
Yeah.
So these people would go to these

2960
01:56:04,051 --> 01:56:06,240
ranches and they still do.
They go to these ranches and you can

2961
01:56:06,241 --> 01:56:09,090
hunt wild African animals there.
That's nuts man.

2962
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:10,260
I had no idea.
Yeah.

2963
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:13,140
Well there.
I've never daunted anything.

2964
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:14,220
No.
Yeah.

2965
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:16,980
Would you be interested in doing it?
I would be interested in if I ate it,

2966
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:19,620
that's what I'm saying.
I'm the guy I had no interest in killing

2967
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:21,540
something to,
to do it,

2968
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:23,530
but I eat meat so I always felt like,
well you kind of.

2969
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:27,300
When I was in Australia I spent like
five days on a sheep station,

2970
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:28,350
which like a big sheet for him.

2971
01:56:28,640 --> 01:56:31,230
It was amazing and I was like herding
sheep on a motorcycle.

2972
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:34,560
It was amazing and cool.
So while I was there,

2973
01:56:34,561 --> 01:56:37,440
he slaughtered to sheep and I was there
when he slaughtered them and he like,

2974
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:38,520
Hey,
slow it into my hand.

2975
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:41,160
I like brought them to the thing.
It was like really intense experience.

2976
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,540
But he,
that's what he does.

2977
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:46,050
That's how this got slaughtered on the
shoot him in the head or the neck,

2978
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,120
cut their Mac and then he like hangs
them upside down.

2979
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:50,920
It was like a really intense thing to
say they just shoot them because if they

2980
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,530
shoot them they die instantly.
I don't know why would they cut their.

2981
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:56,220
I don't know what their neck thing seems
so cruel.

2982
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:56,851
Yeah,
it was weird.

2983
01:56:56,851 --> 01:56:59,280
It was me and these like for like
Australia and it's like,

2984
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:00,123
alright,
yeah,

2985
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:01,440
I was just standing there drinking a
beer.

2986
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,251
Like yeah,
totally.

2987
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:05,850
Just cut a cut a sheep snack man.
That's how we do it on long island

2988
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:11,160
was east Hampton where I grew up.
Uh,

2989
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:13,400
we didn't cut any next,
you know,

2990
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:16,510
but I've thought about doing a show
where I take people hunting that I've

2991
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,240
never hunted,
like maybe comics,

2992
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:21,300
but I just don't think it's the right
way to approach hunting.

2993
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:25,530
I just think it's too confusing.
It's too dark and it's also a,

2994
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:29,490
it would take.
It would make content a spectacle to me

2995
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,590
versus a what it is now.
Yeah,

2996
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:33,840
I mean I would go like if I went with
you when I went with people knew what

2997
01:57:33,841 --> 01:57:35,590
they were doing and I,
you know,

2998
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:37,530
I'm going to do it.
I guess.

2999
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:40,170
I don't know.
My problem is my also my hunting time is

3000
01:57:40,171 --> 01:57:41,850
super precious.
I don't get that much of it.

3001
01:57:41,851 --> 01:57:43,110
I don't want to be teaching anybody.

3002
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:45,140
I'm trying to figure it out myself.
Course not.

3003
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:47,970
You go out with guys who were,
who were experts.

3004
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:49,090
Experts for us.
Yeah.

3005
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:50,700
Yeah.
Well I got to wrap this up.

3006
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:51,810
All right.
