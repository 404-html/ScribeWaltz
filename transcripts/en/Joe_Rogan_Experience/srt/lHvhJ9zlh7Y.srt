1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
Already nailing it,
bitches not even turned on the Joe Rogan

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,040
experience podcast,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,710
brought to you by the flashlight.
If you go to Joe Rogan.net

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,740
and click on the link to the flashlight.
I'm trying to do this and I'm trying to 

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,780
tweet at the same time.
This is unprofessional.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,360
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link and enter in the 

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:25,420
code named Rogan,
you'll get 15 percent off the number one

8
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:27,910
sex toy for men and Doug Benson.
If you want one.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,850
I have extras.
I have one for you.

10
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:31,540
It's got your name right.

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,430
Did I tell you what my slogan I came up 
with for the fleshlight?

12
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:35,930
No.
Fuck those things.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,160
Oh,
I get,

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,310
that's good sample.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,780
It's clean.
I like,

16
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,980
I liked the way you think.
Um,

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,810
if you enter in the code name,
Rogan,

18
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,280
you get 15 percent off.
And Brian,

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:48,920
how many of you?

20
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,230
I uh,
I haven't fucked one until recently.

21
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,260
I just went back to fucking one and it 
was nice.

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,290
It was nice.
I don't know why I took the vacation 

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,510
because I went for awhile.
I was spitting up my hands,

24
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,760
making myself have yeast infections and 
all this shit.

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,960
It don't use spit after eating.
Wait a minute.

26
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,570
You've made yourself have a use and I 
think I did.

27
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:14,571
I think I.
I think some mashed potatoes in your 

28
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,600
hand are so lazy with my lotion.
So nasty.

29
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:18,030
You are so nasty.
He spit in your hand.

30
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,980
You gave yourself a yeast infection on 
your.

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,890
Yeah.
Wow.

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,420
From too much breadsticks anyway.
Don't do what he does and clean your 

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,140
flashlight too.
Don't be disgusting.

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,260
No problem.
With like cantaloupes recently where 

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,660
people were dying from like bad 
cantaloupes,

36
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,850
there were fucking bad cantaloupes from 
eating them,

37
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,851
but then I was just wondering,
I was going to extrapolate like what 

38
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:40,851
will happen if you fucked up bad 
cantaloupe.

39
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,820
No kidding.
Right?

40
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,750
Because Cantaloupe is probably the 
nature's backup to the fleshlight,

41
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,180
right?
How many different people do you think?

42
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:53,181
How many?
What are the numbers of people that are 

43
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:53,181
fucked?
Cantaloupes?

44
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:53,181
I think there's bit.
When you're young,

45
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,390
you would try anything.
I mean I fucked pillows and then I sleep

46
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:54,990
on it,
you know,

47
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,991
so it's like hump things.
They'll get elaborate if you want to 

48
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:02,640
carve a correct size hole into a piece 
of fruit.

49
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,890
I,
just out of curiosity,

50
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,980
how many people do you think of fucked 
cantaloupes?

51
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,010
Cantaloupe?
I would say at least two out of 10 

52
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,380
people and I'm like all time numbers as 
it a million,

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,570
half a million people.
Fifty three,

54
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,790
53.
We've gone through it,

55
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:26,151
you know,
I mean a lot of people have probably 

56
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:26,151
looked at the cantaloupe and they were 
drunk and fuck it,

57
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,630
fuck that.
And maybe look for an apple core.

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Couldn't find it or tried to make a 
whole circular hole with a knife and it 

59
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:32,660
didn't work out.
And they're like,

60
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,240
ah,
fuck it.

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,360
But how many people actually went ahead?
Fucked it and came inside the 

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,360
cantaloupe.
I want the numbers.

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm biased because I have.
So I think everyone has,

64
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,150
you know,
you shut a load into account.

65
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,240
I remember I put it in the microwave 
and.

66
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,730
Oh,
that's right.

67
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,300
Nice and hot.
I always used heat too.

68
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,940
I always,
when I think about masturbating,

69
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,400
I have to have heat involved,
but I don't like to live in Ohio.

70
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:59,401
It was freezing all the time.
Have you ever fucked a girl by mistake 

71
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,550
by using the back oil you put on back?
That heats up.

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,610
You accidentally use it for lube to fuck
a girl in the ass.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
Don't do that.

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Ruins it,
and they run to the bathroom crying and 

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,800
my goodness so that,
that hot oil lotions just for your bag.

76
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,140
Don't put it in an asshole.
Don't tell me that.

77
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,090
This is a real story.
It's super real.

78
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,800
I've done it multiple times,
but I say,

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,550
you know,
it's supposedly really nasty is a.

80
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,000
If you fill the tub with champagne,
if a lady gets into it,

81
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,390
it would just burn the shit out of her.
A tutor out over stuff.

82
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,790
Wow.
That's.

83
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,590
That supposedly happened in Natalie Wood
one time.

84
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,790
Oh,
that's funny.

85
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:44,791
I think.
I think Dennis Hopper used to tell this 

86
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:44,791
story.
I bet it's happening.

87
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,910
A lot of hood parties.
You know what I'm saying?

88
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,930
Come on like you don't think Birdman has
parties,

89
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,940
whereas bathtubs full of champagne and 
checks and just climbing in and and 

90
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,130
booty poppin inside the tub filled the 
champion.

91
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,380
Of course they are.
Of course,

92
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,380
we're telling you those girls ladies,
get your kutuchief chucked out,

93
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,190
get some anti yeast infection type 
situation going there.

94
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,730
That's dangerous stuff.
Martinelli's,

95
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,860
sparkling apple.
Do you think that that would probably 

96
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,811
burn also?
Maybe that would like not burn because 

97
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:18,811
it's not alcoholic,
right?

98
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,490
Maybe picking everything up.
Maybe it would just make everything 

99
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:24,490
smell nice.
Oh,

100
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,690
I like that taste.
Maybe it would be good.

101
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,600
It could be a positive and it's just 
apple cider,

102
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,700
right?
Anyway,

103
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,650
that's the fleshlight commercial and go 
get yourself a flashlight.

104
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,920
They're awesome.
To beat on a lot of controversy on this 

105
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:40,920
new commercials.
Joe.

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Yeah.
They go fuck themselves.

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,820
Controversy.
I just.

108
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,370
A lot of people have been tweeting me 
and I didn't know what to tell you.

109
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,920
It's like,
you know,

110
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,610
chill the fuck out.
Commercials took so long.

111
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,470
It's not really commercial,
dude.

112
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:53,770
It's a commercial doing.
Every time.

113
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,890
Every one of them is organic.
Every one of them was just us fucking 

114
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:58,890
around.
We got it out of the way.

115
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,950
It's the best way to do a commercial 
folks.

116
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,050
It's really not that big a deal.
I didn't even know we were doing a 

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,760
commercial pre show chat.
It's fucking entertaining.

118
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,950
Goddammit.
Relax everybody.

119
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,520
It's like what we're trying to do.
Basically just slipping in real quick on

120
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:12,750
you.
What?

121
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,820
Come on.
Just let me get.

122
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,760
Was it a big deal?
Can I do a five second commercial?

123
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Can you recommend somebody?
Somebody made a funny website search 

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,160
like Brian Dot com.
It's hilarious.

125
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,250
Use it for your search needs.
It's pretty awesome.

126
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,270
As a butthole to every search.
He adds the word butthole every time he 

127
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:34,540
searched his things,
so it was like,

128
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,670
what do you think it would be like to 
live in New Orleans?

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
Let's see.
It will once,

130
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:43,321
but whole wells fargo locations,
butthole and it always adds one extra 

131
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:47,500
bottle to all your searches that change 
the ultimate.

132
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,390
No,
you still get mixed in for fun.

133
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,650
You just,
if you get to page 1000,

134
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,140
199,
you might see something fucked up.

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,630
Old Dude name Wells Fargo who bent over 
showing.

136
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,850
You know,
it's funny how that goat see thing.

137
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,300
That guy pulling apart his asshole.
Yeah,

138
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,900
data is the Internet man.
You know,

139
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,580
there's a photo,
um,

140
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,590
I forget somebody,
you know,

141
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,730
was one of those memes and it was a kid 
that was a horrified.

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,020
It was photoshop obviously and right in 
front of this kid's face was the goats.

143
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,700
He asshole.
And it just said,

144
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,900
welcome to the Internet.
I mean,

145
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,710
if you could pick one image that 
represents the Internet for me,

146
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,390
it's the goats.
He asshole guy,

147
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,810
the guy pulling apart his asshole that 
represents the internet to make is.

148
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:43,811
Guess what?
There's no way that it should be that 

149
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:45,110
easy to find.
No way you should ever be one click away

150
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:50,111
from a guy just opening his asshole.
Just pulling it apart like a chew toy,

151
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,990
you know,
there's no fucking way that should be 

152
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,901
one click away.
That is the Internet that embodies the 

153
00:06:58,901 --> 00:06:58,901
Internet.
That is the potential of the Internet.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,150
It's not the whole Internet,
but it's a good.

155
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,310
It's one particular hole.
It's a good tee shirt for the band.

156
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,100
I mean Fuck Dude,
uh,

157
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,880
we are also sponsored by it on it.com,
o n n I t.

158
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,140
and if you go to a on a.com,
we sell our Alpha brain,

159
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,800
which is a cognitive enhancer and new 
mood,

160
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:26,801
which is a five htp,
a formulation that has five htp and l 

161
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:28,730
trip to fan in it.
And it,

162
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,740
um,
it's,

163
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,900
it really makes you feel awesome.
So if you've been trying.

164
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,780
And I liked it,
I like it a lot.

165
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,880
Five htp is the shit man.
And if you don't want,

166
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,170
don't even forget about what we're 
selling.

167
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,560
Go go buy it from some,
you know,

168
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,620
a GNC or local,
you know,

169
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,670
local store tryouts and five HDP.
That shit feels good or buying in an 

170
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,010
alley.
Try to try to buy from a dealer.

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,660
You don't have to buy our stuff.
It just,

172
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,370
you know,
the,

173
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,460
the idea of nootropics,
just because I'm selling nootropics on 

174
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,460
the show,
don't you?

175
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,230
Don't buy my shit.
You go buy it from somewhere else.

176
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,210
Go read like what nootropics are all 
about online and you know,

177
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,610
and try it.
It might not work for you,

178
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,580
might work for you.
For some people there's,

179
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,340
every body is different biologically I 
think.

180
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,710
And I think stuff that might work for 
you,

181
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,340
it's not necessarily gonna work for me.
Goodbye.

182
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,350
When time instead.
I mean there's some people that can't 

183
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,350
deal with caffeine.
Some people.

184
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,080
I mean I don't,
I don't know if it's gonna work for you,

185
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,560
but for me it wasn't my thing,
but I still try it,

186
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,520
you know,
you never know.

187
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,680
Are you a caffeine guy?
No,

188
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,370
I'm saying it's not at all.
I,

189
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,390
I'm completely off of caffeine,
but I can have it every once in a while 

190
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:37,390
for,
you know,

191
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,290
for.
Do you not go with caffeine because 

192
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,500
caffeine kills your boss.
That's a good point.

193
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,880
No,
no.

194
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,810
I'll have like a,
you know,

195
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,250
of like a fancy,
like this time of year I'll like to have

196
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,590
like a Pumpkin latte every once in a 
while or something.

197
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,010
But I don't,
I don't really.

198
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:56,011
I just not a coffee person,
but I'm more specifically not a diet 

199
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:56,011
diet soda person anymore.

200
00:08:56,011 --> 00:09:01,010
I got totally off of that.
Have you ever tried energy drinks or do 

201
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,530
you stay away from all that?
Yeah,

202
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,870
I just go with,
you know,

203
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,820
whatever your natural.
When I'm tired,

204
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:10,650
that's time to go to bed.
It's probably a smart way.

205
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,710
I'm usually not in a position where I 
have to force myself to stay up,

206
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,530
you know?
And so he's sort of keeps me,

207
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,730
you know,
if it's a sativa,

208
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:22,731
it sort of keeps me up anyway.
So you just avoid all stimulants pretty 

209
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:23,490
well.
I drink alcohol,

210
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,180
so.
Yeah.

211
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,200
That's a depressant though,
right?

212
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,620
Yeah,
yeah.

213
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:28,110
Yeah.
But I mean just in terms of.

214
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,270
Have you ever fuck with that are wrong?
No,

215
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:30,950
no,
no,

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,730
no.
I don't.

217
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,540
I haven't really haven't fucked with 
much.

218
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,541
I've only done mushrooms a few times and
he a couple of times and that's about 

219
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,680
it.
I'm mostly just pot and alcohol.

220
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,210
A lot of people love that.

221
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,210
Adderall man.
A lot of people loved that for getting 

222
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,280
shit done.
I think if I could get a supply of it,

223
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,790
I would probably take it away.
Yeah,

224
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,110
but not even going to look.
How damaging do you think it is for you?

225
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,790
I don't think it's bad.
I think I know.

226
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,850
I think if you use it in moderation,
I think it seems like it's one of those 

227
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,280
that's kind of hard to use in moderation
leg it a lot.

228
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,110
I think Brian's the kind of guy that 
like,

229
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,840
like for me,
if I like masturbate,

230
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,010
it's usually like I can go to sleep 
right after that,

231
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,011
but I,
I imagined Brian underwood masturbate 

232
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:13,170
and then want to stay up late enough to 
be able to masturbate again.

233
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,410
Probably like you get bummed out that it
makes you sleepy and so you need so you 

234
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,750
need some sort of energy thing to power 
through to the next one.

235
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,180
Yeah.
I

236
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,740
want you to try something.
Life is short.

237
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,130
I want you to try this Alpha brain shit 
right now.

238
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,340
No,
no.

239
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,210
I'll give it to you after the show,
but what?

240
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,060
What's it gonna do to me?
It's,

241
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,100
it just the way it helps me.
It makes me feel like my brain works 

242
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,540
better.
It makes me feel cleaner,

243
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:45,541
like have a little bit more energy,
a little bit more like it feels like 

244
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,390
things are firing better,
you know?

245
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,910
It's,
there's a bunch of different interesting

246
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:52,120
ingredients in it.
All of them have been used by people for

247
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
hundreds,
if not thousands of years.

248
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,480
And it's uh,
it's basically vitamins for brain 

249
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,480
function,
you know,

250
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,110
I bet it doesn't feel like it'd be 
something that you've ever like,

251
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,850
oh,
I need some that now.

252
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:04,580
Like,
no,

253
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,560
get hooked.
No,

254
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,460
no,
I don't think so.

255
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,250
No,
it doesn't have that profound effect,

256
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,960
you know,
it's quite honestly,

257
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,310
it's like most vitamins,
you know,

258
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:15,130
I believe in vitamins and I think it's 
very important to take care of your body

259
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:16,780
and give it a lot of nutrients and 
stuff.

260
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,200
But most vitamins don't have an 
immediate effect.

261
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,190
You know,
he took vitamins.

262
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:26,191
You just know you have an overall sense 
of what I'm doing the right thing and 

263
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:30,481
I'm putting good food in my body.
And maybe you might feel like you have 

264
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,961
like a little bit more energy,
but the effects of having a lack of 

265
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:34,370
nutrients there,
you know,

266
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,810
it's slow and long.
It's not like you take vitamins and then

267
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,270
all of a sudden I feel amazing.
No,

268
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,760
it's like if you,
if you do have a good nutritional base,

269
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,320
you will feel better.
You know,

270
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:52,321
if you are taking nutrients,
your body will be working better and it 

271
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:52,810
will work better and this works along 
those.

272
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,070
It's,
these are nutrients that help your brain

273
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,320
function and how they help you think 
better.

274
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,970
And uh,
and I'm in.

275
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,160
Let's do it.
I want you to try them anyway.

276
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:08,161
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for Alpha brain 

277
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,440
and enter the code name Rogan,
you will get 10 percent off and then you

278
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,120
can get your freak on.
You'd get rubber pussies.

279
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:13,810
You get yourself some brain pills.

280
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,070
We're still doing commercials.
I'm going to complain about this.

281
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,520
This is how we do it.
I want to be on the record.

282
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,830
I'm going to tweet you guys and long 
fucking commercial,

283
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,480
press the play and let's get the party 
rolling.

284
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,610
Super stoner.
Doug Benson is in the house pitches 

285
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,510
experience Joe Rogan podcast by night.
Let's be honest,

286
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:42,461
ladies and gentlemen,
the reason why that commercial went so 

287
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:42,470
long is we're way too high to be talking
publicly.

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,390
Okay?
That was ridiculous.

289
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,240
I see what you're saying folks.
I see what you're saying.

290
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,010
I hear you.
I'm on your side now.

291
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,400
I don't know man.
I'm just talking shit.

292
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,440
Five to vaporize.
Let's do some more commercials.

293
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.
We're not sure if this thing works yet.

294
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,400
We're going to give it another few 
minutes because it stills has read about

295
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,180
it though.
Apparently it takes like 10 minutes.

296
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:10,181
Yeah,
it's like a vaporizer slash pong type 

297
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,760
device.
I could barely do a show these days 

298
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:12,760
where somebody doesn't show up with some
new contraption.

299
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,070
Fangled thing.
They want me to try wacky kids these 

300
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,070
days.

301
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,330
You gotTa love him.
Hmm.

302
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,530
Months.
I'm sitting saying unable to connect to 

303
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,530
the Internet brand.
What does that mean?

304
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,310
Oh,
I just got the son of a bitch.

305
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,880
You son of a bitch.
So people are complaining about these 

306
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,021
long form commercials that we're doing 
and I don't mean to do that to you 

307
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:38,410
folks,
but that's no other way to do it.

308
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,090
I don't know how to.
I don't know how to.

309
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
I'm not going to say the same thing 
every day.

310
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,570
Exactly.
That's too fucking boring.

311
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,570
Well,
you could tell the guest to shut the 

312
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:48,570
fuck up.
You why?

313
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm just saying you want it to go 
quicker,

314
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,420
but I,
I like it to.

315
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,060
I thought that was fine.
Like that was.

316
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,860
That felt to me like that's part of the 
show and people like long podcast.

317
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:01,861
So you're just giving them.
Just tell them I'm giving you more 

318
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:01,861
fucker.
Shut up.

319
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:01,870
Yes,
but it's because of money.

320
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,930
That's why.
That's why it freaks them out that 

321
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:06,930
you're doing.
You're making money like you totally.

322
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,430
You motherfucker.
Everyone's saying whatever they want 

323
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,011
about the product.
It's not like we're just sitting at 

324
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:14,011
sound like we're the sham wow guy or 
something.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,310
Who tries to say funny things and 
they're just ridiculous.

326
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,670
Martini Bikini linguine with of.
You're talking about.

327
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,860
Does the shamwow guy,
does he have a podcast?

328
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,800
I don't know.
I would like to.

329
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,720
He was in jail for beating.
It's a girl or something.

330
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,600
Everyone has podcasts now.
It's kind of scary.

331
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Didn't.
Some chick is like a hooker bite his 

332
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:35,680
tongue or something?
Yeah.

333
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:35,680
That shit.
That's it.

334
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
Oh God,
man.

335
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,090
Hooker Bites your tongue.
Dude.

336
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:44,770
You've hit a wall out.
You have hit a fucking wall in life

337
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,750
when hooker buys your time.
Shit.

338
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,570
Fuck.
That's pretty brutal.

339
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:51,680
A lot of disaster

340
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,350
now because human bites are like 
dangerous.

341
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,630
They're dangerous.
They're like really toxic.

342
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,960
We have nasty mounds were like as 
dangerous,

343
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,900
if not more dangerous than most wild 
animals.

344
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,280
You have a yeast infection in my mouth.
Why do you keep having used?

345
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,710
When is it going to stop?
Just kidding.

346
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,440
Have you ever gone down on a girl who 
has a yeast infection?

347
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't know.
I've never.

348
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,050
I don't know.
Probably.

349
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,900
I have no idea of what a lot of girls 
right now that are getting angry at this

350
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:22,480
conversation.
Tastes like bread.

351
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,260
Bread.
Yeah.

352
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,900
Or beers like fish,
fish bread.

353
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,260
This is a subject that makes women 
angry.

354
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,430
It makes them really angry.
I'm talking about if you're a fucking a 

355
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,950
girl,
what they get like a urinary track 

356
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:38,950
infection where it's like,
you know,

357
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:38,950
like,
oh,

358
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,780
that's where the legs just juicing 
everywhere.

359
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,100
Black blood and smells like,
oh,

360
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,300
vinegar or something.

361
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,910
We'll see why women wouldn't enjoy this 
conversation.

362
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,230
Has got to be tough to take care of.
You know?

363
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,570
Oh,
it's so much maintenance.

364
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,930
It's the difference between washing a 
car and being a mechanic.

365
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,350
That's what it's like.
It's like men just have to keep their 

366
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:02,350
fucking car washed,
you know,

367
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,230
keep your car washed,
waxed the hood,

368
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,340
boom.
You're done.

369
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Women have a fucking whole internal 
thing there.

370
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,330
Now we'll check out,
get in there.

371
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:12,290
They've got to get under the mechanism 
for loads for their fucking Kangaroos,

372
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,800
a human factory inside their box.
They have a human factor in there.

373
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,840
I mean Shit,
crank shaft.

374
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,920
We have balls that make loads.
That's what we have and those loads make

375
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,690
people.
It's really no big deal for us.

376
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,860
They have a human making machine inside 
the vagina.

377
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,210
Shit,
what the fuck man?

378
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:36,680
What's up,
Doug?

379
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:38,870
Where have you been all over the place?

380
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,770
You've been on the road like Nice.
Remember?

381
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,830
Like every time I'm in la,
he goes,

382
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,000
where were you last weekend?
I don't know.

383
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,830
I went someplace.
You have constant staff and Phoenix last

384
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,580
weekend?
Yeah,

385
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:50,600
and I,
but I,

386
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm really going where I want to go when
I want to go there.

387
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,650
Like for the next couple months,
I've only playing gigs in California and

388
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:01,040
Florida to avoid winter weather.
To have plants.

389
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,660
No,
no,

390
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,740
no,
no,

391
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,090
no.
But I'm home.

392
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,050
I,
I've only.

393
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,600
I've kind of gotten into a pattern in my
career,

394
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,000
have always trying to be home for a few 
days,

395
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:16,001
then out for a few days.
I never go away for a long time or for 

396
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,780
stay home for a long time.
I just sort of does the go away for a 

397
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,450
couple days and come back is the best 
way.

398
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,090
When people go out for like three months
at a time,

399
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,090
all they do is tour that.
He doesn't like.

400
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,110
You might as well be in a band if you're
going to do that,

401
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,850
you know?
Yeah.

402
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,320
I watched that Dang cooked orgasm,
you know where he and all those guys and

403
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,060
Bobby Kelly.
Three poor guy.

404
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:37,720
Yeah.
They all went to and toured around.

405
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,170
I call those guys and I felt so bad for 
them having like,

406
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,210
because they do stuff like today we're 
going to go ride horses to see what 

407
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,111
wackiness happens.
And then Robert Kelly falls off the 

408
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:50,111
fucking horse and breaks his arm.
Yeah.

409
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:50,111
It's just

410
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:50,720
like,
oh,

411
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,860
you didn't even need to go horse back 
riding.

412
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,090
You could have just been hanging out in 
a condo like you would if you were out 

413
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,590
doing your own gig somewhere.
Yeah.

414
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,470
Yeah.
What was,

415
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,030
um,
what did Robert Kelly break his arm,

416
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,590
twisted it or something?
He had a.

417
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,870
he.
Because during a lot of tour guides him,

418
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:11,760
he has some sort of cast or sleeping on 
his arm I think.

419
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Is that what happened?
I remember there was like an audio that 

420
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:16,800
they were planning on opening.
Anthony was talking about his knee,

421
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,850
right leg hurt his knee.
He broke his leg.

422
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:19,890
I broke my knee.
Man,

423
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,470
I'd probably need man.
Right?

424
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,470
Yeah.
Yes.

425
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,010
I mean maybe I'm just confusing 
everything,

426
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,420
but those guys that had to be really 
stressful to go on the road.

427
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,730
I only did it once with that Charlie 
Murphy thing,

428
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,630
me and Charlie Murphy and John Drawn and
uh,

429
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,820
it was,
it was not the most fun because we 

430
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:40,920
weren't doing well like ticket sales.

431
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,180
We didn't do well in a lot of places.
Like the promotion wasn't the best,

432
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,360
so a lot of people had no idea we were 
even in their towns.

433
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,520
It turned out that we only did well in 
the places where I already did well and 

434
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,350
Charlie already did well.
It wasn't really like a good,

435
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,070
it wasn't a really well produced,
sort of such a blur too.

436
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,450
Like I don't remember anything.
Do you remember what city was?

437
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:06,870
What and what club was what it did?
And unfortunately,

438
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,880
you know,
this was before social media.

439
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,580
We didn't have like twitter or anything 
like that.

440
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:13,620
Imagine us having this stream show 
during that.

441
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,700
Oh,
had been so fun.

442
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,870
Yeah,
it had been really fun.

443
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,350
It had to be in a different town and we 
were literally in a different town.

444
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,270
Every night we would wake up,
stare at the ceiling,

445
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:21,990
going to fuck.

446
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,050
Where am I chose?
Were asked to blur together for sure.

447
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:30,051
The hotels,
airlines and the airports and the shows 

448
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:30,150
were awesome,
but it just wasn't,

449
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,970
it wasn't a financial success.
It didn't do well.

450
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,490
The only place it only did well and like
half the places.

451
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Is there a city that you don't like 
performing in?

452
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,220
Like you just think,
oh,

453
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,510
the crowd's always suck there because 
people always asked me about that.

454
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,540
I,
I always have a great time everywhere I 

455
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,540
go.
When you bring your own people now,

456
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,360
you know,
that's true for us as an opening act for

457
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,890
other comics.
I always,

458
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,910
I never was like,
oh,

459
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:55,140
this city's,
you know,

460
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,020
they don't like me as much as you know,
other cities,

461
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,210
you know,
like sometimes you get a bad crowd,

462
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:03,720
but yeah,
I find I don't find one city to be like,

463
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,380
oh,
that place,

464
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,210
the crowds are always really stupid.

465
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,030
Or you know,
like some places they skew old,

466
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,820
like I don't do well at Atlantic city 
because the crowds are just too old.

467
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,320
Right.
They're just like,

468
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,690
what the hell is he talking about?
Right,

469
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,300
right,
right.

470
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

471
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:18,930
Atlantic city is a tricky place.
Yeah.

472
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,210
That's a tricky place.
I've done that.

473
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,240
What does that big theater there?
We did that at the Borgata did that a 

474
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,730
couple times.
It's a tricky place.

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,830
There's a lot of old people.
It's a strange thing.

476
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,560
It's like,
it's sort of like trying to be Vegas,

477
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,590
but it's just a,
just a hair seedier.

478
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Just a hair.
Weirder hair,

479
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:41,520
more possibility of murdering the hair.
Just a hair more,

480
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,770
you know,
it's,

481
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,780
you know,
it's caters to adapt to New Jersey and 

482
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:47,990
Philadelphia and you

483
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,150
know,
everything around there.

484
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,950
Like it's,
it's more like a localized,

485
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,050
like people come from all over the world
for Vegas,

486
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,210
but if someone's coming from really far 
away,

487
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,090
why are they going to Atlantic city?
That'd be,

488
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,880
that'd be a weird choice.

489
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,770
And Atlantic city's essentially 
surrounded by dangerous cities.

490
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,060
You know,
Vegas is essentially in the middle of 

491
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,060
nowhere,
you know,

492
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,060
you'd get past bar stone.
What the fuck is it?

493
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,330
It's just a bunch of weird towns that 
don't make any sense.

494
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
You know,
that drive to Vegas is the real America 

495
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:14,700
though.
You know,

496
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:14,700
it's,
it's a strange drive.

497
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,860
But that drove to Vegas.
That's the real America Atlantic city.

498
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,960
You have to go through Camden,
you know,

499
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,210
you pass through the outskirts,
south Philly,

500
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,910
you know,
you.

501
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,090
There's like a lot of places around 
around Atlantic city that are filled 

502
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,090
with

503
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,660
like serious criminals,
man.

504
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,520
I mean they had a fucking big billboard 
in Newark when we were there for the UFC

505
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,750
big billboard that said,
stop killing the teachers.

506
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,310
Stop killing the teacher.
Is there a big teacher cleaning going 

507
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,250
on?
I don't know,

508
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:49,320
but the fact that there must be 
something,

509
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,590
I mean,
otherwise why would you make a goddamn 

510
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:54,590
billboard about it saying stop killing 
the teachers and then,

511
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,010
you know,
my joke of course was the people who are

512
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:57,480
killing the teachers probably can't 
read.

513
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,650
You know,
it's not really helping and by the way 

514
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:03,650
they're going to look at that and go,
no,

515
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,450
no,
mighty had killed the teacher.

516
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,740
Encourage them a little bit like saying 
scary,

517
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:13,140
scary place.
Newark is a spooky place.

518
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,000
I lived in New York for a couple of 
years.

519
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,960
I lived there when I was a little kid 
and then I lived there again when I was 

520
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:20,960
adult for I think about six months.

521
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,130
I stayed with my grandfather when I 
first moved to New York,

522
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:28,140
I couldn't afford my own place and I got
signed by this management company and so

523
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,080
I had to relocate to New York,
so I just balls up,

524
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,110
pick up my shed,
whatever money I had in the bank and 

525
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,330
just went.
I was gone in like two weeks so I had to

526
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:40,260
stay with my grandfather and he lived on
North Ninth Street in Newark,

527
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:42,180
New Jersey,
and I'm telling you,

528
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:47,181
man,
you might as well have been in another 

529
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:47,181
country.
It is a crazy little spot.

530
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,310
There's a lot going on there,
man.

531
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:54,410
There's a lot going on.
It's like it's a completely different 

532
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:54,410
vibe.

533
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:54,960
I've only gone through there on a train.
I don't think I.

534
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,460
I don't,
I don't think I ever set foot in there.

535
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,110
They did this thing called block

536
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,200
busting and this is what they used to 
do.

537
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,340
This is how real estate guys made money.
It was a really devious practice.

538
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,380
They would go into a neighborhood and 
say,

539
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,750
hey,
black people are moving in.

540
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,230
You better sell now because your 
property value is going to crash.

541
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,770
By the time they move in,
you know you're,

542
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,520
you're going to be fucked,
you're gonna lose your investment.

543
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,970
So a lot of people bought into it and a 
lot of people just took off.

544
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,010
Sure enough,
boom.

545
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,560
It crashed whole neighborhoods.
They did it on purpose.

546
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,930
They did it to try to make money and my 
grandfather was like,

547
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,790
fuck you.
I like black people.

548
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,990
Oh,
I'm going to stay right here.

549
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,020
This is my house.
I bought this house and he watched this 

550
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,620
neighborhood turned from being an all 
Italian neighborhood to being an all 

551
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,070
black neighborhood.
And then it became like all Spanish,

552
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,270
you know,
like various different kinds of people 

553
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,000
from Puerto Rico,
from all different nationalities,

554
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:52,001
but a lot of Spanish people now.
So it was really almost like a kid 

555
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:55,100
watched this whole thing where he was in
this old school America,

556
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,390
you know,
19 forties,

557
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,630
and then boom,
all of a sudden he's living in the 

558
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,060
modern age where everything has just 
gone crazy around them.

559
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,040
I Bet Mitt Romney's done some of that 
blockbusting oh yeah.

560
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,350
That seems like that's in his 
wheelhouse.

561
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:14,430
Irritating blockbusting blockbusting for
Jesus or blockbusting for Joseph Smith.

562
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,580
Yeah,
he's A.

563
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,450
He's A.
I'm sure he's a swell guy.

564
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,590
We're just joking around.
Folks.

565
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm sure.
Mitt Romney's aces.

566
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,440
I'm sure he's asis.
What he says about a right now he's 

567
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,350
saying that they should just.
Everyone should just go ahead and go,

568
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,960
go bankrupt.
Like all on all houses.

569
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,270
Everyone should just lose their house 
and let the.

570
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,940
Let the market decide what happens to 
everybody.

571
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,970
What the fuck.
That's his strategy is just let 

572
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:42,980
everybody don't loan any money to 
anybody.

573
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,100
Is that a real statement?
That's incredible.

574
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,750
That's incredible.
Let the foreclosure process happened.

575
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,630
Just sit.
It's like being raped,

576
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:56,180
like just lay back and let it happen and
don't struggle.

577
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,580
The ultimate acceptance that as a unit,
we're only as strong as our weakest 

578
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,340
link.
You know you have to have.

579
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,580
If you're.
If you're working towards things as the 

580
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,611
leader,
if you're supposed to be the number one 

581
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:12,680
guide that you're,
you're at the top calling all the shots.

582
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,310
The number one thing you have to take 
care of is the weakest of the links.

583
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,490
That's,
that's the people that are fucked up,

584
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,400
the weakest of the links that people 
that are down and out,

585
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:27,401
the people that are homeless,
the people that don't know where their 

586
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:27,500
next meal's coming from,
you've got to take care of them.

587
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,240
You got to figure that out.
Yeah,

588
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:34,241
and the politics of this country is 
those people are not paying for the 

589
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,531
politicians.
They're not making the contributions 

590
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,720
that racist.
Racist is a lot of poor white people.

591
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,180
Oh yeah.
The poverty level or company level,

592
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:44,980
ridiculous.

593
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,490
This doesn't matter,
right?

594
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,590
It doesn't matter.
White,

595
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,540
white or black,
doesn't matter.

596
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,690
It's not about that.
It's about people that are in despair,

597
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,540
you know,
and friendly.

598
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,260
One to say that they should just suffer.
That's ridiculous.

599
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,440
You know,
some people can't do it on their own 

600
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:02,440
man.
Some people need a little help.

601
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,110
So when people need to be shown how,
you know,

602
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:08,111
we need,
we need a nation with someone who's an 

603
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:11,171
actual guide,
someone who can offer real guidance and 

604
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,880
now they're not doing that man.
It's just a money grab.

605
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,060
It's a money grab by all these fucking 
corporate whores and all these people 

606
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,020
who have paid for these politicians to 
be in place and paid for these laws to 

607
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,681
be in place or just reaping the profits 
while the rest of us freak the fuck out 

608
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,401
because we can't figure out why the 
resources are going the way they're 

609
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:30,401
going.

610
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:30,500
We were going,
why you there?

611
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,780
Why?
Why do we have 100,000

612
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,670
troops here?
Why do we have troops there?

613
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Why?
Why don't we conserve our fucking 

614
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,580
resources?
Why is that the biggest section of our 

615
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,411
economy?
Why does it have to be this military 

616
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:44,411
industrial complex?
Why do we have be doing this,

617
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:47,550
this idea to keep us safe,
to keep the fuck.

618
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,980
Are you talking about man,
keep the troops here.

619
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:51,070
Let them guard.
Yeah,

620
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,520
exactly.
If you want to keep us safe all over the

621
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,650
country.
I have troops all over the outskirts of 

622
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:58,650
the fucking country.
You know?

623
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,830
That's how you keep safe.
You don't have preemptive shit,

624
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:03,450
man.
I don't know dude.

625
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,880
I don't know.
The whole thing freaks me out.

626
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,230
It freaks me out because I can't believe
it's this bad in 2011,

627
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,550
I was listening to Robert Anton Wilson 
Lecture and he was talking,

628
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,551
it was in 1993 and he was talking about 
how war is in the process of being 

629
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,260
phased out,
you know,

630
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,690
and he was talking about how in the 
future it,

631
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,860
it's obvious obviously being phased out 
and I wonder what he would've said now 

632
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,720
today,
thinking about that,

633
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:38,721
like in 1993,
that in 1993 I thought war was going to 

634
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:38,721
be phased out too.

635
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,080
We all thought it was over.
You know,

636
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,230
we got through that whole crazy desert 
storm thing under Bush and all of a 

637
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,581
sudden here we are and it's 2011 and 
it's crazier than ever.

638
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,800
I wonder what he would have said them 
get made.

639
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,310
Is it being phased out because it 
doesn't seem like it's being phased.

640
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,100
It seems like it

641
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,070
heating up like we may be pulling out of
a couple places,

642
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:59,840
but going into new ones,
that's like,

643
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:04,100
what the fuck is going on?
If there's something else going on,

644
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,240
let me know.
All right.

645
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,390
If Indiana Jones is found the fucking 
last temple and the Ark of the covenant 

646
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,110
is in there and you have to keep the bad
guys from getting to it because if not,

647
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,280
it'll be hell on earth and hopefully 
there's some snakes.

648
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:21,340
Yeah,
fucking please let me know because 

649
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,890
otherwise this is crazy.
Otherwise,

650
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:22,730
this is crazy

651
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,900
and it's so obvious that there's money 
behind all this shit.

652
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,490
This.
It's so obvious.

653
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,510
We live in the grossest most corrupt 
country ever.

654
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,460
It's so bizarre.
Not ever.

655
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:35,480
Of course.
I'm just kidding.

656
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,720
I mean,
I'm sure a lot of Middle Eastern 

657
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,720
countries and a lot of South American 
countries,

658
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,720
they're

659
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,780
pretty corrupt.
Corrupt too,

660
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:43,420
but the fact that we're,
we're this wonky.

661
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,430
You know,
and then everybody wants to stand up and

662
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:48,550
say you get,
you should get up if you don't like you,

663
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,150
you should leave Merck.
You know,

664
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,240
there's,
there's so many Rah Rah Rah fans out 

665
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,840
there not liking it as what the whole 
country has been built up.

666
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,980
Exactly.
That was the idea is that everybody,

667
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,020
everybody gets to contribute.
It's called the democracy and we're all 

668
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,741
supposed to participate and help one 
another and now it's just like it's 

669
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:11,860
becoming so every man for himself that 
the disparity between the richest,

670
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,570
the richest one percent and the poorest 
people is,

671
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,450
it's just insane.
The difference.

672
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,550
It's God damn money grab out there.
It's a money grab out there left and 

673
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,731
right.
So are all the occupies right now being 

674
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:26,731
shut down like,
oh,

675
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,520
I haven't been.
Each city's kind of treating it 

676
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:30,520
differently.
Like,

677
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,201
um,
there's a few cities that are really 

678
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:34,330
embracing it.
And in La it's not,

679
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,360
it's not really a problem.
The original one I heard got shut down.

680
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Yeah,
I heard some crazy shit that they were 

681
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,330
keeping reporters out and they were 
forcing reporters out of the area.

682
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,340
They said it was for their own safety.
That's insulting Bloomberg cleared,

683
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:53,550
but he out at eh,
they're all intense and they went 

684
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,440
through and told everybody they had 10 
minutes to get out at 1:00

685
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,180
AM on a Tuesday and uh,
and you know,

686
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:05,181
and then they used,
they used quite a bit of force to get 

687
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:05,181
everybody out of there and now they're 
letting people back in,

688
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:10,021
but they're saying they can't have tents
and sleeping bags like you can go back 

689
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:12,751
in and just stand there.
And the idea is they figure that that's 

690
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:16,561
going to kill the movement a little bit 
because it's getting so cold and they 

691
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:20,430
won't be able to lock.
We will be able to last through the 

692
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:20,430
winter.
But Bloomberg keeps saying it's a safety

693
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,030
issue that also that,
you know,

694
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:27,031
they have the right to peaceably 
assemble but they don't have a right to 

695
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:28,180
have a tent or a sleeping bag,
which is this kind of like,

696
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:33,181
well,
but that's so that they can assemble 

697
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:33,181
peacefully and not,
you know,

698
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,620
not just I'll freeze to death in the 
middle of the fucking park in New York.

699
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,690
Like why would they want casualties 
there?

700
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:42,691
Why would,
why would they want people to suffer 

701
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:42,691
that much,
you know,

702
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,750
in order to just express their anger at 
Wall Street.

703
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,070
I mean,
I think it's fantastic that it's that,

704
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,260
that,
that it's happening everywhere,

705
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:53,860
you know,
that there's,

706
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you know,
there's occupied dubuque and stuff like 

707
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,550
that,
but also this new Bloomberg doing this,

708
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,740
if he just let it,
let it be it,

709
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,920
the movement might have died,
but it brought this whole new media 

710
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,921
storm and all these new,
all this new footage of cops just 

711
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,520
beating up these,
these people that,

712
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,070
that don't look like hippies.
They're not all in tie dye.

713
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,800
They're just people that are just,
you know,

714
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:21,900
concerned and showing up to you to make 
up

715
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,790
mark.
They're holding hand by hand.

716
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,400
And did you see that video?
My brother wouldn't hit my hand.

717
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,470
That's just insane.
I can't believe that as a,

718
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,800
as a fellow person,
just being able to do that too.

719
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:37,801
Like that girl little girl.
What what he's saying is they were 

720
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:37,801
jabbing and with Bhutan.
Yeah.

721
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,240
Yeah.
And Bloomberg,

722
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,720
you know,
he makes it all about as horrible.

723
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,790
He makes it all about keeping,
keeping people of New York safe by 

724
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,010
kicking everybody out of there and it's 
like when they were in their tents,

725
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:50,240
who was,
who was in danger?

726
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,770
Nobody.
But as soon as they're.

727
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,430
Well maybe he's worried about people 
freezing to death.

728
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,890
Don't think he is.
I think ego problem.

729
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,580
I don't think he is either,
but it is sort of a legal concern.

730
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,030
Someone freezes to death on your lawn.
Who's responsible for that?

731
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,730
Yeah,
well it certainly not his lawn.

732
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,610
Like it's,
it's like a public park that's privately

733
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:14,300
owned.
Is it by some corporation?

734
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,770
Is that public safety though?
Like it's just like our argument is that

735
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,820
it's his argument was that people can 
enjoy the park if the park is full of 

736
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,480
people that are just point,
but it's like,

737
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:29,240
you know,
New York City walk two blocks it.

738
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,820
Enjoy that other park.
Yeah,

739
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,710
just one fucking park.
But I think what,

740
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,250
you know,
Eh,

741
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:35,810
yeah,

742
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:36,840
it's a,
it's,

743
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,130
there's definitely two sides to it,
but it just feels like,

744
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,420
it feels like,
um,

745
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:47,170
you know what Bloomberg did sort of.
It sort of energize the movement in a 

746
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,630
way that it might not have happened.
If he did,

747
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,330
if he did just let it play out.

748
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,330
How would anybody expect them to behave 
though?

749
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:58,331
They've got to figure out a way to 
squash this and they have to take 

750
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,270
drastic measures.
There's another go through the middle of

751
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,290
the night.
Everybody's fucking.

752
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:03,290
There's no MDF sleep and they go in 
there and just say,

753
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,260
you got to go now.
Get out with this footage of like cops,

754
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,460
you know,
lifting guys up and throwing them over 

755
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,460
the barricade stuff.
It's like,

756
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,660
it's really.
And you know,

757
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:14,420
in the cops for the most part,
I like to say they're doing what they're

758
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:15,200
told to do.
I don't.

759
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,290
I don't like to blame the cops.
Yeah.

760
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,410
They're given what they're,
they're,

761
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,380
they're doing what they're told to do,
but when they're doing it,

762
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,410
all the sudden the people that don't 
want to listen become the enemy.

763
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,360
They become bad guys.
Yeah.

764
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,610
It's like a bouncer with a drunk person 
in a class.

765
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,730
Like when that drunk person then it gets
violent.

766
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,310
People aren't bad guys.
They should like,

767
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,770
like let them still occupy like the 
trees,

768
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,800
like they should be allowed to like live
in the trees in the park so that the 

769
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:41,800
park be.
Yeah,

770
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,450
but then what if a hippie falls on you 
while you're walking?

771
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:48,451
You get some real safety issues.
They have to have some safety like chat 

772
00:33:48,451 --> 00:33:51,941
people that check it out,
but then they become an [inaudible] and 

773
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,410
a couple months and then the idea is the
idea is to cause people.

774
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,770
The idea is to cause some inconvenience 
and draw some attention.

775
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:58,120
You know,
they,

776
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,660
they don't know.
You don't.

777
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:04,810
You don't like get together and protest 
something and imagine that for politely 

778
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,580
match.
If that's where swaths came from the 

779
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,830
originally people,
they were just so fucking stupid.

780
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,380
They eventually just became these claude
things.

781
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:17,390
Just degenerated to that point.
Imagine someone proved that slaw is 

782
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,350
like,
you know,

783
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,870
that's like a sin.
That's what sends the basics.

784
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:22,400
Ends,
right?

785
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,530
Yeah.
That's my favorite sloths.

786
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

787
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:31,070
What was that movie with Brad Pitt seven
with a seven slash 10 of a v?

788
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,750
Yeah,
that's a good movie.

789
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,460
It's a good fucking movie.
It's,

790
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,290
it's,
it's a creepy movie.

791
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,510
Went in that one dude that big,
the sloths guy was like sitting over 

792
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,700
hunched over the table and it was the 
first time where I saw like a body where

793
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,710
they had like makeup where it was like 
blue,

794
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,800
like it's been sitting there for awhile,
you know that they did a good job.

795
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

796
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,050
Dang it looked at as fuck.
Yeah.

797
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,660
Do you ever do that?
What?

798
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,430
Get makeup like that on you?
Just for fun.

799
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,200
Like it looks like your stomach.

800
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,680
No,
I don't do a lot of things.

801
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,510
Just for fun.
I know Brian Redmond,

802
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,450
bride red band lives just for fun.
I wish you got to dragon's layer shirt 

803
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:13,490
on.
What's that about?

804
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,690
You know what?
I went to a comic book store the other 

805
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,011
day because I've been hearing all this 
shit about how comic book stores are 

806
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:21,011
just hurting right now.
Like they're,

807
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:23,120
they're suffering the most with is a 
whole economy.

808
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,630
People aren't buying comics anymore.
They don't have any free money where,

809
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:29,630
you know they're downloading comp.
Kids are downloading comics now,

810
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,590
so I decided there's one in Burbank that
I've always driven bias.

811
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,830
I might check it out,
maybe I can find a cool poster for the 

812
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:38,830
studio or something.
So I went in there and I just.

813
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,030
I was in there for like three hours is 
the best story ever and a bunch of 

814
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,030
stuff.

815
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,210
Bunch of just like random things.
It was so cheap.

816
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,120
It was like posters were like $7.
I was like,

817
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,980
well,
I never get a chance to brag about this,

818
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,080
but I,
I the very.

819
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,110
I worked at the arcade that had the very
first dragon's layer,

820
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:59,700
the test one before it went public and I
probably killed the dragon.

821
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:04,701
I was probably maybe the 30th or 40th 
person in the world to get all the way 

822
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:09,370
to the end until the dragon because I 
would stay at night when I was off duty 

823
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,720
and I had keys to the place and I would 
just stay in there and play and play and

824
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,380
play until I finally got to the dragon,
you know,

825
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,400
figured it all out and killed the dragon
and uh,

826
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,950
you know,
and then eventually it went,

827
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,040
went public and that is amazing all over
the place.

828
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,820
Yeah.
Nerd boner.

829
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,560
I worked at an arcade called star port.
It was in a mall,

830
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,860
but when you walked in there was all 
this corrugated tin and stuff that 

831
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,290
simulate kind of like you're going into 
like space mountain or something and 

832
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:37,560
there's stars on the ceiling.
It was,

833
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,520
it was kind of a cool themed arcade 
refresh my memory,

834
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,640
because I remember the dragon's lear was
like this really cool animated thing 

835
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:47,400
where,
you know,

836
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,680
you would go,
you would have,

837
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,780
but you would have to move certain ways.
There's a series of scenes that would 

838
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,920
happen on the screen,
like an animated movie.

839
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:00,650
It looked like a dog and you had like a,
you know,

840
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,870
I think you had a regular toggle thing 
and then a couple of buttons.

841
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,340
It's a,
yeah,

842
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:09,390
it's a joystick and uh,
an action button and usually it started 

843
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,891
off like you're walking down like a 
bridge and then like a snake comes up 

844
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:13,080
and you have to think what would you 
want to do?

845
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,570
Like either take the sword to the snake 
or left.

846
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:20,571
But it was more of a guessing game if 
you had this more like you have to try 

847
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,930
every combination of things to do,
like there's one part where you're like,

848
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,180
you're in a,
like a cave,

849
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:27,870
roaring down the river in a raft or 
something and it's like you have,

850
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,200
you can go to the right of the left.
And so if you toggle to the right,

851
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,520
you know,
you,

852
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,530
you'd go,
you'd go the rest of the way without 

853
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:37,530
encountering anything.
But if you go the other way,

854
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,670
something,
something goes wrong and you lose a life

855
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:40,080
or something.
And um,

856
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,920
there's just a bunch of options through 
the whole thing until finally you get to

857
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,440
and kill the dragon.
But yeah,

858
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:48,660
it was really,
it was weird because it wasn't,

859
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:51,460
you know,
it was early enough in video games were,

860
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,610
wasn't like you could really make the 
things do that much because also it was,

861
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,460
he was pretty animated,
there weren't a lot of options.

862
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,030
So like as long as you did the right 
thing,

863
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:04,920
you move forward or you or,
or there'd be a scene of you failing.

864
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,450
They have it on the IPAD,
I believe now,

865
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,560
but that's my dream is to get in a 
dragon's layer,

866
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,570
original dragon's lair arcade game.
And my friend actually just got one and 

867
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:14,570
I'm so jealous.
That's your dream.

868
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,750
That was one of my like,
you know,

869
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,090
like you have dream things like gold 
shorts.

870
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:21,450
I went the gold short circuit board of 
it today,

871
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,750
man.
So yeah,

872
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,410
let me give you also another reason to 
be jealous.

873
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:29,730
Here's the reason to not be jealous is 
because when that thing breaks down,

874
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,150
there's nobody that's gonna fix it.
I already have a laser disc player at my

875
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,530
house,
brand new,

876
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,110
just waiting to replace it.
Why?

877
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,560
You're good enough with that kind of 
stuff that you can install.

878
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,950
The a couple of my friends,
that's what they do for a living and the

879
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:47,990
arcade restore restoration.
Does that work on laser disk is.

880
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,760
Oh yeah,
it's a.

881
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,060
it's a laser disc.
So the game is a laser?

882
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,030
Yes.
Essentially.

883
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,260
Yeah,
with just different chat.

884
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:58,261
You just,
you when you toggle the correct way or 

885
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:58,840
push the button the right way it goes 
into a different chapter.

886
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,870
But honestly nowadays you can mod an 
arcade games like I could hook up a 

887
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,530
computer to it and have every single 
arcade game ever,

888
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,590
you know.
So you don't even need the laser disk 

889
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:10,590
player anymore.
Are you using rom?

890
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,260
How many options were there for 
movement?

891
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:16,261
That's what I don't remember.
I just remember being completely 

892
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:16,261
groundbreaking.
Like Whoa,

893
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:17,210
this is like you're,
it's like an animal.

894
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:18,880
There was a group,
it's amazing.

895
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:22,210
It was just joy stick in one button if I
recall.

896
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:27,570
Yeah,
you just kinda like are always kind of 

897
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:27,570
moving to the left or the right or,
or in the case.

898
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,530
And it was hard case of like throwing 
the sword into the Dragon.

899
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:34,531
I think you had to just press the button
and and and motion in that direction at 

900
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:35,800
the same time.
Laser disc game show.

901
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:40,801
The eighties were one of my favorite 
things ever that he had that mach five 

902
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:44,491
or whatever it was called where it was 
like you're a jet plane and it was like 

903
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,730
all real film of jets and it was really 
cool because it was also using a laser 

904
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,560
disc player.
It was like new and the.

905
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,810
They had like a space which was also 
done by Don Bluth who did a dragon's 

906
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,791
layer and there was one game.
They started taking Japanese cartoon 

907
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:03,061
movies and making them a video games.
A Malibu Grand Prix had a.

908
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,570
It was a race track thing in the midwest
where they had a whole arcade division.

909
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,500
So they took these animated movies and 
one was called a space six,

910
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:16,501
six six or it was like about a train and
it was the coolest video game because 

911
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:20,281
you were on top of a train and it was 
like dragon's layer and it was like a 

912
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:23,341
spy movie was so cool,
but that didn't ever really catch on.

913
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,960
Like it didn't really become,
it was big briefly in the eighties,

914
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:31,000
but it didn't become a lot of them,
you know,

915
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,590
like there's Pac man and then everything
that's sort of vaguely remember that.

916
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:38,060
I vaguely remember that in an arcade.
What year was this?

917
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,040
This was about 85.
80 six I ever saw that.

918
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:45,190
I only saw.
I remember space and feeling like it was

919
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:47,200
already like,
oh well that's not dragon's layer.

920
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,900
That's just an attempt to be like dragon
slayer.

921
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,260
Home Computer Games must have just 
crushed video arcades.

922
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:54,340
Right.
It did.

923
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:59,170
When the Nintendo finally came out.
I mean not like a big video arcade.

924
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,270
You remember when we used to go to just 
video arcades,

925
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,140
you'd open the door and it was just,
it's always,

926
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,560
always with something else or in a weird
place like an airport or a scene.

927
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,340
What are those?
What are those gaven buster type places.

928
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,870
They have a room of games,
but they also have to have food and 

929
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,671
drinks and pool tables and you know,
a shuffleboard and like no place is just

930
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:27,511
video games except for there's one joint
in Portland that's like a whole arcade 

931
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:32,590
that's just all old school shit 
Portland.

932
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,860
Right.
Of course.

933
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,180
It's important that.
That's funny.

934
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,090
I told you about my friend that does the
restoration,

935
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,410
spry and Pinzon,
Columbus,

936
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:39,920
Ohio.

937
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,030
He uh,
he,

938
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,540
his whole basement,
he made a eighties arcade room.

939
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:48,280
So you walked down.
It's like you walk down into 1980 and so

940
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,640
it's,
it's amazing.

941
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,160
And it's.
So he decorated it like Wayne's world,

942
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,250
everything like those,
like little pink neon that's always at 

943
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:57,250
the top,
you know,

944
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,730
from the eighties.
And as soon as Brian posts saying,

945
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,420
made a nickel in show business,
he bought a.

946
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,070
He and his buddy dave wrath bought a,
um,

947
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,800
a combination.
It was half and half.

948
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,230
Ms Dot Pacman,
Galaga.

949
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,900
Oh,
I would just spend hours over his house.

950
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,900
Gallagher geologists,
the shit.

951
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,760
I love it.
I'm pretty good at Calico.

952
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:22,030
And then he also got a joust slash 
robotron and I'm really good at robotron

953
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,040
was another one that I,
you know,

954
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,630
I just worked in an arcade so I just 
played games all day.

955
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,280
Kids would come up to me and they'd be 
like,

956
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,100
can I get some tokens that I'd be like,
hang on a second kid,

957
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,690
you know,
and I'd finished the round,

958
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,420
then I'd throw him some tokens and then 
I'd go back to playing.

959
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,420
Like it was the craziest job.
Cocktail tables for the studio table.

960
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,760
Pacman,
joust games.

961
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,040
They used to have those like while 
you're waiting around like in a pizza 

962
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,731
hut or sit down or sit down table 
pinball was also kind of cool.

963
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,300
There's a place near me that the movie 
theater has an arcade that was a little 

964
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,720
entry room.
We can go and play video games while 

965
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,450
you're waiting for your movie.
I just liked the look of it.

966
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:05,090
I liked the style of arcade games.
Like I don't even play it much.

967
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,400
Like I have a pac man at the studio and 
I barely ever play.

968
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:10,170
I just liked the lights of it.
I like just the look it,

969
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,950
it's so Goddamn Lynard skynard poster.
That's right.

970
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,680
It relaxes you and you're masturbating 
or get turned on by these video game 

971
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,600
commercials.
I get turned on by these video game 

972
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,501
commercials,
but not to the point where I'll go out 

973
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:29,501
and get it out.

974
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:29,501
Really.
I won't,

975
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:30,260
I won't allow myself.
I just know that I will,

976
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,480
you know,
any new video game,

977
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,820
I sort of kicked it,
you know,

978
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,520
I just stopped doing it altogether.
Uh,

979
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:37,620
you know,
after uh,

980
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,990
I'd say after Mario Kart.
Yeah.

981
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,140
I used to play that day and night and 
then after a while you're just like,

982
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:47,090
what is getting great at this gonna do 
for me.

983
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,930
It's fun,
but it's the truth.

984
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,450
You're getting tricked,
you're getting tricked into doing 

985
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:55,450
something absolutely stupid with your 
time.

986
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,500
And it hijacks your,
your whole idea,

987
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,850
your reward system,
you know,

988
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:02,480
you're succeeding,
you're focused,

989
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:07,481
you're in on it,
but really you're not even in the real 

990
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:07,481
world.
You're in this getting all these signals

991
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,850
from this fake world.
Yeah.

992
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,930
But it's like watching a movie to me 
nowadays,

993
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,650
you know,
it's,

994
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,530
it's like watching a movie to me,
I want to escape reality,

995
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,540
but I want to have more control of the 
movie united.

996
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,800
So that's kind of why I do.
I don't watch as many movies anymore.

997
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:24,320
My time when you have interactive video 
games,

998
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:29,321
there's a lot of thinking involved,
especially if you're playing like if 

999
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,590
you're playing counter strike or 
something like that or playing quake or,

1000
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,040
and any John Madden,
you

1001
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,470
got to know about all the players and 
stuff.

1002
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,120
Oh,
there's a lot of thinking going on.

1003
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:41,121
Like your synapses are firing,
you know whether or not you choose to 

1004
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:41,121
think

1005
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:41,650
they're firing on something useful or 
not.

1006
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,390
That's,
you know,

1007
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:43,960
that's really sort of an arbitrary 
decision.

1008
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:48,961
Like you can't say that this person 
isn't actually training their mind 

1009
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:48,961
through intensive video games

1010
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,590
because you're doing intense video 
games.

1011
00:44:50,591 --> 00:44:52,060
You're multitasking,
you're fucking,

1012
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,250
your synapses are firing,
you're moving your fingers.

1013
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,460
You have to first person shooters.
You have to be in direct coordination 

1014
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,331
with your left hand,
which movies your keys and your right 

1015
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:03,331
hand,
which controls the mouse.

1016
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:04,450
And you know,
there's a lot of shit going on.

1017
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,940
You can't tell me that.
That's not exercise for the mind.

1018
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,250
I played a lot of golden eye too,
now that I think,

1019
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,370
you know,
they rereleased what's gold?

1020
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,840
And it was the first James Bond,
like the pretty cool.

1021
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:21,870
Was it good?
I'll run around different weapons type 

1022
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,270
thing,
but if they'd have,

1023
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,040
you know,
you could play for people at a time.

1024
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:29,041
So me and two other people just sit 
there for hours chasing each other 

1025
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:29,140
around trying to shoot each other.

1026
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,970
So stupid.
Yeah,

1027
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:34,530
man.
The whole staff on Newsradio,

1028
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,510
the entire writing staff was addicted to
quake and they had a land set up,

1029
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:42,730
a local area network setup in the office
where they had like six,

1030
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,780
seven computers all linked up together 
and they would have these mad quake 

1031
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,390
tournament's and was courageous.
It was really fucking fun.

1032
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,660
It was unfortunately though,
highly,

1033
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,450
hugely addictive.
And yeah,

1034
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,780
I would,
I would,

1035
00:45:56,781 --> 00:46:01,781
uh,
I would get really stuck playing know 

1036
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:01,781
where I was like,
you know,

1037
00:46:01,781 --> 00:46:02,540
7:00,
8:00

1038
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:03,240
in the morning,
early,

1039
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,870
I got to go home.
Like I make myself drive home because we

1040
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:07,520
were all playing

1041
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:12,970
when I worked at gateway,
all the tech guys with all the gateway 

1042
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:12,970
stores in Columbus.
Uh,

1043
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,800
we used to have land parties.
Every Friday we'd have just get alcohol 

1044
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,270
and uh,
we all have like shuttle or like small 

1045
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,451
little portable computers are 
cantaloupes.

1046
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,680
And then we would just sit there and 
play battlefield 19 or whatever for like

1047
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,490
hours till like five in the morning.
No Glare.

1048
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:31,550
Yeah.

1049
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,290
No,
it's a fun.

1050
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,510
We used to do that in like the quake 
claim that I was in.

1051
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,790
We would get together in Houston,
Texas.

1052
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,350
They would,
most of those guys lived in Houston.

1053
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,420
So we would go to Houston,
have these,

1054
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:43,000
a local area network parties set up in 
this.

1055
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,830
All the computers set up in this room.

1056
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,080
Heavy acid.
I've seen places.

1057
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,590
That was the thing,
the studio make it like a huge.

1058
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,690
Also,
you could sit down and just have like a 

1059
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:55,690
land party every time you hang out 
there.

1060
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,250
Dude,
if we do and do a podcast or email,

1061
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:01,270
I have a real problem.
You can only do it once a month to 

1062
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,040
podcast play.
If you want to put some quick on there 

1063
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,870
once a week car open up the door.
I opened up Pandora's box.

1064
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,370
Yeah,
that'd be cool.

1065
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:14,090
Land Party podcast.
I got to play guys era.

1066
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:15,790
You did.
Why were.

1067
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,690
Why was a good pool player?
That's why you played with him.

1068
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:23,680
Yeah.
He's a buddy.

1069
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

1070
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:26,470
I didn't know.
I didn't know you knew him or what,

1071
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,330
but like it just went to his house.
Are we met?

1072
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,870
We met at a pool hall.
Where's the pool hall?

1073
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:33,310
Because that's another thing that seems 
to be dying.

1074
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,670
It's not hard to find pool halls.
This was the house of billiards in 

1075
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:38,670
Sherman Oaks.
Yeah.

1076
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:39,250
It's hard.
Hard to find good places.

1077
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,270
Vegas has the most good places.
Vegas still has 24 hour pool halls,

1078
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:48,570
which is an anomaly outside of Vegas.
It used to be in New York you could get 

1079
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,630
24 hour pool halls a lot.
There was Chelsea,

1080
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Chelsea billiards,
and there was a bunch of other smaller 

1081
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:54,660
places that were 24 hours.
I don't know how many of them are left,

1082
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,530
but Chelsea is gone and a lot of other 
big ones are gone.

1083
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,410
That's crazy.
At 24 hour place to play a sport.

1084
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:01,660
There's not many of those.
There's not like anything else.

1085
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,020
The name pool really is all about 
gambling.

1086
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:10,170
It's really pocket billiards.
It's called pool because everybody's 

1087
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:10,790
pooling their money together and 
bending.

1088
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,610
The Fun in pool is all about money.
It's all about gambling and so you would

1089
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,970
go to these places and the reason why 
they were open 24 hours a day because no

1090
00:48:18,971 --> 00:48:21,700
one ever wanted to leave.
They would just play.

1091
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,910
You get down and try to get back up.
Guys would sleep under the tables.

1092
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,810
It was so common that guys would stay 
there for two,

1093
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:29,960
three days.
Yeah.

1094
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:34,980
I would go and do gigs.
I'd come back and the same guys will be 

1095
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,420
there from the night before and the same
clothes.

1096
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,170
Almost like a job for a lot of guys.
Yeah,

1097
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,990
and they would.
They would be gambling like crazy,

1098
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:43,660
but it was always fun.
It was always exciting.

1099
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,770
You know,
the,

1100
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,230
the,
the world of gambling and pool and,

1101
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:48,080
and that like,
you know,

1102
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,900
if you're,
if you're in an auction room,

1103
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,640
that's fucking fun,
man.

1104
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,260
It's,
it's very addictive,

1105
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,370
you know,
but it's again,

1106
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:55,930
it's just like the video game thing.
It's like,

1107
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,470
what are you doing by getting really 
good at putting balls in holes?

1108
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,350
What are you doing?
Gambling illegally and getting,

1109
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,660
getting in scrapes with guys because you
don't for the most dudes,

1110
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,160
for the most part,
if everybody knew everybody.

1111
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:12,040
There was very few problems,
but there was always stories.

1112
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:17,041
If you know,
this guy wanted his money back and he 

1113
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:17,041
came at this guy with a fucking golf 
club and you know,

1114
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:22,000
there was always those stories.
I saw a few scuffles over the years of 

1115
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,640
hanging out and pool halls.
But for the most part when people paid,

1116
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,210
you know,
they,

1117
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,830
they,
if they wanted to keep gambling,

1118
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:29,620
they had to pay when they lost because 
everybody had.

1119
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,330
There was a gambler's ethic.
If you,

1120
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:35,320
if you cause trouble when you lost and 
you're only happy when you won,

1121
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,430
nobody would gamble with you.

1122
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,460
People didn't want to.
So they were just naturally became guys 

1123
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,671
who had good reputations and guys who 
didn't and if he didn't know the guy 

1124
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:47,491
don't play him.
So it sort of Tom Cruise and Paul 

1125
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:48,700
Newman's showed up.
That was the big.

1126
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,280
That's when people realize how fun it 
was.

1127
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,870
But it's one of those things.
It's getting,

1128
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,900
it's,
it's sort of getting lost in our 

1129
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:57,900
culture.
When we were playing last night,

1130
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,540
there was a girl a at a table next to us
that was pretty good.

1131
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,680
She,
she could play pretty good and she was 

1132
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,761
with her boyfriend who couldn't fucking 
play at all and she was humiliating him 

1133
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:13,710
and he was trying getting super upset,
but it's like she didn't even try to 

1134
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,970
help him.
His technique was fucking horrible.

1135
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,971
His elbows up in the air.
He was putting all kinds of extra spin 

1136
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:21,550
on the ball.
I couldn't make a ball to save his life.

1137
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,730
And the girl was like,
just laughing at him and jumping up and 

1138
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:26,730
down.
Every time she won.

1139
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,340
And you could see him getting fucking 
pissed.

1140
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Getting actually pissed off that she was
like bragging because she was winning 

1141
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,220
this game.
Like you see them,

1142
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:36,410
like almost want to hit her.
I'm like,

1143
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:41,411
wow,
there's some deep seated shit in this 

1144
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:41,411
game.
Augie.

1145
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,400
All competition between dudes and their 
girlfriend.

1146
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,520
Any kind.
It brings out some really weird shit,

1147
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,550
man.
You got to win against a woman no matter

1148
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:56,030
how nice to women you are and how much 
you respect them.

1149
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:00,350
Still this weird thing kicks in.
That's just hardwired.

1150
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:01,550
Yeah.
I was dating.

1151
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:07,030
This is how I got into pool.
I was dating this chick and she was a 

1152
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,241
little older than.
And she used to like to tell them what 

1153
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:10,241
to do and I didn't really like that,
but I like to fuck her.

1154
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,370
So I stuck around for a little while.
But uh,

1155
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,200
we played.
That was one of the things she tells you

1156
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:15,620
to do.

1157
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,720
Yeah,
we played pool once and uh,

1158
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,220
she beat me playing pool.
She was not,

1159
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,580
I wasn't good.
So I wouldn't say she was pretty good,

1160
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,530
but she beat me.
And so I said,

1161
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh shit,
I found something.

1162
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,440
She's good at,
you know,

1163
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,610
like she's,
she's,

1164
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,750
she's better at meeting this.
Well,

1165
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:31,220
this is terrible.
I have to fix this.

1166
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:34,610
I have to fix this at once,
so I went to the pool hall and learn how

1167
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:38,630
to play pool and we started practicing.
Teacher went and I,

1168
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,710
I got a book on it.
I,

1169
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,500
I,
I got my own cue.

1170
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:46,540
I figured out how to play pool and then 
we played again and I killed her.

1171
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,040
Yeah,
we get it.

1172
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:54,041
I totally practice,
totally learn how to pull play pool and 

1173
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:57,701
then winter.
I mean I wasn't good by any stretch of 

1174
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:00,461
the imagination,
but at least I knew how to play pool 

1175
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:00,461
like I was.

1176
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:02,690
I was definitely way better than it was 
the first time we played and then I won.

1177
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So I like I,
I had a problem that I couldn't let her 

1178
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,410
have beaten me in something and this is 
how I got addicted to playing pool.

1179
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,950
I'm imagining you being like the 
zookeeper character as you're telling 

1180
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:15,700
that story.
I was totally like that guy.

1181
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,440
Well that was the dark days.
That was the actual fighting days.

1182
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,790
The dark days.
I was,

1183
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:22,350
I was way crazier.
Yeah.

1184
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,230
I can't think of an example of something
I taught myself to be better at,

1185
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:26,480
to,
to beat my girlfriend,

1186
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,970
but I'm sure it happened.
I could not let her.

1187
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,370
She was.
She was older than me and she was smart.

1188
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,010
There was no way.
She was a very educated person to,

1189
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,290
you know,
she was a musician.

1190
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,430
She was in a lot,
a lot,

1191
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,620
a lot of shit going on.

1192
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,000
She ever wrote a song about you when you
guys were doing.

1193
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,830
That'd be cool if there was a song out 
there.

1194
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:50,810
I mean,
she's a nice person,

1195
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,900
very nice person,
but couldn't sort of.

1196
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:54,710
No,
no,

1197
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,400
no.
It's very hard to stay in touch with 

1198
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,400
people.
You know,

1199
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,400
when you used to date them and all down 
they date other people.

1200
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,860
They don't want some dude fucking 
calling and texting and emailing.

1201
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,030
It's not great.
It's not right.

1202
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,420
You know which from the best and the 
don't confuse everybody.

1203
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,600
You can confuse the shit out of people.
You know,

1204
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,020
don't you think you know,
but you know,

1205
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:19,030
all of a sudden you know you're in a 
fight with your husband and you know 

1206
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,761
you're,
you're having an email talks with your 

1207
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:21,761
ex boyfriend.
Then all of a sudden you start thinking,

1208
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:25,631
you know,
maybe this guy and I could give it one 

1209
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:25,631
more shot.
Maybe that's why it,

1210
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,040
it can conflict,

1211
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,870
you know?
I think if it's an

1212
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,180
open forum only then that's cool.
Like a facebook wall posts and stuff 

1213
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,180
like that.
Like,

1214
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,820
hey,
how have you been?

1215
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,590
And we should hang out sometime or 
something like that.

1216
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:39,850
Or maybe you could do some gamesmanship 
or somebody wants something and then the

1217
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:45,860
trouble is the other people in your life
start questioning what's going on and it

1218
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,350
sucks.

1219
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,170
Yeah,
it sucks.

1220
00:53:47,171 --> 00:53:48,490
It's annoying.
Really.

1221
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,050
We should be able to just fuck 
everybody.

1222
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,390
That's really ideal,
but no one can handle that.

1223
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,940
Red Bands.
The only person that could handle that.

1224
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,040
No.
Could you imagine if the ego actually 

1225
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,800
gets completely cured,
that you can't have art,

1226
00:54:02,801 --> 00:54:07,801
then that'd be senior.
You're not going to have artists like 

1227
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:10,360
the best jokes were to get paid.
Art is like the struggle,

1228
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
the best painter artist,
like the struggle between the ego and 

1229
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,520
like the,
the desire to produce something 

1230
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,550
fantastic to please others.
You know,

1231
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,760
and if you don't control the ego,
you,

1232
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,600
you,
you can't really produce aren't.

1233
00:54:25,601 --> 00:54:28,990
But the fight with the ego is what fuels
the art sometimes.

1234
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,120
So if we had no ego,
we'd have no art,

1235
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:36,180
no art,
but people would just fuck like 

1236
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,911
randomly.
Everybody would just be able to fuck 

1237
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:38,911
everybody.
You wouldn't worry about it.

1238
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:39,900
It takes nerve to be an artist because 
you're basically saying,

1239
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,080
you know that I can do this thing so 
well that people are going to want it.

1240
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,560
It's very arrogant.
Yeah,

1241
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,260
super arrogant.
But it's also,

1242
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,740
you know,
it starts out like you're,

1243
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,970
you know,
you're just like,

1244
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:58,410
I get people asking me all the time,
how do you become a standup comic?

1245
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,480
And I'm just like,
I do it.

1246
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,310
That's how you become one.
You just do it.

1247
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,480
And then they're always like,
yeah,

1248
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:08,481
but do you have any advice?
And I really like just lots of little 

1249
00:55:08,481 --> 00:55:11,300
tiny pieces of advice you can give if 
you want to sit with a person and talked

1250
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:15,150
to them for two weeks.
But big advice is just do it.

1251
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,260
Never underestimate the power of 
actually fucking doing something.

1252
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,380
And also I'll also not the,
the,

1253
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,220
the fact that they're questioning it at 
all,

1254
00:55:22,221 --> 00:55:27,221
the fact that they're looking to someone
else for help to get started makes you 

1255
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:28,370
think that they.
How are they ever going to make it?

1256
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:30,890
Because they don't want it badly enough.
They're not going to just do it.

1257
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,270
You know?
I never asked anybody,

1258
00:55:32,271 --> 00:55:37,271
oh yeah,
this is what you have to do to go on 

1259
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:37,271
stage.
What do you have to do against days?

1260
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:37,280
That was my,
my initial question,

1261
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:40,280
but once I got in and started doing open
mics,

1262
00:55:40,281 --> 00:55:41,150
I just,
you know,

1263
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,740
you,
you,

1264
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,210
you figure it out by doing it and trial 
and error.

1265
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,020
No one's good.
No one's good.

1266
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,910
The no one that you know who thinks 
they're funny.

1267
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,370
You can go on stage and kill in front of
a room full of strangers.

1268
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:55,460
You might laugh if you think they're 
your buddy and they're up there.

1269
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,390
Yuck,
Yuck it up,

1270
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:57,380
but guess what?
It's a,

1271
00:55:57,381 --> 00:56:02,381
it's a weird fucking way to communicate 
with people and it really is not all 

1272
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:07,721
that it seems.
It's a very tricky sort of a craft that 

1273
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:08,660
you have to learn and develop.
But you can do it.

1274
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,510
Anybody can do it,
but nobody's good in the beginning.

1275
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,310
Nobody is good in the beginning.
Yeah.

1276
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,090
Or you get,
you know,

1277
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:16,240
you get your labs here and there and 
that's encouraged.

1278
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:17,930
You get a little chuckle here and there.
You know,

1279
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:19,910
you feel like you're onto something but 
you suck.

1280
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:22,010
Dude,
we all sucked.

1281
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,100
Everybody does not have your first

1282
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,100
time.
Is that usually the best to within the 

1283
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,980
next 10 times,
but some people get an extra charisma 

1284
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:31,980
bump to that.
Yeah.

1285
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,970
You know what I mean?
Like I bet you the first set of like 

1286
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:35,970
Bill Hicks,
Eddie Murphy.

1287
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:36,390
Yes.
Yeah.

1288
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,100
Spade started really early.
Rock started really early,

1289
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,150
like those guys were probably were,
you know,

1290
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,560
very decent their first time out,
you know,

1291
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,530
just because you know that it's that 
charismatic personality.

1292
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,080
Well,
I was talking about he has,

1293
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,700
who is one of my favorite comedians of 
all time.

1294
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:56,701
Joey Joey is in my opinion,
he's at a just sheer laugh out loud,

1295
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,800
fall down moments.
He's provided me with the most,

1296
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:04,801
if any human being ever.
And Joey was not that good when I met 

1297
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:05,140
him.
He was not that good on stage.

1298
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,570
He just couldn't do it.
It was a real weird thing.

1299
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:08,420
I don't know what it was.

1300
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,500
He's just a hilarious dude.
I mean he's hilarious talking about 

1301
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,231
anything but he maybe he couldn't focus 
it into setup punchline kind of maybe.

1302
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:22,141
I don't know what it was or bins turned 
a fucking corner man and I don't 

1303
00:57:22,141 --> 00:57:23,040
remember when it was,
but our,

1304
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,940
it was,
it was actually,

1305
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,310
I don't,
I don't know,

1306
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,860
maybe maybe three,
four years in.

1307
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,150
I don't know what it was,
three,

1308
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:36,151
four years in o and m,
he turned this fucking corner and just 

1309
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:38,560
started destroying.
Wavy just became more himself.

1310
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,190
Yeah.
Oh,

1311
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:40,510
he definitely did.
He,

1312
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,810
he just learned to be relaxed on stage.
He just eat,

1313
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:48,840
you know,
I asked him what happened and he was 

1314
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840
like,
I just stopped giving a fuck.

1315
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Yeah,
yeah.

1316
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:48,840
He said,
I stopped giving a fuck.

1317
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,260
Yeah.
Not trying too many things,

1318
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,870
too many people telling them what to do.
And he was like,

1319
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,340
fuck you,
I'm going to do it my way.

1320
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,690
And when he did that,
boom,

1321
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,330
he was awesome.
But when he was trying to make everybody

1322
00:57:58,331 --> 00:57:59,590
happy,
he just couldn't.

1323
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:02,950
He couldn't,
he couldn't really be himself,

1324
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,420
you know,
himself as the,

1325
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:09,421
I don't give a fuck guy that tells the 
funny stories in the back of the comedy 

1326
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:10,120
store and that's the guy that we all 
knew and loved.

1327
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,120
But then on stage he figured out how to 
do it and that was,

1328
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,860
you know,
that's,

1329
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,930
that's the most dramatic at,
of my life of seeing someone go from not

1330
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,860
being good to being really good.
Joe Is the most dramatic.

1331
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:21,700
Oh,
I got it.

1332
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,730
I got my most dramatic one.
Who was Doug Stanhope?

1333
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,490
Doug Stanhope wasn't good in the 
beginning.

1334
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,120
Well,
you know,

1335
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:33,121
he was,
I don't know how raw he was when I saw 

1336
00:58:33,121 --> 00:58:33,121
him.
He was,

1337
00:58:33,121 --> 00:58:34,000
what year was this?
Oh man,

1338
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,670
a long time ago.
It was like a,

1339
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,120
it was back when,
you know,

1340
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:43,190
Steve Sherpa was still physically there 
at the Riviera comedy club and it was 

1341
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,210
maybe even still an Improv at that 
point.

1342
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,360
And I was one of two.
I always wanted to feature acts with 

1343
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,871
this other guy named Tom Martin knew now
he writes on simpsons and stuff and the 

1344
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:58,450
headliner was hugh fink and Doug 
Stanhope was the host,

1345
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,960
the Mc for like one of those crazy weeks
where you do two shows a night for seven

1346
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:09,001
nights and uh,
and crowds were starting to get smaller 

1347
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:09,100
than,
you know,

1348
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:14,101
like the kind of the vegas comedy boom 
was starting to fade a little bit and 

1349
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:15,520
Sherpa would just yell at him every 
night,

1350
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,920
you know,
he was like that weeks punching bag and 

1351
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,530
what was just yelling at him.
But he was,

1352
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,850
it was just Doug Stanhope.
Well,

1353
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,400
just,
you know,

1354
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,390
being laid,
bringing,

1355
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,630
bringing a girl into the showroom 
without asking ahead of time and like,

1356
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,100
like triple just,
you know,

1357
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:32,050
it happened to me a few times.
He just sort of picks one person to sort

1358
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:37,051
of pick on to kind of establish to the 
group that you can't get away with 

1359
00:59:37,051 --> 00:59:37,051
anything.

1360
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,360
But Doug,
like a super,

1361
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,650
super good kid,
you know,

1362
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:47,651
nice guy.
I was a few years older than him and 

1363
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:47,651
thought I really had it under control 
and the three of us,

1364
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,610
we just all that we're working with 
them,

1365
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:50,780
we just all sort of thought,
oh,

1366
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:55,781
you know,
we'll see what happens with him because 

1367
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:55,781
it's,
his act was just like,

1368
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:56,240
he was just like anybody's,
like,

1369
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,270
just somebody trying to do is stand back
and not.

1370
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,000
I think he,
Stan hope really turned a corner when he

1371
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:05,270
just started talking about his own 
experiences instead of trying to say,

1372
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,360
do you ever notice that he's not an 
observational comic?

1373
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:13,361
I mean,
there's observations within what he's 

1374
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,551
talking about because these stories are 
so interesting and he saw such a funny 

1375
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:15,551
guy.

1376
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:15,920
Well,
when you're young it's like,

1377
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:19,240
what do you have to really talk about?
Said that.

1378
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,440
Like,
I remember he had this one bit where he 

1379
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:24,440
would talk about.
He would talk about,

1380
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,710
uh,
he would describe how nasty a egg roll 

1381
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:33,891
is and how much he doesn't like egg 
rolls and it's like as an audience 

1382
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:33,891
member,
you know,

1383
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,960
maybe 50,
70 percent of the audience loves 

1384
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:39,750
eggrolls.
So then it was just kind of like,

1385
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:40,860
you just kind of sit there going,
well,

1386
01:00:40,861 --> 01:00:41,520
this,
you know,

1387
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,820
he's got to figure out,
uh,

1388
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,840
you know,
he's either got to have more of a 

1389
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,521
personal take on why they're bad to 
convince us or he's got to drop that 

1390
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:50,700
because,
you know,

1391
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,210
egg rolls are awesome,
they're delicious.

1392
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,160
You.
It's just like,

1393
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,230
he was like,
they're filled with mulch.

1394
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,260
I remember that was one of his punch 
punch slides was just the word mulch.

1395
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,760
You know,
how like the weirdest thing stick out 

1396
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:04,760
when you work with somebody for like a 
week.

1397
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,840
Like there's some sentence or thing that
they talked about that you remember.

1398
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,120
And I always remember that,
but I've always,

1399
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,130
you know,
I've known him ever since then.

1400
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,230
He never,
you know,

1401
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,600
he just kept plowing away and became,
you know,

1402
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
such a powerful,
funny comic like himself found himself 

1403
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:22,740
then became himself.
Yeah,

1404
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:24,030
totally.
And you know,

1405
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:26,190
again,
kind of had like sort of a hook of being

1406
01:01:26,191 --> 01:01:27,850
like the guy that's going to talk about,
you know,

1407
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:29,520
some pretty horrifying things

1408
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,530
with Doug Stanhope business.
The real deal,

1409
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:34,370
he's legit does and hope really is that 
guy.

1410
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,400
He really does live in a crazy house,
is painted weird colors,

1411
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:43,040
growing crazy house.
She really is on all sorts of fucking 

1412
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:43,040
crazy pills.
Joe,

1413
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,960
remember,
awesome American flag out there.

1414
01:01:44,961 --> 01:01:45,850
Yeah,
dude ass.

1415
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:50,851
Yeah,
I was there when he was still have 

1416
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:50,851
homeless people live on his fucking 
front lawn like Arizona,

1417
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:51,200
Utah.
He's in business.

1418
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:56,310
Well,
should I even say goes everywhere he 

1419
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:56,310
does.
He's lives in Arizona,

1420
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,940
but he tours and puts on his own,
like he kinda,

1421
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,810
you know.
Yeah,

1422
01:01:58,811 --> 01:01:59,380
it does.
It does.

1423
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,490
He tours like a Rockstar,
like he goes to town to town.

1424
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,540
Doug had a fucking house that was 
painted like an American flag in Venice 

1425
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,590
and we would go party at his house.
When we were doing the man show,

1426
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:14,591
he rented this House that was literally 
a fucking American flags and it was 

1427
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:16,160
right on the street and he had the 
little fenced in area in the front.

1428
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:21,161
He would let homeless people stay there,
so he had this homeless couple that was 

1429
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:24,081
staying there and the fucking woman 
stabbed the man and they got a video of 

1430
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:29,301
her looking at her hands because she had
blood on her hands from the guy she 

1431
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:32,130
stabbed and she was.
She had like an accent and she was like,

1432
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,000
I'm a company.
Come from my whole,

1433
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,190
I'm a,
I'm a whore.

1434
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,080
She kept saying something,
something.

1435
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:38,250
I'm a client,
I'm a whore,

1436
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,980
and she was looking at.
It was dark dude and this is all on Doug

1437
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,660
Stanhope been lost.
He was so crazy.

1438
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:46,530
I was like,
dude,

1439
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:50,190
you're hanging out with people who are 
like probably like severely imbalanced.

1440
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,700
It's not just a matter of them being 
homeless like the.

1441
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:57,820
A lot of the homeless people that you 
find on the streets are really people 

1442
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,680
that were kicked out of mental 
institutions,

1443
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,700
you know,
or got out of mental institutions that 

1444
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:03,700
didn't have anybody to take care of them
and there's a lot of crazy people

1445
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,120
or just lost their mind randomly and 
didn't,

1446
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,770
didn't fit in slowly

1447
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,820
but surely eroded until that was their 
reality.

1448
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:12,460
Their reality was there.
The rats of society.

1449
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,420
You know,

1450
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,480
that's funny that I brought,
when I brought dug up,

1451
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:18,670
I totally,
I totally skipped that whole,

1452
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,370
that you guys did a show together thing 
like I talking,

1453
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,450
I knew you knew who he was because he's 
so funny.

1454
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,330
But I was talking about it like,
you know,

1455
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,040
yeah.
You know,

1456
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,090
we both know who Doug Stanhope,
but you actually really know the guy.

1457
01:03:31,091 --> 01:03:36,091
Like I just run into them here and there
over the years and we've always been 

1458
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:38,530
friendly and I just recently just told 
them when you're in La,

1459
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,800
you know,
let me know because I want him on my 

1460
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:43,800
podcast.
He's been on this right?

1461
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,000
Yeah,
yeah,

1462
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,770
yeah,
yeah.

1463
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,350
He's awesome.
He's a funny.

1464
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,090
He's really doing it too.

1465
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,350
And his episode of Louis Ck show was 
great.

1466
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,430
Yeah.

1467
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,020
That was weird seeing him like that,
wasn't it?

1468
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,330
Yeah.
But also it's interesting,

1469
01:03:59,331 --> 01:04:00,560
amalgam of,
you know,

1470
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,810
what he's really like.
And then some,

1471
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,880
you know,
some things that,

1472
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,240
you know,
Louis just wrote for him to play that,

1473
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,830
you know,
we're,

1474
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,170
I guess Louis just sort of,
you know,

1475
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:15,590
rounding out the character in a dramatic
way because I don't know if I don't,

1476
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,710
I doubt Doug's ever gone to Louis and 
said I'm going to kill myself.

1477
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,270
Right.
It's been nice.

1478
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,290
It's been nice knowing you

1479
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,000
those not going to do that,
unless that was wrong.

1480
01:04:25,001 --> 01:04:27,280
And then he would do that.
Who is,

1481
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,060
he lived.
Totally.

1482
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:30,460
Hunter s Thompson himself,
a hunter.

1483
01:04:30,461 --> 01:04:31,780
S Thompson was done,
man.

1484
01:04:31,781 --> 01:04:36,781
He had hip replacement.
Surgery was in constant pain and he 

1485
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:36,781
couldn't walk,
couldn't swim.

1486
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:39,730
He was fucked up man.
And he didn't like living life like that

1487
01:04:39,731 --> 01:04:41,740
and he was 60 something years old and he
was like,

1488
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:43,540
that's it.
Boom.

1489
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:45,710
Checkout time,
you know?

1490
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:48,460
And he decided to do it that way.
Doug would do that,

1491
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:50,470
you think?
Yeah,

1492
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,120
yeah,
yeah.

1493
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,470
He would do that.
That's what I take bats.

1494
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:56,140
Yeah.
Make sure he's okay.

1495
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,470
You know what?
What's the alternative?

1496
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:03,130
Let it slowly run out of batteries.
Die In the corner.

1497
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,450
I don't know,
man.

1498
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,490
Exactly the alternative vaporizer 
coming.

1499
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,430
Um,
it's probably heated up by now.

1500
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,120
Well,
it still says read on it.

1501
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,530
I think that's a nice special effect to 
me.

1502
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,200
I mean,
how long do you think we've been talking

1503
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:18,040
for?
Twenty minutes.

1504
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,050
An hour and five minutes.
No Way.

1505
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,070
That's ridiculous.
This podcast is to easy,

1506
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,740
Doug.
You're not.

1507
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,630
Casting is so much fun.
It's so much fun.

1508
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:30,910
It's the most fun thing we've ever done,
you know,

1509
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:33,970
as far as like the most honest 
connection with people,

1510
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:39,330
you know,
and you just sit there and talk and for 

1511
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:39,550
people like that,
they're like working right now.

1512
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,340
You know,
I,

1513
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,310
I,
I think it's the coolest thing ever.

1514
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:44,410
I'm so happy that we can do something 
like this.

1515
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,630
You know,
entertainers want to entertain,

1516
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,700
you know,
I mean comics want to be funny,

1517
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,240
people want to talk.
It's,

1518
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,980
we love doing it,
you know?

1519
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,520
So the fact that it's such an honest 
relationship,

1520
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,170
we love doing it.
We put it out there,

1521
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:57,100
it's free,
boom.

1522
01:05:57,101 --> 01:06:00,400
People enjoy it.
It's such a great relationship.

1523
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,550
You know what I'm saying?
You creating friends all over the place,

1524
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,170
that's what you're doing,
you know,

1525
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:07,490
and that's the people that come out to 
see you at the,

1526
01:06:07,491 --> 01:06:11,740
at the comedy clubs.
They're friends now because I just,

1527
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,870
just this last weekend,

1528
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:16,390
funny because I was in Arizona in 
flagstaff and then um,

1529
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:21,550
Phoenix and uh,
I didn't know I was going to be doing 

1530
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:21,550
the show this week,
you know,

1531
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:21,620
I thought,
oh,

1532
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:23,320
I'll be on again at some point.
You know,

1533
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,940
I,
I figured I'd be back here on the show,

1534
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:30,941
but I didn't know you called me like 
yesterday or the day before and we set 

1535
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:33,530
this up.
So last weekend there's about,

1536
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,170
there's about,
over the course of a couple of shows,

1537
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:39,740
there's probably about a good 10,
15 people who said to me,

1538
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:43,190
go on Joe show again or I want to hear 
you on Joe show again.

1539
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,180
And I was just like,
yeah,

1540
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:45,520
don't worry about it.
It'll happen.

1541
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,740
And they're probably right now being 
like,

1542
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:51,910
what the fuck he was going to be on the 
couple of days later.

1543
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,460
We don't really schedule this thing and 
advanced folks.

1544
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,040
We'd keep this bitches organic as 
possible.

1545
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,150
But also you're dealing with

1546
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,690
the schedules have,
you know,

1547
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:03,220
I mostly have your comedian friends,
you know,

1548
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,820
they're all in and out of town and have 
shit to do.

1549
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:10,990
Well,
this is what the coolest thing about it 

1550
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:10,990
is that,
you know,

1551
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:10,990
most of us are around.
If we're around,

1552
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,050
we're around like the days we do the 
podcast,

1553
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:13,520
like Tuesday,
Thursday,

1554
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,090
and now it really has an impact on,
on guys gigs too.

1555
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,060
Especially Duncan.
Duncan's getting like some fucking sweet

1556
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:22,130
gigs.
He's getting an pack in places.

1557
01:07:22,131 --> 01:07:26,840
Man Dunkin sold out his first show ever 
in Seattle and he was tripping out.

1558
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:27,230
It's like

1559
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,100
the fuck man.

1560
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,010
That's awesome.
He brought back little Hobo puppet thing

1561
01:07:35,011 --> 01:07:40,011
that he does the Hobo love.
I love the new dol itself,

1562
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:41,880
you mean?
Yeah,

1563
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:46,881
it's awesome.
It's little Hobo is one of my all time 

1564
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:47,310
favorite bits and people either get it 
or they don't get it,

1565
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,010
but either way it's fun for me.
I love it.

1566
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,950
Oh yeah.
When they don't get angry in comedy.

1567
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:53,810
It's so funny.
Well,

1568
01:07:53,811 --> 01:07:56,040
if they get uncomfortable,
sometimes it's even more fun.

1569
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:58,400
You know,
just dumped shit.

1570
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,260
Fucking send some,
you know,

1571
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:05,300
he says some dark shit in that bit.
I don't want to kill any of his 

1572
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:05,300
punchlines.
Yeah,

1573
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,040
don't talk about that.
There's a lot of people that hear that 

1574
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:09,040
and get what?
He got.

1575
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,650
A bunch of people walk out on him and 
Atlanta.

1576
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:11,850
Georgia.
Are you serious?

1577
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:13,940
Yeah.
Christian couple got up and left.

1578
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,650
He talking,
talking about Jesus onstage.

1579
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,040
Hey Man.
People have their beliefs.

1580
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,360
They don't want you to fucking with 
their beliefs.

1581
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,170
They didn't come to a comedy show to get
change.

1582
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:27,080
God dammit.
They came to a comedy show to laugh.

1583
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,830
Did you ever can't make everybody laugh?
You're no good.

1584
01:08:30,831 --> 01:08:34,630
Mr Comedian she ever had family reunions
growing up like,

1585
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,260
like,
no.

1586
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:40,270
You met at a park with other parts of 
families that you didn't know you were 

1587
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:41,990
connected to at all and like these like,
wait,

1588
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,270
that's your second cousin to the left 
and you're like,

1589
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:49,271
what the fuck?
I'm related to that person now that you 

1590
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:49,271
recall?
Yeah,

1591
01:08:49,271 --> 01:08:52,920
New Jersey.
I guess when I was real young we did 

1592
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,061
have a few of those.
I was really young when I was before I 

1593
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:57,701
was sick so I barely remember it like 
you said it and it makes me like have 

1594
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,770
little flashes that might not even be 
real know they were put in there,

1595
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:03,890
but I talk about this on stage which is 
true.

1596
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,890
I remember one vivid moment when I was 
young because everybody was mad at me 

1597
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,180
because I hit my cousin with a bag of 
cookies and everybody was mad because 

1598
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:15,980
the cookies went flying and I remember 
the cookie of looking at the cookies and

1599
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:20,981
the dirt and shit.
I fucked up but I was like four and 

1600
01:09:20,981 --> 01:09:21,950
people were angry at me and I remember 
that.

1601
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:27,220
It's amazing that they.
That there could be even a semi vivid 

1602
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,350
memory.
I mean,

1603
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:29,540
when you say like I have a vivid memory 
of it,

1604
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:32,450
what does really mean?
How much are you extrapolating?

1605
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:34,910
How much are you,
how much are you exaggerating?

1606
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:40,030
How vivid is it real?
It was big enough in the first place to 

1607
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:42,740
some form of it his and sometimes like 
because that's the thing that's crazy to

1608
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:47,741
me.
It's like whenever somebody remembers a 

1609
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:49,340
ton of stuff from when they were little,
I'm always kind of baffled by that.

1610
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,340
I think it's almost like they're just 
sort of taking what they kind of 

1611
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,520
remember and then just going ahead and 
filling out the story.

1612
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,040
Exactly.
I think that is a lot of what happens.

1613
01:09:58,041 --> 01:10:03,041
I don't think our memories and I fucking
good and I think they don't understand 

1614
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,460
really where memory is stored.
You know,

1615
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:09,461
the,
the issue with memory and the brain is 

1616
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:12,461
that they believed that every seven 
years virtually every cell in the body 

1617
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,330
has regenerated and reborn in new.
So there's a new version,

1618
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:21,331
like in seven years.
Every cell is different than the seven 

1619
01:10:21,331 --> 01:10:24,260
years before except the neurons.
And so they don't know if that memory is

1620
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:29,261
stored somehow in the neurons or if it's
just sort of handed down like files.

1621
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,840
Like every seven years you got a new 
administration comes in and goes,

1622
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:34,010
look,
this is the past,

1623
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,600
this is the uncle that fuck them.

1624
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,180
This is the thing that happened in 
second grade.

1625
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,570
This is the car accident.
All this is,

1626
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,690
you've got to remember this.
So you got it,

1627
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:46,750
got it.
And then they take it and then seven 

1628
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,121
years later out,
have pockets of things you don't 

1629
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:51,440
remember or the things you remembered at
one point and don't remember anymore.

1630
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,740
I,
I hold at episodes of my life.

1631
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,590
I don't remember.
I watched like an old fear factory run.

1632
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,860
I had no recollection of any of it.
And it was only 10 years ago and I'm 

1633
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:03,800
watching.
I don't remember this.

1634
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,570
I don't remember this happening.
I don't remember this.

1635
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,780
This is weird.
I have the two earliest memories I have 

1636
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,140
when is breaking a pickle jar at a 
grocery store?

1637
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:13,980
Like one of the huge and it just 
remember

1638
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,980
it being scary.
I remember like doing it and stuff like 

1639
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:18,980
that.
And falling in,

1640
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:18,980
I guess,
I think it was like two or three when it

1641
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,781
happened and the other one is getting 
attacked by a bunch of chickens at this 

1642
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:23,781
farm.
And I got picked.

1643
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:25,500
I think I've said that before where I 
got back and I have a scar in between my

1644
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:30,060
nose because I was near a chicken nest.
Eat Chicken every day,

1645
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,160
but fried chicken every day with one 
hand on my Dick.

1646
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,950
Right.
But both of those memories I remember,

1647
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,380
like I remember that happening.
I remember the pickle jar.

1648
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:44,580
I remember being attacked by chickens,
but I don't remember it in first person.

1649
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,930
I remember kind of being above and 
looking down at myself while my.

1650
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:52,950
Well that's the files you've got handed 
down the third person view with those 

1651
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:56,160
both stories that uh,
the family liked to tell.

1652
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,650
Like remember we know that huge pickle 
jar.

1653
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,680
Not really.
Like every time I bring it up to my mom,

1654
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,160
she has no idea.
She has no idea.

1655
01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:04,710
I have to like remember.
And then she goes,

1656
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:07,380
that wasn't an important file for her 
when she was.

1657
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:09,600
She didn't need to remember that.
Yeah.

1658
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:14,930
Yeah.
That's brutal when your parents don't 

1659
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:14,930
remember important shit that happened to
you and that's a big thing like breaking

1660
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,140
a pickle jar.
Come on by.

1661
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:21,141
Poor little brian could have been dead 
to the fell on the sharpest point of 

1662
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:21,141
that.

1663
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:22,230
It could be the over.
Yeah.

1664
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:23,590
He could have died.
Right?

1665
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,480
If it cut me night,
I almost fell off a cliff.

1666
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,690
I almost fell off a cliff in San 
Francisco.

1667
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,100
I was like,
yeah,

1668
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:36,310
am I grabbed up?
My father grabbed me at the very last 

1669
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,310
second.
He's your angel.

1670
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,500
Yup.
Yeah,

1671
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,630
some cliffs,
San Francisco.

1672
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:44,690
Some little areas we walk like down near
the beach that are really kind of 

1673
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:44,690
sketchy.
You know,

1674
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:47,150
there's some areas we could fall down 
and really fuck yourself up,

1675
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:48,190
man.
You could die.

1676
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,970
Yeah.
The whole.

1677
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
That whole Pacific coast highway is so 
immensely fucking beautiful but so scary

1678
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,270
given drive that,
that,

1679
01:12:57,271 --> 01:13:01,610
that the pch.
Francisco was that wild?

1680
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,470
Doesn't that make your balls just tingle
like their crackling like they have?

1681
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,830
What does that say?
Stuff?

1682
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:10,220
The snap pop rocks.
Remember pop rocks that would do to your

1683
01:13:10,221 --> 01:13:10,610
mouth.

1684
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:17,860
That's what makes your balls feel like 
when you're going around the whole 

1685
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,200
Pacific coast highway,
looking at that fucking cliff,

1686
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:23,030
that fucking drop that's right there,
right there,

1687
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:26,690
and it's forever and the ground moves 
around this bitch all the time.

1688
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:30,050
It's like you're essentially playing a 
game of musical chairs.

1689
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,320
You're just hoping you can get from this
point to that point where the really 

1690
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,491
thin fucking outcropping that you're a 
little metal boxes driving around with 

1691
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:43,661
nothing to stop you from just driving 
right the fuck off the thing into the 

1692
01:13:43,661 --> 01:13:46,580
ground and the rocks in the ocean.
You never drive it in a storm.

1693
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,470
Oh my God.
You did iop.

1694
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,630
Yeah.
I've had situations where like,

1695
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:51,860
you know,
where it's like a,

1696
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,830
the waves are crashing up on it.
I was,

1697
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,170
I was stone cold sober.
I was,

1698
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,010
it was a sunny day.
Um,

1699
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:01,610
I was wide awake and I was still 
shitting my pants.

1700
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:04,490
I was like,
this is a crazy drive man.

1701
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:08,660
It's weird to look at.
It's just a mind fuck.

1702
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:13,300
It's a mind fuck that just a little,
you know,

1703
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:18,301
or someone's coming at you,
you're trusting this other asshole that 

1704
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:20,530
you don't even know to not be texting 
right now to not be fingering himself.

1705
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:25,000
You know your tampons with Paulina 
asleep.

1706
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:30,720
All of those at one of those at once.
Everything tsunami of bad luck coming 

1707
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:32,950
your way and you're on the left hand 
lane.

1708
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:37,810
You get bumped off into the fucking 
great blue yonder of the ocean floor.

1709
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:41,680
Fuck man.
That's a crazy way to drive.

1710
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:42,980
You know,
I would like to.

1711
01:14:42,981 --> 01:14:46,060
I like to have less worry about death in
my drawer.

1712
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:49,040
Driving is always scary to me.
I mean just today I was driving,

1713
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:54,041
there was fucking like a sandbag truck 
overturned or something like that and 

1714
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,100
they're just sandbags everywhere in the 
highway out of nowhere.

1715
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:57,360
Like you're just driving all these sand 
bags.

1716
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:02,390
Dude,
I hit a fucking one of those railroad 

1717
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,940
ties,
those iron things.

1718
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,350
What are those?
The tracks.

1719
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:06,690
Not at tire track.
Section of track.

1720
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,700
Someone had dropped on the fucking 
highway.

1721
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:14,180
I was driving and I saw it last minute.
I saw this thing and I was like,

1722
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:19,490
oh fuck.
Like I remember gripping with both 

1723
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:23,421
hands.
There's no way I could turn if I tried 

1724
01:15:23,421 --> 01:15:23,421
to turn out what I would have flipped 
the car,

1725
01:15:23,421 --> 01:15:24,570
you know,
it was just too close and I hit it and I

1726
01:15:24,571 --> 01:15:29,571
got the car launched into the air,
the carwash and blew the fucking tires 

1727
01:15:31,141 --> 01:15:33,060
right off the rims.
Like the bolt,

1728
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:38,240
I think at least one of them,
like literally was shredded and I drove 

1729
01:15:38,461 --> 01:15:43,461
on rims to the next exit and got out and
just called the tow truck and had it 

1730
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:45,840
dealt with.
But it was a spooky moment.

1731
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,700
Man.
I hit that fucking thing.

1732
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,260
I sought last minute.
I'm like,

1733
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,610
Oh fuck,
that's metal.

1734
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:55,730
You know,
it's like that thing fucking.

1735
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,490
Oh my God.
It's not lucky.

1736
01:15:59,491 --> 01:16:00,270
It didn't.
You know,

1737
01:16:00,271 --> 01:16:02,640
sometimes when you drive over something 
too,

1738
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:06,030
like you can,
you can rip out the bottom of your car,

1739
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,210
you know,
it could come up and it can go into the 

1740
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:11,210
bottom of your car and can drop a tranny
real easy.

1741
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:14,430
Fuck yeah.
I just wanted to say that in adult life,

1742
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:20,120
a dropped his tranny in highschool guys 
are blow their fucking their 

1743
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,030
transmission apart,
doing donuts.

1744
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,450
There was a common thing guys would fuck
up their trainees.

1745
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:28,020
We'd hear him driving the next day here,
the transmission best find clank,

1746
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:33,021
clank,
clank clank because guys were doing 

1747
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:33,021
smoke shows.

1748
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:36,420
It's San Diego.
When I was in high school there was 

1749
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,311
this,
there was this street where it was kind 

1750
01:16:38,311 --> 01:16:38,430
of like a San Francisco style street 
where it went down,

1751
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:43,470
it went pretty steep and then straight 
for just a bit and then steep again and 

1752
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:46,210
you could fuck in.
You could get air and you know,

1753
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:50,800
if you want it to going down.
And so we would intentionally drive fast

1754
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:53,060
enough to get the car up into the air.
And it was like,

1755
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:55,900
it's the dumbest thing you could do.
Most people don't know,

1756
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:57,760
but we all got away with it because,
you know,

1757
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:00,070
everyone just did it a few times.
The dukes of Hazzard,

1758
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:02,380
I believe you ever fuck your car.
Um,

1759
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:07,410
did you ever break it?
W W one time on another hill driving 

1760
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,290
with some friends as a joke,
I,

1761
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,590
uh,
or as a joke,

1762
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,070
I just,
for

1763
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:15,070
whatever reason I was gonna I was trying
to throw the car in neutral and I throw 

1764
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,150
it into reverse while going know quickly
downhill.

1765
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,930
Oh my fucking noise at that made with.
Oh my God.

1766
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:21,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1767
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,170
I immediately had to just pull the car 
over and,

1768
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,870
you know,
get it,

1769
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:28,330
get it towed and get it fixed and just 
exploded your transmission.

1770
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:28,660
I,
yeah,

1771
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,710
just really they shouldn't be able to go
there.

1772
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:32,580
It shouldn't be able to go into reverse 
that.

1773
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,240
You shouldn't be able to do that.
But it was like an old.

1774
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,210
It was like an AMC Hornet.
Oh.

1775
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,700
And uh,
it was,

1776
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:42,020
it was pretty dumb why you're going in 
for direction.

1777
01:17:42,021 --> 01:17:47,021
Isn't there a way to engineer some sort 
of a way that doesn't just think you 

1778
01:17:47,021 --> 01:17:47,920
can't anymore?
I don't think you are.

1779
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,160
Yeah.
You have to kind of,

1780
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,670
you move it to the side,
you know,

1781
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:54,480
it's almost like a stick shift where you
have to kind of a medicine bottle or cut

1782
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,840
into each each level or whatever.

1783
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,460
But you know,
I was a kid,

1784
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,350
teenager,
you a silly,

1785
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,610
goofy,
odd,

1786
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,790
did so much silly shit when I was a kid.
It's amazing.

1787
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:05,690
The kids should be allowed to drive 
cars.

1788
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:10,810
Oh,
it's so now when I'm driving around and 

1789
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:10,810
if I get cut off by somebody that looks 
like they're 15,

1790
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,380
16.
I was just like such assholes.

1791
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,820
Like also when I was that age I,
I was an asshole driver,

1792
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:20,690
but I didn't have all I had was maybe an
occasional fast food from the driving.

1793
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,730
I didn't have texting,
you know,

1794
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:27,731
I didn't have headphones on or all,
all the,

1795
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,690
all the distractions of today and now I 
can't believe that there's any,

1796
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,040
there's anywhere in a car that has a,
a,

1797
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,830
a,
you know,

1798
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,270
a TV.
There's not like,

1799
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:39,920
there's not like a limo that's being 
driven by a professional.

1800
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:40,650
You know what I mean?

1801
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:45,850
Like,
just even if you have your kids in the 

1802
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,591
backseat watching some shit on TV,
wouldn't that be an extra distraction 

1803
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:47,830
that.
No,

1804
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,840
it's the opposite dangerous or you just 
like how focused it makes the kids to 

1805
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,680
kids zone out for kids are done.
But why do you.

1806
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:57,440
But you definitely don't need a TV up,
up above the rear view mirror.

1807
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,280
No,
that's stupid.

1808
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:00,620
That's ridiculous.
You can't see that's,

1809
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:02,810
that's how it is.
And I rented a car,

1810
01:19:02,811 --> 01:19:07,811
um,
I rented a who was an escalator 

1811
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:08,630
navigator,
one of those and that's what the TV was.

1812
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:11,900
The TV would come down in the center and
they would block the view.

1813
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:12,830
You,
you couldn't see,

1814
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,330
you look over your rear view or like a,
you know,

1815
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:21,250
to watch it when you're not in motion,
you're supposed to watch an emotion 

1816
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:21,250
because the kids,
you know,

1817
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:21,560
that's when,
that's one of the tunes amount,

1818
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,800
but the better ones are on the headsets 
and now they have them on the headsets 

1819
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:26,800
where you can have a.

1820
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,350
each one is watching a different thing 
so they can watch their headphones.

1821
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,770
When you have limited time,
you got a three and a half year old.

1822
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,230
That's the perfect shit.
They just zonked out.

1823
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,990
No more questions.
It's just a watch.

1824
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:42,470
Dora the explorer and they have a good 
old fucking time so they don't even mind

1825
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:43,670
driving.
You know,

1826
01:19:43,671 --> 01:19:48,671
they don't mind driving because driving 
for them it's like going to the movies 

1827
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:51,460
they have like cool little dvds they 
watch and they have a good time and the 

1828
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,910
dvds you can get like little educational
ones.

1829
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,390
So it's actually good for them.
I love them.

1830
01:19:56,410 --> 01:20:01,410
Watch like,
you know there's like your kid can read 

1831
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:04,481
and shit.
Kids are going to be way smarter today 

1832
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:07,060
than we were.
We didn't get access to anything until 

1833
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:07,060
we were fucking.
It's gonna be cool in the future.

1834
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,060
I bet you the babies

1835
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:13,060
are going to be so smart at such a young
age that they're going to be able to 

1836
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:13,060
drive cars for you.
So they're going to be like,

1837
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,190
as a kid,
being able to see the babies,

1838
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:19,191
then we're going to be able to drive for
you firing of the mine where you didn't 

1839
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:24,690
think about that at all.
Babies out of the womb,

1840
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:27,120
we're just going to drive.
You never know they could drive everyone

1841
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:29,370
around.
Driving is gonna be so easy because it's

1842
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:34,371
all going to have magnets around your 
whole car that they just have to push 

1843
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:34,890
one button for like on or sign.
You're such a silly man.

1844
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,410
Such a silly mad,
you know?

1845
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,880
Why do,
why do you want more babies?

1846
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:43,881
I need more drivers.
I need more people driving me around 

1847
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:47,020
that I don't ever see and knowing no one
wouldn't want to have sex with.

1848
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,750
It would just be a matter of,
yeah,

1849
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:54,010
life experience,
but you have full intelligence right 

1850
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:54,010
away.
He just needed life experience.

1851
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,230
So we make you work as a driver for the 
first years.

1852
01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:02,350
People are going to be a DM or smarter.
They're going to be in some areas 

1853
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:04,370
they're going to be dumber because some 
things are going to become obsolete.

1854
01:21:04,371 --> 01:21:06,740
Like you're not going to ever need to 
know a phone number.

1855
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,390
Math maybe,
but hopefully people will adaptation,

1856
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:12,890
right?
I mean that's what's going on.

1857
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:16,280
We're adapting to this new environment.
We're adapting to these new needs.

1858
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,600
You know,
it's unquestionably something's 

1859
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,860
happening and we're getting to a 
symbiotic relationship with technology,

1860
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:30,130
but can you imagine how much space in 
your brain is available that would 15,

1861
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:35,630
20 years ago be full of phone numbers 
that you don't need to remember anymore,

1862
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,670
but don't you remember a lot of 
different things now?

1863
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,760
Don't you think that you have a lot of 
information that you get through the 

1864
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:42,920
Internet that probably would never get 
before?

1865
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,210
You know,
a lot of people,

1866
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:49,360
it was difficult for them to be 
stimulated in the days before the 

1867
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,331
Internet,
but today there's not a time in the 

1868
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:52,331
world where I'm in an airport that has 
wifi.

1869
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:53,560
We're on board yet,
but you know,

1870
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,140
I love.
I love the airport wife.

1871
01:21:55,190 --> 01:22:00,190
You know what I'm saying?
Will you just sit there and you can 

1872
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,280
either goof around or get stuff done,
but either way you're killing the time.

1873
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:02,830
You're.
Yeah,

1874
01:22:02,831 --> 01:22:03,220
you're,
you're,

1875
01:22:03,221 --> 01:22:03,920
you're,
you know,

1876
01:22:03,921 --> 01:22:06,530
you're enjoying yourself.
You're actually having a good time.

1877
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:11,531
You're getting entertained,
but you are also using a different than 

1878
01:22:11,531 --> 01:22:11,531
some people

1879
01:22:11,531 --> 01:22:15,610
use the internet.
A lot of people just go in there and 

1880
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,100
play cards and talk about video games.
I have

1881
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:21,100
a say if you have a,
an hour to kill and you were at the 

1882
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,100
airport,
you know,

1883
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,851
you log on your favorite video game for 
them and you find out what the hell's 

1884
01:22:24,851 --> 01:22:27,710
going on.
It's entertaining and then listen to 

1885
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,440
podcasts.
It's um,

1886
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,030
it's very,
it's a very interesting,

1887
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:36,290
like a progression to try to like look 
ahead too.

1888
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:39,200
It's like what the fuck is this going to
go next?

1889
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:44,400
Like what does the next symbiotic 
relationship between human beings and 

1890
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,651
technology?
Because the cell phone is pretty much a 

1891
01:22:47,651 --> 01:22:47,870
part of your body.
So what's next phase?

1892
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:52,930
People having sex.
You really think it's actual fake 

1893
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:53,420
people.
Flashlights that have emotions.

1894
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:59,350
It's the fucking same emotions.
You can turn it off the emotions that 

1895
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:03,431
would get people dick hard.
I do like porn where this seems to be 

1896
01:23:03,431 --> 01:23:06,100
having fun more than porn.
Whereas people seem to be,

1897
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
you know,
I just watched the other day that was 

1898
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,371
just random.
People like watching porn where people 

1899
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:14,950
fight and then they fuck.
And then when they fuck the,

1900
01:23:14,951 --> 01:23:15,970
like,
you know,

1901
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,110
get back at each other and then resolve 
their issues through fucking like people

1902
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:25,111
liked those.
They like videos like that when people 

1903
01:23:25,111 --> 01:23:25,111
were actually angry at each other 
because that's when they have their best

1904
01:23:25,111 --> 01:23:30,040
sucks.
A lot of people have the best sex they 

1905
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:30,040
ever have.
It's makeup sex.

1906
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,690
Like this girl that will like.
I firmly believe they have learned to 

1907
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,770
start fights so that the man will step 
in,

1908
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:40,830
are you with them for a little bit?
Then they resolve everything they make 

1909
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:43,771
up.
They say they love you and then they 

1910
01:23:43,771 --> 01:23:45,281
fuck.
And they love it and they have like 

1911
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:46,560
super extra charge fucking.
So I think they start problems and men 

1912
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,860
and women I'm sure because they like a 
store.

1913
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:52,060
It's why women can read a pornographic 
things and men need to see them.

1914
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:57,120
It's women like the story the women 
liked what leads up to having the 

1915
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:01,380
foreplay sold.
They like drama crazy for you like it to

1916
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:02,860
have a beginning,
middle and end.

1917
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:05,710
And then the and has to go on for longer
than we want it to.

1918
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:10,920
Have you ever thought what it would be 
like to be a woman for a day or every 10

1919
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,270
years that microwave with the 
cantaloupe?

1920
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,280
Dang.
Brian's life would be not much 

1921
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,280
different.
He would just be a lesbian.

1922
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,890
No,
I,

1923
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:26,891
I,
I've said this before where when I was 

1924
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:29,251
younger I would like look at my boobs 
and act like they were real boobs and 

1925
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:30,870
then try to kiss him,
but that's about as close as to.

1926
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,130
That's the question though.
If you're.

1927
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,960
Are you a girl for a day?

1928
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,960
Who wants cock?
Are you a girl for a day and go for the 

1929
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:39,960
whole experience?
Oh,

1930
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:40,820
I wish you'd get fucked too.
I wouldn't want the.

1931
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:45,400
I would probably be interesting to feel 
what it would feel like to get fucked,

1932
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:49,510
but I couldn't do the memory is a dick 
in me.

1933
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:52,020
Yeah.
And in your mouth to stop.

1934
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,750
No,
no.

1935
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,520
Thanks.
Mentioned period would be like,

1936
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,160
I'm a girl for a day.
I'm going to convert to being a.

1937
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,540
don't they say Jewish girls don't don't 
like to blow.

1938
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,000
No.
Jewish girls love to do it.

1939
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:08,520
That's crazy nonsense.
I love it.

1940
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:14,140
Oh wait,
isn't there some sort of girls that 

1941
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:18,250
don't don't like to blow dudes or is 
that just girls in general?

1942
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:23,251
I don't know.
It's just always going to be dudes 

1943
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,931
complaining because that's what.
That's what's fun about porn that you 

1944
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:27,790
can't often get a girl that you're just 
hooking up with or whatever in porn that

1945
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:31,170
they often act like it's the most 
delicious thing could have.

1946
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,010
So I know most girls are just started 
like just doing,

1947
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:36,010
just doing what they gotta do to get it 
over with.

1948
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,910
Some girls know,
some girls love Derek.

1949
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:43,390
You've got to find them.
You know why it's kind of gross of a 

1950
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:44,170
girl sucking your cock and she doesn't 
want to.

1951
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,880
Doesn't want to like wants to please 
you,

1952
01:25:48,881 --> 01:25:51,210
but also doesn't think it's the most 
delicious thing.

1953
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,470
She's like eating pussy.
Don't get any posts.

1954
01:25:53,471 --> 01:25:54,220
I do,
I love it.

1955
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:59,221
But how could anybody think I love the 
pleasing the person is or maybe a little

1956
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:04,110
sense of control is the most important 
part than then

1957
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,450
how it tastes and looks and feels.
Those are all good too,

1958
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:10,490
but you know,
I think that it's more like,

1959
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,440
it's just fun.
It's just fun to,

1960
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:17,500
you know,
because that's a great way to please a 

1961
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:17,500
woman,
Doug Benson and putting it out there,

1962
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,500
bitches as,
as you will.

1963
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,580
How often do you eat out,

1964
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,600
have,
you know,

1965
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:32,410
whenever it's there,
whenever the time is right,

1966
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,720
maybe some brunch will be some happy 
hour

1967
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,280
maybe after dinner as eating.
What does that mean?

1968
01:26:38,281 --> 01:26:40,260
Eating ass licking a girl's asshole

1969
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,310
don't like that.
I love when people,

1970
01:26:44,311 --> 01:26:45,660
when you talk about something and they 
go,

1971
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:47,130
yeah,
and then they say,

1972
01:26:47,131 --> 01:26:48,260
no,
no,

1973
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:49,470
no,
don't do that.

1974
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:50,820
I did.
It's awesome.

1975
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,290
Frenching it.
That's a no,

1976
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:54,930
but that's an immediate reaction.
You know when someone says,

1977
01:26:54,931 --> 01:26:55,980
yeah,
I don't think so.

1978
01:26:56,150 --> 01:27:01,150
You know,
it's like that's what that same Dusky 

1979
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:01,150
guy should have said when they asked him
why you were attracted to young boys.

1980
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:01,800
Yeah,
I don't think so.

1981
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:03,090
No.
Instead he's like,

1982
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:05,640
he repeated like asked me again if I eat
a lot of ass.

1983
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:07,410
Are you,
do you eat a lot of ass too?

1984
01:27:07,411 --> 01:27:12,220
I eat a lot of.
No,

1985
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,440
I don't eat a lot of.
It was the world's greatest athlete.

1986
01:27:18,690 --> 01:27:20,840
That's a world champion.
Well,

1987
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:26,630
the stacks of theater don't eat enough.
This should totally be trophies for the 

1988
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:26,630
best

1989
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,660
assay eating.
That's a God damn adventure.

1990
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:32,330
You can get trophies for parasailing.
Who should get trophies for ass eating.

1991
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:38,490
Why not asking in contests?
What if the world were free and we 

1992
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,691
weren't so worried about things.
Pornography could be judged on the 

1993
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:46,350
merits of technique.
Zero percent toilet paper in the ass is 

1994
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,040
always important.
That's very important.

1995
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:53,130
Toilet paper when you,
when you go down on a girl and you find 

1996
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:54,880
toilet paper just dangling off her ass 
and so disturbing that it's probably one

1997
01:27:54,881 --> 01:27:57,540
of the things that keeps me out of that,
out of that region.

1998
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:02,550
It's just could backfire.
I had back in so it's not ruin anything.

1999
01:28:03,701 --> 01:28:05,680
I don't want her to be upset.
I get a little stubble.

2000
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:06,910
It's like essentially,
you know,

2001
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:11,911
it's like a little bit of sandpaper.
You rubbed some toilet paper on some 

2002
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:14,350
sandpaper.
You're gonna leave some residue.

2003
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,850
Do you like stuff in your ass?

2004
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:17,080
No.
No.

2005
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:21,060
You said that.
I'm actually very scared.

2006
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:26,090
I was like,
this is the end of a long conversation 

2007
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:26,090
like stuffing your ass.

2008
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:28,220
I'm very scared of my ass.
I don't know if I told her.

2009
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:30,730
It's just,
it's good I guess in my diet.

2010
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,170
That's good.
Your meat diet,

2011
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:34,930
how often are you vegetables?
I eat them every day,

2012
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:39,931
but that's just,
I don't know what you should do is what 

2013
01:28:39,931 --> 01:28:41,620
I do and I just need to get on,
get on the Kale shakes.

2014
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:44,260
I'm telling you.
It's not that delicious,

2015
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,250
but I don't mind eating Kale so much.
I kind of picked that up every once in a

2016
01:28:48,251 --> 01:28:53,251
while.
Like the whole foods or something like 

2017
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:53,251
along with the.
Yeah,

2018
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:53,251
yeah,
yeah.

2019
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:58,380
Not Bad,
but a shake of Kevin James turned me 

2020
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:01,681
onto this shit and um,
he started doing it in the lost like 80 

2021
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:02,190
pounds when he's doing essentially

2022
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,530
takes cucumbers,
Kale,

2023
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:05,250
celery,
this,

2024
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:06,210
how I do it,
cucumbers,

2025
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:06,960
Kale,
celery,

2026
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,360
and I put a chunk of ginger in there 
too.

2027
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:12,540
And a whole pear ginger anymore.
It drives me crazy.

2028
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:14,100
I think.
I hate gender like that.

2029
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:15,930
I like to put some gas in there.
Yeah,

2030
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:18,450
pull the last name.
I like the sting of ginger.

2031
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:20,730
I like that.
Yeah,

2032
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:25,810
it's very spicy,
but I liked that it's good for you and 

2033
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:27,600
so anyway,
I blend it all up in this vitamix thing.

2034
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:32,601
You ever see a vitamix?
It's like a mixer designed to to 

2035
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:35,420
pulverize it.
It's not really juicing because it's 

2036
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:38,391
just chopping the living fuck out of all
these vegetables until it's like a soup 

2037
01:29:38,391 --> 01:29:41,580
and then you drink this soup and it's 
fucking.

2038
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,380
It's not bad.
It doesn't taste bad.

2039
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:48,060
It's just sort of a task and you lose 
weight because you're losing weight,

2040
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,760
vegetables and there's no other feeling 
bad.

2041
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,790
You feel it's a giant serving of 
vegetables,

2042
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:56,280
like much more vegetables probably than 
you would ever really eat.

2043
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,200
Oh yeah.
You have to force myself to eat.

2044
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:01,860
Most of it can eat like six giant leaves
of Kale,

2045
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:04,440
10 stalks of Celery,
a whole cucumber.

2046
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,140
It's rare that you would eat that many 
vegetables in one sitting.

2047
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:12,141
You could do it,
but this is even better because it's 

2048
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:12,750
completely taken the whole chewing down 
process out.

2049
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,910
So you're.
You're digesting it,

2050
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:18,360
you're swallowing it,
and it's like just incinerated,

2051
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:23,361
just chopped up into little tiny pieces 
and it's like really easily absorbed by 

2052
01:30:23,361 --> 01:30:27,171
your body and your shit's magnifical.
The shits become easier because.

2053
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:32,640
So lubed up to though do your whole 
system is just whenever you have.

2054
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:37,670
If you have a steak later,
it slides out like a Toboggan for your 

2055
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:40,380
vitamix Joe.
This is a late night drink,

2056
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:44,010
like with some food vodka,
ice,

2057
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:47,200
a red seedless grapes,
like a lot of red seat lit,

2058
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:51,120
scrapes and a little bit to apples and 
it's,

2059
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:53,520
it's a,
it's kind of like grape Fyedka,

2060
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,980
but like it's got a little bit of a 
texture to it.

2061
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,390
It's cool.
Wow,

2062
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:58,860
I love that.
That's a great idea.

2063
01:30:58,861 --> 01:31:01,830
So you make like a little smoothing mega
little smitty and if you,

2064
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:03,010
if you have any,
uh,

2065
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:04,230
not,
um,

2066
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,130
what's that sweetener that's made out of
a cactus or something like that?

2067
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,630
If you have any of that,
put that in there.

2068
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,120
Dva?
Yeah.

2069
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,870
You can use to Gaba.
Gaba,

2070
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:16,500
I use the Gaba.
Gaba is not so good for you.

2071
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,350
It's why not?
I don't know.

2072
01:31:19,351 --> 01:31:24,351
I read that somewhere I need to research
that somebody had said that a Gaba is 

2073
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:25,240
not good for you.
I think like any artificial sweeteners,

2074
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,170
so it's,
it's a,

2075
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,170
they make a tequila out of it.
Yeah.

2076
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:35,760
But it's a plant is a plant and it's a 
real sweet plant and you know,

2077
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,760
that's uh,
somehow or another they make to kill out

2078
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:43,410
of that process.
So that word a lot associated with.

2079
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,730
I made lemonade the other day with it,
with the garbage.

2080
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:47,820
It was really delicious,
but I was drinking.

2081
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:49,260
I was like,
it's probably not so good for you.

2082
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,280
Why?
Why?

2083
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,350
No?
Stevia is supposed to be good for you,

2084
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:55,140
but Stevia to me is not like a real 
sweet taste.

2085
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,340
It's like a trick.
Sweet.

2086
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,300
Yeah.
It's like a,

2087
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,830
almost like an aspirin.
What was that old shit?

2088
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:00,030
Sweet

2089
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:01,490
and lows.
Sweet and low hip.

2090
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,580
Funky fucking.
It was kind of sweet,

2091
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:06,250
but kind of funky.
I kinda like it better than,

2092
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:11,310
than any other.
But the problem I have is they need to 

2093
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,070
have it at more places.
Like starbucks seems like it should have

2094
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:15,460
starbucks.
I don't think people.

2095
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:17,740
I think it's a taste issue.
I don't prefer the taste of it.

2096
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,600
I think it's probably something you can 
get used to,

2097
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:22,480
but I don't like and things.
I don't mind.

2098
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:24,460
Things being not sweet,
you know what I mean?

2099
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:25,750
Like coffee.
I don't want coffee,

2100
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:27,370
sweetened,
sweetened,

2101
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:28,390
iced tea,
iced tea.

2102
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,920
I just drink it,
you know?

2103
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:35,250
Yeah.
I don't put any extra shit into pretty 

2104
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:35,320
much anything really.
You want your health,

2105
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:35,710
do you?
What?

2106
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:38,500
Do you take care of herself?
I go through periods that are,

2107
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:40,870
you know,
can go up and down.

2108
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,670
No,
I don't think I've ever eaten.

2109
01:32:42,671 --> 01:32:44,050
Kick in bed.
Never.

2110
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,630
I don't think so.
What about in the tub?

2111
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,260
I don't think I've ever eaten food in 
the tub.

2112
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:51,600
That's the cat in the hat.
Comes back.

2113
01:32:51,601 --> 01:32:53,500
He kicked in the tub and it becomes a 
mess.

2114
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,840
That motherfucker to paraphrase it that 
way.

2115
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,440
When you read that to your children,
this is my kids' favorite stories.

2116
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:07,441
They're fun because I get into them or 
get into the cat in the hat once 

2117
01:33:07,441 --> 01:33:07,900
brilliantly written stuff.
Frog and toad.

2118
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:09,180
You got to get them in the frog and 
toad.

2119
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:10,360
Okay.
That's the best.

2120
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:15,450
Remember that frog and toad frog and 
attend that live together and they were 

2121
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:17,770
sort of vaguely remember that or they 
were trying to cross the highway and you

2122
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:19,200
have to.
It was cool.

2123
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:23,200
Get into the lily pads.
That's frogger.

2124
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:27,250
It's weird that a frog would hang with 
the toad the other different yet.

2125
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:29,800
So this lucky frogs a little.
Those cons.

2126
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,470
You know how he will be.

2127
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,730
If they're big,
they'll just be taking kids right out of

2128
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:35,950
your arm and you seen big frog.
They're pretty big.

2129
01:33:35,951 --> 01:33:39,790
I mean big like real big like dog size.
The frogs were huge.

2130
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:44,810
They eat babies and was about a frog 
recent researching frogs long time ago 

2131
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:48,931
because of that,
licking frogs and so I got really into 

2132
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:51,241
frogs and they have pac man frog.
He received PAC man frogs or mouth's 

2133
01:33:51,241 --> 01:33:54,640
open up like PAC man.
Frog is a ruthless motherfuckers.

2134
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:54,990
You know,
they.

2135
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:59,430
They were like my.
Sometimes my might have made that up.

2136
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:04,550
They do those frogs that he dug.
Man.

2137
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:11,110
How about the fact that people take 
frogs and they get high with them?

2138
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,220
That's why I was researching frogs 
because frogs off Ebay a long time.

2139
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:16,940
I got to something like that.
You can buy that.

2140
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,330
I don't know if they've made a frog 
illegal yet.

2141
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:20,800
What is the frog that does it?
The frog.

2142
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:24,820
It producers five Meo DMT is really 
incredibly potent.

2143
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:29,821
Helis engine and will you do is you take
this frog and the skin excretes like 

2144
01:34:29,821 --> 01:34:34,111
some sort of a white milky substance and
you do it on a window of a car so that 

2145
01:34:34,111 --> 01:34:37,660
it's in the sun or anything glass that's
outside glass coffee table.

2146
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:40,120
You secrete it and then when it dries 
off,

2147
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,640
you scrape it with a razor blade and it 
becomes a white powder.

2148
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,990
You put it in something,
you freebase it and you blast off.

2149
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:50,210
Yeah.

2150
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:54,220
Welcome to the center of the universe 
provided by a frog.

2151
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:55,680
Do you think that's why they ended up 
what?

2152
01:34:55,681 --> 01:34:57,980
I was going to be a bunch of frogs on us

2153
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
because we're all going to start 
tripping off these frogs because it's 

2154
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:02,980
going to be frogs everywhere and then 
we're going to go into this Dm.

2155
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:07,980
Treaties are likely.
That's tripping off of how justice 

2156
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,340
hallucinogen Hallucinogen,
hallucinogen hallucinogen.

2157
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:14,010
That's the correct agenda is what I'm 
used to it as well.

2158
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:18,750
It's like nuclear or new cuellar.
You're going to have options.

2159
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:21,890
Other options.
If I said nuclear,

2160
01:35:21,891 --> 01:35:26,891
would you correct?
It's like authentically often nuclear 

2161
01:35:26,891 --> 01:35:28,910
coupon and coupon nuclear bombs,
nuclear bombs.

2162
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,680
I don't think I are correct.
You out loud.

2163
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:32,680
I would just assume.
I know.

2164
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:37,640
I just assumed you were gonna you know 
like you hear in both ways so often.

2165
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,760
Like if all the dumb things that George 
Bush said and did that one to me it was 

2166
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:42,760
like,
well,

2167
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:44,360
but a lot of people say it the wrong 
way,

2168
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:46,070
so you just get used to it.

2169
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:49,640
It's just like old expressions that now 
people say I'm the wrong the wrong way.

2170
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,250
With English.
People write things different.

2171
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,720
They right there.
Correct.

2172
01:35:53,721 --> 01:35:58,721
Tires is t y r e S.
I kept seeing that written an English 

2173
01:35:58,721 --> 01:35:59,390
magazine.
I was like,

2174
01:35:59,391 --> 01:36:04,391
why is the world world?
It's spelled w r o l d instead of w o r,

2175
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:05,900
l,
D,

2176
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:09,370
real world.
It's pronounced wrong.

2177
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,150
Wrong.
Did you just make that up?

2178
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,930
I always get,
I say world and everyone gives me shift.

2179
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,190
So you make that up.
No,

2180
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,550
it's not spelled war.
Made that up.

2181
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:20,500
Yes.
You motherfucker.

2182
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:24,380
Color color.
They have and color.

2183
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,200
Yeah.
There's a bunch of different.

2184
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:30,050
It's funny when you reading tweets,
you don't even have to look to see where

2185
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:32,180
the person's from.
When it's got those things in it.

2186
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,510
Well they also say cheers mate,
and they always say,

2187
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:37,790
you're a legend isn't legend's mate.

2188
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,690
You're a legend.
Right?

2189
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:41,460
I think that's just huge.
Joe Calls Me and says,

2190
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,740
you are a legend.
I love that expression.

2191
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:46,190
The love that they love,
they love.

2192
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:47,390
Brilliant.
It's a brilliant,

2193
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:48,200
brilliant,
great.

2194
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:50,170
That's another one.
They retired and con.

2195
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,240
They like to say,
I like how you publicly announced that 

2196
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,060
when you band people on twitter,
like you're like,

2197
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:57,770
you are banned.
No blurry,

2198
01:36:57,771 --> 01:36:58,790
blocked,
blocked.

2199
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:04,180
But sometimes I'm just kidding.
Like sometimes I'll just take some dumb 

2200
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:04,180
tweet,
the Kim Kardashian road or something and

2201
01:37:04,180 --> 01:37:07,250
I'll say blog or irl,
you know,

2202
01:37:07,251 --> 01:37:12,251
somebody will write something to me 
that's actually kind of Nice and I'll 

2203
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:12,251
write block just to be silly and I'll 
write to them and say,

2204
01:37:12,251 --> 01:37:13,550
I didn't really block you,
I just,

2205
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,830
I just wanted to retweet what you said.
But I also,

2206
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:20,970
I don't like just retweet and 
compliments and stuff because I just 

2207
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:21,860
think that that's true to compliment 
than say blocked.

2208
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:25,670
That's funny because then everybody gets
a lot out of it.

2209
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:26,090
Like,
oh,

2210
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,430
he's such an asshole.
That guy that said that nice thing,

2211
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:33,790
you know,
but I just think that like there's just 

2212
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:33,790
too much,
too many people that just want,

2213
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:37,780
they're all about getting retweets and 
like begging for them and it's just 

2214
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:38,440
like,
that's kind of whacked.

2215
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,390
The whole retweet thing.
I respond to people as much as I can,

2216
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,550
but that,
that is kind of whack.

2217
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,820
Yeah,
you're good with people though.

2218
01:37:43,821 --> 01:37:48,821
You like answer questions and stuff.
I just get the same questions all the 

2219
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:51,971
time.
People always ask me because I follow 

2220
01:37:51,971 --> 01:37:54,580
for under 20 people.
I thought that'd be funny thing on my 

2221
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,560
side,
on my page and it says I follow under 20

2222
01:37:55,561 --> 01:37:56,040
people,

2223
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,190
but then also that's like about how many
people I want to follow.

2224
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:04,191
Like if there's somebody that I'm not 
interested in anymore and I want to add 

2225
01:38:04,191 --> 01:38:08,331
somebody,
I'll drop somebody in ad I just keep it 

2226
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:08,331
in 20.
Oh.

2227
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:12,260
Then a lot of people get it right away.
They don't ask to be added because 

2228
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,961
they're like,
I don't want to ruin your for 20 thing 

2229
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:16,941
dude,
but I'd love it if you added me or 

2230
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:16,941
whatever,
but do.

2231
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:17,550
Does anybody more connected to the pop 
movement and you.

2232
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,160
I don't know.
I'm not.

2233
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:22,950
I'm not as political as people might 
want me to be about it.

2234
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:25,110
Although I've got some news for you 
guys.

2235
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:27,660
I'd love to share with your listeners 
slash viewers.

2236
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:31,860
Sure.
In Missouri in 2012,

2237
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:34,950
there's a chance of getting outright 
legalization on the ballot.

2238
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:38,370
Really skipping over.
They're skipping over the medical thing.

2239
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:42,060
They just need x number of signatures 
and it's not that many.

2240
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:47,330
They just need a certain number of 
signatures to get it to happen and they 

2241
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:48,210
need the signatures by May.
So if you're in Missouri,

2242
01:38:48,211 --> 01:38:50,970
get ahold of like your local normal 
chapter,

2243
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,310
you know,
nor nrml is,

2244
01:38:54,410 --> 01:38:56,400
that's how Brian's always spelled 
normal.

2245
01:38:56,401 --> 01:38:58,030
How many and uh,
and,

2246
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:03,040
and just make sure you find out where 
you can go because it's has to be 

2247
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,751
physical signatures,
which is the most fucked up thing in 

2248
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:08,331
this computer age.
People should be able to sign petitions 

2249
01:39:08,331 --> 01:39:11,511
now on their computer onlines and some 
do like the Conservatives get lots of 

2250
01:39:11,511 --> 01:39:15,951
good petitions going online,
but for to get on the ballot for 

2251
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:18,120
legalization in Missouri,
which I would love because there's a lot

2252
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:23,121
of cities in Missouri that I like and if
I got to go there and know that it was 

2253
01:39:23,121 --> 01:39:24,330
legal,
it was so much fun.

2254
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,690
Well,
you know,

2255
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:27,720
marijuana is legal in Denver pretty 
much.

2256
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:29,910
Yeah.
They give you some sort of ticket.

2257
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:30,660
They don't,
they don't.

2258
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,010
You're like blowing it on A.
I think it's one of those.

2259
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,620
I'm sure you're not supposed to be out 
there publicly drinking,

2260
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:39,780
just like you're not supposed to be out 
there publicly smoking pot,

2261
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:43,080
but then other people are pretty chill.
Yeah.

2262
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:48,090
Then on stopping people at all,
there's a lot of cities and and you 

2263
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:51,561
know,
there's 16 states in Washington dc that 

2264
01:39:51,561 --> 01:39:52,920
are our medical,
but then a lot of cities it's been,

2265
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:56,820
you know,
kind of because I think it's,

2266
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:59,730
it's been kind of quietly decriminalized
and a lot of places,

2267
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:02,040
a lot of those states though,
it's really hard to get a license.

2268
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,580
It's not as easy as it is.
Yeah.

2269
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:08,750
And it's really hard to.
The whole dispensary system isn't in 

2270
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:08,750
place,
you know,

2271
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:13,340
and that's the problem currently in 
California is that the feds are again 

2272
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:16,640
threatening to cut two to basically 
close down dispensary's and then the 

2273
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,100
question is,
well where did the patients,

2274
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,380
because they've seen me,
there seemed to be okay with patients at

2275
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:19,950
this point.

2276
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,990
Like if you're a medical marijuana 
patient,

2277
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:25,350
you should be able to get it,
but where the patient's going to get it,

2278
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:30,351
if they close down the dispensary 
because they're supposed to grow their 

2279
01:40:30,351 --> 01:40:33,231
own or have some sort of concern from 
the law enforcement is that there's a 

2280
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:39,201
lot of profit being made that is not 
supposed to be according to the way the 

2281
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:41,350
law is structured.
It's there.

2282
01:40:41,351 --> 01:40:44,010
You're not supposed to be able to profit
as much as these people are profiting.

2283
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,400
But the bottom line is that should be 
the very last thing that law enforcement

2284
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:53,290
is devoting its resources to.
You know,

2285
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:54,840
no one's getting hurt there.
Okay,

2286
01:40:55,020 --> 01:41:00,020
so you're all,
your attention should be devoted to 

2287
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:03,481
crime.
All your attention should be devoted to 

2288
01:41:03,481 --> 01:41:03,850
reckless drivers.
Drunk drivers,

2289
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,560
crime,
assault,

2290
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,740
violent crime associated with marijuana 
would go away.

2291
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,360
It was like,
oh yeah,

2292
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:13,660
just leave it alone and I swear 
everything will be better.

2293
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,250
It's really simple.
You know,

2294
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:16,930
there's,
there's other shit to concentrate on,

2295
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:21,820
but I think also that in some cases 
places need arrests.

2296
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,220
They need to make arrests and it's a 
fucking easy collar.

2297
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:29,250
It's not hard.
No one's going to shoot you in your 

2298
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:29,250
closing down a pot store,
you know,

2299
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:33,030
you go there,
you bring guys who are dressed like 

2300
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,030
they're ready to go to war in 
Afghanistan and they fucking go in there

2301
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:36,040
with machine guns and they clear 
everything out and they take everything.

2302
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,960
And it's crazy man.
You know,

2303
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:38,800
the,
the ones that,

2304
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:43,801
uh,
they had an la a few years back where 

2305
01:41:43,801 --> 01:41:44,230
they had the guys who were,
had blackwater uniforms on,

2306
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,000
they had,
there were blackwater guys,

2307
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:51,001
they hired mercenaries to go in there 
and clean up and close down these pot 

2308
01:41:51,001 --> 01:41:51,160
shops.
And you're like,

2309
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,030
because of the weirdest rates like in.
So you remember that though?

2310
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:57,950
Do you remember that shit in,
in super high.

2311
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:03,030
We show two different rates and uh,
and one of the biggest laughs in the 

2312
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:04,030
movies,
the unfortunately not me speaking.

2313
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:06,190
Uh,
so somebody that's just a,

2314
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:11,191
you know,
a protest or advocate that's hanging 

2315
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:13,381
outside of place.
It's being rated a yells at the guys as 

2316
01:42:13,381 --> 01:42:17,641
they're walking downstairs,
have boxes full of marijuana and money 

2317
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:18,820
yells at him.
Go bust a meth lab.

2318
01:42:18,821 --> 01:42:19,430
You Pussy.

2319
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:24,880
No Shit,
no shit.

2320
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,100
It's so easy,
it's an easy color,

2321
01:42:27,101 --> 01:42:28,930
it's weak you,
you know,

2322
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:34,170
it's wrong.
And I'm sure a lot of the guys that are 

2323
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:35,080
involved in doing those things,
again,

2324
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:36,910
they're just following orders.
They're just like,

2325
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:38,190
you know,
there's absolutely.

2326
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,340
That's the.
I get,

2327
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:42,340
I guess people in law enforcement more 
and more saying,

2328
01:42:42,341 --> 01:42:47,341
hey to me and winking at me and say I 
like your work and stuff and kissing on 

2329
01:42:47,341 --> 01:42:48,340
the lips.
A lot of making out.

2330
01:42:48,341 --> 01:42:49,690
I just,
I just will not.

2331
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,180
I just draw the line at eating their 
ass.

2332
01:42:52,810 --> 01:42:53,800
Don't try that line,
bro.

2333
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:55,840
Sacrifice.
I gotta try it.

2334
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:57,680
I just think of assets as being,
you know,

2335
01:42:57,681 --> 01:43:00,360
I just said a very juvenile attitude 
towards assets.

2336
01:43:00,430 --> 01:43:03,730
Make them do a stripper shower before 
and I don't want anything in my ass.

2337
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:05,440
He even as Nice,
soft tongue.

2338
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,140
I always say the cops don't get nearly 
enough credit and there's a,

2339
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:10,750
there's a divide between the citizens 
and the police.

2340
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,670
It doesn't have to exist.
It's ridiculous.

2341
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,080
They should be supported,
you know,

2342
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:17,380
and people support troops.
But very few people support cops.

2343
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:21,460
There's bad cops for sure,
but it's a small percentage.

2344
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,860
We get to see how how good cops are 
though,

2345
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:26,700
because we're usually in situations 
where it's,

2346
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,610
it's sort of,
you know,

2347
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:32,290
especially you like wherever you see a 
lot of law enforcement,

2348
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:37,291
that's kind of it.
They're sort of protecting you and you 

2349
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:39,280
know,
just being out in public and stuff.

2350
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:44,610
Right.
I don't really have protected me when 

2351
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:44,610
I'm out in public.
When,

2352
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:44,770
when they see you,
they're like,

2353
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,510
you're a celebrity to them.
So you're like,

2354
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:48,820
the last thing there cops are going to 
do is hassle you.

2355
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:49,990
That's true.
But you know,

2356
01:43:49,991 --> 01:43:52,040
also when I pulled over when I wasn't

2357
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,150
a celebrity,
I'm polite.

2358
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:53,890
You,
you,

2359
01:43:53,891 --> 01:43:55,250
you asked me a question?
No Sir.

2360
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:56,780
He asked me for my license.
I gave a true.

2361
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:59,060
It's true.
You respectful.

2362
01:43:59,210 --> 01:43:59,740
Yeah.
I,

2363
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:04,070
I've gotten out of a few arrests 
situations by just being polite.

2364
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,470
Cup knows you're legitimately 
respectful,

2365
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:07,610
you know,
they appreciate that.

2366
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,630
You know,
like man,

2367
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,460
that's the fucking job.
The job is.

2368
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:15,461
We agree that guy gets the gun and the 
fucking flashing lights and you listen 

2369
01:44:15,461 --> 01:44:15,461
to him.
Yes sir.

2370
01:44:15,461 --> 01:44:17,870
No Sir.
And that means you're a good citizen and

2371
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:19,340
you're not trying to fucking cause any 
trouble.

2372
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:20,820
And in turn he doesn't,
you know,

2373
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:24,500
take advantage of this power that's 
presented to him by this willingness for

2374
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,170
people to obey.
And he doesn't automatically assume that

2375
01:44:27,171 --> 01:44:30,470
everybody owes it to them.
And that's the problem with older cops.

2376
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:32,130
That's the problem with these white 
shirt concedes.

2377
01:44:32,131 --> 01:44:34,490
He punching people in these occupy Wall 
Street crowds.

2378
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:36,770
They,
they think they can punch people.

2379
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:37,260
You know,
there,

2380
01:44:37,261 --> 01:44:39,770
there's ones and it's not all of them,
it's just a small fraction of it,

2381
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:41,360
but they feel like they're better than 
people.

2382
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,130
They feel like they've been older and 
people around.

2383
01:44:43,131 --> 01:44:46,370
People who have been forced to listen to
them so long that they have a complex.

2384
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:51,371
They've been involved in law enforcement
for 30 years and you have to fucking 

2385
01:44:51,371 --> 01:44:51,371
listen to them,
you know?

2386
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,230
Yeah.
They're bullies.

2387
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:54,530
There are bullies.
You know,

2388
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:57,410
you give people ultimate power,
you're going to get ultimate corruption.

2389
01:44:57,411 --> 01:45:02,411
We all know that.
And even though you don't think of that 

2390
01:45:02,411 --> 01:45:02,411
as corruption,
that has absolutely corruption.

2391
01:45:02,411 --> 01:45:06,880
When that guy,
that guy white shirt and the video 

2392
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,220
punches that chicken the face,
that's fucking corruption.

2393
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,560
That is a hundred percent corruption.
That's all.

2394
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:10,680
Somebody told me,
that chick,

2395
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,290
that's actually a very feminine man.

2396
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,960
Either way I say it's a chick,
chick,

2397
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:18,680
chick,
chick like dude.

2398
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:24,250
And the guy punches him right in the 
face with a very sloppy overhand right 

2399
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:24,800
to it's piss poor technique.
I really was very,

2400
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,500
very upset with this video tested 
correctly.

2401
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:30,650
No,
no.

2402
01:45:30,651 --> 01:45:33,290
I mean just take that video and then do 
the play by play.

2403
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:38,291
Like you're doing it for a fight.
Who the fuck taught him how to throw 

2404
01:45:38,291 --> 01:45:40,490
that right hand and for 102 pound check 
she takes it.

2405
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:41,630
Well,
she took it wells,

2406
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,790
weak ass punch.
But you know,

2407
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:45,380
the fact that he thought that he could 
do that.

2408
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:47,060
I don't care what that person said.
Damn.

2409
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:52,120
You know,
if someone's yelling at you and causing 

2410
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:53,270
you calling you names and becoming a 
problem and you have to arrest him,

2411
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:58,271
then he fucking arrest them.
You don't have to punch people in the 

2412
01:45:58,271 --> 01:45:58,271
fucking head.

2413
01:45:58,271 --> 01:45:58,271
You Dick.
What do you think about the,

2414
01:45:58,271 --> 01:46:02,681
um,
the preponderance of a Taser incidents 

2415
01:46:02,681 --> 01:46:04,640
and uses of tasers everywhere.
Ridiculous.

2416
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:09,641
Not just tasers.
How about the flash bombs they're 

2417
01:46:09,641 --> 01:46:09,641
throwing on people?
Did you see that shit?

2418
01:46:09,641 --> 01:46:12,890
That was a guy was a wounded vet.
The whole thing is disgusting.

2419
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:15,500
It's really disgusting.
It's like these cops are,

2420
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:20,501
you know,
they're forced everyday to go out there 

2421
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:22,331
and try to combat this ever growing 
thing that has shows no signs of 

2422
01:46:22,331 --> 01:46:24,320
weakening in fact shows signs of gaining
momentum and strength.

2423
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,560
And that's why all these movements are 
being taken to try to squash it and try 

2424
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:31,190
to suppress it because they go,
well,

2425
01:46:31,191 --> 01:46:34,070
we got to stop this now because right 
now it's 30,000

2426
01:46:34,071 --> 01:46:36,410
people,
but the fuck do we do in it's 300,000

2427
01:46:36,411 --> 01:46:37,730
people out there.
Guess what?

2428
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,260
They're going to come through those 
doors.

2429
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:44,350
Three hundred thousand people are going 
to come through those doors and they're 

2430
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:44,350
gonna start throwing people out windows,
you know?

2431
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:45,750
And I don't think they will.
I mean it's not violent.

2432
01:46:45,751 --> 01:46:47,330
It hasn't been a violent movement so 
far,

2433
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:49,860
but that's what they would do if they 
have 300,000

2434
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,310
people,

2435
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,990
so if you,
if you think of,

2436
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:54,600
if you're like mayor Bloomberg or if 
you're,

2437
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:59,601
you know,
on these fucking guys that owned some 

2438
01:46:59,601 --> 01:47:01,731
giant Hedge Fund and you've made 
billions of dollars is raping people 

2439
01:47:01,731 --> 01:47:03,480
your whole life and then all the sudden 
you know,

2440
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:07,560
you picture what you would do if you 
were all those people,

2441
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,360
you would think those people going to 
get me,

2442
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,400
they're going to come again in a storm.
The gates,

2443
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:14,640
even if they stay nonviolent,
these people are never gonna accept that

2444
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:19,790
because they're always gonna.
Assume that human nature is always 

2445
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:21,951
violence,
so they're going to push these people 

2446
01:47:21,951 --> 01:47:23,751
back before it ever gets to a point 
where they can't control it and that's 

2447
01:47:23,751 --> 01:47:24,050
why they're there.
Clearing these fucking tense out.

2448
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:29,060
That's where they're trying to.
I guess they had an old library full of 

2449
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:29,060
books there too,
and they throw the books away.

2450
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:29,700
What the fuck,
man?

2451
01:47:29,730 --> 01:47:32,340
You throw on books away.
That should be against the law.

2452
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,300
Okay.
Right there.

2453
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:37,590
That should be a crime in this day of 
age and age of ultimate retardation that

2454
01:47:37,591 --> 01:47:42,591
we find ourselves in when people are so 
fucking dope that you're throwing books 

2455
01:47:42,591 --> 01:47:43,470
away.
God Damn Man.

2456
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:48,530
You talk about someone who's not working
for the greater good of the people cop 

2457
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:49,380
that's throwing books away.
Yeah,

2458
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:54,381
for the worst and all in the name of the
supposedly name of public safety.

2459
01:47:57,730 --> 01:47:58,470
So gross.
Well,

2460
01:47:58,471 --> 01:48:02,160
you know that chase paid the cops four 
point $6,000,000,

2461
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:04,620
made a huge donation to the cops.
Of course.

2462
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:05,640
Isn't that ridiculous?

2463
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:10,720
Everything.
Everything behind everything is is is 

2464
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:13,070
money now the money that these people 
that are going to try to defeat Obama,

2465
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:18,071
the money,
the millions and millions that they're 

2466
01:48:18,071 --> 01:48:20,190
raising,
that's all it's going to is just trying 

2467
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,890
to win an election late.
That's a messed up system.

2468
01:48:21,891 --> 01:48:26,891
People are starving.
Those millions of dollars could feed 

2469
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:29,060
people and instead they're just putting 
somebody else in charge who's not who,

2470
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,100
you know,
because Obama,

2471
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:33,800
as much as he seems to try is 
ineffective.

2472
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:36,200
Everything's gonna be ineffective.
Whoever,

2473
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:38,240
if he loses,
if he wins,

2474
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:40,640
if he wins,
I think is next for years can be kind of

2475
01:48:40,641 --> 01:48:43,460
interesting because he'll kind of have 
nothing to fucking lose.

2476
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,160
Is that true though,
man?

2477
01:48:45,161 --> 01:48:46,330
I hope so.
You know,

2478
01:48:46,331 --> 01:48:51,331
I don't buy that anymore because I just 
haven't seen any evidence whatsoever 

2479
01:48:51,331 --> 01:48:51,490
that he has any power at all.
I just,

2480
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:53,470
I don't,
I don't necessarily believe it.

2481
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:58,710
I think they,
there's a whole group of people that 

2482
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,550
have got him into position and once 
those people sit down with them,

2483
01:49:00,551 --> 01:49:05,551
they explained to him what they would 
like to get done and that's what gets 

2484
01:49:05,551 --> 01:49:08,551
done.
And that's why Guantanamo Bay still 

2485
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:08,551
open.
That's why

2486
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:08,710
still slips through the cracks.
Like there's no,

2487
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:11,830
there's no money interests that wanted 
to get rid of.

2488
01:49:11,831 --> 01:49:13,060
Don't ask,
don't tell.

2489
01:49:13,061 --> 01:49:13,990
And he made that happen.

2490
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:16,350
Yeah.
That's a bone that he through people.

2491
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,200
That's the bones go.
It's pretty good.

2492
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:20,140
Yeah.
It's good.

2493
01:49:20,141 --> 01:49:20,790
That good?
Yeah.

2494
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:23,610
You know what that means.
That means that gay people are to become

2495
01:49:23,611 --> 01:49:25,260
hired killers too.
Yay.

2496
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:28,390
The fuck kind of advancement is that.
Well,

2497
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,250
they can,
you know,

2498
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:30,190
gay people,
you know,

2499
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,860
it's not,
it's not that I'm and I'm,

2500
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:34,830
I'm 100 percent not anti soldier 
whatsoever.

2501
01:49:34,831 --> 01:49:39,831
The show I am for the soldiers would I'm
not for is the people that tell the 

2502
01:49:39,831 --> 01:49:42,030
soldiers what to do.
Every fucking army needs soldiers.

2503
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:44,520
Every nation needs an army because guess
what?

2504
01:49:44,521 --> 01:49:49,521
Human nature is what it is.
There's a lot of bad fucking people in 

2505
01:49:49,521 --> 01:49:52,741
the world.
What makes me sick is when bad people 

2506
01:49:52,741 --> 01:49:53,800
take good soldiers and make them do bad 
shit,

2507
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:57,070
and they do that for their own good.
So it's not that I'm against soldiers.

2508
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:59,350
I'm 100 percent for soldiers,
soldiers.

2509
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:05,610
Those are people that understand.
What I'm not for is the people that put 

2510
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:08,881
soldiers in situations where the 
soldiers think they're doing the right 

2511
01:50:08,881 --> 01:50:10,000
thing because they're following orders.
They think they're doing the right thing

2512
01:50:10,001 --> 01:50:11,950
because they're going after guys who 
look like bad guys,

2513
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,040
but the big question ever gets answered,
what the fuck are you doing there in the

2514
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:17,500
first place?
You think you're doing the right thing.

2515
01:50:17,501 --> 01:50:19,420
What the fuck are you doing there in the
first place?

2516
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:20,980
You're going to stop another nine slash 
11.

2517
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,450
Those guys are dead.
They're all dead.

2518
01:50:22,451 --> 01:50:24,600
The guys who did it are dead.
This is how you stop it.

2519
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:25,510
You don't.
Don't let that happen,

2520
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:28,960
but I can get everybody over here.
Fucking more soldiers.

2521
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,110
The everybody watches this more 
carefully.

2522
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:31,660
Yeah,
keep.

2523
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:33,490
Keep America safe.
Soldiers.

2524
01:50:33,491 --> 01:50:34,780
The TSA employee

2525
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:39,970
just keep.
Can't deny the economic reasons for 

2526
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:43,981
going over there.
You can't deny it mean in the middle of 

2527
01:50:43,981 --> 01:50:46,561
this peak oil crisis.
Everybody's freaking out about what 

2528
01:50:46,561 --> 01:50:48,250
happens when we run out of oil.
Is it possible to run out of oil?

2529
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:53,251
What happens if the prices skyrocket to 
the point where we get a massive 

2530
01:50:53,251 --> 01:50:55,720
recession and so that's the reason why 
we go over there.

2531
01:50:55,721 --> 01:51:00,721
We go over there to control the oil.
Do we go over there because there's not 

2532
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:00,721
much left.
I mean,

2533
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:01,240
what?
What's really going on?

2534
01:51:01,241 --> 01:51:01,870
Let me know.

2535
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:05,530
You think that all this is leading up to
the protest.

2536
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:07,970
You know,
getting the troops back here,

2537
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:13,010
like all this is just gonna lead to 
something like a new hands across 

2538
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:16,531
America and I knew we are the world.
We already have to go through something 

2539
01:51:16,531 --> 01:51:16,531
like that again.
Get already.

2540
01:51:16,531 --> 01:51:20,821
Is there your hands across America?
The only thing I'm worried about is the.

2541
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:24,760
We are the world parodies that stand up 
college would close their acts with.

2542
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,800
That's what I'm worried about.
11 meaning,

2543
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:31,810
you know the Kevin meaning I remember 
hands across America but I don't 

2544
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:36,721
remember if I did it or not.
I remember I don't think it worked 

2545
01:51:36,721 --> 01:51:36,721
right.
It didn't work.

2546
01:51:36,721 --> 01:51:38,470
It was fake and they just edited things 
together.

2547
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:39,520
It was like,
wow,

2548
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:44,521
look how far it goes.
All the way to the codes were 

2549
01:51:44,521 --> 01:51:44,521
transferred from person to person.
That one,

2550
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:48,010
I don't know if I stood somewhere and 
held hands with two people on the street

2551
01:51:48,011 --> 01:51:48,910
somewhere or not.

2552
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:51,310
I think my uncle told me it was if I 
didn't.

2553
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:53,470
Well it's what we were talking about 
every seven years.

2554
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,930
You get some shape files.
The Ellis sort.

2555
01:51:56,020 --> 01:52:01,020
That's been a while since that happened.
I think my hands across America 

2556
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,550
shouldn't have caused you that much 
inconvenience,

2557
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:04,810
Brian,
as an individual.

2558
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:06,090
It's not that big a deal,
Brian.

2559
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:11,370
This is the worst fear that you're in.
Fear of another we other world song.

2560
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:13,620
That's so not what's going on here.
What's going on here?

2561
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,060
Some overthrow the government type shit.
That's what's going on here.

2562
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:17,350
And what's going on here is people 
saying,

2563
01:52:17,351 --> 01:52:18,340
Hey,
this system right now,

2564
01:52:18,341 --> 01:52:22,420
it doesn't fucking work at all.
The only time in our life that I've ever

2565
01:52:22,421 --> 01:52:27,421
seen this,
never seen anything even remotely close 

2566
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:27,421
to it.
Know every president,

2567
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:31,531
uh,
in my lifetime has raised taxes at a 

2568
01:52:31,531 --> 01:52:33,400
point where taxes need to be raised.
It's never been this crazy.

2569
01:52:34,150 --> 01:52:34,820
It's never been this.

2570
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:40,000
There's never been this much discontent.
It never been giant protests all over 

2571
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,910
the world.
They have occupied Toronto.

2572
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:40,910
So

2573
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:42,450
guess what?
Toronto is doing great.

2574
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:44,250
They're doing awesome.
Yeah,

2575
01:52:44,251 --> 01:52:46,020
it seems like they have a good economy.
They're,

2576
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:46,550
they're,
they're,

2577
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:48,260
you know,
they don't have nearly the problems with

2578
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:53,261
unemployment that we have there.
They're fucking doing pretty good up 

2579
01:52:53,261 --> 01:52:53,261
there.
A lot better than we're doing,

2580
01:52:53,261 --> 01:52:54,200
man,
but people are still like,

2581
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:55,370
fuck it.
It's not good enough.

2582
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,890
Was it the 55,000
people at Rogers Center?

2583
01:52:57,891 --> 01:53:01,160
Was that the most people at one UFC 
event ever?

2584
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:02,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

2585
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,410
That was epic.
Yeah.

2586
01:53:03,411 --> 01:53:04,080
And those,
those,

2587
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:07,970
those tickets aren't cheap though.
The record is actually being held by.

2588
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,240
Um,
I think the,

2589
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,200
I think in Japan they've had 90,000
people.

2590
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,350
Really?
Yeah.

2591
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:16,080
I think that's what the biggest they've 
ever had.

2592
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,050
No,
it wasn't the UFC,

2593
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:19,130
it was pride,
pride events.

2594
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:25,260
I'm pretty sure during the peak of mixed
martial arts they had something like 

2595
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:25,260
80,000
plus people,

2596
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:29,980
which is really insane when you think 
about it because when we did the UFC it 

2597
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:34,121
was 55,
but then they released an additional 

2598
01:53:34,121 --> 01:53:34,121
5,000
seats and they sold them to.

2599
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:37,160
So it turned out to be $60,000.
It was just,

2600
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:42,161
they had to figure out how many seats 
they could have and bringing all the 

2601
01:53:42,161 --> 01:53:42,800
equipment because it was a completely 
different show.

2602
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,920
It was really stressful for everyone 
doing it because they had these giant 

2603
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:50,660
fucking tvs everywhere.
So everything is being shown on these 80

2604
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:53,630
foot fucking tvs mean.
It's a huge place,

2605
01:53:53,631 --> 01:53:54,950
man.
And you could.

2606
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,770
People were watching it from the hotel 
that's really wild.

2607
01:53:57,950 --> 01:54:02,330
The back of the Roger Center has a 
fucking hotel with windows wide open and

2608
01:54:02,331 --> 01:54:07,331
you could look.
People had rooms where they could look 

2609
01:54:07,331 --> 01:54:07,331
out their window and watched the fight.
That's awesome.

2610
01:54:07,331 --> 01:54:08,900
Fucking.
I didn't even see that dude.

2611
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:10,550
It's the shit.
That place is huge.

2612
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:11,990
They played baseball in there,
man.

2613
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:14,160
I'm going to wrap your head around that.
Well,

2614
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,740
is that the only place where um,
they,

2615
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,460
they gave us a earphones.

2616
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,060
They gave us these things that we put in
our,

2617
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:26,870
in our ears to listen to you call the,
the matches.

2618
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,700
You can get those anywhere.
Everywhere.

2619
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:34,070
Yeah.
They're the only place anybody's ever 

2620
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,070
walked up to me and said,
here,

2621
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,070
do you want this?
You know,

2622
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:35,660
they were just giving them out to people
for some reason in Toronto.

2623
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:36,410
Oh,
that's.

2624
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:41,690
So I listened the whole time.
I think you should get it with your 

2625
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:41,690
ticket.
You know,

2626
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:42,030
you're paying a fuck load for a ticket 
anyway.

2627
01:54:42,031 --> 01:54:43,790
They just hand them bitches out when 
they get in the door.

2628
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:48,791
That'd be a nice thing.
It's only 10 bucks and you can reuse it 

2629
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:48,880
at every UFC event.
Yeah.

2630
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:49,830
Yeah.
I don't,

2631
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:54,850
I don't know what ended up happening 
with the one that I had because you 

2632
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:54,850
know,
I smoke a lot of pot.

2633
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,050
Smoke a lot of pot,
don't you?

2634
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:59,240
Especially in Toronto.
Toronto's awesome.

2635
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:02,380
Do you ever do that pot club where you.
Yeah,

2636
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:05,450
you told me about it and then I did it 
this next time I was there.

2637
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:11,510
We shouldn't say the name because I 
don't know how easy it is to get in 

2638
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:11,880
trouble for that,
but I don't think it studies either.

2639
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:13,400
I don't know,
but they're all pretty,

2640
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:18,430
pretty fucking chill there.
I'm pretty sure they have a vote really 

2641
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:20,250
soon on decriminalization.
You know,

2642
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,570
I think there's something going on 
there.

2643
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:25,070
I don't know the exact specifics of 
their situation with their law,

2644
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:28,040
but it was deemed that the way the law 
was written,

2645
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,770
the cannabis laws were unconstitutional 
and uh,

2646
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,600
they only had a certain amount of time 
to fight that.

2647
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,940
And they're in the midst of it right 
now.

2648
01:55:34,941 --> 01:55:38,720
I'm pretty sure it's going to be decided
sometime before the end of the year,

2649
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,580
before the end of December.

2650
01:55:40,580 --> 01:55:41,780
I believe.
That's cool.

2651
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:42,950
Yeah.
Really interpret their,

2652
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,390
their attitude towards.
It was amazing up there.

2653
01:55:45,410 --> 01:55:47,250
As is NBC.
They just fucking,

2654
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,080
you know,
BC has medical now too.

2655
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:53,120
If you have a California license you can
go to basically takes up.

2656
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,870
I was just there for just for a night 
and I had,

2657
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:57,900
I had a blast.
I love going to Canada.

2658
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,210
So greatest city in the country.
Canada,

2659
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,860
Canada's greatest city in our country.
Know the,

2660
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:06,760
the,
the greatest city in Canada is.

2661
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:08,070
It is.
You know what,

2662
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:09,120
there's no bad one.
I,

2663
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:11,190
there's a,
it's a tossup between Vancouver,

2664
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:14,310
like the most fun I've ever had between 
Vancouver,

2665
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,750
Toronto,
and Montreal.

2666
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:17,460
Those are the three big cities that I 
performed out.

2667
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,470
I would say it's a toss up.
You know,

2668
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:21,250
the only thing in Montreal you get 
people,

2669
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:26,470
there's a certain amount of people that 
don't necessarily speak English that 

2670
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,470
well.

2671
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:27,180
It's a little more French.
Most people are bilingual,

2672
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,130
but there's a certain percent of the 
girls,

2673
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:32,550
but also that could effect a reaction a 
little bit,

2674
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:35,310
a little comedy because the language 
difference,

2675
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:39,970
we get that a little bit,
but a damn those girls are hot chocolate

2676
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:45,010
with a French accent,
but when they're being horrible brawls 

2677
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:45,480
though,
even when they're being mean to you,

2678
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:48,090
what they have horrible bras.
Bras.

2679
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:53,091
I've been with two of those French 
Canadian girls and they both had really 

2680
01:56:53,091 --> 01:56:56,271
creepy.
I think that says more about girls who 

2681
01:56:56,271 --> 01:56:56,271
want to fuck you.
Love that.

2682
01:56:56,271 --> 01:56:59,601
I love that you're sampling to girls.
Is a statement like that.

2683
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:04,190
That's his gallery too.
I was with had terrible bras and did it.

2684
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,970
You'd never know.
Duke countries have like,

2685
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:08,670
things like browser more important,
like style wise,

2686
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:09,600
like you know,
like old,

2687
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:14,660
old woman underwear.
Like is there a country want to stay 

2688
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,260
warm when you were there with chicks?

2689
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:20,260
Wanted to stay warm.
They throw less emphasis on sexy 

2690
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:20,430
underwear in Montreal and the winter 
man.

2691
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,960
Oh son and get cold.
I,

2692
01:57:22,961 --> 01:57:23,370
I,
uh,

2693
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:25,810
used to do the old,
uh,

2694
01:57:25,811 --> 01:57:28,680
I should do Jimbo comedy works in 
Montreal.

2695
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,990
I still do that.
Did it last time I was there was a great

2696
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:33,030
little small club.
It only seats like 100 people.

2697
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:38,270
I should do it like way,
way back in the day when I do the 

2698
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:38,270
Montreal comedy festival.
But uh,

2699
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:42,321
I walked from my hotel to a,
the club because it was only a few 

2700
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:42,630
blocks.
That's all I got there every day is,

2701
01:57:42,910 --> 01:57:46,980
you know,
long time ago and it was minus 15,

2702
01:57:46,981 --> 01:57:48,840
minus 16,
I think it was something like that.

2703
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:53,310
And I walked to the club and it was 
ruthlessly painful dude.

2704
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:58,340
It was ruthlessly painful.
Like my ears felt like they're going to 

2705
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:58,340
fall off my head.
You had to have a wool hat,

2706
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,670
like you had to have ear covers.

2707
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:02,040
It's not like a looks thing like you 
have to have,

2708
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:04,740
should wear a ski mask,
ski masks,

2709
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:08,460
you should wear a ski mask because your 
face gets ripped apart by the cold air.

2710
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:12,240
Fuck that noise.
I'm not a fan of that.

2711
01:58:12,241 --> 01:58:17,241
So I guess we just officially decided 
Vancouver's because in the wintertime 

2712
01:58:17,241 --> 01:58:19,620
it's just got like Portland weather or 
Seattle.

2713
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:24,890
Vancouver is pretty fucking bad ass.
That's the cool people are as cool as 

2714
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:29,001
fuck.
That is one of the most marijuana 

2715
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:29,001
influence cities in the world.
Oh yeah.

2716
01:58:29,001 --> 01:58:30,540
One of the most.
The movie that I was in the union,

2717
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,460
the business of getting high.
Have you ever watched that?

2718
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:33,390
So,
uh,

2719
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:35,710
my friend Adam scored,
he did it and it's all about the,

2720
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:40,730
the economy in Vancouver and how much of
it is based around marijuana and how 

2721
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:41,610
insane it is,
you know,

2722
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:46,510
the American laws and the horseshoe that
goes on with legalization.

2723
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:51,510
But it's a great documentary on how 
ridiculous the whole scenario is.

2724
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:57,361
The fact that it's illegal in the first 
place we should vaporize when we talk 

2725
01:58:57,361 --> 01:58:57,550
about this,
you think that things are ready to roll?

2726
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:02,500
How long could it possibly take?
But it's flashing red light flashing the

2727
01:59:02,501 --> 01:59:07,501
whole time.
I'm not supposed to be solid when it's 

2728
01:59:07,501 --> 01:59:10,501
right.
I don't want to say the name of this 

2729
01:59:10,501 --> 01:59:11,611
product because I don't want to give 
this guy a bad review because he seems 

2730
01:59:11,611 --> 01:59:11,611
like a real nice guy.
Isn't the red light you talking about?

2731
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,360
Hold on,
let's try and see if it works.

2732
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:15,820
Give it a shot

2733
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:17,850
tomorrow.
Yeah.

2734
01:59:17,851 --> 01:59:21,630
Tomorrow we have a death squad comedy 
show at the Pasadena Ice House.

2735
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:25,050
The dog will be there,
won't be doing a podcast beforehand.

2736
01:59:25,051 --> 01:59:30,051
So the podcast starts eight PM Pacific.
So it's going to be the same deal where 

2737
01:59:30,051 --> 01:59:34,611
people can watch it live.
They can watch it live and we're going 

2738
01:59:34,611 --> 01:59:37,071
to have a John Reap a little esther.
I'm Yoshi.

2739
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:45,080
Wait,
is this a comedy show or a video game 

2740
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:48,140
company?
So I like that video game with little 

2741
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:48,140
estrogen Yossi.
Try to get,

2742
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:52,880
get into the castle.
A asshole Joe is trying to.

2743
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:57,240
Allegedly.
You think it works?

2744
01:59:57,950 --> 01:59:59,250
Yeah,
it works.

2745
01:59:59,550 --> 02:00:00,350
I'm just,
you know,

2746
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:05,900
I'd like to try it.
You do it looks Kinda like sucking a 

2747
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:05,900
cock though.
And you know,

2748
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:05,920
I'm against that.
Do you,

2749
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,810
do you usually use vaporizers or what's 
your huh?

2750
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:14,250
Like way better for.
I don't have any usual.

2751
02:00:14,251 --> 02:00:18,870
I have a myriad of ways to uh,
to get thc into my system.

2752
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:21,600
I had a lollipop in the car on the way 
over here.

2753
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,240
You animal fucking savage.
Those are good.

2754
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:25,470
And then,
you know,

2755
02:00:25,471 --> 02:00:30,471
and then people always have joints 
around that you smoke and I'm not a 

2756
02:00:30,471 --> 02:00:31,110
joint roller myself.
I'm not a,

2757
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:36,120
I don't have those skills.
I make apps so easy to make apples into 

2758
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:37,710
pipes whenever I'm in hotels because 
they always have them in the lobby and.

2759
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:42,740
But don't you feel like you're getting a
lot of the butane from the lighter in 

2760
02:00:42,740 --> 02:00:45,891
your mouth?
Don't you taste that shit when you 

2761
02:00:45,891 --> 02:00:45,891
inhale it through an apple?
Anytime you use anything?

2762
02:00:45,891 --> 02:00:48,450
We have to highlight the weed.
We liked the weed over and over again.

2763
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:53,530
You know that the joints is your light 
at once and you could light it with a 

2764
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:53,530
match.
Yeah,

2765
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:54,210
that's a good.
That's a good point.

2766
02:00:54,211 --> 02:00:58,680
But I just like with joints it's almost 
become more like a social thing for me.

2767
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:01,730
Like I never just sit and smoke a joint 
by myself and,

2768
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:03,150
and,
and you don't get,

2769
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:05,460
you don't get big hits off of it.
I like,

2770
02:01:05,461 --> 02:01:06,130
I like,
you know,

2771
02:01:06,131 --> 02:01:09,760
that's why like you don't get big hits,
you're such a fucking still.

2772
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:13,590
And we'll give you a little pin joint or
something.

2773
02:01:13,591 --> 02:01:13,950
I'm like,
oh,

2774
02:01:13,951 --> 02:01:15,600
that's fun to pretend we're smoking 
polo.

2775
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:16,730
Little tiny joint.
Yeah,

2776
02:01:16,731 --> 02:01:17,230
yeah,
yeah.

2777
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:22,870
But you know,
I'd rather have a blunt that adjoin and 

2778
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:22,870
pipe over go do,
you know?

2779
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:27,140
And then Bong bongs really like I hit 
them so rarely now that they really 

2780
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:29,340
knocked me on my ass,
you know,

2781
02:01:29,341 --> 02:01:34,341
and like,
especially like somebody put some like 

2782
02:01:34,341 --> 02:01:36,291
fucking hash oil in there or something 
because I'm really getting used to just 

2783
02:01:36,291 --> 02:01:38,430
smoke and vaporizer in my apartment and 
you know,

2784
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:39,280
and,
and,

2785
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:43,090
and doing a lot of edibles.
So my smoking game is coming,

2786
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,140
coming down,
you know,

2787
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:49,100
like smoking game bonds will show you,
glitches in the Matrix.

2788
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:50,960
Bongs,
you'll,

2789
02:01:50,961 --> 02:01:53,060
you'll have moments with the same exact 
thing.

2790
02:01:53,061 --> 02:01:54,740
Is repeated a second later.
What,

2791
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:59,830
what?
There is this house that I lived in 

2792
02:01:59,830 --> 02:02:01,631
where I,
in college I lived with seven girls and 

2793
02:02:01,631 --> 02:02:02,210
it was a two story house.
It was like,

2794
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:07,211
just like the railroad and we made a 
bong out of PCP that went from the first

2795
02:02:07,341 --> 02:02:11,270
story.
See PCP bro,

2796
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,070
bro.
Crazy man.

2797
02:02:13,220 --> 02:02:17,210
We made fucking pipes out of agile dosh 
and it went to the second floor.

2798
02:02:17,211 --> 02:02:21,760
It was like so huge and there was one 
guy that could clear the whole thing,

2799
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:23,780
just hit it,
just hit it.

2800
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:29,180
Just said it like it's a like,
it's a son,

2801
02:02:31,980 --> 02:02:33,470
doesn't feel like it's doing anything.
Does it?

2802
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:35,500
Was it clouding up?
It doesn't.

2803
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:36,570
Sam,
he sounds like a.

2804
02:02:36,571 --> 02:02:38,140
A teapot.
Yeah.

2805
02:02:38,170 --> 02:02:41,350
The little tea pot.
Short and stout here.

2806
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:48,710
Really powerful professional stoner 
professional stoner.

2807
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:52,750
Doug Benson approves of this device.
Yeah.

2808
02:02:53,390 --> 02:02:56,090
My seemed like a pretty good,
pretty good hit.

2809
02:02:56,280 --> 02:03:01,280
W,
what do you know about this nonsense 

2810
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,461
that the ATF was going to stop people 
from getting new firearms if you were a 

2811
02:03:03,461 --> 02:03:04,700
medical marijuana patient now you heard 
this.

2812
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:08,750
I've heard stuff to that effect in that.
Sounds.

2813
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,180
Sounds pretty.
It sounds nutty,

2814
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:16,181
but it's also.
It doesn't hit me at home because I 

2815
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:16,181
don't,
you know,

2816
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:17,420
I'm not a firearms guy.
Well,

2817
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:20,150
I understand that.
For me,

2818
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:25,160
I wish everybody.
I wish everybody had guns was high 

2819
02:03:25,160 --> 02:03:29,200
fight.
You think more about your fellow man 

2820
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:29,200
before you pull the trigger.
It's disgusting.

2821
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,290
It's disgusting.
Like he don't like.

2822
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:35,291
I,
I hate that when people kind of paint 

2823
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:35,291
this idea that you could just that poc 
and somehow,

2824
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:40,180
I mean,
I guess there's some people that can 

2825
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:40,180
make kind of crazy,
but for the most part it doesn't,

2826
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:43,090
it doesn't make you have visions or do 
things that you like,

2827
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:48,100
like with alcohol where you do things 
that you wouldn't do if you weren't 

2828
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:48,100
drunk.

2829
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:51,140
There's weed doesn't really have that.
I mean not full or something,

2830
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,900
you know what I mean?
Like behind the wheel of a car,

2831
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:56,780
how many people do you know or like when
they're high and driving,

2832
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:00,650
they're maniacs in there and dangerous 
and you know,

2833
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:04,220
more of a threat than the old chart.
The cop pulls you over,

2834
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:06,620
do you know why I pulled you over?
You're going three miles an hour.

2835
02:04:06,621 --> 02:04:09,410
You're not parked.
But even then,

2836
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:11,230
you know,
like every once in a while,

2837
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,730
like I,
I've been trying to write down lately,

2838
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:16,130
every time I do something stupid and 
when I'm not high,

2839
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:16,770
I'm not,
I'm,

2840
02:04:16,780 --> 02:04:18,830
I'm not high like maybe an hour out of 
every day.

2841
02:04:18,831 --> 02:04:22,130
So it's a small window because whether 
you do your taxes.

2842
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:24,560
Yeah,
I could do my taxes high too.

2843
02:04:24,561 --> 02:04:26,280
I mean I used to,
I now I have an account.

2844
02:04:26,281 --> 02:04:27,500
Doesn't freak you out though.

2845
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,030
It does,
but you double check it,

2846
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:30,590
you know,
like text to the,

2847
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:32,870
when you're high and you're leaving a 
hotel room,

2848
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:33,340
you,
you,

2849
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:38,380
you,
you pace around the room three or four 

2850
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:40,661
times to make sure you got all of items.
And then one time out of five you left 

2851
02:04:40,661 --> 02:04:41,910
something behind and you're just going 
to have to buy it.

2852
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:46,930
Check your pocket for $20 to buy a new 
iphone adapter at the airport power 

2853
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:51,500
adapter.
And I lose it every time I leave the 

2854
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:51,500
house more than $20.
Those things.

2855
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:51,690
Yeah,
they're pricey.

2856
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:53,640
They're like 100 bucks or they really.
Yeah.

2857
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:56,260
But what I did was I bought phone power 
adapters.

2858
02:04:56,270 --> 02:04:57,870
A 100 bucks or no,
uh,

2859
02:04:57,871 --> 02:04:59,510
you know,
for the laptop,

2860
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:01,920
for laptop,
you know,

2861
02:05:01,921 --> 02:05:04,830
those ones with the big white square.
Okay.

2862
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:09,920
And uh,
but those things I know last a couple 

2863
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,001
over the years and then I just finally 
got wise and bought two and I travel 

2864
02:05:14,230 --> 02:05:15,630
with one and have one at home.

2865
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:16,950
Yeah,
I do the same thing.

2866
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:20,340
I have a laptop at least.
At least when I get back home,

2867
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:22,650
it's there and I'm ready to go.
I was so confused.

2868
02:05:22,651 --> 02:05:24,140
I thought you were just talking about 
iphone adapters.

2869
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,570
I'm like,
how the fuck are they charge 100 bucks.

2870
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:31,730
30 bucks though.
Apple just released a recall on power 

2871
02:05:31,951 --> 02:05:35,280
adapters and it's funny.
It's about time they did something about

2872
02:05:35,281 --> 02:05:40,281
this because I've seen this on both my 
power adapters for laptops and I phones 

2873
02:05:40,281 --> 02:05:42,720
where the cord kind of comes out of the 
plug.

2874
02:05:42,721 --> 02:05:43,690
Have you seen that?
Yeah,

2875
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:44,670
yeah.
Yeah.

2876
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,350
And so finally the recalling it right 
now,

2877
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,790
the new ones are much more sturdy

2878
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:51,080
new ones though.
They're like waste 30.

2879
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:52,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2880
02:05:52,251 --> 02:05:54,110
Technology man.
It's adapting.

2881
02:05:54,111 --> 02:05:55,640
That seems to be the fucking bottleneck 
though,

2882
02:05:55,641 --> 02:05:57,980
is battery life,
the real battle battery life.

2883
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,560
You have to be connected to power.
You know,

2884
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:05,590
real battery life was just not 
substantial interest for power 

2885
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:05,590
everywhere now.
Yeah.

2886
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:10,460
But the real question is,
will there ever be some sort of an 

2887
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:14,681
infinite battery source or some sort of 
an amazing battery source where shit 

2888
02:06:14,681 --> 02:06:16,040
last forever,
but the print power,

2889
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:20,300
how can you do that though?
How is something storing power?

2890
02:06:20,420 --> 02:06:23,720
You know,
it would have to be like or something.

2891
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:25,400
Yeah,
something like that.

2892
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,340
But I'm,
I'm pretty cool with how it is.

2893
02:06:28,341 --> 02:06:33,341
I don't,
I don't get caught off guard by my 

2894
02:06:33,341 --> 02:06:33,341
computer,
you know,

2895
02:06:33,341 --> 02:06:33,341
running out.
Look,

2896
02:06:33,341 --> 02:06:33,341
I'm,
I'm,

2897
02:06:33,341 --> 02:06:34,410
I'm amazed that it works at all.
You know,

2898
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:39,820
the whole device is incredible.
Especially I know a lot of people I had 

2899
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:40,970
a conversation with is very,
very intelligent lady,

2900
02:06:40,971 --> 02:06:45,971
but she was talking to me about a 
windows and she only uses windows and 

2901
02:06:45,971 --> 02:06:48,650
the reason why she only uses windows is 
because she doesn't like being told what

2902
02:06:48,651 --> 02:06:50,360
forum she buys her computers in.

2903
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,550
She wants to be able to pick her own 
parts and different,

2904
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:56,390
different things and I understand that.
But the rational part of me goes,

2905
02:06:56,391 --> 02:07:01,391
yeah,
but macs don't have viruses and they 

2906
02:07:01,391 --> 02:07:01,391
work better.
Done.

2907
02:07:01,391 --> 02:07:01,600
That conversation's over like.
Yeah,

2908
02:07:01,610 --> 02:07:02,000
I,
yeah.

2909
02:07:02,001 --> 02:07:07,001
I would rather you know anybody,
but the reason why they work so good is 

2910
02:07:07,001 --> 02:07:10,661
because there's not a billion different 
douche bags making these computers with 

2911
02:07:10,661 --> 02:07:11,830
all these different parts and you know,
the,

2912
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:16,860
the,
the operating system has to figure out 

2913
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:17,090
how the drivers to each individual 
device work.

2914
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:19,970
I just think this is a shitty operating 
system.

2915
02:07:19,971 --> 02:07:22,060
It used to be good and then they went to
like,

2916
02:07:22,061 --> 02:07:23,100
you know,
xp was,

2917
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,010
what is it that now windows eight is it 
seven,

2918
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:28,130
seven,
77 and I just think it's the Shitty,

2919
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:33,190
like I don't like it.
I like Osx and then when it comes to 

2920
02:07:33,190 --> 02:07:33,860
most things you buy for your computer 
nowadays,

2921
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:37,000
everything's USB.
If it doesn't,

2922
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:40,260
you don't have to have like what are you
really doing it?

2923
02:07:40,610 --> 02:07:43,240
If you didn't have a computer,
windows would be awesome.

2924
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:46,540
If somebody gave you a windows seven 
computer in 1995,

2925
02:07:46,541 --> 02:07:51,541
you would have,
you would shoot a load all over your 

2926
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:51,541
keyboard.
You would be so excited,

2927
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:55,030
but things have changed drastically at 
one point.

2928
02:07:55,090 --> 02:08:00,090
Totally.
I remember I couldn't believe you 

2929
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:03,211
actually controlling that white line,
which I'm moving on screen and it's fun 

2930
02:08:03,211 --> 02:08:03,211
to get good at it.

2931
02:08:03,211 --> 02:08:04,180
That was another one.
I was good at.

2932
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:05,330
Pong.
Yeah.

2933
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:10,340
Real good at the one where you play,
where you play against the machine or 

2934
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:10,340
whatever.
Yeah,

2935
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:13,870
that was great.
That really freestone or days to.

2936
02:08:13,871 --> 02:08:15,610
Right.
That was the one I was really good at is

2937
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:18,820
my parents used to go to a lay 
priesthood days.

2938
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:22,630
My parents used to go to a bar at a,
at a golf course.

2939
02:08:22,631 --> 02:08:25,660
There was also a restaurant,
so they'd hang out there and you know,

2940
02:08:25,661 --> 02:08:29,360
they just bring me along or whatever.
And they had like that.

2941
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:34,680
It was almost like my babysitter was 
playing with the fucking pong machine 

2942
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:35,880
while my parents had some cocktails and 
uh,

2943
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:39,100
I got so good at that.
And also you used to be able to get free

2944
02:08:39,101 --> 02:08:43,320
games on pong by the metal thing in the 
front that you,

2945
02:08:43,370 --> 02:08:48,370
that you put the quarters into the slot 
if you rubbed your feet on the ground 

2946
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:52,300
and carpeting and built up static 
electricity and then had like a piece of

2947
02:08:52,301 --> 02:08:53,770
metal in your hand like a quarter.

2948
02:08:53,980 --> 02:08:57,640
You could tap it just right and it would
throw a credits onto the.

2949
02:08:57,641 --> 02:08:59,650
Onto the machine.
Yeah,

2950
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:02,500
I did it all the time or that I've,
I've like,

2951
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:04,390
that is crazy.
My life.

2952
02:09:04,391 --> 02:09:09,391
I've always found all these weird scams 
that eventually like not only do they 

2953
02:09:09,391 --> 02:09:10,420
not save you a whole lot in the first 
place is twenty five cents,

2954
02:09:10,421 --> 02:09:13,310
but they also over time become,
you know,

2955
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:16,750
become worthless.
But it's weird little skills you pick up

2956
02:09:16,751 --> 02:09:21,751
just to just to cheat the,
like the ski bus over and put it in the 

2957
02:09:21,751 --> 02:09:26,131
50 and you just keep on getting those 
tickets and put it into throwing it in 

2958
02:09:28,790 --> 02:09:33,790
their tickets to animal that bad.
So many tickets that we hadn't.

2959
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:38,380
Anything of value.
There was always like one,

2960
02:09:38,381 --> 02:09:39,970
like,
like a beat box,

2961
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,220
like a,
you know,

2962
02:09:41,930 --> 02:09:45,610
you can't help that.
We'd call the day and yeah.

2963
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:48,010
And you can't save up to get that many 
tickets.

2964
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:53,010
A million tickets for this one.
You thinking about how much money you 

2965
02:09:53,010 --> 02:09:55,711
spent,
how much time of your life has gone 

2966
02:09:55,711 --> 02:09:55,711
rolling a stupid ball.
Oh,

2967
02:09:55,711 --> 02:09:59,941
all the things I've done that take time.
Like the amount of time I've spent 

2968
02:09:59,941 --> 02:10:01,090
playing poker,
the amount of time I spend watching dumb

2969
02:10:01,091 --> 02:10:03,640
movies.
How you a road poker player.

2970
02:10:03,641 --> 02:10:05,250
Do you go to casinos when you do the 
road?

2971
02:10:05,251 --> 02:10:08,190
That's what I'm in a gambling town or 
like I don't,

2972
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:13,200
I don't seek out casinos everywhere I go
because a lot of places have them now 

2973
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:14,980
because if Indian grounds or because 
you're on a boat on the river.

2974
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:16,540
But uh,
I only,

2975
02:10:16,570 --> 02:10:20,470
I only go if I'm playing the casino or 
you know,

2976
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:25,790
or I live across the street from it.
That's part of what I love about going 

2977
02:10:25,790 --> 02:10:29,010
to see UFC in vegas is it gets me away 
from the tables for like five hours 

2978
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:29,950
because.
Yeah,

2979
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:31,930
because I'll just sit and play and play 
and play,

2980
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:32,830
you know,
I love it,

2981
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:34,340
but it's such a waste of time.

2982
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:38,330
But also,
and it also at this point in my life,

2983
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:41,950
the thrill of winning a hand isn't 
really the same because I don't,

2984
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:44,900
I don't need the money as bad.
You know,

2985
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:47,270
back when I was playing when I was like,
you know,

2986
02:10:47,271 --> 02:10:52,271
I,
I could pay for rent next month in his 

2987
02:10:52,271 --> 02:10:52,271
hand.
That was,

2988
02:10:52,271 --> 02:10:53,270
it was a lot more exciting.
Well,

2989
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:58,271
Ari should fear would one point in time 
was winning more money playing poker 

2990
02:10:58,271 --> 02:10:59,180
than he was making it,
doing comedy for?

2991
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:04,210
He's a good player.
I only played like we were the same 

2992
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:04,550
table in one tournament once I think,
but I,

2993
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:09,640
I,
I got to vibe off of him like he really 

2994
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:12,461
knows what he's doing because I still.
There's still things that professional 

2995
02:11:12,461 --> 02:11:13,460
poker players could,
could teach me that I could,

2996
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:16,580
I could stand to learn,
but I'm just too lazy to learn.

2997
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:19,550
Like you know,
all the kinds of calculations you should

2998
02:11:19,551 --> 02:11:23,870
be making during each hand.
Like how exactly how much to bet and all

2999
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:25,490
that stuff.
I'm just more like,

3000
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:27,350
you know,
just goofing around.

3001
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:32,380
He was just having fun.
You're not trying to be the best poker 

3002
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:32,380
player in the world.
No,

3003
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,110
but I'm trying.
I'm trying to win through.

3004
02:11:33,111 --> 02:11:35,210
Just playing like an asshole.
You can play chess.

3005
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,860
I did.
You know,

3006
02:11:36,861 --> 02:11:39,620
when I was younger.
I haven't haven't in a long time.

3007
02:11:40,010 --> 02:11:42,890
That's a great obsession game.
That game could drive people.

3008
02:11:42,891 --> 02:11:44,630
Deepened the whole.
Yeah.

3009
02:11:44,631 --> 02:11:46,910
You could spend a lot of time on that.
You can go crazy.

3010
02:11:46,911 --> 02:11:51,911
You can really go mad and playing chess 
because for certain people it absorbs 

3011
02:11:51,911 --> 02:11:53,000
there everyday.
Like there'll be walking down the street

3012
02:11:53,001 --> 02:11:55,160
and there'll be thinking about moves.
Like it starts.

3013
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:57,050
It starts getting to a point where you 
know,

3014
02:11:57,230 --> 02:11:59,510
you,
you see a direct result between the more

3015
02:11:59,511 --> 02:12:02,130
concentrated you are,
the more you concentrate on it,

3016
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:07,150
more that you focus on it,
the more you start winning and the 

3017
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:07,150
better you get at playing chess and then
you just go.

3018
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:08,630
You get lost,
then you're crazy.

3019
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:09,130
Yeah.
See,

3020
02:12:09,131 --> 02:12:14,131
that's what I suggest doing poker is I 
don't like sit there and evaluate how 

3021
02:12:14,131 --> 02:12:16,520
everyone else is playing and what their 
personalities are and like,

3022
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:21,660
oh,
what he did on that hand and then what 

3023
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:21,660
he did on the next hand.
Like I'm just like more,

3024
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:23,190
I'm just playing in the moment and I 
know when,

3025
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:25,760
you know,
I know good cards when I see him or when

3026
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:27,050
I have a good chance of,
you know,

3027
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,690
drawing a winning hand and I just sort 
of,

3028
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:30,980
you know,
play like that.

3029
02:12:31,010 --> 02:12:33,710
I did a movie once and the guy who was 
renting out the house,

3030
02:12:33,711 --> 02:12:34,490
they rent out,
you know,

3031
02:12:34,491 --> 02:12:36,860
you want to shoot a movie in the house,
you can rent someone's house like people

3032
02:12:36,861 --> 02:12:40,950
offer them for rent and this guy was a 
professional chess player and um,

3033
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:43,110
so you know,
a lot of downtime during movie.

3034
02:12:43,110 --> 02:12:45,050
So I'd go hang out with this guy and 
talk to them,

3035
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:49,160
try to figure out what he was doing.
And he was playing chess online,

3036
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:50,870
you know,
with all these different people.

3037
02:12:50,871 --> 02:12:53,870
And he was like some super fucking 
master chess player.

3038
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:59,020
So it was a,
it was fascinating that he's got this 

3039
02:12:59,020 --> 02:13:00,890
giant community of apparently you could 
just get chess games like anytime of the

3040
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,060
day,
anytime of the night online,

3041
02:13:02,061 --> 02:13:03,830
whatever level you're at,
you know,

3042
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:06,140
and there's people from all over the 
world that would play chess with,

3043
02:13:06,141 --> 02:13:08,990
you know,
same thing with scrabble really.

3044
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:11,080
People are fucking nuts with the 
scrabble,

3045
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:15,500
scrabble computer downwards with like 
where they're playing against people all

3046
02:13:15,501 --> 02:13:20,501
over the place.
But you can see you can do it anytime 

3047
02:13:20,501 --> 02:13:20,990
you want.
That's part of what I love about twitter

3048
02:13:20,991 --> 02:13:25,991
is if I am like up in the middle of the 
night and not asleep for some reason 

3049
02:13:25,991 --> 02:13:26,480
because I got to go to the airport or 
whatever.

3050
02:13:27,250 --> 02:13:29,970
Can't sleep that.
So great that like the,

3051
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:32,550
it's the,
that it's international.

3052
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:34,890
Once you get a certain number of 
followers you can like,

3053
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:39,950
you know,
I'm sure some people go on twitter and 

3054
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:39,950
they're pissed because they,
you know,

3055
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:43,750
they can't,
nobody that they follow saying anything 

3056
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:44,010
or write back to them.
But it just.

3057
02:13:44,011 --> 02:13:47,940
So it's such,
such a 24 hour chat room source of.

3058
02:13:48,490 --> 02:13:48,930
Yeah.
Well,

3059
02:13:48,931 --> 02:13:51,570
you don't have to chat with people,
you can just read what people are saying

3060
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:53,880
and really choose what you want to 
respond to.

3061
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:56,250
The 24 hour aspect is really interesting
when you're flying,

3062
02:13:56,251 --> 02:14:00,030
when you're in like in England or Europe
or something like that and times are all

3063
02:14:00,031 --> 02:14:05,031
screwed up and weird,
but you can constantly be tweeting and 

3064
02:14:05,031 --> 02:14:05,340
you know,
and you can kind of like,

3065
02:14:05,341 --> 02:14:08,640
it kind of replaces texting all your 
friends about what you're doing.

3066
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:12,300
You just send a tweet that's not going 
to wake somebody up like you didn't want

3067
02:14:12,301 --> 02:14:17,301
to text.
So I'm at Buckingham Palace and you 

3068
02:14:17,301 --> 02:14:20,131
know,
they're trying to sleep and the phone's 

3069
02:14:20,131 --> 02:14:20,131
going on,
you know,

3070
02:14:20,131 --> 02:14:22,730
it's a good way to like I use it as like
a texting device when I think somebody 

3071
02:14:22,730 --> 02:14:25,320
might not be awake,
I just write to them a direct message on

3072
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:28,560
twitter instead of texting them.
Oh do you really?

3073
02:14:28,580 --> 02:14:30,990
I don't check those enough.
Yeah,

3074
02:14:30,991 --> 02:14:35,991
I know you're really slow to get back on
those sometimes for weeks and some 

3075
02:14:36,031 --> 02:14:36,690
people,
it's funny,

3076
02:14:36,691 --> 02:14:38,250
when you write direct messages to 
people,

3077
02:14:38,251 --> 02:14:43,251
sometimes they just don't even know that
that's a thing that I did that with 

3078
02:14:43,251 --> 02:14:43,380
voicemail.
Now I don't ever listen to my voicemails

3079
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:45,600
and it's probably the dumbest thing 
ever,

3080
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:46,390
but I just,
that's,

3081
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,970
to me,
it's just annoying.

3082
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:50,130
I went to one guys,
one guy tweeted me,

3083
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,900
one guy tweeted me,
it was like,

3084
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:54,350
it's a shame who's fucking phone is on?

3085
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:57,690
That was me.
That would wake a person up.

3086
02:14:57,730 --> 02:14:58,560
Yeah,
that's brutal.

3087
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:03,650
How hard.
Why don't you have that bitch on 

3088
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:03,650
vibrate?
He's not used to doing podcasts.

3089
02:15:03,650 --> 02:15:06,540
One Guy tweeted,
one guy tweeted me,

3090
02:15:06,550 --> 02:15:08,790
um,
something that was on vibrate.

3091
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:11,940
It wasn't me.
It was a fibrate.

3092
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:13,720
Shit's broken sun.
Yeah,

3093
02:15:13,721 --> 02:15:14,640
it's,
it's,

3094
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:19,860
it's got a weird quirk to it because you
don't have a case on you drop that 

3095
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:19,860
bitch.
Tell the truth.

3096
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:20,320
No,
I,

3097
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:25,360
it's,
I've done pretty good at not dropping 

3098
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:25,360
it.
It's my baby,

3099
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:25,360
you know,
I don't.

3100
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:25,360
Uh,
I don't drop it.

3101
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,450
This guy tweeted me.
Um,

3102
02:15:26,620 --> 02:15:31,620
you know,
it's a shame that you can't reply and 

3103
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:32,970
say something to,
for help the troops.

3104
02:15:32,971 --> 02:15:37,971
It was like really weird,
like phonetically all fucked up and it 

3105
02:15:37,971 --> 02:15:39,390
was all caps to see,
to support the troops,

3106
02:15:39,650 --> 02:15:42,030
the explanation point,
exclamation point one,

3107
02:15:42,031 --> 02:15:42,600
one,
one.

3108
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:43,560
And it was like it was.

3109
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,640
And then I go,
wow,

3110
02:15:44,641 --> 02:15:48,120
what the fuck did I like?
This guy expects me to reply is I have a

3111
02:15:48,121 --> 02:15:49,670
half a million twitter followers.
Dude.

3112
02:15:49,710 --> 02:15:51,570
Sometimes I don't look at it all day.
I don't.

3113
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:53,220
There's no way I could respond to 
everybody.

3114
02:15:53,221 --> 02:15:54,450
It's impossible.
I do.

3115
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:56,800
So then I thought you're awesome.
Every single person.

3116
02:15:56,850 --> 02:15:57,870
Absolutely awesome.
Right?

3117
02:15:57,871 --> 02:16:00,990
So then I go to every single person,
but quite a few,

3118
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:06,020
I go to his twitter page and that's the 
same message he sent to literally 

3119
02:16:06,020 --> 02:16:07,860
thousands of evil.
He just like,

3120
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:10,900
Oh yeah,
you go look at any time somebody writes,

3121
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:14,460
in case you're wondering about their 
personality or whatever,

3122
02:16:14,461 --> 02:16:16,300
you can go and see everything else 
they've written.

3123
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:21,310
I love robot.
Probably hate it when it's like if it's 

3124
02:16:21,310 --> 02:16:21,840
at Benson,
at Joe Rogan,

3125
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:23,670
at red band,
some some shit.

3126
02:16:24,110 --> 02:16:25,160
And it's like,
well,

3127
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:26,390
no,
that's what happened.

3128
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:28,620
That's what happens is it's fine when 
it's,

3129
02:16:28,621 --> 02:16:29,980
my actual friends are

3130
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,290
thrown in there like we all have common 
interests,

3131
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:35,290
but when somebody just throws in random,
you know,

3132
02:16:35,291 --> 02:16:36,340
like,
you know,

3133
02:16:36,341 --> 02:16:40,440
princess.
So it's as well that's just,

3134
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:43,900
that's just his ass will now be tweeting
you tonight.

3135
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:47,050
I guarantee you people are right.
Snoop Dogg and Doug Benson,

3136
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:51,130
you guys something about pot that they 
think we both need to know.

3137
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:56,370
But when they just throw in,
like when it's just to me and Kim 

3138
02:16:56,370 --> 02:16:58,330
Kardashians and Brian Williams from NBC 
news or whatever,

3139
02:16:58,331 --> 02:17:01,220
like some weird combination of,
you know,

3140
02:17:02,030 --> 02:17:03,760
on the,
on the fringe celebrity,

3141
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:05,010
uh,
it's,

3142
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:08,080
it's such a turnout.
It makes you want to just not respond to

3143
02:17:08,081 --> 02:17:13,081
them.
And then you go look at their page and 

3144
02:17:13,081 --> 02:17:13,870
they're just randomly picking names and 
that's how they do a lot of,

3145
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:17,270
uh,
there's a lot of spam now on,

3146
02:17:17,340 --> 02:17:19,530
on twitter.
If you,

3147
02:17:19,710 --> 02:17:24,710
you know,
as soon as you get a message us that 

3148
02:17:24,710 --> 02:17:26,761
seems like an ad and then you,
then you check their page and they're 

3149
02:17:26,761 --> 02:17:26,761
just,
it's just sending that same thing.

3150
02:17:26,761 --> 02:17:28,850
I'm talking to my podcast.

3151
02:17:29,310 --> 02:17:32,440
So in the interest of brevity,
I got hacked like I,

3152
02:17:32,470 --> 02:17:34,040
I signed up for,
yeah,

3153
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:39,380
I must have clicked on some link to get 
some twitter picture or something like 

3154
02:17:39,380 --> 02:17:41,370
that.
And somehow or another they tweeted from

3155
02:17:41,371 --> 02:17:46,371
my account about some contests for an 
ipad two and I was following them.

3156
02:17:47,191 --> 02:17:48,570
All of the sudden I was like,
wow,

3157
02:17:48,571 --> 02:17:53,571
this is amazing.
Like they hacked into by twitter 

3158
02:17:53,571 --> 02:17:55,851
account.
You apparently it was probably some red 

3159
02:17:55,851 --> 02:17:55,851
tape or some,
you know,

3160
02:17:55,851 --> 02:17:56,280
find print rather.
And you know,

3161
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,890
when you agreed to,
uh,

3162
02:17:57,960 --> 02:17:59,440
accept some,
you know,

3163
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:00,720
some twitter application.

3164
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:04,330
It happens everyday.
Not Everyday,

3165
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:09,350
but pretty frequently I'll see one of my
more famous friends or people had 

3166
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:09,870
followed just because I'm curious about 
them,

3167
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:13,310
that we still treat something odd or 
something that sends,

3168
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:15,630
seems like an ad.
And then the next tweet is like,

3169
02:18:15,631 --> 02:18:16,830
Oh shit,
I got hacked.

3170
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:22,160
Do you know,
did you see when Ashton Kutcher was 

3171
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:22,160
tweeting?
Oh my gosh,

3172
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:23,100
that was particularly about paternal 
being fired.

3173
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:24,690
Yeah,
because he did all.

3174
02:18:24,691 --> 02:18:26,820
He knew all he,
all he reacted to,

3175
02:18:26,821 --> 02:18:28,680
and I'm sure that's what a lot of people
reacted to,

3176
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:34,010
was just hearing that this amazing coach
got fired just very suddenly and he 

3177
02:18:35,971 --> 02:18:37,020
didn't stop to think,
wow,

3178
02:18:37,021 --> 02:18:42,021
that big of a move.
Like why would penn state following a 

3179
02:18:42,021 --> 02:18:43,560
fire a guy?
So suddenly if something really terrible

3180
02:18:43,561 --> 02:18:46,620
didn't happen,
but he still went on and tweeted,

3181
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:48,570
oh man,
that's a bummer.

3182
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:50,760
Or something like that.
Or I love you,

3183
02:18:50,761 --> 02:18:53,520
Joe Pa.
Yeah.

3184
02:18:53,550 --> 02:18:54,930
Yeah.
And then the other guy,

3185
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:58,230
but then he did Qa,
I guess kind of a good thing to spin it.

3186
02:18:58,231 --> 02:19:03,231
He respond.
He retweeted every person that wrote to 

3187
02:19:03,231 --> 02:19:06,321
them,
you're an asshole urine idiot and you 

3188
02:19:06,321 --> 02:19:06,321
just write in each one something like,
yeah,

3189
02:19:06,321 --> 02:19:07,830
I'm sorry I did.
I just didn't know all the facts.

3190
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:10,700
He sort of responded to a lot of people 
in show them,

3191
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:13,140
showed a lot of the vitriol that was 
happening.

3192
02:19:13,350 --> 02:19:16,740
You made a staff at Foxconn responded 
to.

3193
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:22,100
It seemed like something he really did.
It was kind of the whole factory of 

3194
02:19:22,100 --> 02:19:25,371
people responding to twitter.
Imagine he is always Chinese workers,

3195
02:19:26,170 --> 02:19:28,190
like the ones they use in world of 
warcraft

3196
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:30,100
to build up your energy,
you know,

3197
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:35,280
they send your account overseas and some
Chinese guy plays with it until he 

3198
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,050
fucking starves to death.
Just copying machines,

3199
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:40,520
body aside and throw some new student 
onto the block too.

3200
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:44,810
I'm not cynical enough to think that 
Ashton didn't do it himself because it.

3201
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:47,120
Because it all happened in such real 
time.

3202
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:49,100
Right.
You just had so many people.

3203
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:53,020
Seems to me that when you're a celebrity
that's involved in a public scandal,

3204
02:19:53,080 --> 02:19:58,080
he has this most latest one.
It seems interesting that he's tweeting 

3205
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:58,970
people at all.
You know,

3206
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:01,220
it's like you wouldn't.
You would think if you're gonna,

3207
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:06,640
you're gonna read any of the replies.
You know you're going to get a lot of 

3208
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:10,601
people that are going to ask you a bunch
of questions and you don't want to 

3209
02:20:10,601 --> 02:20:12,881
answer like,
do you really want to just go out there 

3210
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:12,881
and,
and interconnect with people,

3211
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:12,881
but I guess he does it.

3212
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:14,600
Spill.
That's the amazing thing is it's like,

3213
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:16,880
you know,
how important is it to get,

3214
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:20,440
to try to feel like you're getting your 
side of it out when,

3215
02:20:20,441 --> 02:20:22,630
when you think you're misunderstood,
you know,

3216
02:20:22,631 --> 02:20:24,020
and,
and at a certain point in time,

3217
02:20:24,021 --> 02:20:27,200
a lot of the people's twitters become a 
very impersonal,

3218
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:29,090
you know,
when the numbers get too big,

3219
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:34,120
it seems like people take less chances.
The they say less than a million people 

3220
02:20:34,641 --> 02:20:37,320
writing back to you that you shouldn't 
have used a certain slur.

3221
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:42,380
Something when you were trying to.
The joke was how inappropriate what you 

3222
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:42,380
were.
Right.

3223
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:45,200
Like I'll sometimes,
if I think it's something really dark,

3224
02:20:45,201 --> 02:20:50,201
I'll just,
I'll just drop it in the middle of the 

3225
02:20:50,201 --> 02:20:52,130
night because a lot of stuff just gets 
sort of lost in the twitter verse,

3226
02:20:52,131 --> 02:20:54,020
you know,
like nobody's sitting.

3227
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:59,021
Most people don't sit and read every 
single thing written by every single 

3228
02:20:59,021 --> 02:20:59,021
person.

3229
02:20:59,021 --> 02:21:01,310
They follow that because a lot of people
follow a thousand people.

3230
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:05,900
So you're just in this kind of rushing 
stream of comments and sometimes they'll

3231
02:21:05,901 --> 02:21:10,901
land on you because they know they like 
you more than other people they follow 

3232
02:21:10,901 --> 02:21:11,660
or whatever.
But sometimes they'll also like anything

3233
02:21:11,661 --> 02:21:13,610
that looks like you're just promoting a 
Gig,

3234
02:21:13,611 --> 02:21:17,630
they might just breeze past it.
I get every time I play a town,

3235
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:20,660
like the day after on twitter,
someone will write me,

3236
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:25,661
when are you coming to?
And it's that town I was just in and it 

3237
02:21:25,661 --> 02:21:26,180
just been tweeting about.
But it's just,

3238
02:21:26,181 --> 02:21:29,510
you can't expect everybody to see 
everything.

3239
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:30,810
It's hard to.
I mean,

3240
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:32,220
think that you're going to communicate.
I mean you,

3241
02:21:32,221 --> 02:21:35,810
you got to hope that your twitter is 
interesting enough that people are going

3242
02:21:35,811 --> 02:21:37,400
to lock onto it,
you know,

3243
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:42,430
and you're going to hope that you build 
some sort of a community there and then 

3244
02:21:42,430 --> 02:21:46,631
they're going to be able to follow you 
on your website or follow you at your 

3245
02:21:46,631 --> 02:21:47,770
shows or look through your tweets to 
find out where you're at or you know,

3246
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,030
do you have a little schedule on your 
twitter page?

3247
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:52,490
So if you go to your twitter page,
you can see what the upcoming dates are.

3248
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:55,940
They have a link to a site where I've 
got all my dates,

3249
02:21:55,941 --> 02:22:00,941
but that,
what do you guys think about this new 

3250
02:22:00,941 --> 02:22:00,941
business they have on there with all 
the,

3251
02:22:00,941 --> 02:22:01,550
um,
you know,

3252
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:05,550
activity following activity following.
Oh,

3253
02:22:06,470 --> 02:22:11,470
clicked on that.
Yet there's a word activity now in the 

3254
02:22:11,470 --> 02:22:14,051
top of your page and if you click on it,
you see just a list of everything that 

3255
02:22:14,121 --> 02:22:16,190
everybody,
you follow what they're up to,

3256
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:18,110
like,
who they've retreated,

3257
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:21,590
who they're following,
much information tells you,

3258
02:22:21,591 --> 02:22:26,591
it tells you.
You get to find out now as soon as 

3259
02:22:26,591 --> 02:22:26,591
somebody follows you,
do you do that?

3260
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:29,610
Because that's kind of interesting 
because then because then you can,

3261
02:22:29,611 --> 02:22:34,611
if you're just sitting there looking at 
it and it comes up that somebody just 

3262
02:22:34,611 --> 02:22:37,281
started following you,
it's kind of cool to just immediately 

3263
02:22:37,281 --> 02:22:37,281
send them some sort of,
hey,

3264
02:22:37,281 --> 02:22:37,590
welcome,
hope you hope you like it.

3265
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:40,430
Kind of message from my peer specialists
got big tits.

3266
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,000
Dude,
tell me what you do,

3267
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:43,800
how do you work and how do you work with
Doug Benson?

3268
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:45,630
It's 2:00
in the morning,

3269
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,740
11 in the morning.
Okay,

3270
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:49,980
here's the scenario.
You're alone stone to the gills.

3271
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:55,400
Okay.
And you just like checking out twitter 

3272
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,470
and some really ridiculously hot suicide
girl with tattoos just starts following 

3273
02:23:00,241 --> 02:23:01,020
you.
I,

3274
02:23:01,021 --> 02:23:02,820
you know,
I might write back and say,

3275
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,590
you know,
hey,

3276
02:23:04,591 --> 02:23:07,120
what's up?
Or what's up?

3277
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:08,590
Hello?
Or whatever.

3278
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:09,780
Just what you do,
just reach,

3279
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:10,790
reach,
reach out,

3280
02:23:10,810 --> 02:23:12,360
somebody to see what happens to a little
high,

3281
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:12,810
just little,
hey,

3282
02:23:12,811 --> 02:23:15,420
what's up?
Nothing incriminating button creeping.

3283
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:20,580
And then often what we'll come back is I
can't direct message you because you 

3284
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:24,411
don't follow me.
And my next direct message says the 

3285
02:23:24,411 --> 02:23:26,010
system works and then you know,
and then you,

3286
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:28,980
you see how different people handle it.

3287
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:33,980
Different ways.
Some people will get pissed off right 

3288
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:33,980
away and don't want to,
you know,

3289
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:36,831
don't want to deal with somebody where 
they're half of the conversation is 

3290
02:23:36,831 --> 02:23:36,831
public,
but your half is,

3291
02:23:36,831 --> 02:23:39,690
is private.
But you know,

3292
02:23:39,691 --> 02:23:40,950
what else am I going to do?
You know,

3293
02:23:40,951 --> 02:23:43,350
I,
I'm not on twitter to have conversations

3294
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:46,890
with other people in front of all,
all of my followers because.

3295
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:49,830
So why don't you just fucking with them,
it's not interesting to read.

3296
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:52,410
Just follow them for a little while and 
then unfold.

3297
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:56,220
You can do that for 20 number,
but no.

3298
02:23:56,221 --> 02:24:00,060
Then I really will play a game where if 
there's somebody that I want to follow,

3299
02:24:00,061 --> 02:24:04,530
I will add them and then go through the 
list and see who's going to go.

3300
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:08,670
It's usually somebody that I followed 
that just ultimately is their tweets.

3301
02:24:08,671 --> 02:24:10,320
Haven't been that interesting because 
they're like,

3302
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:10,950
you know,
I,

3303
02:24:10,951 --> 02:24:13,960
I followed some crazy super famous 
people just because I,

3304
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:16,830
I think it could be interesting and some
I cling to like I,

3305
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:19,050
I love following Alec Baldwin.

3306
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,840
I think he's really entertaining and 
yeah,

3307
02:24:21,841 --> 02:24:24,340
and I don't follow them out.
But I gave up my,

3308
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:29,450
her,
I followed her for a while and then 

3309
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:29,450
stop.
I stopped a long time ago.

3310
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:34,360
Why?
Because he just tweets a lot and for 

3311
02:24:34,360 --> 02:24:36,420
awhile there it was just a lot of back 
and forth with Demi Moore and that was 

3312
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:36,420
just kinda like they were being way too 
cute.

3313
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:38,730
Like the whole time you're like,
this relationship is not going to last.

3314
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:41,040
They're putting way too much effort into
pretending,

3315
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:46,310
not pretending,
maybe actually being in love with each 

3316
02:24:46,310 --> 02:24:46,310
other,
but they just won't shut up about it.

3317
02:24:46,310 --> 02:24:49,290
How can you maintain that is a couple 
PDA on twitter's growth.

3318
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:52,920
What if she's a lesbian and he's like 
her beard?

3319
02:24:54,220 --> 02:24:55,740
Ooh,
no,

3320
02:24:55,741 --> 02:24:58,880
I think they probably fucked.
They had turned sex where?

3321
02:24:58,890 --> 02:25:00,280
Like the creepy weird.
Sorry.

3322
02:25:00,370 --> 02:25:03,930
I came in and looked ashen,
his asshole and stuff like that.

3323
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:06,210
Brian,
you just ruined everything.

3324
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:10,890
It ruined everything.
I know he's mad at Ashton now.

3325
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,040
Ashton supposedly having affairs.
Oh,

3326
02:25:14,060 --> 02:25:16,650
so now they don't talk.
Uncle Bruce is going to kick them out.

3327
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:18,900
But that's the funny thing that he's,
you know,

3328
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:22,510
for TV viewers instantly forgive the 
whole thing about him having affairs,

3329
02:25:22,650 --> 02:25:24,040
but you know,

3330
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:29,070
that show the ratings might have come 
down a little bit from the jumping out 

3331
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:30,100
in favor of Joe Papa.
Really at the wrong moment,

3332
02:25:30,580 --> 02:25:31,900
you know,
because you know,

3333
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:36,580
that's what's amazing to me about the 
whole Penn state story is just that.

3334
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:37,570
That is,
that is,

3335
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:40,690
you know,
only one notch above the worst thing.

3336
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,460
The worst thing a person could do 
probably right there,

3337
02:25:44,370 --> 02:25:49,370
you know,
and I don't even want to think about 

3338
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:49,370
what's below it and,
and you know,

3339
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:53,671
and so everyone's disgusted by it,
but some are still managed to be some 

3340
02:25:53,671 --> 02:25:54,880
people that,
that are just,

3341
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:58,900
you know,
defending in some weird way,

3342
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:04,920
you know,
the people that were involved in the 

3343
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:04,920
story.
Yeah.

3344
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:04,920
You can't,
you know,

3345
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:07,570
I was saying how weird it is.
The guy's name was officer or Macquarie,

3346
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:08,560
the guy who,
uh,

3347
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:11,020
found them in,
in the hotel room together,

3348
02:26:11,021 --> 02:26:16,021
which did,
that whole thing now is just falling 

3349
02:26:16,021 --> 02:26:16,021
apart.

3350
02:26:16,021 --> 02:26:16,570
His story's not matching what,
what supposedly happened at the time.

3351
02:26:16,571 --> 02:26:17,650
And which guy?
Macquarie.

3352
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:19,120
Yeah.
He's saying now that he went,

3353
02:26:19,150 --> 02:26:22,630
he did go to police officers and then 
they and they proceeded to,

3354
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:27,950
you know,
not follow through because initially 

3355
02:26:27,950 --> 02:26:31,060
he's just sick of getting all this shit 
about people saying that he just went to

3356
02:26:31,061 --> 02:26:34,840
Joe Pa and he didn't go to the cops.
So he now he's saying he did,

3357
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:37,060
but he testified,
you know,

3358
02:26:37,061 --> 02:26:39,070
because this guy has gone through,
you know,

3359
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:44,250
people had to testify for and against 
San Dusky before on it earlier charges,

3360
02:26:45,370 --> 02:26:50,370
this is crazy.
And so at that time it supposedly the 

3361
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:53,680
report was that he didn't speak to any 
cops and now he's saying he did.

3362
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,340
So it's,
it's,

3363
02:26:55,610 --> 02:27:00,310
it's one of those complicated,
horrifying stories that we may never end

3364
02:27:00,311 --> 02:27:02,920
in our lifetimes.
It may just go on and on and on,

3365
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:07,810
just because getting to the bottom of 
everything that happened.

3366
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:13,290
Like I heard someone tell someone else 
the theory that then I heard that is 

3367
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:17,680
just absolutely mortifying that,
you know,

3368
02:27:17,681 --> 02:27:22,681
this guy saying Dusky worked with the 
children's charity and those were the 

3369
02:27:22,681 --> 02:27:26,161
kids he was bringing to the Games and 
that they show pictures of him like 

3370
02:27:26,161 --> 02:27:27,490
leaning on these kids and they got 
little foothill football helmets on and,

3371
02:27:27,970 --> 02:27:32,970
and you know,
it's crazy that he was showering with 

3372
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:32,970
them at all,
like the kids and the end him.

3373
02:27:32,970 --> 02:27:34,330
Neither one of them are playing in a 
game.

3374
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:36,730
So why do they even need.
Why?

3375
02:27:36,970 --> 02:27:39,360
What's the pretense for being in the 
showers?

3376
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,260
Yeah,
like right there,

3377
02:27:41,261 --> 02:27:43,990
the guy's guilty.
Could he be,

3378
02:27:43,991 --> 02:27:45,810
you know,
like I don't care if you put.

3379
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:49,120
If he actually had sex with him,
he's just setting up that scenario,

3380
02:27:49,121 --> 02:27:51,250
makes them a creep that shouldn't be 
allowed to do that.

3381
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:55,780
And with kids with these disinfect,
these kids that are poor and you know,

3382
02:27:55,781 --> 02:27:58,450
and from foster homes or whatever the,
you know,

3383
02:27:58,451 --> 02:27:59,980
this,
this charity,

3384
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:02,780
he's,
he's got these extra vulnerable kids and

3385
02:28:02,790 --> 02:28:06,970
he's doing these things too and it's 
probably being taken to a football game.

3386
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:09,070
It's the most amazing thing that's ever 
happened to them.

3387
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:13,810
And they also don't necessarily 
understand the implications of what he's

3388
02:28:13,811 --> 02:28:18,010
doing to them when he physically attacks
them or those photos real of his house.

3389
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:23,040
Like being in the same like,
like the backyard of an elementary 

3390
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:23,040
school.
Just seen

3391
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,160
that I bought surprise.
I mean it just like an elementary school

3392
02:28:26,161 --> 02:28:28,670
and a little bit of woods and then a 
house and then supposedly,

3393
02:28:28,671 --> 02:28:31,670
I don't know if it was just a joke,
but supposedly that's his house.

3394
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:33,260
Like on the other side of this little 
woods,

3395
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:38,560
I'm thinking like that woods is probably
like that scene in like human centipede 

3396
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:41,831
word.
Like they go and find this house in the 

3397
02:28:41,831 --> 02:28:41,831
middle of the other side of the woods 
and there's like a creepy guy that lives

3398
02:28:41,831 --> 02:28:43,970
in there and molests kids I come to,
you know,

3399
02:28:43,990 --> 02:28:48,990
you probably like sneaks through the 
forest and spies on kids at the 

3400
02:28:48,990 --> 02:28:50,510
elementary school and it's just like 
this creepy rape force.

3401
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:55,810
We all just start talking and just go.
It's hilarious when you're fucking high 

3402
02:28:56,030 --> 02:29:01,030
and just start talking about something 
because I never even got to my point 

3403
02:29:01,030 --> 02:29:01,220
which was,
which was that,

3404
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:06,820
you know,
there's a lot of rich people that also 

3405
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:07,070
pumped money into this charity because 
this guy told them to.

3406
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:12,070
And so this one law enforcement officer 
who I think probably has a good idea 

3407
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:16,031
about these things,
suggested the notion that this guy was 

3408
02:29:16,031 --> 02:29:18,680
grooming kids for boosters to fool 
around with.

3409
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:21,560
Oh my God.
Like there was a whole ring.

3410
02:29:21,740 --> 02:29:22,850
He had a whole.
Yeah.

3411
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:25,150
Like he had like,
he had a whole system like that.

3412
02:29:25,151 --> 02:29:26,780
That's a,
that's a possibility.

3413
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:31,990
Oh my God,
like this thing is going to get so 

3414
02:29:31,990 --> 02:29:32,600
twisted and deep as used.
Horrifying.

3415
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:38,950
It's amazing that he got away with it as
long as he did and the only way he got 

3416
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:38,960
away with it for 19 years,
20 years,

3417
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:43,961
whatever the fuck it was,
is if people knew and didn't say 

3418
02:29:43,961 --> 02:29:43,961
anything,
period.

3419
02:29:43,961 --> 02:29:47,020
It was the institution.
It was the everyone afraid of losing 

3420
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:47,030
their jobs,
losing the game,

3421
02:29:47,031 --> 02:29:48,160
losing their,
you know,

3422
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:49,340
their,
you know,

3423
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:51,980
everything is so important to them.

3424
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:54,920
I mean they rioted when he got fired,
you saw the riots,

3425
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:56,480
right?
What I'm saying,

3426
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:01,760
they were Ashton Kutcher,
Ashton Kutcher would've flipped a car 

3427
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,950
over if he was there because the story 
just got quickly,

3428
02:30:03,951 --> 02:30:08,951
more and more horrifying,
but they just reacted immediately that 

3429
02:30:08,951 --> 02:30:08,951
he was fired.
Yeah.

3430
02:30:08,951 --> 02:30:09,710
Well,
as soon as he was like,

3431
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:12,830
well also how horrible for him to come 
out and say,

3432
02:30:12,831 --> 02:30:17,831
this is horrible.
I'm going to finish out the season and 

3433
02:30:17,831 --> 02:30:18,590
then retire.
Like his first move should have been.

3434
02:30:18,591 --> 02:30:21,710
I'm Outta here.
Like I went to retire and I fucked up,

3435
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:24,440
but saying I'm going to finish out the 
season.

3436
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:30,070
That gave everyone like this hope that 
like they were going to have a great 

3437
02:30:30,070 --> 02:30:32,000
championship season and then worry about
this later,

3438
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:34,130
and so then when they turned around and 
really,

3439
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:39,340
you know,
he ended up being fired or resigned or 

3440
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:39,340
whatever,
however went down,

3441
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:39,860
that's when they started flipping shit 
over.

3442
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:42,650
This story was in a book.
It would be two.

3443
02:30:42,651 --> 02:30:44,180
Fantastic.
It'd be like,

3444
02:30:44,181 --> 02:30:47,360
this is too crazy.
This is not like a Stephen King Book.

3445
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:48,020
Yeah,
you wouldn't.

3446
02:30:48,021 --> 02:30:48,530
Yeah,
it is.

3447
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:49,430
Really.
It really is.

3448
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:54,460
Really is.
You would think there's no way that can 

3449
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:56,561
happen for this long.
There's no way I could go on for 20 

3450
02:30:56,561 --> 02:30:59,291
years and he could just keep getting 
away with it and keep mining these 

3451
02:30:59,291 --> 02:31:03,010
children to have such shame and 
confusion by the incident that they 

3452
02:31:03,010 --> 02:31:05,150
never tell anyone.
How many guys,

3453
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:06,450
how many kids?
Always kids.

3454
02:31:06,451 --> 02:31:11,451
It's also kids like most of this stuff 
happens with kids that are familiar 

3455
02:31:11,451 --> 02:31:12,620
with.
They're the person that attacks them.

3456
02:31:12,621 --> 02:31:17,621
It's never.
It's rarely an abject stranger who gets 

3457
02:31:17,621 --> 02:31:17,880
in their life and quickly done something
horrible.

3458
02:31:18,080 --> 02:31:19,980
We actually spent a good deal of time

3459
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,690
talking about this in the podcast last 
night.

3460
02:31:21,810 --> 02:31:24,530
About how,
or last time about how um,

3461
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:29,900
there were some emails back and forth 
from some priests were they actually 

3462
02:31:29,900 --> 02:31:32,130
talked about getting boys from troubled 
homes,

3463
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:34,860
getting boys who don't have good 
connections to their family.

3464
02:31:34,861 --> 02:31:36,680
They don't have anyone to count on.
Get them.

3465
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:41,490
They go after them and grown them.
Some dark shit,

3466
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:41,880
man.

3467
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:45,430
Yeah.
So this is Sanduski guy's just,

3468
02:31:45,490 --> 02:31:49,710
it's just not a very,
like we were making fun of earlier his,

3469
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:52,800
his side of the story,
talking to Bob Costas,

3470
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:58,040
particularly scary.
Bob Cast is so good at those interviews 

3471
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:58,160
too.
And I said,

3472
02:31:58,290 --> 02:32:00,840
why were you in this?
Why did you need to shower at all?

3473
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:02,300
Yeah,
that's a good question.

3474
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:04,380
Asking that.
That's a good question.

3475
02:32:04,830 --> 02:32:05,910
Well,
I think everybody,

3476
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:07,950
but he did press him pretty hard.
You did.

3477
02:32:08,070 --> 02:32:10,560
I think everybody assumes that guy fucks
kids.

3478
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:15,680
I think everybody's assuming that,
but they have to be careful in how they 

3479
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:17,160
proceed with questioning him,
I think.

3480
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:20,730
But the thing that he did that he did 
this tea,

3481
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,880
this radio interview to spin the court 
of public opinion,

3482
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:25,250
that's ridiculous,
you know,

3483
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:27,660
but I think it just made it worse.
I'll way,

3484
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:28,080
way,
way,

3485
02:32:28,081 --> 02:32:29,640
way worse,
way worse because he was.

3486
02:32:29,660 --> 02:32:34,660
Because he went into it with the Hubris 
in the confidence of thinking that as 

3487
02:32:34,660 --> 02:32:36,960
long as I just go in there and denied,
at least some people might believe me.

3488
02:32:37,470 --> 02:32:42,470
Yes.
But then saying just being such a creep 

3489
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:44,040
and saying like being around children 
now the answer is no.

3490
02:32:44,041 --> 02:32:46,890
I would never do that to a child.
That's the answer.

3491
02:32:47,110 --> 02:32:49,500
It's in their parents that are going to 
try to murder him.

3492
02:32:49,501 --> 02:32:51,290
Now I'm.
Oh yeah,

3493
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:56,330
no,
that's the thing that I think not only 

3494
02:32:56,330 --> 02:32:58,941
is the media outside his house now,
I think that like that's another crazy 

3495
02:32:58,941 --> 02:32:59,690
thing letting him go on bales.
Ridiculous.

3496
02:33:00,010 --> 02:33:02,130
Like,
I mean certainly in jail,

3497
02:33:02,131 --> 02:33:04,170
I don't think they cheat child predators
very well.

3498
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:07,740
They to isolate doctors,
isolate them in a jail,

3499
02:33:07,741 --> 02:33:09,330
like letting him go on bail.
I don't,

3500
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:11,760
I don't get that at all.
I think that guy's going to ice himself.

3501
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:16,790
He might ice himself or get out of the 
access to kids in showers have to be 

3502
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:20,211
limited at least to a couple of hours a 
week or something like that says you 

3503
02:33:20,211 --> 02:33:25,040
can't do it daily because that's what 
happened to him the first time where I 

3504
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:25,650
was.
They took away as key to the showers.

3505
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:30,860
What they took away.
It's got such a school did because the 

3506
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:31,680
first time it happened,
they believed him.

3507
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:33,210
When he said he was,
it was just horseplay.

3508
02:33:33,211 --> 02:33:38,211
There was no,
so it was hot and he had to only do hot 

3509
02:33:38,211 --> 02:33:38,211
dog hot tubs after that.
Oh my God.

3510
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:39,570
Yeah.
Where's it defined?

3511
02:33:39,571 --> 02:33:41,550
A new venue.
It takes them to hotel rooms.

3512
02:33:41,551 --> 02:33:46,551
That's what it does.
Who brought kids with them on the road 

3513
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:46,551
there were staying with them.
That's.

3514
02:33:46,551 --> 02:33:50,160
It's such an amazing.
Such an amazing cover.

3515
02:33:50,161 --> 02:33:55,161
Like I always.
I always joke around on stage about how 

3516
02:33:55,161 --> 02:33:58,010
wouldn't it be funny if I did all I've 
done to create this idea that I'm a pod 

3517
02:33:58,010 --> 02:34:00,810
comic and it turns out I am a cop and 
that all my shows,

3518
02:34:00,811 --> 02:34:05,811
everybody gets arrested like a giant 
sting operation.

3519
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:11,680
Other people in the pot movement it 
probably undercover cops you think?

3520
02:34:11,710 --> 02:34:16,710
Yeah,
there was one that died in a motorcycle 

3521
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:16,710
accident and he would uh,
meet at this.

3522
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:18,010
It was like a normal chapter.

3523
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:19,930
One of those groups,
you know,

3524
02:34:20,140 --> 02:34:21,490
and uh,
he was uh,

3525
02:34:21,510 --> 02:34:26,510
a local guy and he was in this,
this group and I died in a motorcycle 

3526
02:34:26,510 --> 02:34:31,411
accident.
It turned out he was a cop and he was 

3527
02:34:31,411 --> 02:34:32,140
undercover the entire time or maybe just
enjoying himself.

3528
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:34,150
I don't think so.
I think that was his job.

3529
02:34:34,151 --> 02:34:37,390
I think that's what it came to.
Kids that don't smoke course,

3530
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:41,110
which is an interesting.
Like those people are like saints to me.

3531
02:34:41,111 --> 02:34:43,930
Like why go to all this trouble or 
something that you're not doing,

3532
02:34:43,931 --> 02:34:45,850
but they see the big picture.
Yeah.

3533
02:34:45,851 --> 02:34:50,851
It's a freedom issue.
The main issue is why would anybody be 

3534
02:34:50,851 --> 02:34:54,451
able to tell you what you can't do and 
someone telling you that you can't get 

3535
02:34:54,451 --> 02:34:54,820
high is absolutely nuts.
It's crazy.

3536
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,100
It's like if you were.
I always say if you're on an island with

3537
02:34:57,101 --> 02:34:59,650
two people and one person said,
listen man,

3538
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:00,580
I don't want you getting high.

3539
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:02,380
You get high,
I'm going to put you in a cage.

3540
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:05,390
He'd be like,
I'm going to have to kill this guy going

3541
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:07,150
to lock me in a fucking cage if I get 
high.

3542
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:09,820
That's ridiculous.
Tell that I want to do.

3543
02:35:09,821 --> 02:35:14,821
Like if they said you can't,
you know you can't have sex with a 

3544
02:35:14,821 --> 02:35:15,100
cantaloupe,
and if there was four people,

3545
02:35:15,101 --> 02:35:17,890
and I mean it's just as ridiculous.
If there's a 4 million people,

3546
02:35:17,891 --> 02:35:22,891
it's just as ridiculous.
It's ridiculous for one person to tell 

3547
02:35:22,891 --> 02:35:25,921
you what you can and can't do with your 
bond and it's not gonna affect other 

3548
02:35:25,921 --> 02:35:28,351
people.
It's not an issue where you're ruining 

3549
02:35:28,351 --> 02:35:28,351
the fucking environment.
It's not an issue with her.

3550
02:35:28,351 --> 02:35:32,280
You're damaging the civilization.
You're not doing anything while you're 

3551
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:32,680
doing it wrong,
then you're doing it wrong.

3552
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:34,530
For sure.
Where?

3553
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:39,560
Where are you at this weekend and you're
going to do the Sunday show at the 

3554
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:40,660
center of your shows are sold out 
already,

3555
02:35:40,661 --> 02:35:40,810
right?

3556
02:35:40,810 --> 02:35:41,480
Yeah,
they're sold out.

3557
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:44,860
I got one.
I got one show at four,

3558
02:35:44,861 --> 02:35:48,640
20 in the afternoon on Sunday.
San Jose is ridiculous.

3559
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:52,970
You are sticking to a meme.
You to that motherfucker.

3560
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:55,270
Do you like it so much?
Well,

3561
02:35:55,271 --> 02:36:00,271
you know,
you gotta play clubs where they don't 

3562
02:36:00,271 --> 02:36:00,271
have a lot of windows,
you know,

3563
02:36:00,271 --> 02:36:00,271
so it still looks like a nightclub or 
whatever.

3564
02:36:00,271 --> 02:36:03,520
You've still got the same vibe,
but I've had really good time because,

3565
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:04,420
you know,
I'm,

3566
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:09,440
I'm done for the night,
I'm off for the rest of the night at 

3567
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:12,301
6:00
PM when I do that is cool and I get to 

3568
02:36:12,301 --> 02:36:16,621
actually go out and enjoy these cities 
that I visit all the time and never see 

3569
02:36:16,621 --> 02:36:17,410
because I'm in the stupid comedy club 
all night.

3570
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:21,270
Not to say that that's not also a great 
way to just do my living days.

3571
02:36:21,340 --> 02:36:26,340
But uh,
Saturdays and Sundays I'll and some 

3572
02:36:26,340 --> 02:36:26,340
cities I'll come in and they'll do both 
days.

3573
02:36:26,380 --> 02:36:31,380
You know,
like I got coming up at the Sacramento 

3574
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:31,380
punchline,
Martin Luther King weekend.

3575
02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:35,071
I'm going to do a show on four slash 
Saturday slash Sunday for 20 Monday and 

3576
02:36:35,071 --> 02:36:37,160
just hang out there all weekend,
have my nights free.

3577
02:36:37,340 --> 02:36:40,150
There's a lot of likeminded people in 
Sacramento.

3578
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:41,210
She says I am.
Yeah,

3579
02:36:41,250 --> 02:36:42,850
I see what you're saying.
It's a fun place.

3580
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:45,250
So that's a really smart thing to do,
man.

3581
02:36:45,251 --> 02:36:47,890
So you,
you sort of reorganized the weekend,

3582
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:50,230
you'd take a spot where it wasn't 
ordinarily open,

3583
02:36:50,231 --> 02:36:53,340
you open it for you and you can do it in
comedy clubs.

3584
02:36:53,341 --> 02:36:58,341
They see people that show up are the 
ones that I told about the show through 

3585
02:36:58,341 --> 02:37:00,010
my podcast or through twitter.
And so the crowds are great.

3586
02:37:00,011 --> 02:37:05,011
We play a game,
we play that game that I play on the 

3587
02:37:05,011 --> 02:37:05,011
podcast.
I'll let her Balton game.

3588
02:37:05,011 --> 02:37:06,440
We played that with audience members in 
my opening act and it's a,

3589
02:37:06,470 --> 02:37:07,270
it's a blast.

3590
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:09,070
Oh really?
That's how people from the audience come

3591
02:37:09,071 --> 02:37:09,780
up and,
and,

3592
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:14,940
and you know,
challenge to whoever I brought with me 

3593
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:18,031
on the road for that particular and it's
super fun and they're awake for four,

3594
02:37:18,900 --> 02:37:23,240
20 in the afternoon except in Denver.
Both Times I did it in Denver.

3595
02:37:23,241 --> 02:37:28,241
Somebody managed to get drunk,
but everywhere else they're sober.

3596
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:29,300
They're not,
you know,

3597
02:37:29,301 --> 02:37:32,990
they may be a few beers in or whatever,
but like they're not that,

3598
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:35,780
that kind of trash that you see when you
do shows at night,

3599
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:41,080
especially in a town where there was 
some sports thing in the afternoon and 

3600
02:37:41,080 --> 02:37:42,260
they'd been drinking since then.
They come to your show and there were,

3601
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:44,480
you know,
they're pre drunk before they even start

3602
02:37:44,481 --> 02:37:49,481
drinking their two drink minimum.
So is that how you're doing all your 

3603
02:37:49,481 --> 02:37:49,481
shows now?
You're doing all?

3604
02:37:49,481 --> 02:37:50,180
Not all of them.
I also do like,

3605
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:52,340
I'll go into a club and just be there on
a night.

3606
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:55,250
They're normally closed Sunday,
Monday or Tuesday,

3607
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:57,590
like I'm doing the,
um,

3608
02:37:57,980 --> 02:38:02,600
Fort Lauderdale Improv on Monday,
December 11th,

3609
02:38:02,601 --> 02:38:05,810
and the West Palm Improv on Tuesday,
December twelfth.

3610
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:08,330
And they're both huge clubs.
They're really nice,

3611
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:10,790
but they're huge.
So every time I play there,

3612
02:38:11,050 --> 02:38:16,050
you know,
normally if I have to do two or three 

3613
02:38:16,050 --> 02:38:17,921
shows,
I'm just not gonna to every show is 

3614
02:38:17,921 --> 02:38:19,721
going to have a lot of empty seats.
But if I just go in and do one on a 

3615
02:38:19,721 --> 02:38:22,700
night when they're not even normally 
open and hopefully everybody that's,

3616
02:38:22,730 --> 02:38:25,270
you know,
into me and has the night available.

3617
02:38:25,630 --> 02:38:26,990
Come check it out.
Yeah.

3618
02:38:26,991 --> 02:38:29,630
That improv is gigantic.
I think it's 600 plus seats,

3619
02:38:29,631 --> 02:38:31,010
right?
Isn't it?

3620
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:32,690
It's a palace.
You know?

3621
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:37,930
That's a big goddamn place.
Now when you think about how many shows 

3622
02:38:37,930 --> 02:38:39,680
you're doing two shows on a Friday night
and 600 seats.

3623
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:41,670
Holy Shit Man.
That's a.

3624
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:42,850
that's a good day here.

3625
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:44,330
Show.
That's a theater show.

3626
02:38:44,331 --> 02:38:46,830
It's hard to get that many people to 
come to her and it's like,

3627
02:38:47,740 --> 02:38:48,380
oh,
you're dying.

3628
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,120
What?
Your Voice.

3629
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:53,460
Because that's the new impression.
This is a,

3630
02:38:53,710 --> 02:38:58,710
this is mafia Doug Benson data.
Come on the watering a podcast pretty 

3631
02:39:03,351 --> 02:39:04,220
much over.
What do you think?

3632
02:39:05,140 --> 02:39:07,070
You know,
since I can't talk anymore,

3633
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:09,920
is that really your voice now?
For like a minute or two?

3634
02:39:09,921 --> 02:39:13,670
I just like know you're serious.
Wow.

3635
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:18,910
Yeah.
Because I was on one of those tirades 

3636
02:39:18,910 --> 02:39:18,910
where we want something to drink and 
take a breath.

3637
02:39:18,910 --> 02:39:20,030
Do you want a water or something?
I got a water.

3638
02:39:20,180 --> 02:39:20,900
Okay.
You're okay.

3639
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:26,840
Damn.
I never seen anybody before fall apart.

3640
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:29,210
I mean you're okay.
I not read about it.

3641
02:39:29,211 --> 02:39:30,200
I'm falling apart.

3642
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:35,690
Just vocally fall apart.
I'm trying to pull it back faster than I

3643
02:39:35,691 --> 02:39:36,560
normally would.
But.

3644
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:41,990
So when did you start doing this?
You don't do any weekends anymore.

3645
02:39:41,991 --> 02:39:43,610
You don't do like a regular weekend and 
the club?

3646
02:39:44,370 --> 02:39:46,490
Uh,
some every once in a while,

3647
02:39:46,491 --> 02:39:49,430
but for the most part the smaller club 
that I,

3648
02:39:49,431 --> 02:39:50,840
you don't do that.
I really like.

3649
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:52,690
You don't do midnight Saturday shows do 
you,

3650
02:39:52,730 --> 02:39:54,890
do you ever do.
That's ridiculous.

3651
02:39:54,891 --> 02:39:59,891
Three shows in one night.
That's the other thing I like about 

3652
02:39:59,891 --> 02:39:59,960
doing the four slash 20 shows or,
or even 8:00,

3653
02:39:59,961 --> 02:40:03,680
but it's the only show I love doing one 
show.

3654
02:40:04,450 --> 02:40:06,800
Like comics would like to go from club 
to club to club,

3655
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:08,060
you know,
like to do that.

3656
02:40:08,630 --> 02:40:09,770
Will you have a,
you,

3657
02:40:09,880 --> 02:40:13,080
you like to like you have a big chunk.
You do what will you do?

3658
02:40:13,081 --> 02:40:14,580
Like an hour or so what do you do?

3659
02:40:15,470 --> 02:40:19,170
Like I do 45 a standup and then an extra
15 or 20 of,

3660
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:21,600
you know,
playing the game and fucking around with

3661
02:40:21,601 --> 02:40:23,580
the crowd and that's pretty much all 
people want to see.

3662
02:40:23,581 --> 02:40:24,930
And then you're done.
You feel like you did it.

3663
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:27,200
You don't want to Redo it.
Yeah.

3664
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:28,410
It's weird.
It's weird,

3665
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:30,840
you know,
it's not a movie where they just started

3666
02:40:30,841 --> 02:40:32,590
up again and it's the same thing again.
Well,

3667
02:40:32,591 --> 02:40:37,591
the real problem with second shows that 
sometimes I'll be in the middle of the 

3668
02:40:37,591 --> 02:40:37,591
second show when I'll go,
did I do this?

3669
02:40:37,591 --> 02:40:42,111
But yet,
because I can't remember because I've 

3670
02:40:42,111 --> 02:40:43,890
gone through a whole show and now I'm in
the second show.

3671
02:40:43,891 --> 02:40:44,850
Again,
when you're on stage,

3672
02:40:44,851 --> 02:40:48,750
you're pretty much in this zone and I'm 
in the zone and I'm like,

3673
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:52,410
I'm in the zone.
I've been his own for a long time,

3674
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:53,680
but did I know I did that?

3675
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:55,020
Did I do that earlier?
I don't.

3676
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:56,910
I don't know if I did that joke.
Holy Shit.

3677
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:58,370
And then you panic.
You're like,

3678
02:40:58,390 --> 02:41:00,150
was that the first show or is it the 
second show?

3679
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,850
Should I try this?
And then you go into it and you're like,

3680
02:41:02,851 --> 02:41:07,851
oh my God.
And you kind of have your bits tend to 

3681
02:41:07,851 --> 02:41:07,851
be,
you know,

3682
02:41:07,851 --> 02:41:07,851
on the,
on the longer end,

3683
02:41:07,851 --> 02:41:12,141
like they don't really,
you don't really bring up things that 

3684
02:41:12,141 --> 02:41:14,340
are super brief.
So much of a case if it's a really short

3685
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:15,520
joke,
right.

3686
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:18,720
Gets a big laugh when I say it again,
because it was like,

3687
02:41:18,721 --> 02:41:19,120
yeah,
he's,

3688
02:41:19,220 --> 02:41:24,220
he said it again.
You don't ever play up the fact that 

3689
02:41:24,220 --> 02:41:24,220
you're,
hi.

3690
02:41:24,220 --> 02:41:24,420
I heard about people doing like fake 
shots.

3691
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:25,190
I'm like,
man,

3692
02:41:25,191 --> 02:41:28,020
I can't be fake shots.
That's terrible.

3693
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:29,880
No,
but yeah,

3694
02:41:29,881 --> 02:41:31,920
if the intention is to like,
hey everybody,

3695
02:41:31,921 --> 02:41:32,940
I'm doing a shot.

3696
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,150
But if I tell the staff,
send me up fake shots.

3697
02:41:36,151 --> 02:41:39,170
If people offer to buy me one really 
because I don't.

3698
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:42,090
I hate it.
You can't say no when a shot comes up to

3699
02:41:42,091 --> 02:41:43,220
you,
unless you're like a.

3700
02:41:43,250 --> 02:41:45,240
If you go,
I'm an alcoholic or something.

3701
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:46,280
If you go,
I'm,

3702
02:41:46,340 --> 02:41:47,970
I'm,
I'm six years sober.

3703
02:41:47,971 --> 02:41:52,971
I'm not going to do it.
But with my act and the fact that I've 

3704
02:41:52,971 --> 02:41:54,940
already got a cocktail up there,
they'll send me up shots and you know,

3705
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,790
sometimes I'll do them and I'm fine with
it.

3706
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:59,730
But a lot of reserves the right to drink
fake shots.

3707
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:00,330
Yeah.
Well,

3708
02:42:00,331 --> 02:42:01,110
and you know,
it's just,

3709
02:42:01,111 --> 02:42:06,111
it just gets it over with.
If you just drank a fake show telling 

3710
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:06,111
everybody.
Yeah,

3711
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:06,111
I'll never do it again.
Yeah.

3712
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:08,700
People are going to know now now the 
secrets on your game son.

3713
02:42:08,970 --> 02:42:09,990
But once you know what I mean,
you,

3714
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,850
if you do the shot quickly,
it's over with.

3715
02:42:11,850 --> 02:42:13,710
But if you stand there and act like 
you're not going to do it,

3716
02:42:13,711 --> 02:42:16,350
then people started chanting worse 
wouldn't be out of it.

3717
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:18,290
Now.
All the people that went to shows before

3718
02:42:18,300 --> 02:42:23,300
going to think back at the times,
you threw a shot back and screamed 

3719
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,920
yeehaw and jumped up and they don't act 
like God damn.

3720
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:29,910
I don't act it too,
too big.

3721
02:42:29,911 --> 02:42:34,911
I just,
I just pretend to drink it because even 

3722
02:42:34,911 --> 02:42:36,901
when I normally drink Assad,
I usually don't make a lot of noise on 

3723
02:42:36,901 --> 02:42:39,831
top of the glass and it's just a glass 
of water and I do a whole song and dance

3724
02:42:42,841 --> 02:42:47,841
numbers.
The glass against the wall fucking guts 

3725
02:42:47,841 --> 02:42:51,110
or is it on his tip?
All that and we find out you were just 

3726
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:51,570
stone cold,
sober drinking water,

3727
02:42:52,050 --> 02:42:53,880
putting on a show.
Fuck.

3728
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:59,240
I'd have to say that I,
it's probably happened maybe four times 

3729
02:42:59,240 --> 02:42:59,880
in entire career.

3730
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:05,330
I've never dressed.
The combination of me saying to the 

3731
02:43:05,330 --> 02:43:07,880
staff send me up a fake shot combined 
with somebody wanting to send me up a 

3732
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:09,780
shot because it doesn't happen every 
show because I'm not.

3733
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:14,810
So what happens to the money laundering 
going on here where it was a fake shot 

3734
02:43:14,810 --> 02:43:16,390
is not worth anything.
They're charging someone for a shy.

3735
02:43:16,510 --> 02:43:21,510
Well,
regular shots barely worth the price of 

3736
02:43:21,510 --> 02:43:25,261
a.
It doesn't seem like there's money 

3737
02:43:25,261 --> 02:43:25,261
that's unaccounted for there.
Yeah.

3738
02:43:25,261 --> 02:43:26,380
Yeah.
Money Laundering,

3739
02:43:26,510 --> 02:43:28,390
I think that Shit's illegal.
Well,

3740
02:43:28,391 --> 02:43:30,520
let me tell you how I balanced it out in
my,

3741
02:43:30,521 --> 02:43:35,521
uh,
the rest of my years as a comic is when 

3742
02:43:35,521 --> 02:43:38,071
people,
when I'm at the bar and a comedy club 

3743
02:43:38,071 --> 02:43:39,991
and somebody offers to buy me a drink,
I always turn it down and say I get the 

3744
02:43:39,991 --> 02:43:42,490
club gives me free drinks and I don't 
want you to buy one.

3745
02:43:42,790 --> 02:43:45,100
And then a lot of times they go,
I want to buy you one anyway.

3746
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:48,370
Like it becomes important to do 
something for you,

3747
02:43:48,371 --> 02:43:51,910
which I appreciate the bat,
but it's frustrating to have,

3748
02:43:51,990 --> 02:43:53,860
you know,
that kind of argument with somebody,

3749
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:54,640
you know,
like,

3750
02:43:55,120 --> 02:43:58,240
don't spend your money,
you don't spend your money.

3751
02:43:58,270 --> 02:43:59,550
So people that have,
you know,

3752
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:04,680
I don't know,
they have a chance to meet you for the 

3753
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:04,680
first time.
It's important to them.

3754
02:44:04,680 --> 02:44:05,260
I understood I was still standing right 
there and talk to them.

3755
02:44:05,261 --> 02:44:10,261
I don't say I don't want you to drink 
and run away if they want to give you 

3756
02:44:10,261 --> 02:44:10,261
something,
you know,

3757
02:44:10,261 --> 02:44:11,590
it's a gesture that's why never turned 
down.

3758
02:44:11,591 --> 02:44:12,520
We'd.
When people give me,

3759
02:44:12,521 --> 02:44:15,100
we'd really,
you trust it all.

3760
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:17,080
You don't ever think,
man,

3761
02:44:17,081 --> 02:44:19,170
I could be smart to have this 
conversation before you're.

3762
02:44:19,171 --> 02:44:22,690
You're on the more paranoid interest the
whole week thing that I am.

3763
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:24,430
I've never looked at him like,
oh my God,

3764
02:44:24,431 --> 02:44:26,500
I'm not taking that.
That looks like.

3765
02:44:26,770 --> 02:44:28,150
Yeah,
I just think it's such a.

3766
02:44:28,151 --> 02:44:29,500
it's such a crap shoot.
I mean,

3767
02:44:30,370 --> 02:44:33,640
let's say I probably smoked from 
strangers,

3768
02:44:33,670 --> 02:44:36,160
either a bud they gave me or some sort 
of joint.

3769
02:44:36,161 --> 02:44:38,170
It must be in the thousands at this 
point.

3770
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:41,740
Wow.
So nothing's happened yet.

3771
02:44:41,830 --> 02:44:46,830
So the odds seem incredibly good that 
I'll get through a few more years of it 

3772
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:48,160
do.
I'm so happy for you.

3773
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,970
I'm glad.
I'm glad you pulled through it.

3774
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:52,900
Mti.
It's dangerous.

3775
02:44:52,901 --> 02:44:54,850
That's great.
Do you ever worry about what's dangerous

3776
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:59,900
provocateurs?
Perhaps comps posing as donors want to 

3777
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:02,981
get high with you,
go to their current of trouble because 

3778
02:45:02,981 --> 02:45:05,670
the voice of the movement people 
craziest when Willie Nelson's tour bus,

3779
02:45:08,471 --> 02:45:11,770
that seems like it's really.
And get them for pot.

3780
02:45:11,771 --> 02:45:13,090
Come on,
come on,

3781
02:45:13,350 --> 02:45:15,940
find something else or just leave him 
alone,

3782
02:45:15,941 --> 02:45:17,350
but he's in trouble for that.

3783
02:45:17,350 --> 02:45:19,210
You know,
they were letting him off the hook,

3784
02:45:19,211 --> 02:45:19,930
but then,
uh,

3785
02:45:19,990 --> 02:45:20,670
they,
they,

3786
02:45:20,850 --> 02:45:25,850
you know,
someone get offended that the fact that 

3787
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:25,850
he,
uh,

3788
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:25,850
is above the law,
above the wall.

3789
02:45:25,850 --> 02:45:28,380
Yeah.
So some idiot kind of fed into the whole

3790
02:45:28,381 --> 02:45:31,960
thing.
This Texas man,

3791
02:45:31,961 --> 02:45:34,180
you don't understand texts as well.
A lot of places.

3792
02:45:34,181 --> 02:45:36,430
I don't understand that.
Texas is a real tricky one.

3793
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:41,460
There's some big cities and then there's
some fucking people that live in a time 

3794
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:41,460
warp.
You know,

3795
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:41,680
there's,
you've got Dallas,

3796
02:45:41,681 --> 02:45:43,110
you got Houston,
you've got Austin,

3797
02:45:43,111 --> 02:45:44,770
you've got San Jose,
San Antonio,

3798
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:45,520
you know,
you got,

3799
02:45:45,670 --> 02:45:50,670
you got some cool cities and then on top
of that you've got these weird spots in 

3800
02:45:50,670 --> 02:45:51,790
between the cities that go on forever 
and ever.

3801
02:45:51,791 --> 02:45:54,250
And they're massive.
There's so much room in Texas,

3802
02:45:54,251 --> 02:45:55,690
man.
It's a country,

3803
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,980
you know,
it really is,

3804
02:45:57,430 --> 02:46:00,880
is a giant ass fucking state.
But boy do I love that Austin though.

3805
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:02,140
Oh,
that's the best that,

3806
02:46:02,270 --> 02:46:04,440
that's one of my favorite cities of all 
time.

3807
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:09,630
Anywhere full time.
And that's where I'm going to cap city 

3808
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:09,630
club.
You played there.

3809
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:09,630
Oh yeah.
I love that.

3810
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:10,310
I'm going to do,

3811
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:15,660
I'm not only might doing for 20 shows,
I'm combining my other thing that I love

3812
02:46:15,771 --> 02:46:19,700
to do now,
which is podcasts and I add 4:20

3813
02:46:19,730 --> 02:46:24,730
on thanksgiving weekend on Saturday and 
Sunday I'm doing a two different tapings

3814
02:46:25,911 --> 02:46:28,970
of my podcast that I'll then be able to 
cap city got will.

3815
02:46:28,990 --> 02:46:33,990
Then be able to turn around and put out 
on the Internet because that's the only 

3816
02:46:33,990 --> 02:46:33,990
thing I don't.
I don't like about stand.

3817
02:46:33,990 --> 02:46:37,510
I love about stand up comedy.
The fact that it's just you and the 

3818
02:46:37,510 --> 02:46:39,890
audience and no one else hears it,
but thanks to podcasting,

3819
02:46:39,891 --> 02:46:43,370
I'm feeling I want to get more stuff out
to people right now.

3820
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:48,580
So this is a great opportunity for me to
show up in a town and instead of doing 

3821
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:50,020
standup,
I do the podcast.

3822
02:46:50,030 --> 02:46:52,130
So you're saying that you can't put your
standing up on the Internet?

3823
02:46:52,600 --> 02:46:57,600
Well you can't.
You know how I am going to do a thing 

3824
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:00,590
coming up soon.
I think my next album is going to be two

3825
02:47:00,591 --> 02:47:03,350
discs.
One is me,

3826
02:47:03,380 --> 02:47:07,580
like I'll wake up the day of the shows 
and I won't smoke pot all day,

3827
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:11,510
maybe even stopped the day before or 
something and just be crazy,

3828
02:47:11,511 --> 02:47:16,511
super sober for the first recording and 
then between the first show,

3829
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:21,790
the second show,
smoke as much weed and do as much as I 

3830
02:47:21,790 --> 02:47:23,600
can and then try to do the exact same 
set again,

3831
02:47:25,070 --> 02:47:30,070
try to do the album again and then 
people can listen to both and see the 

3832
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:31,790
good and the bad news.
Your conclusion one into.

3833
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:37,240
Yeah,
and was like Doug Benson banked and 

3834
02:47:38,121 --> 02:47:41,270
unbanked or stoned and unstained or 
something like that.

3835
02:47:41,271 --> 02:47:46,271
But the illusion was it 2002.
Two versions of it are two different 

3836
02:47:46,911 --> 02:47:48,830
Algos.
Two completely different animals.

3837
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:50,810
So Brian was just having fun.

3838
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:51,820
He's a silly boy.
Yeah,

3839
02:47:51,830 --> 02:47:56,830
he just says things this motherfucker.
So you'll sell a one or the other?

3840
02:47:57,660 --> 02:48:00,590
Is that we won both.
You're buying double album.

3841
02:48:00,990 --> 02:48:02,210
You bought them both.
Okay.

3842
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:05,420
And I also dream of a day where I can do
a tour where like,

3843
02:48:05,421 --> 02:48:08,360
you know,
how a pearl jam sold like every night of

3844
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:11,960
the tour on,
on the CD that one time and,

3845
02:48:12,010 --> 02:48:17,010
and bootlegs obviously happened to 
everybody all the time and I'd like to 

3846
02:48:17,010 --> 02:48:20,051
make my own bootleg and just make like 
do a tour of 10 cities and the same act 

3847
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:27,280
essentially that whatever I'm doing at 
that time and then a recorded in each 

3848
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:29,540
place and you can buy,
you can buy more than one if you want to

3849
02:48:29,541 --> 02:48:32,560
see the differences or you can just buy 
the one from the city or from,

3850
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:38,040
from a city you think will be funny to 
hear me interacting with people of that 

3851
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:38,040
city.

3852
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:40,310
That's a funny idea.
And have a bunch of different recordings

3853
02:48:40,311 --> 02:48:41,780
to choose from.
Um,

3854
02:48:41,870 --> 02:48:45,350
some comics used to sell recordings of 
the show that you just went to.

3855
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:50,680
Yeah.
So like cds at a club or two has tried 

3856
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:51,960
to kind of toy with that sort of idea.
A lot of Goddamn cds.

3857
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:54,800
But it also doesn't,
it only appeals to the drunkest audience

3858
02:48:54,801 --> 02:48:58,970
members yelled out the dumbest Shit,
you know,

3859
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:03,350
it's kind of a weird thing to say here 
by what you just what just happened.

3860
02:49:04,250 --> 02:49:09,250
But that's what I'm doing with podcasts.
Like I do podcasts where people were 

3861
02:49:09,250 --> 02:49:10,590
there live and then they listen to it 
later.

3862
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:13,220
It's like their email address and you go
here,

3863
02:49:13,230 --> 02:49:15,960
I'm going to send you a link to where 
you can buy this for five bucks.

3864
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:18,450
You have your podcast setup where some 
of them are free,

3865
02:49:18,451 --> 02:49:21,450
some of them aren't weekly free one of 
one week.

3866
02:49:21,570 --> 02:49:24,660
There's bonus free ones that I do like 
where I record,

3867
02:49:24,661 --> 02:49:26,730
like if I'm in a rental car with another
comic,

3868
02:49:26,731 --> 02:49:28,800
I'll just record an episode of the show 
while we're driving.

3869
02:49:29,460 --> 02:49:34,460
And so I put those up pretty frequently 
and then like once or twice a month,

3870
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:40,040
usually once a month I'll have a episode
that's $2 in the comedy album section of

3871
02:49:43,111 --> 02:49:48,111
Itunes,
which is a fun place to be and to be 

3872
02:49:48,111 --> 02:49:50,361
that cheap because like right now one of
mine is like number one because it's 

3873
02:49:50,361 --> 02:49:53,691
only $2.
And then all the album or the album is 

3874
02:49:53,691 --> 02:49:54,330
behind it costs like eight bucks.
So you get a nice,

3875
02:49:54,331 --> 02:49:59,331
cool,
nice placement for a little while and 

3876
02:49:59,331 --> 02:49:59,331
then it falls pretty fast because,
you know,

3877
02:49:59,331 --> 02:50:02,700
people will buy it later,
but most people buy it right away or you

3878
02:50:02,701 --> 02:50:03,990
know,
shortly after it goes,

3879
02:50:04,260 --> 02:50:06,780
becomes available and it's,
you know,

3880
02:50:06,781 --> 02:50:07,140
the money.

3881
02:50:07,150 --> 02:50:09,740
So you off air,
how much the money as well,

3882
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:10,350
you know,
it's,

3883
02:50:10,351 --> 02:50:13,280
I don't know if it's,
it's just a different route.

3884
02:50:13,610 --> 02:50:18,610
Gang signs at me,
it's a different route that I've gone 

3885
02:50:18,610 --> 02:50:18,610
instead of,
uh,

3886
02:50:18,610 --> 02:50:21,921
instead of having actual advertisers not
against having advertisers,

3887
02:50:22,021 --> 02:50:24,630
I just have already gathered,
found the right match.

3888
02:50:24,970 --> 02:50:29,970
Yeah.
People just kept the ones that every 

3889
02:50:29,970 --> 02:50:32,151
other podcast has.
And I did those for awhile and I just 

3890
02:50:32,151 --> 02:50:32,550
felt like if I listen to a bunch of 
podcasts,

3891
02:50:32,551 --> 02:50:34,740
if I had to always hear about audible 
books,

3892
02:50:34,741 --> 02:50:38,040
every podcast I listened to about one 
800 flowers.

3893
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:39,750
Doug,
I never did that one.

3894
02:50:39,751 --> 02:50:41,970
But yeah,
I are Adam and eve or whatever.

3895
02:50:41,971 --> 02:50:44,520
I wouldn't want to hear about the same 
thing all over the place.

3896
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:46,560
I think each show should have its own 
thing.

3897
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:51,830
Unfortunately for me,
movie studios can't really support me 

3898
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:54,921
because I trashed movies and I can't get
like a movie theater chain to support me

3899
02:50:55,351 --> 02:50:58,080
because people go see movies at the 
theater near their house.

3900
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:02,340
Do you ever feel like confined by the 
theme of your podcast?

3901
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:03,430
The movie thing?
Yeah.

3902
02:51:03,540 --> 02:51:05,790
Well I would,
if I were you and you know,

3903
02:51:05,791 --> 02:51:10,791
like your,
your interest in and the amount of 

3904
02:51:10,791 --> 02:51:11,370
movies you see is so far fewer than than
what I do,

3905
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:13,770
so like I could see where that could be 
limiting.

3906
02:51:13,771 --> 02:51:16,020
If you just feel like a movie,
why would you choose that?

3907
02:51:16,021 --> 02:51:18,040
You know what I mean?
Just you.

3908
02:51:18,220 --> 02:51:20,870
If you weren't a comic and you were in,
you were in,

3909
02:51:20,900 --> 02:51:23,250
you worked in UFC like you do,
would you,

3910
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:28,280
would you think you'd be able to find 
ongoing satisfaction just talking about 

3911
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:29,450
UFC as a podcast?
Sure,

3912
02:51:29,730 --> 02:51:30,420
definitely.
Yeah,

3913
02:51:30,421 --> 02:51:31,920
so that's,
that's how much I love movies.

3914
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:34,290
It's just that I could just,
I could talk on and on and on,

3915
02:51:34,291 --> 02:51:35,220
but if I just said,
dude,

3916
02:51:35,221 --> 02:51:40,221
just a UFC podcast every week,
I'd feel a little defined by it or you 

3917
02:51:40,221 --> 02:51:43,710
would because you've got so many other 
areas that you're interested in,

3918
02:51:43,890 --> 02:51:45,690
but I'm saying like somebody who's just 
really,

3919
02:51:45,691 --> 02:51:48,060
that's their main focus,
like because for me,

3920
02:51:48,061 --> 02:51:50,040
growing up,
my main focus was just movies.

3921
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:54,390
Like I wanted to watch them and be in 
them and that's all I cared about.

3922
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:56,910
Do you do,
do you write scripts for the two?

3923
02:51:56,911 --> 02:51:58,110
Of course.
Uh,

3924
02:51:58,111 --> 02:51:58,860
yeah,
a little bit,

3925
02:51:58,861 --> 02:51:59,430
but I've,
you know,

3926
02:51:59,431 --> 02:52:00,840
I've grown really,
I,

3927
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:06,440
that's the good and bad of podcasting is
it's allowed to talk about and 

3928
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:11,680
participate in what I want to do without
ever having to sit by myself and write,

3929
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:18,400
you know,
like the process of just sitting and 

3930
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:19,360
writing something while the outcome is 
very satisfying.

3931
02:52:19,630 --> 02:52:22,960
Like right now I'm working on a book and
it's,

3932
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:28,200
you know,
it's torture for me to sit down and 

3933
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:28,200
write a chapter of my book.
Why?

3934
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,160
Because they're just sitting there by 
myself.

3935
02:52:30,161 --> 02:52:32,350
Writing is just not,
it's no fun to me.

3936
02:52:32,351 --> 02:52:34,570
I want to always have,
you know,

3937
02:52:34,571 --> 02:52:38,260
a TV on or listening to something or 
watching something going,

3938
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:40,060
you know,
going out and doing something.

3939
02:52:40,380 --> 02:52:42,710
Go to starbucks.
What is that exactly?

3940
02:52:42,770 --> 02:52:44,500
Is that.
Those guys are,

3941
02:52:44,501 --> 02:52:49,501
that's what they are.
It's like I do enjoy sometimes sitting 

3942
02:52:49,501 --> 02:52:50,050
in a whole foods or something and 
getting work done on my computer because

3943
02:52:50,051 --> 02:52:52,450
it's fun to have all that weird stimuli 
around you,

3944
02:52:52,451 --> 02:52:54,130
but you can still just kinda look at 
your,

3945
02:52:54,131 --> 02:52:55,420
what you're doing.
Well,

3946
02:52:55,580 --> 02:53:00,580
just look up whenever.
Anything interesting because your ideas 

3947
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:02,320
too when you're looking around.
Like if you have your twitter handy,

3948
02:53:02,321 --> 02:53:04,120
it's like you know,
you see something stupid ass.

3949
02:53:04,121 --> 02:53:06,490
Especially when you're paying bills.
Yeah.

3950
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:11,520
We gotta wrap this picture but that's 
the thing I do like thank God I do have 

3951
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:11,920
the marijuana,
not God,

3952
02:53:11,921 --> 02:53:12,940
but you know what I mean.
Jesus.

3953
02:53:13,350 --> 02:53:14,500
Yes.
Thank Jesus.

3954
02:53:14,501 --> 02:53:19,501
I have to have marijuana because that 
does help to make writing less boring 

3955
02:53:20,891 --> 02:53:21,640
and frustrated.

3956
02:53:21,890 --> 02:53:23,480

this podcast.
Just a little bit more,

4000
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:14,450
end.
Tweeted it yet,

4001

4002
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:22,660

4003
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:22,660
possible.

4004

4007
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:36,380
And no secret surprise.
It's going to be a big fat fucking 

4008
02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:36,380
chilled out party.
So enjoy.

4009
