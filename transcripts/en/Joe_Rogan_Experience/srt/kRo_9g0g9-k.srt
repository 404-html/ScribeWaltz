1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,870
We're here,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,630
the Party's already started with 
drinking something that my friend Ben 

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,800
O'brian invented.
It's called an right brain.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,570
It's a whiskey and Alpha brain and it's 
delicious in a Yeti Tumbler.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,740
Cheers.
Cheers.

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:17,760
My brother.
Good to see you,

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:18,170
buddy.
Yeah,

8
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:19,060
man,
it's been a while.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,230
You're living the good life and I'm 
still kicking.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,760
You know,
it's another good day.

11
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm still vertical.
Yeah,

12
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,070
but you live in the good life,
man.

13
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:26,480
You're,
you're,

14
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
you're out doing what I want to do.
You're out there in the fucking great 

15
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,740
state of Montana.
Did escaped.

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,070
I landed on Saturday and yeah,
I lived in San Diego for I think almost 

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,370
10 years.
Love San Diego.

18
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,500
No,
no complaints about California.

19
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,570
It's beautiful.
The beaches,

20
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,470
there's mountains.
All that stuff.

21
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:45,750
I love it.
Landed San Diego,

22
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,751
got in the rental car,
was going out to skydive and couldn't 

23
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,330
even see the mountains out by where I'm 
going.

24
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,330
A good job because it was all hazy and 
smoggy and it took me longer to get out 

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,290
of the parking lot than it does to like 
get back to my house.

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,230
Go shoot the bow in the back yard,
go do a workout.

27
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,260
I was still in the San Diego 
international parking lot so I can't 

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,420
wait to go back.
Yeah,

29
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:07,830
there's good and bad.
You know,

30
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:09,990
there's good things about the big city 
life,

31
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,820
you know,
you get a lot of great restaurants,

32
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,300
a lot of cool shit,
but you've already done that.

33
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,410
You know,
we moved to a town that has 22,000

34
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,470
people.
Wow.

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,850
From a subdivision of San Diego that at 
260,000

36
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:28,851
people and I honestly,
my only regret is that it took us so 

37
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,020
long to pull the trigger on doing it.
It is unbelievable.

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,600
And have you done the winter?
Yeah.

39
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,840
That there yet?
Winter's coming.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,470
So you haven't done it yet?
Yeah.

41
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:45,471
Once I visited the winter last year,
we were there for the whole month of 

42
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:45,630
December.
There was a few days it was negative 10.

43
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,020
Okay.
Which I found a few stand close enough 

44
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,020
to the fire.
It feels just fine.

45
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,290
Yeah man.
I just wear a nice thick,

46
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,020
like a real good jacket,
you know,

47
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,380
were good,
will undergarments.

48
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,470
I know it'd be all right.
I know some people who work in the 

49
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,021
industry have to make the cold weather 
gear just from my old job and they sent 

50
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,040
me some stuff so it's really not that 
bad and there's some things in life that

51
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,010
I will spend good money on.
Cold weather gear,

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,040
rain gear,
just pony up and pay the extra money 

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,040
because it's going to pay off for you in
the end.

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,100
Yeah,
it get some real shit.

55
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,110
My friend Tony Lives in Columbus,
Ohio,

56
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:19,630
and he.

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
The way he put it,
he goes like,

58
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,170
look.
He's like,

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,340
here's the deal.
He goes,

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,920
you can't really dress for hot weather.
He goes,

61
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,270
well,
you could dress for cold weather.

62
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,340
Those you wear warm clothes and cold 
weather,

63
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,600
you're fine.
And he goes,

64
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,490
but when it's hot out,
it's just fucking hot out.

65
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,310
You got to go indoors or you can meet 
up,

66
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,260
but then once you get to that level,
you're done.

67
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,020
Yeah,
but even when you knew that hot,

68
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,650
but it's like La has no.
Whether it gets,

69
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,590
it gets hot and that's it.
It rarely rains.

70
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,650
If it rains 20 days a year,
it's crazy.

71
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,410
Nobody knows what to do inside.
I'm not going to lie.

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,530
I was,
I was laughing and very happy when you 

73
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,751
were posting about.
It was like 100 and 506 and Epa we live 

74
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:02,500
is like 60 beautiful bluebird skies,
a little bit of a breeze.

75
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,310
I bet you get sick,
nighttime starve or looking to right.

76
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:11,311
Look at what's The star gazing up there.
It's not hard to get out of that light 

77
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:11,770
pollution you drive.
You know,

78
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,050
we were fortunate.
We have a,

79
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,430
probably the reason we moved up there as
we bought an investment property in 2016

80
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,170
and it's in the middle of nowhere,
like probably 15 miles out and you want 

81
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,171
to talk about no light pollution and the
ability just to look up and it doesn't 

82
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:28,750
look anything unless you've experienced 
that.

83
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,751
You can't describe how much you're 
missing out if you live in a city 

84
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:33,751
looking up.
It's unbelievable.

85
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah,
it's weird,

86
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:39,001
right?
It's one of the weirdest things about 

87
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,001
civilization that we've chosen to do 
that.

88
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,550
I know that a lot of,
um,

89
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,810
there's,
there's a lot of talk about people 

90
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:44,810
having like,
um,

91
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,970
nights or like one time of the year 
where everybody shut their lights off 

92
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,090
and they have like a,
just a viewing of the stars,

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,100
like a no light night who's talking 
about doing a step before online.

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I've heard people organizing light 
pollution observance day or some shit.

95
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,360
Yeah,
I've heard some crazy things online.

96
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,830
I try to try to avoid most of the things
that I hear about online gatherings that

97
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,831
started online.
If I know the picture that I put a view 

98
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:17,460
with,
you're flying squirrel suit flying over 

99
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,771
the fucking earth.
I purposely chose it because you could 

100
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:19,771
see the curvature of the earth,
the background,

101
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,920
or can you based on the comex.
It's a bro.

102
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,160
Was that shot with the Fisher islands?
Whatever the Gopro comes with,

103
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,290
that's probably felons.
It's got a little bit of a curvature to 

104
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,290
it.
I look at that.

105
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,970
There you go.
I love that suit.

106
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,950
I was jumping that suit on Saturday.
It some interesting comments in there.

107
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:43,270
The Internet is a very interesting 
environment that has no consequences and

108
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:48,271
allows people to interact in a way they 
never would if they were sitting across 

109
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:48,271
like we are right now.

110
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:52,110
Yeah,
and it also requires discipline in that 

111
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,621
regard.
Like the way that people communicate 

112
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:55,621
with people.
It just,

113
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,330
there's no discipline in terms of like 
conserve,

114
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,190
like just think about what you're going 
to say.

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,220
Think about if a person was in front of 
you,

116
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,890
think about how it's gonna affect that 
person and then proceed.

117
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,780
Nobody does that.
There's none of that.

118
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,910
There's not,
I wouldn't say nobody does that,

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,550
but it's few and far between.
No consequences.

120
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,260
Especially if you're an anonymous 
person.

121
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,700
She just a regular Joe Blow and you got 
an egg and it's like,

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,690
Dick,
fuck,

123
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:20,440
six,
nine,

124
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,370
five,
two,

125
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,650
whatever your name is and you just feel 
like talking shit.

126
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,660
I mean I understand it.
If you.

127
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,990
If you put a quarter inch piece of glass
in between me and another driver on the 

128
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,531
road,
I've been known to say some interesting 

129
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,541
things that I wouldn't say to somebody 
in a line at starbucks if they bumped 

130
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:36,541
into me.

131
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,570
Do you know what that's from though,
what they say?

132
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,950
Um,
they,

133
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,030
the scientists have studied the human 
response to critical situations where 

134
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,980
you're,
you have to make split second maneuvers,

135
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:52,981
like high stress situations and you 
don't think of a car as being a high 

136
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:56,611
stress situation,
but when you're going 70 miles an hour 

137
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:56,611
and every little thing,
it's like you're,

138
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:59,420
you're way more tuned in than you think 
you are.

139
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,130
So anything that happens like this 
motherfucker like you,

140
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,320
you're way more ramped up.
That's where road rage comes from.

141
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,350
It comes from the fact that your brain 
is very aware that you're going to have 

142
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,790
to make split second decisions.
So even though you don't realize it,

143
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,850
you're at seven all the time.
He just ready to flip to 11 when a guy's

144
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,480
crazy.
You motherfucker.

145
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,650
Yeah,
I mean I've seen people just lose their 

146
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:24,650
shit.

147
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,880
And by the way,
here's the really crazy thing.

148
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,750
I've seen people lose their shit and if,
if it advert physically escalated,

149
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,280
like they did pull over,
they got out of the car.

150
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,710
I've seen that be helpless,
be helpless.

151
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,510
They don't know how I've been with 
people.

152
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm like,
listen man,

153
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,110
you don't know how to fight it all.
What are you doing?

154
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,630
You're starting a fight.
That's crazy.

155
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Don't do that.
You're starting a fight and you're 

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,731
praying to God or whatever you believe 
in that this person doesn't actually 

157
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:48,731
follow you or pull over.
Yeah,

158
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,200
they're in a car version of the egg on 
twitter.

159
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,090
They just assume like,
fuck you,

160
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:58,091
you're never gonna.
See me again and this isn't real piece 

161
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:58,550
of shit,
but sometimes it is real.

162
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,850
You know?
I've seen people duking it out on the 

163
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:03,850
side of the road and then it's pretty 
ugly.

164
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,420
It doesn't go well for both parties.
Generally.

165
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,480
A buddy of mine from Jujitsu pulled over
to the side of the road with a guy once 

166
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,930
and they start doing it now and they 
both knew how to fight and it was crazy.

167
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,480
They were hitting doubles and sprawling 
and the guy goes for a Doris,

168
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:20,481
he reverses them.
He gets side control knees and in the 

169
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:20,481
body.
That guy fucking hits them at triangle.

170
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,600
They fucking,
he passes the guard like the whole 

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,600
thing.
Go back and forth on that meeting,

172
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,560
on the fucking grass.
They were on the grass on the side of 

173
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,560
the road and then when it's,
they're both exhausted.

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,150
They high fived each other and then got 
back in their car.

175
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,790
They were laughing like,
you know how to fight man.

176
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,390
Like it both actually they both rug,
I'm going to fuck this dude up.

177
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm going to fuck this dude up.
And then they both were not just,

178
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,340
not just did they both know how to 
fight.

179
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,350
They were both at like a purple belt 
level,

180
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,420
little impromptu grappling session.
Car and punches and kicks and the whole 

181
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,011
deal.
But they have both actually knew how to 

182
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,111
fight.
It was pretty funny the way he was 

183
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:56,111
telling it was pretty hilarious.
I mean,

184
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,560
I mean I can't,
I can't lie.

185
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,140
I get,
I get excited when I see people upset in

186
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:05,141
their cars.
Like if they get cut off accidentally 

187
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,580
and I see them getting pissed.
Like the footage is slowly rolls off the

188
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:12,581
gas.
They get really close and I'm doing 40 

189
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:14,450
on the freeway and I don't know.
I mean I don't know.

190
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,630
My problem is probably just an asshole,
but as the more upset they get,

191
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,840
the more warmth I feel in my soul as I'm
going down the road,

192
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,480
watching them lose their shit in their 
car.

193
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,510
Well,
don't you think that a guy like you 

194
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,951
who's been through so much actual real 
combat probably relishes a little 

195
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,260
elevation of the normal day to day life?
Just a little turn that bitch up a 

196
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,150
little bit.
Let's just crank it up a little bit.

197
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm probably the last person that would 
ever fight like I just.

198
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,000
And I bet you it's the same with the UFC
guys,

199
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:52,001
right?
Who make their living in that insane 

200
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:52,001
octagon like you think.
Some of the things I do are a little bit

201
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:56,350
atypical.
I think people who live in the octagon 

202
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:56,350
are absolutely out of their mind,
but I bet you

203
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,030
you flew 18 miles and a squirrel suit.
The suit did most of the work,

204
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,140
man,
I just laid in that bed.

205
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,680
It doesn't matter the fucking all this 
shit that can go wrong.

206
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,990
What did you say what the temperature 
was when he jumped out?

207
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,610
50 below zero.
50 below.

208
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,170
With the wind chill and I was rocking a 
tee shirt,

209
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,480
not smart.
How cold did that get?

210
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,140
I couldn't feel my hands.
I had hand warmers.

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,800
The chemical know the ones that you 
crack open just for like skiing,

212
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,500
but I didn't.
I didn't open the bag until 20,000

213
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,540
feet,
you know,

214
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,730
didn't really think that through.
It needs oxygen,

215
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,430
open the bag while you're flying,
like up on the way up.

216
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:36,000
It was an hour flight to altitude and I 
knew it was going to be cold so I opened

217
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:41,001
up the things and I put them on my hands
and put my gloves on and send them like 

218
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,210
why am I not feeling these heat up?

219
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,050
And then I realized that they need 
oxygen for the chemical reaction.

220
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,320
So I jumped out and I buy probably 
halfway down.

221
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:54,321
I couldn't feel my hand so I just had 
them like tucked up behind the wing and 

222
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,801
I know where the little small parachute 
is that you have to pull to deploy your 

223
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:57,801
parachute.
And I'm like,

224
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:57,870
all right,
be all right.

225
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,340
I know where this is.
I've done this before.

226
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,900
Pulled the parachute and I get on the 
ground and then my hands started burning

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,200
because the chemical started reacting,
so it went from freezing cold hand to 

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,540
feeling like I had my hands dipped into 
law so I couldn't get the gloves off.

229
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,830
Also,
probably a little

230
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,950
hypothermia,
right.

231
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,860
Approximately.
Say they found a guy recently.

232
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm in,
I want to say Oregon or Idaho,

233
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,100
I don't know,
one of them cold places.

234
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,580
And uh,
he went elk hunting and they couldn't 

235
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,011
find him.
He got lost and when they found him he 

236
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,681
was dead and he was only like a couple 
hundred yards from his truck and they 

237
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:35,860
think he got snowed out and couldn't see
where he was going.

238
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,890
And he had taken his jacket off and he'd
taken his gloves and his hat off and 

239
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,211
they say that's one of the signs of 
hypothermia is you started people in 

240
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,591
naked.
A lot of the time they take all the 

241
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:48,591
while your fork,
it just start.

242
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:48,970
You know,
you hit hot too.

243
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,560
Apparently.
It's not just euphoria the,

244
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,040
I don't know if you get hot or 
Washington state.

245
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,830
Yeah.
Missing elk hunter recovered in 

246
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,611
Washington.
I'd heard about another guy who died in 

247
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:02,611
Oregon who was a.

248
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:06,720
He was a tech guy.
He used to be on this tech show that I 

249
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,540
used to watch and he would review like 
gadgets.

250
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:12,541
This was like early two thousands and he
went up with his family and they didn't 

251
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:18,391
have a car that can handle like serious 
snow and they got stuck and they were 

252
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:23,341
there for nine days with no food and he 
went walking off to get help and froze 

253
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,100
to death in his family was eventually 
rescued.

254
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,430
How far did you make it?
I don't think he made it very far.

255
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,980
I mean he wasn't wearing the right 
clothes.

256
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,150
You're wearing regular clothes,
you know,

257
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,170
and he just,
he was just desperate and he was trying 

258
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,720
to save his family and it's just so sad 
because I had seen that guy on TV.

259
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,650
It was so weird because you see a guy on
tv,

260
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:48,580
we're reviewing gadgets,
like here's the latest laptop,

261
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,790
like look at the,
here's the ether net port and what we've

262
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,060
got here is a,
you know,

263
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,070
the blah blah blah,
blah blah and

264
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
all this different stuff.
He review like the most technical of 

265
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,571
technical things and in terms of like 
the highest level of electronic 

266
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:04,450
achievements so far,
right?

267
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,220
Like the newest gadgets that people 
love,

268
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,080
like,
like the,

269
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,810
when you think about society and 
civilization,

270
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:15,811
you think about those things and 
meanwhile the guy froze to death in the 

271
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,380
forest.
Like the real life.

272
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,830
All the tech in the world isn't going to
save you because you get out into the 

273
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,501
wild.
If you rely on something that has 

274
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:25,900
batteries for your sustainment of your 
life,

275
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,250
you're going to be in trouble at some 
point.

276
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,530
Yeah.
You gotta have baseline skills.

277
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Yeah.
They say that like when people go into 

278
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,961
the forest,
people are afraid of grizzly bears and 

279
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,541
all sorts of different things.
But hypothermia kills more people than 

280
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:39,541
anything.
Yeah.

281
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,320
It doesn't surprise me.
It's slow too.

282
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,360
I mean,
that's the insidious onset of,

283
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,830
you know,
your feet get a little bit cold.

284
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,080
And from what I've,
uh,

285
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,630
I've talked to some guys who work like 
up in Alaska,

286
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
right?
Where's Mckinley Mckinley's in Alaska,

287
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:57,030
wherever McKinley is.
And it's not uncommon for them to find 

288
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,750
people basically missing,
but they're naked because it's that slow

289
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,751
that thought process degrades.
I'm sweating or take my jacket off and 

290
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:07,980
they just lay down and go to sleep.
Like it's just that one percent of the 

291
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,951
time until you are basically a popsicle 
and doesn't your brain pump morphine or 

292
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:14,860
some equivalent to morphine through your
body when you're near death.

293
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,430
I think when you're in severe pain or 
near death,

294
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,900
every literally make something.
I think you just go into shock,

295
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,400
you know?
Yeah.

296
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,410
I don't know the,
the physical process of what happens 

297
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,611
when you go into shock.
But I've seen some people that are in a 

298
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,881
lot of pain and they would have liked to
have their brain pumping some morphine 

299
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:35,881
one happening.

300
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,900
Maybe they weren't pumping enough.
Perhaps.

301
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,270
You know,
I'd read something about that,

302
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:45,271
that there were,
there was someone who was trying to 

303
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,280
explain I'm near death experiences and 
like why when people have near death 

304
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:53,071
experiences,
they have all these freaky visions and 

305
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:55,000
some of it they think could be connected
to psychedelic chemicals that your brain

306
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,040
produces,
which are that day.

307
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:02,041
Definitely know that's true,
but I think there was also some talk 

308
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,080
about some morphine like substance that 
your brain makes.

309
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,640
I wouldn't surprise me if your body 
recognizes it was on the downhill slide.

310
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,340
That'll be the little.
This dude doesn't need these.

311
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,570
Keep screaming.
Yeah,

312
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,810
probably.
It probably just a protection mechanism 

313
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:15,810
if anything.
Yeah.

314
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:15,810
Well,
when you're out there,

315
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,281
man,
I think one of the cool things about 

316
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,010
being in the wilderness is that most 
people,

317
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,550
most people just never experienced that 
for long stretches and when you do get 

318
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,270
to experience it,
it gives you sort of a like,

319
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,460
oh,
I always thought the world was this.

320
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,620
I always thought the world was Phoenix,
Arizona,

321
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:37,621
where they drive down the street and you
go to see your friend and you're in the 

322
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:40,591
car and you go to the movies and there's
the restaurant and then you go to 

323
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:44,071
Montana,
go wandering through the forest and you 

324
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:47,341
see deer and bears and you see the 
mountains and the quiet and your cell 

325
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:49,990
phone doesn't work and you're like,
oh yeah,

326
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,230
this is the actual world.
I have found that it's that in that 

327
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,340
people and including myself,
think that I am this,

328
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,550
and then you go out into that 
environment where you're detached and 

329
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,101
then you have to rely upon yourself and 
your knowledge and your grid or your 

330
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,090
fortitude and you kind of figure out 
more of who you are as well too.

331
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,480
I don't think people really.
You don't figure out who you are if you 

332
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,390
live in the greater Los Angeles area.

333
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,120
Do you know who you are in Los Angeles?
Correct.

334
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,940
But I don't think he wore in Los Angeles
is who you really are?

335
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't think so either.
I think you'd get to go out and outside 

336
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,150
of that and either rely on yourself or 
maybe even more importantly,

337
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:31,151
rely on somebody else and have that 
dynamic outside of you mean you 

338
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:36,521
couldn't,
I guess you could starve to death 

339
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:36,521
obviously,
or you know,

340
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:39,040
not have enough water,
but the places to get those things in 

341
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,771
La,
you could solve in a block in either 

342
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,991
direction,
go far enough out in the woods and 

343
00:15:43,991 --> 00:15:46,571
you're on your own.
And to me that's where you find out who 

344
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:46,571
you are.
I do.

345
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,900
I like being out there because I get to 
think about me a lot.

346
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,370
Yeah.
I think that's a real good point that 

347
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:53,370
you're not who you think you are,
who you are.

348
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,480
You think you know yourself,
but you know yourself in the 

349
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,480
environments that you know.
Correct.

350
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,620
The way you really find out who you are 
is to experience a lot of different 

351
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,920
environments and a lot of different 
difficult things.

352
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Like you don't really know someone until
you see them tired to see them 

353
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,490
exhausted.
Hungry.

354
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,630
Yeah.
Yeah,

355
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,140
yeah.
Well,

356
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,790
the John Dudley is always said that 
about hunting,

357
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,580
like you think you know a guy take him 
hunting.

358
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,980
His litmus test is hunting camp.
Yeah,

359
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:23,981
I believe he says you'll either be 
friends for life or I'm never going to 

360
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:24,050
want to spend another moment with you.
Yeah,

361
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,260
it was pretty accurate.
It come off the rails.

362
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,290
People.
I don't want to get up at five in the 

363
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,290
morning.
I just went to bed at 11.

364
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,980
All right,
well you're not on the invite list for 

365
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,141
next year.
You're missing out on this thing we're 

366
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:38,141
doing here.

367
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:38,990
You can go hunt that pb andj and the 
refrigerator.

368
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,970
There's a line where you got to learn 
though,

369
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,290
like there is a line.
We're like,

370
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,810
okay,
we could die today.

371
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,980
This is not.
We should.

372
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,260
We should really be careful if we go out
today,

373
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,550
you know this is.
This is not the like my friend Adam 

374
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:53,550
Green Tree.
Do you know Adam?

375
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,710
You got to meet him.
First off,

376
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,940
I don't know him,
but I definitely follow him.

377
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,190
Yeah,
that motherfucker skirts the line.

378
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,320
That's his water buffalo up there,
by the way,

379
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,630
right above the old glory as Paul.
Awesome.

380
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,210
Is that your elk from?
Yeah,

381
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,950
because that one is.
That's from to hone ranch.

382
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,650
God,
look at that rack on that thing.

383
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,880
Um,
but Adam,

384
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,010
he,
he crosses that line.

385
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,460
He gets to the edge that pushes that 
line is how I would describe it.

386
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,220
He goes out by himself a month at a 
time.

387
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,190
Nothing but a tent runs out of water all
the time.

388
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,430
Drinks funky water coming out.
He's got that weird Australia gut 

389
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,390
though.
We could just drink water and like,

390
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,270
because some microbes going on or 
whatever he's eating in this life.

391
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,130
It's like it's festering inside of his 
body,

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
kills off everything else.
He doesn't get sick at the fucking guy 

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,001
drinks at it creaks all the time.
He's probably always just sick and 

394
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:47,600
that's his normal.
Maybe is sick.

395
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,720
It's happy though.
Yeah.

396
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,800
But he,
uh,

397
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,100
he

398
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
gets close,
like he gets close to that edge like 

399
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,071
that.
Do you ever see that when you watch the 

400
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:00,141
intro instagram story,
when the grizzly bear kept charging him 

401
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:00,141
and he's fucking filming it all for 
Instagram?

402
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:01,410
Yeah,
but he's also got an unloaded gun.

403
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
I was very upset with.
No,

404
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
it was loaded,
but he had never shot it.

405
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,440
So was out of battery.
The bullets were the wrong size for the 

406
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,930
gun so he could.
Well,

407
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,940
you can barely see the top of the gun.
I'm looking at it and you can see the 

408
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,020
barrel at the angle.
So the slide is back in like your,

409
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,580
your.
You can tell your.

410
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:21,650
Oh yeah,
like you're pointing your finger at a 

411
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,831
bad a bear.
You're going to pull on that as it each 

412
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:26,430
your face.
He said the bear ran to 10 yards.

413
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,770
No thank you.
Clip 10 yards.

414
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,460
Past false charge.
Ten yards.

415
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,610
He said when you see it running and you 
see the muscles rippling under the hair 

416
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,920
and the hair and the snow and the 
masters of that claw ripping through the

417
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:44,550
ground.
No thank you.

418
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,670
And it's huge.
You know,

419
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,710
he said it was like a nine foot bear.
She's running around and if so if he.

420
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,830
I mean obviously he's got a ton of 
interactions with animals in the wild,

421
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:59,820
but if he had run instead of standing 
his ground,

422
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,680
he had been fucked.
It would have attacked him,

423
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,550
right?
100 percent.

424
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,900
Oh my God.
He would have been fucked.

425
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,970
You can't because they just have an 
instinct.

426
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,610
It would just take you out.
It's like you're weak.

427
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,410
You're.
You're moving away.

428
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,760
Not only you,
not a threat.

429
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:16,761
Now,
now the bear has the opportunity to 

430
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:17,640
close the distance and the bears don't 
exactly know what the fuck you are.

431
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,470
They don't exactly know what the fuck a 
person.

432
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,480
If they might've seen a person a few 
times before,

433
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,300
but they don't eat a person and they 
don't fuck a person.

434
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,240
The problem is when a bear does eat,
a person wants a bear,

435
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:28,320
eats a person like,
oh,

436
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,500
I could just fucking eat people 
delicious.

437
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,190
They can't run it like a bear chases on 
elk.

438
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:36,900
Like it's.
It's kind of a hustle.

439
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,190
There's a lot of running.
I can't imagine a baird catching an elk.

440
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,470
They do this really crazy video,
but they're eating a moose.

441
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,380
He's chasing this moose and it's a big 
fucking.

442
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:48,470
Barron's chased him around a circle in 
there.

443
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,050
It looks like they're filling it from a 
helicopter and the bear is just this.

444
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,040
This Mousse is hauling ass.
See if you can find that Jamie bear.

445
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,280
The fucked up thing is when bears catch 
you.

446
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,380
They just eat you.
They don't kill you first just start.

447
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,390
They just start eating just like they do
a salmon or they grab a salmon and just 

448
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,290
bite into it and pull it apart.
They do that to your guts.

449
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,740
See,
that's where I'm really hoping that 

450
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:15,740
morphine thing from your brain is true.

451
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Can you imagine looking up and seeing 
your lower torso inside of the mouth of 

452
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
a massive imagining it?
That's what's so scary.

453
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,520
Do you ever see the movie grizzly man?
No.

454
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,940
How dare you?
How dare you miss out on the intentional

455
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:31,650
comedy in the history of the watch it 
tonight.

456
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:32,970
It's fucking great.
You want to talk?

457
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,770
We were talking about this before the 
show,

458
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:39,771
but people who are gay who don't want to
admit they're gay run.

459
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,110
That's this guy,
and he decided to go live with the 

460
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,050
grizzly bears to protect them in the 
forest.

461
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,910
He got to eat.
I,

462
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,060
I know this story.
Yeah.

463
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:48,970
Okay.
Now,

464
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,030
but it's a werner herzog film and I 
don't know if Werner Herzog was trying 

465
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,720
to make it funny,
but.

466
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,320
And I mean maybe it's just funny.
It's funny,

467
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,530
but it's funny to me because I have this
crazy appreciation for wildlife and 

468
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,800
respect for it and there's part of me 
that like,

469
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,600
like Steve Rinell had a funny way of 
talking about this guy.

470
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,080
He goes,
hey,

471
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,670
you say all you want about that guy.
He goes,

472
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,590
that guy was a hard camper.
He goes,

473
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:19,591
that guy did some hard fucking camp and 
he was out there for six months at a 

474
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:19,990
time.
My guy got to give respect.

475
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:23,200
You really did live with the bears for 
six months at a time,

476
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,800
but we're Herzog.
The way he filmed it,

477
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,910
he filmed like the way he would have 
people talking about the guy,

478
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,160
like they go to a sheriff and the 
sheriff's like,

479
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,340
I thought he was retarded.
Just really digging into that character 

480
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:39,860
and plot development.
Yeah,

481
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:43,090
the guy,
I mean it's just he shows you this guy's

482
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,110
ex girlfriend who's crazy and they're 
talking about his life and they 

483
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,291
interviewed one of his past roommates or
some guy who knew him in La and he's 

484
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,801
talking about how crazy he is and how he
kind of made up a path for himself and 

485
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:59,320
it was just like this really had fake 
accents that he would use sometimes.

486
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Just a really bizarre character who 
found his identity in taking care air 

487
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:10,501
quotes,
taking care of these bears that didn't 

488
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,901
need taken care of and he was going to 
protect these barriers and these 

489
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,430
barriers.
Just they didn't give a fuck about him.

490
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,110
We had don't think they wanted his 
protection.

491
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,190
Oh,
it was amazing.

492
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,390
It's amazing.
But anyway,

493
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,960
the film of him getting eaten,
he was filming.

494
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,961
Bears had the cover on the camera,
but the audio ran and the audio ran for 

495
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:28,450
seven minutes.
By the way,

496
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,450
if you try to find that audio online,
it's not there,

497
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,720
but there's some fake audio online that 
people attribute to it,

498
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,790
but if you listen to it with a 
discerning year,

499
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,710
you tell those people aren't really 
screaming,

500
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,440
fake screaming,
but it was seven minutes long of the 

501
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,440
bear eating.
Him and his girlfriend,

502
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,010
his girlfriend hit the bare,
his girlfriend to the bear.

503
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,710
The bear was eating him and the 
girlfriend hit the bear in the head with

504
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,570
a frying pan.
Didn't do Jack Shit.

505
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,330
The bear tears her apart.
You know,

506
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,490
I'm not going to lie.
I'm more surprised that he had a 

507
00:22:59,490 --> 00:22:59,490
girlfriend who wasn't really a 
girlfriend.

508
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,480
It was a girl.
There was a friend who thought she was 

509
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,480
referring to worlds.
Two words.

510
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,880
Yeah.
I've had friends that are gay,

511
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,090
that have wives and these poor wives.
They walk around looking like this all 

512
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,880
day long like feels like,
what the fuck's wrong?

513
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,240
How can this guy doesn't fuck me?
Like man,

514
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,300
there's a lot of poor bastards out there
that are just deep in the closet and 

515
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,310
they don't.
That's not cool.

516
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,700
That's when we hit that point now where 
you can just kind of do and be a wish.

517
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:25,840
We were.
I wish we were.

518
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,290
I know a couple guys that are deep,
deep in the.

519
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,590
Let me say.
I like,

520
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,750
oh,
I talked to them.

521
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,370
I talked to them in brief brief chunks 
because I'm,

522
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,040
I,
I get this feeling from them where I'm 

523
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,790
talking to them where they just want to 
end the conversation before I go,

524
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:43,600
hey man,
are you gay?

525
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,720
Like every conversation is like this 
really quick,

526
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:48,890
really quick,
really quick.

527
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:49,570
Hey,
good to see.

528
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,360
All right.
Hey,

529
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,070
take it easy man.
See you next time.

530
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:52,820
Hold on.
Hey,

531
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,500
before you go.
Are you good?

532
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,440
Are you guys.
It's just,

533
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,050
it's a bomber man.
It's a bummer.

534
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,860
Yeah.
I mean to get to get to 2017 and not 

535
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:10,690
have that worked out.
It seems to me to be a travesty that the

536
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,530
fact that people give a shit.
Yeah.

537
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,440
Why does anybody care what other choices
that they make in their life?

538
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Well,
my theory has been there's two types of 

539
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,220
people that care about gay marriage in 
that is people who are really dumb,

540
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,980
or people that are secretly worried that
digs are delicious.

541
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,250
I can get behind that campaign.
That's my theory.

542
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:32,120
That was one of my old bits and I think 
that when you know,

543
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,210
there's a lot of it,
there are people are afraid that other 

544
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,311
people gonna think they're gay.
A lot of it is people who grew up where 

545
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,701
they hear terrible things about gay 
people or prejudice people around them 

546
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,250
tell them crazy things about gay people.
They don't realize that gay people were 

547
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,040
just people that like guys,
that's it.

548
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,720
And there's other guys that like guys 
too.

549
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,470
And if everything was open,
they wouldn't feel so creepy.

550
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,500
They feel creepy because they have to 
hide it and be secretive and always be 

551
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,890
like,
it's forbidden or there.

552
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Yeah.
So that's where the weirdness comes 

553
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:04,900
from.
But if you go to Santa Monica Boulevard,

554
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,510
there's these fucking.
There's this area of like three blocks 

555
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,960
in West Hollywood and Santa Monica 
Boulevard that I don't get out of my 

556
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:13,960
car.

557
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,770
It's not worth it because you're just 
loading the scenario up.

558
00:25:14,771 --> 00:25:16,790
I'm already thinking in my head like,
I'm never going here.

559
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,170
Do you ever go to willow's wild animal 
parks where we stay in the car and the 

560
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,490
monkeys jumped on your car and rip your 
fucking windshield wipers off?

561
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,230
No.
Have those New Jersey went?

562
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

563
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,130
The monkeys jumped on your car.
I don't know if it happens anymore,

564
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,800
but they used to.
We used to be there and you know,

565
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,790
you'd have to like agree that the monkey
might fuck your car,

566
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,800
can sign a waiver when you get in,
like don't go there with a Ferrari until

567
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,790
connect with a car that could get jacked
because these monkeys,

568
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:48,791
my Jack your car,
but you would be around these animals 

569
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:48,791
and you'd stay in your vehicle the 
entire time.

570
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,200
They have one in China and it's a great 
story.

571
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Uh,
about a year ago this lady was in an 

572
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,240
argument with her boyfriend.
She's like,

573
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,311
fuck you.
And she got out of the car and she went 

574
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,300
around the car and she was yelling at 
him in a fucking tiger came.

575
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,710
You posted that video.
I saw that and just yanked her away.

576
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:11,711
And then the tiger.
Then someone else chased after and 

577
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:11,990
apparently she lived,
but her mom died.

578
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Her mom was going out trying to save her
saber from the tiger and the tiger 

579
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,740
killed her mom.
Stumped bitch just thought she was.

580
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,630
She's like,
I have it in my head.

581
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:23,300
I'm going to fucking say what I want and
I'm going to get out of this car.

582
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:26,540
Fuck you.
And she gets out of her car and she does

583
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:31,541
it in a wild animal park filled with 800
pound tigers.

584
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,750
If you do stupid things,
you're going to win stupid prizes.

585
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,010
It's amazing how quick the tiger seizes 
the opportunity though from that video.

586
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:45,011
She was only on the driver's side of the
car for a few seconds so them lights 

587
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:45,011
out.
Pull that out,

588
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,530
pull that up.
It's a great video to watch.

589
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,560
One of my favorite videos,
it's just like I don't want anybody to 

590
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:51,990
get killed by a tire.
I really don't,

591
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,290
but I do want,
if someone gets killed by a tiger doing 

592
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,051
something really fucking stupid,
I do want everybody to watch that and 

593
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,051
go,
hey,

594
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,470
don't do that.
This ain't the lion king motherfucker.

595
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,200
This shit's real like it.
Here it is.

596
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,730
Oh God.
She gets out of the car,

597
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:07,260
the Wildlife Zoo.
She gets out.

598
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,220
Watch passenger side.
Back seat.

599
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Fuck you.
Just imagine the argument going on in 

600
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,240
front of you.
I'm Outta here.

601
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah.
She's like,

602
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,290
I'm so tired of your bullshit.
She runs around the other side.

603
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,000
Going to make one more point,
and the guy's like,

604
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,460
hey,
will you just fucking relaxed?

605
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:20,760
Bitch.
Just don't hit me.

606
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,410
Don't hit me.
God Damn it.

607
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,810
Get back in your car.
Pat.

608
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,890
Jason just drags her lead.
He runs out of the car.

609
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Oh God.
And then the mom ones out and that 

610
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,671
lady's dead.
The third lady Dayton is a rangers come 

611
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:37,770
out.
They're going to try to save her.

612
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,660
See,
I think the move is close.

613
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:43,650
All doors roll up.
Windows think grabs are so quick.

614
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,510
It's like,
this is what I've wanted.

615
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:49,170
I'm so tired of eating a whole meat 
served on an aluminum tray.

616
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:52,020
Fuck you.
Fuck you for keeping me here.

617
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,810
Here's the thing,
man.

618
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,510
I think if they fed those tigers wild 
animals,

619
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,640
they probably wouldn't do that.
They probably wouldn't give a shit about

620
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,830
that lady,
but what they do is they give the Tigers

621
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:05,930
no animal reward to have an animal 
reward system right there.

622
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,330
The tigers jobs to clean up the 
population of this one.

623
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,370
This tiger flying through the fucking 
cool.

624
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,560
Are you kidding me?
Rip.

625
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,650
This guy's hand apart.
Just flew up to the top of and he 

626
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:19,940
listened some fingers.
Oh yeah.

627
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:24,941
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking to his hand 

628
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:24,941
apart.
That tigers don't play,

629
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:28,071
but if you let that tiger killed things 
like if they let a bunch of axis deer 

630
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,000
Lewis,
which that demands,

631
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,480
that would be what they look for.
They would chase down the deer,

632
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,950
eat them.
They live like natural,

633
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,440
but so they have this overwhelming 
desire.

634
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,350
It's like,
here's a way to put it.

635
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,610
If you.
Yeah.

636
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:46,620
If like if you were a guy,
that's not a good way to put it.

637
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,650
I was going to say,
if you're a guy and they extracted all 

638
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:51,840
the come from your balls,
but they kept you horny,

639
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
but that wouldn't make sense.

640
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,820
Absolutely no sense.
I bailed on it.

641
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,130
Right?
What else?

642
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,650
I was like,
that's a bad analogy.

643
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:04,320
Do don't run with that one,
but these animals,

644
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:08,050
they get their appetite satisfied but 
not their appetite to kill their deal.

645
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,080
They're born like you roll a yarn,
roll a ball of yarn in front of a 

646
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,121
kitten.
Fucking cat dives on it because that's 

647
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:17,121
what they're supposed to do.
This supposed to attack things.

648
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:19,020
They have a bill.
Even little flirt,

649
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:24,021
fluffy little kittens.
They have a built in desire to attack 

650
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:28,461
things.
I think that's why people are the way 

651
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:31,461
they are and social media.
They don't have the release that the 

652
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:31,461
human body,
soul,

653
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:32,760
Spirit,
however you want to describe it,

654
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:37,761
is designed to get somewhere else and if
all you get it from as a device through 

655
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,540
other people's pictures are selected 
posts,

656
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,860
I think you go crazy.
I think that

657
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,780
is why I don't trust nearly every human 
being on the face of the planet.

658
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,810
It's just they're not,
I don't think they get the chance to 

659
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:51,810
express who they want to be.

660
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:51,810
I agree.
One hundred percent.

661
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,620
I agree 100 percent.
And I think um,

662
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,990
I've been thinking a lot about this 
whole boss,

663
00:29:56,991 --> 00:30:01,991
employee sexual assault,
sexual harassment thing that's been 

664
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,381
going on every day.
Something else comes on and it's always 

665
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:08,561
the same thing.
It's always a man in power in a woman 

666
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,630
who works for him and something goes 
down and it's never the opposite.

667
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:14,780
It's never chicks getting their pussy by
some dude who works in the office.

668
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:20,110
It's never.
There's a lot of women that are ceos or 

669
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,900
it hasn't been reported yet.
Those guys can keep their mouth shut.

670
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:25,901
Right?
Or the guy doesn't consider that to be 

671
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:25,901
harassment.
It's not.

672
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:25,901
She's,
yeah,

673
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:27,430
she lets you fuck her and she buys your 
car.

674
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Damn,
we got a mustang the fuck you go to the 

675
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,040
New York Post for.

676
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,460
Oh my God,
that almost came out of my nose.

677
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,600
But if it's a.
But I think this is what I think.

678
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,630
I think that a lot of males right in a 
male in a position of power,

679
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:52,901
like the chief of the village,
like that guy would probably have his 

680
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,090
choice.
He was the war Lord.

681
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:59,091
He had this choice of women and the 
women would respond to him in a 

682
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,850
favorable way,
which would let him know.

683
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:03,900
It would indicate to him that it's time 
to fuck right,

684
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,480
this girl wants it,
I'm going to give it to her.

685
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,870
So when a guy is like some Harvey 
Weinstein guy or someone who's at the 

686
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:15,760
front of some giant company and everyone
in the office kisses his ass when he's 

687
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,900
there and everyone's so happy to talk to
him and people are angling for,

688
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,070
for raises and they're angling for 
promotions and they're always nice to 

689
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,211
him and they treated him like royalty.
I think the guy start thinking that 

690
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,840
these girls are attracted to him,
that they.

691
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,840
That he's going to fuck them.
Like it's a power thing,

692
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:38,050
but it's also like a trick on the reward
system that the brain has and then it's 

693
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,680
a scumbag thing to.
There's like a lot of factors in there.

694
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:45,070
I think,
I think it's a lot tied to the power 

695
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,070
side.

696
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,870
I cannot think of an example of any 
occupation that doesn't have that 

697
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,530
problem somewhere near the apex,

698
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,370
right?
When a man gets in power,

699
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,130
just power.
I think power.

700
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,610
I think that as

701
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,280
humans we're only capable of dealing 
with so much fill in the blank when it 

702
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,811
comes to that,
whether it's the money or the fame or 

703
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:06,811
people throwing themselves at you.
I think at some point,

704
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:09,010
depending on the moral compass that you 
have and how it's calibrated,

705
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:14,011
it ends up swinging in the wrong 
direction because you can look at 

706
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:16,240
physicians,
you could look at religion,

707
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,410
you can look at people in the military,
generals in the number of sexual assault

708
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:25,360
cases and the generals like a one to 
four star generals in the US in 2017 was

709
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:29,920
insanely high to comedy.
Bill Cosby to,

710
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,150
you know,
just fill in the blank.

711
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:34,150
You can find an example everywhere.
Once you start getting to the apex,

712
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:35,830
I think there's just a disconnect on how
much,

713
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,530
depending on who you are going into that
position,

714
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,250
I think there's a disconnect on how much
you can handle

715
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,920
because we was a really weird one 
because I.

716
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,240
I've had this theory for a while,
but I think that during cosby's era,

717
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,480
the 19 sixties,
I think it was not just common to drug 

718
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:56,420
women,
but it was almost like a joke like that.

719
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:01,421
People thought it was funny because 
drugs were fairly fairly new and the 

720
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:07,001
consequences of sexual assault warrant 
talked about and it wasn't thought about

721
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,230
the same way and I think that those 
during that day,

722
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,690
like he used to joke around about it in 
his act.

723
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,700
I remember you saying that before.
Yeah.

724
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,580
He had these Spanish Florida.
Yeah,

725
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,030
and he even had a section,
a segment or a scene on the cosby show 

726
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,550
where someone would give something to 
someone that would make them have sex 

727
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,220
with them or he would put them to sleep 
with something.

728
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Like he would joke around about it and 
he had joked around about it on talk 

729
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,650
shows and stuff.

730
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,250
I mean,
this is,

731
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,970
but I think that when you talked to 
someone who was around during the 19 

732
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,691
sixties,
they used to call it slip and so under 

733
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:46,691
Mickey.
You have heard the term before?

734
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,590
Yeah,
I think they just once and shit started 

735
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,780
coming out and they start giving them to
people just slip it in tow so fucked up.

736
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,180
So fucked up.
But it still happens,

737
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,310
man.
To this day it's still happens.

738
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,400
You know?
I had these girls on the podcast the 

739
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,400
other day.
I'm,

740
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,311
I'm Korean and Christina from the 
podcast guys we fucked and one of them 

741
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:10,061
was saying that she was hanging out with
this guy and she had a drink and then 

742
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:14,291
all of a sudden she just couldn't 
fucking controllers got into a cab or 

743
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:14,291
something like that.
Right.

744
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,310
And rescued her.
You had your hands full with those two.

745
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,360
That was like crazy.

746
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,360
It seemed to me like you had to wet cats
in a paper bag when she was talking 

747
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,120
about I had an anal anal orgasms with a 
vibrator.

748
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm like,
well,

749
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,880
okay.
Yes,

750
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:28,790
yes.
Tell me more.

751
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,020
No,
I was listening to that at my house.

752
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:32,300
I think folding laundry in my head,
I'm like,

753
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,330
damn,
you got your hands full with those two.

754
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,640
Well,
they're fun.

755
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,260
It was an entertaining podcast for sure.
They are girls that talk publicly the 

756
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,220
way girls talk privately when they have 
a couple drinks in them.

757
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,180
One hundred percent.
Yeah,

758
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,820
and that's what's so attractive about 
their podcast.

759
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,420
I wish I had there.
I don't know what the term to use.

760
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:56,810
Bravery or whatever it is to be that 
open and honest and like just fuck it.

761
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,340
Here I am.
Blank slate.

762
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,770
Here's what I like.
Here's what I don't like.

763
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:01,550
Here's what I might like.

764
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,850
I don't know.
Well it's appealing though.

765
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,700
When someone does do it.
Like if someone you can tell you like,

766
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,320
okay,
this person is actually there.

767
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,870
They're being completely balls out 
honest with no repercussions or horses.

768
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,050
So like say if they were an actress,
like let's find some famous who is a 

769
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,850
famous current actress.
Good.

770
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,870
Give me like a hot.
Who's a hot Jennifer Lawrence.

771
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,120
Yeah,
but she's already had that scandal.

772
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,540
She had that scandal where people got a 
hold of her pictures and you know,

773
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,640
was without her permission and shit like
that.

774
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,200
Yeah.
I'm out of my legal and this one,

775
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,120
Scarlett Johansson.
Okay.

776
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:37,350
Let's say Scarlett Johansson and 
Scarlett Johansson.

777
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:42,351
If somebody like filmed her talking 
about how she had had an anal orgasms 

778
00:35:42,351 --> 00:35:47,301
with a vibrator and how she likes having
her boyfriend get his dick sucked in 

779
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,400
front of her.
That was it.

780
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,370
She didn't know that people are going to
like,

781
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:51,510
it would be horrific.

782
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,800
She like,
oh my God.

783
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,810
She'd have to stay home for days.
You have to pop advils and sleep on the 

784
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,270
couch with a fucking blanket overhead.
You know what I mean?

785
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:03,210
She'd be horrified.
I can't believe that got out.

786
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,090
This is so awful.
Or she could go on and be like,

787
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:07,650
yeah,
you're goddamn right.

788
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,770
Yeah.
But these girls just like blurted out 

789
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,350
and then move onto the next thing.
I like Tacos just one thing after the 

790
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,310
other,
but they're,

791
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,110
that's their free,
you know?

792
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,140
And that's what people like.
This is what people liked about Charlie 

793
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Sheen until they found out he had aids.
Yeah.

794
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,320
That was an interesting development in 
that particular store.

795
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:26,920
It's like,
oh,

796
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,950
well this story takes a fucking terrible
term.

797
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:31,410
Yeah.
Now I gotta change the lenses out on the

798
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,240
glasses that I view you through.
Yeah.

799
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,290
I thought you were winning.

800
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Yeah.
I thought you had tiger blood just 

801
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,890
fricking winning at every turn.
I didn't realize.

802
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,120
Didn't realize you had the high five and
the old tiger blood.

803
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,900
Yeah.
The,

804
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,090
the high five that he got.
Um,

805
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,000
apparently is what started that whole 
thing off.

806
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,710
What is insanity?
Yeah,

807
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:50,630
sure it is.
Yeah.

808
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,250
Well,
when he,

809
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,980
it turns out that when he was diagnosed 
with HIV was right when he started going

810
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,690
wild and talking about,
you know,

811
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,060
snorting and smoking,
eight grams of crack and that's how I 

812
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,200
roll and all that shit.
Yeah.

813
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,130
Okay.
Yeah.

814
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,470
And I'm sure when you start off bat shit
crazy,

815
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,360
it doesn't help and that's your 
baseline,

816
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,580
but you remember how people reacted to 
that though.

817
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,780
They will like,
yes,

818
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,640
tell us what you're doing,
Charlie.

819
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,030
I mean,
he did a Goddamn tour of theaters and he

820
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:19,290
didn't have,
he didn't even sit down.

821
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,760
He would sit down and just be like,
all right,

822
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:25,020
so just got done smoking an eight ball.
Well he would tell stories,

823
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:27,480
but they had to craft what the thing 
would be.

824
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,540
See what started out was he was just 
going to go in this theater tour and 

825
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,810
he's probably on copd if I talk to the 
people,

826
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:36,360
they're gonna love us and he didn't know
really what to do.

827
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,390
So the first couple of shows were a 
total disaster and then he started 

828
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,011
bringing comics in there with them.
So like my friend Russell Peters did a 

829
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:49,371
bunch of them with him.
So he would go up for a little bit then 

830
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:49,371
go up or like what kind of host the 
thing.

831
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:54,260
Oh,
so it was comic and then trolley and 

832
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,771
they were sitting down talking and this 
way you get to hear Charlie's wild 

833
00:37:57,771 --> 00:37:57,771
stories and talking crazy shit.

834
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,900
But the comic would frame it all with 
some actual comedy and comedy and 

835
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,120
comedic relaxed reaction to this maniac.
So they keep it on the rails and 

836
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:14,030
Russell's great comic and he's 
particularly great at talking like 

837
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,890
talking shit and ad libbing.
Like Russell's a great.

838
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,920
He does a lot of crowd work and his act,
so he's like super fast and speedy and 

839
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,320
Russell brand's.
Russell Peters,

840
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,830
Russell brand,
who is another guy he's an absolute 

841
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:27,830
hands full with on the podcast.
Yeah,

842
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,550
he's.
He's a character.

843
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,900
Don't get that guy coffee.
Yeah,

844
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,370
he had a lot of coffee.
Well,

845
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:33,960
he's a.
he's a drug free character.

846
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,690
Choke Free Soda of.

847
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,020
Yeah.
Now,

848
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,200
now drug free.
That guy did enough drugs to kill all 

849
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,200
three of us in this room probably.
He lived.

850
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:42,970
Yeah.
God bless him.

851
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:44,350
Now he's got a story to tell.
Yeah,

852
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:45,910
but he's another guy.
He's pretty free,

853
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,890
you know,
even like with who he is now,

854
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:51,130
he's free and he's all.
I cannot believe the transparency.

855
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,270
Like I said,
I don't have,

856
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,840
I don't have the,
the courage to just be like,

857
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,310
boom,
here it is.

858
00:38:57,311 --> 00:39:00,510
Let's just unzip the fly,
lay it out and here we are.

859
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,560
People like,
you just don't try.

860
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,510
I bet you did.
I try.

861
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,300
I try my luck.
So for the podcast,

862
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,720
my rule is I just try to be honest.
That's all I try to do is just be honest

863
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:15,721
and portray myself as I am and say the 
things that I actually believe and not 

864
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,130
try to add one percent to it,
but there's still some people were,

865
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:19,690
if they were to ask me some questions,
I'd be like,

866
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,710
yeah,
that's for another day.

867
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,030
You know,
I'm not going to answer every single 

868
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,030
question.
Well also,

869
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,590
especially if it comes to like military 
shit,

870
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,160
there's stuff you can answer,
we'll then you just make stuff up.

871
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,090
Oh,
is that what you do?

872
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,920
Pretty much is.
There's a lot of that going on,

873
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,120
right?
There's a ton of that going on,

874
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:39,121
which is why most of the time I try to 
dispel misconceptions.

875
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:44,161
The reality is no,
there's really nothing that I've ever 

876
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:46,291
done that you can't talk about.
Is there any books or anything that's 

877
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:50,461
ever come out where you knew one story 
and then you saw come on and you're 

878
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:54,691
like,
I have gone to the bookstore and read 

879
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:59,011
books written by an individual who said 
they were on a combat operation that I 

880
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,920
was on and don't remember seeing them 
there.

881
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,220
It's problematic.
Yeah.

882
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:08,830
That seems like a real issue.
It's a huge issue.

883
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,920
Um,
I would say 99 point nine percent of 

884
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,331
books that have a trident on them should
be purchased and then put next to your 

885
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:19,510
toilet paper roll.
So when you run out of toilet paper,

886
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,280
you can just start ripping pages out of 
the books,

887
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,500
wipe your ass with pride and just 
showing that symbol is the symbol that 

888
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,580
is associated with being a seal.
It's,

889
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,180
you know,
you get,

890
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,420
when you get that symbol,
they change your designator inside of 

891
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,820
the navy system and it registers as a 53
slash 26,

892
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,630
which is why do you think you see them 
using that trident?

893
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,660
Because it's recognizable.
So they're doing it because they're 

894
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:42,660
bullshit artists.
They're doing it.

895
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,970
Um,
I can't say exactly why they're doing 

896
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,321
it.
I know some people are doing it purely 

897
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,601
to make money.
Some people got out or a little bit 

898
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,150
early and have used the recognizability 
of that mark to further their own 

899
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,490
motives down the road and a purely 100 
percent profit seeking other people are 

900
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,570
there trying to tell I guess would be 
their story or their version of a story 

901
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,621
and that would be the people in the 
middle and then I guess on the other 

902
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:13,411
end,
the best example I point people at as 

903
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:14,140
generally Jockos book,
it's not a book about hey,

904
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:14,680
no shit.

905
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,680
There I was,
which is the number one indicator of a 

906
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,920
store at this completely false as la.
There we were like,

907
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:21,550
no,
you're done.

908
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,530
Why is that be?
People want to romanticize and embellish

909
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,940
the reality of,
of what actually happened and I don't 

910
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,040
know if it's the desire to make it seem 
like it's

911
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,920
more than it was.
I don't know if it's because most of the

912
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:39,590
time when you're coming from a military 
background,

913
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:40,170
you don't.
You're not.

914
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,410
You're not used to any level with people
really.

915
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,830
I would call it fan ship I guess or you 
know what I mean?

916
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:50,831
Like it's you.
It's the military and being in the 

917
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:52,580
military is not about money,
you know,

918
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:57,581
I could,
you can pull up online and see exactly 

919
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,191
how much every individual in the 
military is making based off what rank 

920
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:00,191
they are and how many years they've been
in.

921
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:01,820
So people will be approached and like,
look,

922
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:04,010
this is how much money you could make if
you wrote a book and they're like,

923
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,650
holy shit,
that's the.

924
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,730
And so they will and they'll make 
millions of dollars.

925
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,640
The problem is is if you start 
embellishing those stories,

926
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,700
in my mind at least it starts tarnishing
the reality of what the occupation 

927
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,800
actually is and the in the good and 
sometimes amazing things that happen 

928
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,030
lose a lot of their value in my mind and
I just think it's an enticement that 

929
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,220
guys are not used to inside of the 
military.

930
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,380
It's very.
When I was in the military,

931
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,110
I mean I feel like I was talking to 
Jamie before we started.

932
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:33,560
I feel like I'm late to everything and 
late to social media.

933
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:38,561
I'm late to.
I had never listened to a podcast 

934
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:38,561
before.
I sat down and met you with tate.

935
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:39,680
Really?
I had never listened to one.

936
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,770
I had no idea.
I had no idea that diversity of 

937
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,360
information that is out there and you 
can go and,

938
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,760
and I mean you can almost get like a,
a,

939
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,520
an advanced degree in whatever it is you
want to get by just going.

940
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:56,540
I had no idea.
Never listened to one because I was so 

941
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,680
focused on something else.
And then you lift your head up from that

942
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,980
world and you're like,
what the fuck is going on around here?

943
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,760
And you know,
if you post the right pictures on social

944
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:09,761
media that you and your outfit with your
thousand yard stare off into the 

945
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:12,821
distance,
then you get more followers and then 

946
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:12,821
people,
oh,

947
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:12,821
come and speak and say.

948
00:43:12,821 --> 00:43:15,860
And it just,
it's an enticing thing to individuals in

949
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:18,770
my opinion,
that are just not used to that.

950
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:21,380
And it can really.
It can really.

951
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,440
I think it can take you down a path that
I would recommend most people don't 

952
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,440
take,
which is why I like the way Jocko,

953
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,331
when as he has experiences,
but he's trying to take those 

954
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:33,731
experiences in,
portray them in a way that people can 

955
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:33,980
make use of them.
It's not about the story,

956
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:38,981
it's about what he learned during the 
story and how you can implement that in 

957
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:41,951
your life.
So there's a broad spectrum of 

958
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,501
everything from literally rip off pages 
and wipe your ass to recommend to 

959
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:47,860
anybody that I encounter that asked 
about [inaudible].

960
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,590
New Book is fantastic and it's so short.
It's like it's an easy read.

961
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,390
That's what makes it so fantastic book 
could change your life because if those.

962
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,210
Those quotes are from a real 
inspirational guy,

963
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,940
he's.
He's really trying to really be.

964
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:04,400
I would say he's not trying to be 
inspirational.

965
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,410
He's.
He wrote down in committed to paper the 

966
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,560
principles that he uses to live his 
life,

967
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,340
his passion and his enthusiasm for 
getting up at 4:30

968
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:16,580
in the morning and working out 
unprecedented for like a week.

969
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:21,730
I was getting up a few minutes before 
him and I would just post on twitter 

970
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,210
like up before Jocko,
Hashtag don't be lazy,

971
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,710
and then I got fucking tired and I had 
to stop.

972
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,430
Don't do that.
He'll get up earlier.

973
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,520
He will,
but he,

974
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,890
of course he was liking him.
I was like,

975
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,250
God damn it.
I'm trying to elicit

976
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,590
a response out of you.
Jocko.

977
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,500
It's falling.
He led.

978
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,860
Absolutely.
I mean because if people were asked you,

979
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,550
they will still ask me are I think I'll 
still ask them if we know each other and

980
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,990
I've known him forever and they don't.
You can't.

981
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,490
You can't call how Jocko like that.
I'm like,

982
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:46,620
I think it's okay.
I think it's gonna be all right.

983
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:48,750
If I make funky Jocko on twitter,
it's going to be all right.

984
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,040
He's got a good sense of humor.
Yeah.

985
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,680
Well especially if you know the guy.
Yeah.

986
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,760
He's not going to get pissed about it,
but his father was like,

987
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,250
this is a funny man just because you 
have at for 29.

988
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,490
Hey Man,
if you want to be a lazy bitch ahead and

989
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:07,491
then I have to stop myself,
that's as far as I can go on twitter 

990
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:07,491
because I will lose my mind and I don't 
want to be that person.

991
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,600
Yeah,
you can't respond to many people.

992
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,980
You have like a minimum or a maximum 
requirement per day.

993
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,430
Just give yourself like a threshold.
I've looked at three different comments 

994
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,850
about.
I don't understand how you could 

995
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,530
possibly keep track or even tabs.
I mean your numbers are astronomical.

996
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,040
No,
I don't keep track.

997
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,070
Occasionally I dip my toe into the water
of social media,

998
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:32,130
but for the most part I don't.
It's got to be like an abstract painting

999
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,930
rolling by.
They're like 60 miles an hour.

1000
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,240
You can probably just catch one or two 
things that comes by.

1001
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,300
We'll also,
between working out,

1002
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,040
writing comedy,
doing stand up,

1003
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,790
be with my family,
archery.

1004
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,510
Anything else I'm doing at the time?
I don't have the fucking time.

1005
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,250
Podcasts.
Yeah,

1006
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,620
UFC duties.
Whatever I have to do with doc.

1007
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,320
I don't have the dime.
It doesn't exist.

1008
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,550
So you're tapped out?

1009
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,200
Yeah,
so I do what I can.

1010
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,730
I post stuff and then I get out of there
and plus I don't the turmoil,

1011
00:46:02,731 --> 00:46:03,630
the P,
I don't want to like,

1012
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,400
you can engage.
Like,

1013
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:07,470
what's that?
That if you,

1014
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,430
uh,
what's that?

1015
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,770
If you respond to every barking dog and 
ever get where you're going,

1016
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,010
if you ever heard that.
Sounds good.

1017
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:15,600
I'm with you.
I think I paraphrased it,

1018
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,870
but that's the idea behind this.
Like there's no way you don't have the 

1019
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,751
time.
And I have friends that have less 

1020
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:24,510
followers who will go like my friend 
Owen Benjamin.

1021
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,040
He's fucking crazy.
He'll,

1022
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,860
he'll have twitter fights all day long.
And I told him the other day,

1023
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:29,290
I'm like,
Bro,

1024
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,650
it's gonna.
Stop engaging.

1025
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,180
We got to stop doing this.
It entice people.

1026
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:36,240
Once they recognize that you engage,
it would entice them to hit you up more.

1027
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,400
Exactly.
And then your time is you're done.

1028
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,010
Yeah.
And then they'll try to piss you off and

1029
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:42,780
then you'd go back and forth with them,
oh,

1030
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:44,520
well fuck you.
And then next thing you know,

1031
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,910
you're up at 3:00
in the morning checking your twitter 

1032
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,930
exhausted the rest of the day.
Just compliment people when they say 

1033
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,090
mean things just right back.
I think you're an amazing human being.

1034
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,510
Heart emoticon sent.
Thanks.

1035
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,730
Thanks Sweetie.
Because they don't know how to take 

1036
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:01,730
that.
Oh,

1037
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,050
how long do you think you're going to 
last?

1038
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,100
The winter to the end up keeping the 
place in San Diego and just coming back 

1039
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,090
here in November?
No,

1040
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,180
I have really not thought about San 
Diego since the day that we left and I 

1041
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,721
am with tickets.
Snowed in will be like a good five feet 

1042
00:47:17,721 --> 00:47:20,430
cold weather stuff and I got guys truck.
I do have a truck.

1043
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,650
I have a F150.
Nice.

1044
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,880
Slightly modified though.

1045
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,680
Jacked.
Jacked up.

1046
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,720
A little lift.
It's came tested.

1047
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,840
Thirty five big 750 horsepower.
Mud and snow tires.

1048
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,350
Probably 750 horsepower.
Jesus Christ.

1049
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,580
What the fuck do you have in the hood?
Shelby supercharger.

1050
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,940
Oh,
you went.

1051
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,730
You went deep.
It came that way.

1052
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:47,731
My wife was so pissed at me because I 
went in with my other f-150 to get an 

1053
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,670
oil change and I technically did get an 
oil change because I came home with this

1054
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:55,120
truck and she walked outside and she was
just like God.

1055
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,650
But a lot of those like super sport 
performance trucks,

1056
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:01,100
they,
they have street tires on them.

1057
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,740
Mine have massive knobby tires.
I literally went in,

1058
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:11,090
uh,
I got very fortunate and I got a great 

1059
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,720
deal on a Ford on like a pseudo 
endorsement sponsorship thing earlier.

1060
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,230
So I had a bunch of equity in my truck.
I literally went in to get an oil change

1061
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:21,040
and right next to me in this spot was 
this Ford f150 black ops model,

1062
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,580
like the Tuscan Tuscany so hard.

1063
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,080
And I get out of my truck,
which I usually feel good and then I'm 

1064
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,930
looking up at this other truck and now I
immediately feel like bitch.

1065
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,320
And I'm just an eye.
So I climbed up on the wheel and I'm 

1066
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:37,320
just reading the sticker because I 
couldn't read it from the ground.

1067
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,760
I'm just looking at like,
all right,

1068
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:44,761
well that price is totally outside of my
range and I go inside and of course the 

1069
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:47,650
salesman happened to see me and he comes
over to the service side of the,

1070
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,330
you know what I'm getting now given the 
guy my keys,

1071
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,650
and he was like,
what do you think about that truck?

1072
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,660
Like,
I think that thing's awesome man.

1073
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:53,080
He's like,
well,

1074
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:54,460
let's just.
Let's just run the numbers.

1075
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,550
Like okay.
Four hours later I'm going home and the 

1076
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,801
new truck for hours,
it took you four hours in the 

1077
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:01,801
dealership.

1078
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:02,920
You wives call it up,
where the fuck are you?

1079
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:08,010
Well,
she does that because that's not the 

1080
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:08,010
first time it's happened.
Oh,

1081
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:08,010
you've done that?
I buy.

1082
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:12,990
I tried to buy her a car one time.
I told her I was taking her minivan in 

1083
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,380
Honda Odyssey.
Best urban assault vehicle ever dual 

1084
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,230
open doors.
You can just take down a compound and 

1085
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:19,230
that thing.
Yeah,

1086
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,300
as long as you have blacked out windows,
they don't store some rocket launchers 

1087
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:22,450
on top of that bitch and just roll.
So I was like,

1088
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:27,451
hey,
how do you want me to take you in and 

1089
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:27,451
take your car and get an oil change?
I was getting her a Tahoe and like three

1090
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:28,780
hours and she starts calling me,
what are you doing?

1091
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,230
I'm like,
oh,

1092
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,900
they found a leak in your flux 
capacitor.

1093
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,390
It's going to be a few more minutes.
Shit shit about cars,

1094
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:34,840
but the future.

1095
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,420
Yeah.
And uh,

1096
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,440
so I come home and she's like,
oh,

1097
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:43,441
I like that car.
It's the wrong color and the different 

1098
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:43,441
seats.
And I'm like,

1099
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:43,441
God damn it.
So she went back and picked out her own.

1100
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:44,800
So after a couple hours,
the dealership,

1101
00:49:44,801 --> 00:49:48,430
I think she realized something was up 
and I got in trouble for that.

1102
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,490
Yeah.
I saw a video where they were comparing 

1103
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,070
that shelby supercharged f-150 to the 
raptor.

1104
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,140
They were trying to figure out which one
was better.

1105
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,410
I don't know,
but I think that truck is ready to go 

1106
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,320
for the winter time.
It's got some big old tires,

1107
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,120
uh,
an entirely too much torque and power 

1108
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,120
for me.
Yeah,

1109
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,230
it's a little bit loose,
you know,

1110
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,780
break loose,
locking differentials and all that jazz.

1111
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,880
We don't even know what that means.
I'm locking differentials means you can 

1112
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,101
like you have an arb locking 
differential and what you do is you set 

1113
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:22,420
it so that all wheels will always spin 
together no matter what.

1114
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:24,100
So it locks together,
so if you're,

1115
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,220
if you're in a place where one wheel is 
spinning,

1116
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,220
it doesn't

1117
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
work that way.
All wheel spin together and it's not 

1118
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,521
good for driving down the road,
but it's good for getting you out of 

1119
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:39,050
places and for traversing very difficult
terrain.

1120
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,330
It might have that.
I might have fucked that up,

1121
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:46,570
but locking differentials are a.
it's a must on any sort of off road 

1122
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:49,220
vehicle.
I never planned to tick it off road even

1123
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:51,560
though I think it's designed for the 
Zombie apocalypse.

1124
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,600
I tried to baby that thing and just park
it in the garage.

1125
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,730
Yeah,
but what if you have to like what if you

1126
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:59,420
have to go into the forest to get your 
elk.

1127
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,350
If you're packing out,
it's called somebody else who's a trail,

1128
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,600
some sort of logging trail.
Call somebody else,

1129
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,970
bring their truck.
I don't think you can use it in Montana.

1130
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,540
No,
I was actually thinking about that to 

1131
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:16,540
wind.
Now.

1132
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:16,540
I don't even know what I'd use it for,
but I feel like to have it,

1133
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,000
I feel like I would be more prepared for
life in general with the window.

1134
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,060
My Bronco has a wrench,
doesn't suck and that thing's bad ass.

1135
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:26,690
Never going to use that.
When they were telling me how the winch,

1136
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:28,480
where's my Yay.
I'm fucking thinking.

1137
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,390
The confidence that you have gay 
climbing into.

1138
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,840
You're like,
I got a winch,

1139
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,440
a winch.
Nothing can stop me.

1140
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:35,330
What the folks got stomped me.
Nothing to winch.

1141
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah.
You can pull something out of a ditch.

1142
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,950
That's like a man thing.
Like men want equipment.

1143
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:42,170
They're never going to use liquid.
Should always have a chainsaw.

1144
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:47,171
Just in case 100 percent.
You live in a fucking apartment in New 

1145
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:47,171
York City.
Why do you have a chainsaw?

1146
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:49,760
Never know.
Might have to cut down the door.

1147
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,370
Shit goes wrong.
Straight goes sideways.

1148
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,520
Now trees start growing everywhere,
but we're ready for winter,

1149
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,770
man.
If we got the ski pass is ready to go,

1150
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:01,580
I can see worldclass skiing from my 
son's bedroom mountain.

1151
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,210
We live just south of white fish.
So in white fish the mountain is called 

1152
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,570
big mountain.
It's not big sky.

1153
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,520
Most people confuse the two big skies in
Bozeman.

1154
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,410
I think you said you had been to big sky
before.

1155
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:17,411
I've been to Bozeman.
Bozeman has big sky makes guys like 

1156
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:21,341
right outside of Bose,
just south of incorrect and white fish 

1157
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:21,341
is just north of where we live in 
Kalispell.

1158
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:24,950
And a big mountain is,
it should be open in four days.

1159
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,900
We went to Bozeman and we were there 
when they have this,

1160
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:30,380
uh,
this grizzly sanctuary.

1161
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,920
We took a ride to yellowstone and we 
stopped the grizzly sanctuary.

1162
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:37,490
And the other bucket bears,
they're so big they don't even look like

1163
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:42,491
they're real and they throw them frozen 
watermelons and that's what they're 

1164
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:44,540
eating.
A whole frozen watermelon.

1165
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
So they throw this frozen because it was
hot out and we went in the summer and 

1166
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,040
the bear just this giant block of ice,
you know,

1167
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:52,780
that's what it is.
It's a,

1168
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,270
it's a huge beach ball of ice that's 
like a 20 pounder.

1169
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,590
The bear just opens his mouth and 
crushes it with one bite,

1170
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,100
just cuts through the frozen watermelon 
like it's nothing.

1171
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,170
It's so sobering when you watch a bear 
lying on the water,

1172
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,340
right.
He was in the water,

1173
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:15,490
like lying on its back holding this 
frozen watermelon in his paws and just 

1174
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:19,520
chomping on it and eating it.
It's not a Disney movie.

1175
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Don't mean when Disney movie bitch by.
My brother in law who has never hunted 

1176
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:25,280
before,

1177
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:32,930
has purchased a read works one nice 
already has the yard.

1178
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,730
He's got the whole eight.
He's already got a silverback sitting in

1179
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:40,731
his house.
He's already got an elevate rest in his 

1180
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:43,371
bill.
Comes in and like two weeks and he was 

1181
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:43,371
trying to explain.
I was uh,

1182
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:46,850
had dinner with them last night and he's
trying to explain to his son and his 

1183
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,301
daughter like,
it's not Bambi that I'm going to go 

1184
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:50,370
hunting with.
And they're just like,

1185
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,520
no damage.
No Daddy,

1186
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,310
you can't get.
But it's,

1187
00:53:54,311 --> 00:53:55,920
it's funny.
[inaudible] my kids were like,

1188
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,200
why would you kill a bear dad?
Or why would you kill a deer?

1189
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,450
Why would you kill an elk?
Well,

1190
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,700
to eat it 100 percent.
Yeah.

1191
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,580
It's.
It's interesting though,

1192
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:09,440
help people in my limited super limited 
experience into the hunting world.

1193
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:14,360
Very entrenched in in it's either no.
These animals like these is,

1194
00:54:14,361 --> 00:54:15,660
this is Bambi,
how could you do that?

1195
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:17,370
Or they have an understanding of what's 
going on.

1196
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:17,660
I'm like,
oh,

1197
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:18,000
okay.

1198
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,020
I have a friend who's a hardcore Vegan 
and these kind of an asshole about it,

1199
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:26,021
but he's got dogs and he feeds him dog 
food and dog food from the dog food 

1200
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:27,440
store and it's got animals chopped up,
ground up,

1201
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:31,190
stuffed into these bags and he's good 
with that and I'm like,

1202
00:54:31,191 --> 00:54:34,310
you're a hypocrite.
Like you're a fucking hypocrite.

1203
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:35,600
You really are.
He's like,

1204
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:37,010
well,
the dogs are carnivores.

1205
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:38,090
We're not.
No,

1206
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,110
you choose to not be a carnivore.
You choose to be an herbivore.

1207
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,300
Okay.
But most humans are omnivores.

1208
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,340
That was going to say that we evolved.
We evolved to eat a wide variety of 

1209
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,900
foods and this,
this thing that you're doing is just,

1210
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,870
you're standing out and he's an asshole.
He's a nice guy,

1211
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,050
but he's an asshole and he's always been
like a really negative guy,

1212
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,360
like he's nice to me,
but he's.

1213
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:03,520
He's nice to his friends,
but he's always had this propensity for 

1214
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,790
negativity,
pessimistic attitude towards people be 

1215
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:11,111
successful as a human being,
but shitty to people like for whatever 

1216
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:14,080
weird reason just has this aggressive 
attitude and now he uses it against,

1217
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,140
against people that are involved in 
hunting and he gets off on it.

1218
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:19,730
He thinks it's fun.
You know,

1219
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:24,731
it's just,
it's a weird thing that you can sort of 

1220
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:25,760
justify the torturing and killing of 
these animals to feed your dogs,

1221
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,600
but when someone wants to go out and 
hunt an animal to eat it,

1222
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:34,601
like I get all the people that are 
pissed off that people go out and hunt 

1223
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:37,840
lions and don't eat 'em and hunt 
elephants and don't eat them.

1224
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:40,820
I'm drafts and stuff and I'm with you 
100 percent,

1225
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,890
but here's the thing that's not eating 
deer.

1226
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:49,100
That's not hunting buffalo,
a bison and eating bison.

1227
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:52,760
That's not counting and eating things 
that we're talking about.

1228
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:57,761
Two totally different things and then 
when you get to like the lions and the 

1229
00:55:57,761 --> 00:56:02,270
elephants and there's a real problem and
the real problem is that there's not 

1230
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:07,271
enough money in conservation to ensure 
the safety of these animals unless these

1231
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:13,211
animals are valuable and the most 
valuable way that you can present these 

1232
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:14,480
animals.
This is fucked up,

1233
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:18,200
but when they're hunting targets,
and I'm not.

1234
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,780
I'm not saying this is the only way to 
do it and I think it's not,

1235
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,230
but Africa is a crazy in the best 
documentary about it is Louis Theroux 

1236
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,680
who's a British documentary and did this
trip where he went to one of those high 

1237
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:35,710
fence hunting camps in Africa.
You know those things.

1238
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,300
I've never been to Africa.
I was in a.

1239
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,850
It was in Kenya,
but I've never been around.

1240
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:42,160
And you weren't hunting people where I 
was actually.

1241
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,210
They're building schools.
Oh,

1242
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,360
let me give you.
I'm a humanitarian at.

1243
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,320
You're a sweetheart.
I am a sweetie,

1244
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,500
but luther rose documentary.
Louis through his documentary is amazing

1245
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,900
because you kind of get the sense of 
what it's all about.

1246
00:56:55,901 --> 00:57:00,901
Like these animals.
A lot of them were going extinct just a 

1247
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:03,090
couple of decades ago because there's 
massive poverty all throughout Africa 

1248
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:07,270
and there's no money and they figured 
out that if you take these animals,

1249
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,920
protect them,
put them inside a fenced area in,

1250
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:12,490
in talking about these enormous,
like 10,000

1251
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:17,491
Acre reserves preserves and then people 
fly in to hunt them on a daily basis.

1252
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:23,581
They get a tremendous amount of money,
so then these animals that populations 

1253
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:27,031
are booming,
there are higher than they've ever been 

1254
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:28,180
and the animals are protected.
They're no longer in any danger of being

1255
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:33,181
extinct,
but a lot of people are super 

1256
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:33,370
uncomfortable with the circumstances and
I get that too.

1257
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:35,050
I'm in the same boat as you would like 
to me.

1258
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:39,160
I don't like hunting a giraffe.
Not not into it personally.

1259
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:44,290
Not going to make a character judgment 
against somebody who is or the the 

1260
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,971
elephant or whatever animal that you may
go to call it trophy hunting.

1261
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:53,251
Like I don't know enough about it.
I would assume and hope that the 

1262
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:57,851
situation is exactly like you described 
where the people who live in the area 

1263
00:57:57,851 --> 00:57:58,690
are managing and monitoring.
The species and making sure it's good to

1264
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:03,691
go and if they're doing that,
I have no issue with it and in the same 

1265
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:05,890
breath I totally understand why it's 
very off putting to individual who see a

1266
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:07,780
picture of that and just loses their 
shit.

1267
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,840
Yeah,
I completely get the elephant thing and 

1268
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,340
particular elephants to me or this kind 
of majestic sweet animal,

1269
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,040
but the reality of people living in 
Africa is different.

1270
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,370
People that live in Africa,
elephants destroy their crops,

1271
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:26,610
trample them.
It really becomes a big issue of 

1272
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:30,300
elephants move into areas where they're 
farming and they have to do something 

1273
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,651
about it and sometimes they'll.
They'll have to hire hunters or have 

1274
00:58:34,651 --> 00:58:37,381
someone come in and do it and then once 
someone does shoot one of those 

1275
00:58:37,381 --> 00:58:38,350
elephants,
the amount of people that come in.

1276
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:43,351
Have you ever seen what happened?
She posted a picture or you posted a 

1277
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:47,371
picture of.
I think it was an elephant and it was a 

1278
00:58:47,371 --> 00:58:47,371
line of people outside of the border of 
the picture.

1279
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,440
I'm assuming they were waiting to come 
and get their share of the bank or 

1280
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,440
whatever it was from that animal.
Yeah,

1281
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,430
I mean these are people that have a 
really hard time getting meat.

1282
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,460
An elephant meet is gross as it sounds 
to people listening to this.

1283
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,820
It's supposed to be unbelievably 
delicious if you were raised on it.

1284
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,130
I mean it's supposed to taste really 
good.

1285
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,560
I'm not saying you go out and get an 
elephant burger folks,

1286
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,620
but I'm just saying please don't.
The soul thing is it's very complicated 

1287
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:10,620
and you could say,
well,

1288
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,470
these people shouldn't be raising crops 
where the elephants live.

1289
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:18,100
The problem is this is not like any 
other thing,

1290
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,350
like it's not like an encroachment 
issue.

1291
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,170
Like these people are living in a 
fucking village in Africa.

1292
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,870
I mean this is like literally where 
humans evolved.

1293
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:31,720
So this is,
this is a real situation of humans and a

1294
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,730
very small tribal situation encountering
elephants that just decide that,

1295
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:38,090
hey,
I'm an elephant.

1296
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:39,680
I'm fucking 10,000
pounds.

1297
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,820
I'm just going to eat your food,
bitch.

1298
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,700
You Ain't gonna do shit and these people
don't know what to do about it.

1299
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,130
There's a lot of that and there's,
that's the other thing.

1300
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:46,730
People say,
well,

1301
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:50,210
elephants are going extinct.
So yes and no.

1302
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,790
In some places in the world you go to 
Iowa,

1303
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,140
there's no elephants,
right?

1304
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,120
Content as well.
They're extended no elephants.

1305
00:59:56,121 --> 01:00:01,121
Yep.
But there's parts of Africa that have a 

1306
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:03,521
lot of elephants and they actually have 
to control the populations and it's the 

1307
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:06,350
same thing with deer.
Like people in California will tell you,

1308
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,880
you know,
hey,

1309
01:00:07,881 --> 01:00:09,080
you know,
you shouldn't shoot a deer.

1310
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,760
He talked to people in Iowa and you're 
like,

1311
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:12,050
please,
you've got to shoot these deer.

1312
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:14,660
My wife Rector fucking car.
She's in the hospital.

1313
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,330
Same thing in Montana.
There's deer on the side of the road,

1314
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:18,530
everywhere,
everywhere,

1315
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:22,060
everywhere.
And you can see for on the bumper,

1316
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:27,090
bumper is in windshield smashed.
It's doesn't take a rocket surgeon to 

1317
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,240
put two and two to get an advanced 
degree.

1318
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,990
I love how people in Montana have those 
fucking road warrior grills.

1319
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:34,490
So I got one.
You got bring it.

1320
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,050
Come on dear.
Apparently if you hit a deer in Montana,

1321
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:41,270
you can call the fish and game.
Let them know what happened.

1322
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,770
Throw it in the trunk.
Yeah,

1323
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,980
I like that.
That's good because then you get to keep

1324
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:47,630
the meat.
The meat doesn't just go to waste.

1325
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,720
I like that.
As long as you're not driving around 

1326
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:52,720
looking for a deer,
that's what someone said,

1327
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,711
but the problem with that is the odds of
you hitting a deer on purpose or like 

1328
01:00:56,711 --> 01:00:57,620
fucking zero.
I know,

1329
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,410
but if you try to avoid them,
it's a pretty high percentage.

1330
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,230
I'd almost hit a few like I don't want 
to hit a deer in this truck.

1331
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:04,230
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1332
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,380
I remember I was coming home once.
I had a Gig in upstate New York and I 

1333
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,421
was driving down to where I lived in new
Rochelle and I hit this one patch that 

1334
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,830
had so many deer.

1335
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,350
I had to drive like 20 miles an hour on 
the highway.

1336
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,630
It was fucking insane.
It probably wouldn't even get out of the

1337
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:25,631
way.
They were just darting in front of the 

1338
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:25,631
road,
like left and right,

1339
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,630
left and right,
and I'm talking like an infestation.

1340
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,680
It was crazy.
And this is what happens when there's no

1341
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:35,210
predators and no hunters and you know 
you don't want wolves in your backyard.

1342
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,430
People once you live in Montana,
kind of cool.

1343
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,540
I would still take a strong pass on 
wolves in the backyard.

1344
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,820
No,
I would like to see them.

1345
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:46,040
When I was up there,
this lady who lived up there was talking

1346
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:47,150
to us and she said,
um,

1347
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,240
she lives in this canyon and they had 
wolves come through a couple of nights 

1348
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,240
before.
And I said,

1349
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:52,670
what is that like?
She goes,

1350
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:54,290
well,
it's two things.

1351
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:59,350
She's like,
it's beautiful and you also have to be 

1352
01:01:59,350 --> 01:01:59,510
cautious.
She's,

1353
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,310
Oh,
so it's this thing where you like,

1354
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,340
I'll really love it.
They're there and I loved looking at 

1355
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,340
them,
but I want them to go away.

1356
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,670
I love looking at them from the safety 
and security of inside of my house.

1357
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:11,480
She's like,
well,

1358
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:14,990
people get a little nervous about their 
livestock and definitely their pets.

1359
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,760
I go their pets.
She's like,

1360
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:18,650
yes,
that's number one.

1361
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,890
They will kill dogs

1362
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,240
real quick.
I bet.

1363
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,670
It sounds amazing though,
to hear a pack of wolves in the wild.

1364
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,680
I have no,
no experience with that.

1365
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:30,681
It's got to be.
I had never heard an elk bugle until 

1366
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:30,681
September.
Oh.

1367
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:33,000
And I also thought that they,
after I heard them bugling,

1368
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,420
I assumed that they did that all year 
round.

1369
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:37,230
I just thought,
okay,

1370
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,770
I'll communicate by bugling.
I had no idea that for basically a month

1371
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:45,771
you can hear them communicating like 
that and then they zip it and start 

1372
01:02:45,771 --> 01:02:47,260
working together as a little probably 
not heard.

1373
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,900
I had no idea.
And it was in a valley had when I was in

1374
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:56,901
the middle of my,
other than optimal hunting experience 

1375
01:02:56,901 --> 01:03:00,440
and just surrounded by it,
we couldn't have had this conversation 

1376
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:00,440
at this volume.

1377
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,700
Yeah,
like you got to be shitting me.

1378
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:08,910
There's a film that's coming out Friday,
me and Cam went to Utah and we're a 

1379
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:14,070
hunting elk in Utah and there's one 
scene in it where we just every now and 

1380
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:17,300
then if you go elk hunting,
and especially this one place in Utah is

1381
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,160
enormous ranch.
It's a private ranch and it's 240,000

1382
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:26,161
acres.
Where were you in relationship to Salt 

1383
01:03:26,161 --> 01:03:26,161
Lake City?
Couple hours drive.

1384
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,970
I wasn't paying attention.
Jed was driving,

1385
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,350
you don't know southeast West.
My phone.

1386
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:32,560
So it was a new.
I got to,

1387
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:36,520
you get off twitter joke.
I had to do email.

1388
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,070
I was behind.
So,

1389
01:03:39,071 --> 01:03:40,110
um,
uh,

1390
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,180
anyway,
there's this one part of the film while 

1391
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:45,550
we're in there and you literally,
you might hear 100 bugles around us.

1392
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:50,190
There's screaming left.
Yeah.

1393
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,840
Yeah.
And you know,

1394
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:54,930
the audio,
even if you were in like an Imax theater

1395
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,720
would not do a justice.
No,

1396
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,560
I couldn't.
I couldn't believe it.

1397
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,600
I,
the one thing I know,

1398
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:05,601
I don't have enough of his interactions 
around animals to understand behavior 

1399
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:10,070
and patterns and what to expect,
but I mean in that day was a 

1400
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,820
reinforcement that I was sitting at my 
jaw was on the floor.

1401
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:14,670
I could not believe what it sounded 
like.

1402
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:15,360
It's like a,

1403
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,410
like a mystical animal with the sound it
makes.

1404
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:23,411
It's almost like a lord of the rings 
character and when you watch them do it 

1405
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:25,660
to just like,
we watched this one elk fuck this cow.

1406
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,600
And it's crazy the way they do it,
the way they do it as like a brock 

1407
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,500
lesnar double leg take down.
Like he,

1408
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:36,200
he got on top of her from behind and 
then boom,

1409
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:41,201
he hits her one time,
just shoves her forward and she 

1410
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:43,130
collapses on her front legs and he kinda
wobbles off of her,

1411
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,220
but he is,
he's a one pump chump.

1412
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,420
Maybe that's what they're into,
what they're into one bank,

1413
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:52,190
get it done,
move on to the next.

1414
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,770
And he's doing it all day long and 
protecting month?

1415
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,050
Yeah,
draining himself.

1416
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,000
They lose like 30 slash 40 pounds.
Oh,

1417
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:00,440
do they really?
Probably more.

1418
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,150
Well,
I'm saying 30,

1419
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:03,030
40 pounds,
but they're,

1420
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,300
you know,
seven,

1421
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,680
800 pound animal.
I bet they lose a lot more than that.

1422
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,630
They get real skinny.
They stop eating.

1423
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,030
They just fuck like crazy for two 
months.

1424
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Unbelievable animal,
but probably the most majestic animal 

1425
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:16,990
that I've ever been around.
I cannot wait until next September.

1426
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,250
Yeah.
There's a

1427
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:23,250
real controversy in Montana about wolves
because the wolves that are in Montana 

1428
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,850
right now have been reintroduced from 
Canada.

1429
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,300
They captured them from Canada and then 
reintroduced them to the yellowstone 

1430
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,201
area and there's a really interesting 
video about it called the wolves changed

1431
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:36,490
the walls.
Changing rivers.

1432
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:39,220
I think it's called,
it's like a short film,

1433
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,430
a short film.
I think it's called how wolves changed 

1434
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:48,571
the river and it all just talks about 
how the introduction of the wolves 

1435
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,880
changed the way the river flowed.
Because is this how wolves change 

1436
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:56,470
rivers?
Yeah.

1437
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,150
It's pretty bad ass because it.
It shows the need for predators.

1438
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:06,130
It shows that you can't just have this 
overabundance of wildlife,

1439
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:11,131
like a undulates cows and elk and things
because they eat all the grass when they

1440
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:16,561
eat all the grass.
The trees never grow a strong root 

1441
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:16,561
system.
So there's a lot of things happen.

1442
01:06:16,561 --> 01:06:18,340
Like ECO system on its head.
Yeah,

1443
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,910
and some birds don't survive and you 
know,

1444
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:26,911
there's like,
songbirds have been spotted in like 

1445
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:29,950
really high numbers in yellowstone now.
There's a bunch of stuff.

1446
01:06:29,951 --> 01:06:34,951
They documented it.
A lot of it is because the wolves chase 

1447
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:37,930
down the elk and made the elk and it 
decimated the elk population,

1448
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:42,931
like knocked it down to like half.
But in the process made those elk like 

1449
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,800
just a little bit more wary,
a little smarter.

1450
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:50,130
Still a healthy population,
but that's Kinda how it's supposed to 

1451
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,461
be.
It's not supposed to be like these 

1452
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:53,461
hunters that lived there.
They got super spoiled because they were

1453
01:06:53,461 --> 01:06:55,820
used to like seeing hundreds of hours of
bed,

1454
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,880
like slide open the door and get the 
laser range finder out.

1455
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:03,340
Well,
especially if you're a rifle hunter,

1456
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:05,890
which a lot of them are.
There's way more rifle hunter.

1457
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:08,100
I can't get behind that.
I get behind me.

1458
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:09,090
I mean

1459
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,290
no,
I can't need meat.

1460
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,530
It's the way you did it.
I get it.

1461
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm saying me,
myself personally,

1462
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,880
it has no draw or interest whatsoever.
Yeah.

1463
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,390
Bow Hunting on the other hand,
now we're now we're talking.

1464
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:27,420
What's the difference to you?
One I absolutely suck at and the other 

1465
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:28,560
one,
uh,

1466
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:31,870
generally can hit what I'm aiming at and
it's easier with the rifle.

1467
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,900
Like wind is the perfect example.
You take a shot with a rifle in high 

1468
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,831
wind.
The wind when you're thinking of rifle 

1469
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:40,831
is from the ballistic effect of the 
round,

1470
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:45,150
you know,
left or right or in the temperature and 

1471
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:45,150
all that stuff.
When with a bow,

1472
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:49,800
your crawl on your belly.
And being a Ninja and then it's like 

1473
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,940
animals gone.
I got a completely different ball game.

1474
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,320
You could sit with a rifle with a cooler
and a bowl of Chili and get an elk.

1475
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:04,690
Well,
you know the other thing that gets me 

1476
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,180
with rifles and I don't think you should
make it any more difficult.

1477
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,280
That's not my point.
I think the most effective and efficient

1478
01:08:10,581 --> 01:08:13,040
and ethical way you should kill an 
animal should be the way you do it.

1479
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:16,070
But there's these pods that people have 
these that they set

1480
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,070
up a tripod with a bench.
It's essentially God like a mobile rifle

1481
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:25,820
bench sitting there on.
So it's got a you lena,

1482
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:30,821
like a lead sled attached.
You can just bring your finger in from 

1483
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:31,460
the outside and just bring it back and 
it doesn't move at all.

1484
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,870
You don't even have to have it in your 
shoulder.

1485
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,900
You lock it in place,
you screw it down so you have the 

1486
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:38,660
perfect angle.
You set it on the vitals and you squeeze

1487
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:41,720
it off and boom,
and exactly where you want it.

1488
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,750
In that setup,
you could actually not even have it 

1489
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,881
shoulder.
You could go sit in a chair to the side 

1490
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:49,010
of it and people do it all the time.
To be clear,

1491
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,860
I support hunting whether you want to,
however you want to do it.

1492
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,780
I'm a full fan.
For me personally,

1493
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:56,270
I just can't get into rifle hunting gets
too easy.

1494
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:01,580
If you put an elk anywhere from zero to 
1500 yards in front of me,

1495
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,380
it's game over Sun.
Right?

1496
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:05,450
Well,
you're an expert marksman though.

1497
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,310
I mean,
I would say I'm a marksman.

1498
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,870
I don't know if I would add expert to 
it,

1499
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:12,140
but I can sometimes hit things humble.
I missed.

1500
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:17,141
Sometimes I guess I'm good Miss Story,
but when you see an animal and you're 

1501
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:22,991
hunting with a bow,
so the thing is the difficulty and the 

1502
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:27,311
challenge and the connection to the 
animals way more intense because you're 

1503
01:09:27,311 --> 01:09:30,641
trying to get inside a 40 yards.
The whole thing to me is it's not a 

1504
01:09:30,641 --> 01:09:32,150
matter of how much I feel like I can do,
right?

1505
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:37,151
It's a matter of how few things I can 
mess up and I love fighting against the 

1506
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:42,851
odds like that.
I love the challenge of having to worry 

1507
01:09:42,851 --> 01:09:44,920
about not only cover and concealment and
you know,

1508
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:50,050
high ground versus low ground,
but shadows and light and moving and 

1509
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:54,131
noise inside of that moving and 
monitoring the wind and then the fact 

1510
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:54,950
that the animal might just want to go 
take a piss and you're screwed.

1511
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,300
You get the best stock in the woods.
I got,

1512
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:58,190
I gotta take a Wiz.
I love,

1513
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,130
I love the challenge of it and I suck at
it.

1514
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,150
So I,
I just,

1515
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:07,010
it is a draw to me that and my wife has 
already shaking her head at me.

1516
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,060
She's like,
God damn it.

1517
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:09,710
You're going hunting again.
Yeah.

1518
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,800
So I think for,
for some people they're.

1519
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:17,801
The issue that they have is that they 
think that killing an animal should not 

1520
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:20,180
be this pleasurable challenge that it 
should be.

1521
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:25,181
If you are going to eat animals,
you should be shooting him in the head 

1522
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:28,720
with a high powered rifle where you 
can't miss and they die instantaneously 

1523
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,860
and there's no suffering.
If only that situation actually existed.

1524
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,430
Well it can.
If you shoot them from five yards,

1525
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:39,550
well you know you missed some big 
targets with a rifle from pretty damn 

1526
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:39,550
close.

1527
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:40,550
How close?
Seven feet.

1528
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,240
Hey Man.
When you're running it through a hallway

1529
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,040
and stuff,
sometimes that's a different animal.

1530
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:49,340
It's a different animal both 
figuratively and literally.

1531
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:50,870
I missed,
you know,

1532
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:54,110
if there is no 100 percent solution,
that's true.

1533
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:59,140
I get it right.
But if an animal doesn't know you're 

1534
01:10:59,140 --> 01:10:59,970
there and you're setting up and it's 100
yard shot and you have a 30 year,

1535
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:03,170
you've done 300 win mag or you don't 
even need to get to 100 yards.

1536
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:05,190
Real estate,
you can be at 300 or $500.

1537
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:08,100
Whatever.
You feel comfortable shooting at a.

1538
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:11,840
If you want meat though.
Yeah,

1539
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,100
it's the way to go.
But also why not

1540
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,100
enjoy the experience?
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1541
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,351
with.
To me it's a challenge in more than a 

1542
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:21,780
challenge in of whatever it sounds gay,
but it's a journey.

1543
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,500
I,
I enjoy Sanga.

1544
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,230
I Dunno.
Just journeys.

1545
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:26,700
Okay.
It depends.

1546
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:31,701
I guess on the type of journey.
How do you feel about the Lord of the 

1547
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:32,520
rings was a journey.
It was a journey.

1548
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,340
I've watched all those movies about the 
books.

1549
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:38,520
I didn't read the books.
I want to go to New Zealand and jump off

1550
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:40,740
the cliffs in that movie.
Uh,

1551
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,820
but the,
the journey is like why not enjoy it?

1552
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,890
I enjoy,
I enjoy the struggle.

1553
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,920
I enjoy that.
It's hard to hit what you're aiming at 

1554
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,741
with a bow and exponentially more so 
that every time you add a yard to the 

1555
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:57,360
distance,
I enjoy that the animals are,

1556
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:02,540
they have instincts that are amazing and
that you cannot defeat their nose and 

1557
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,570
that you can't control the and joy all 
of that.

1558
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:08,900
That to me is I think,
and I'm enjoying that experience.

1559
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:12,120
And then again,
this is my first bow hunting season.

1560
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:17,121
I started bowhunting and late August,
so I have almost no experience under my 

1561
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,040
belt,
but I do enjoy the,

1562
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:23,100
the final aspect of that as well too,
in getting into position and being able 

1563
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,540
to perform in that moment.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1564
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,770
with enjoying killing an animal that 
you're doing so respectfully and like my

1565
01:12:28,771 --> 01:12:29,970
freezer right now,
my house,

1566
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:34,971
my goal is to never go to the grocery 
store and buy meat again for the entire 

1567
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:36,090
year and I think our freezer is full 
enough to do that.

1568
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,980
My kids love it.
I've made.

1569
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,880
I got maple elk sausage,
I got Italian elk sausage.

1570
01:12:41,881 --> 01:12:43,320
I got brought worst.
I get steaks.

1571
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:45,120
I got roast like we're not going to the 
grocery store.

1572
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,150
Yeah.
That to me like so why not enjoy that 

1573
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:52,521
whole process,
that whole story arc doing it ethically 

1574
01:12:52,521 --> 01:12:52,740
and enjoying the journey along.

1575
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,030
No,
I,

1576
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:58,031
I agree with you,
but I just wanted to hear you spell it 

1577
01:12:58,031 --> 01:13:00,660
out because that's the issue that a lot 
of people that are sort of in the animal

1578
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:05,661
rights activist side of things,
one of the things that they would have 

1579
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:05,661
an issue with is the enjoyment part of 
it,

1580
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:07,770
but I can't help it if some people are 
pussies.

1581
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:13,720
It's just the challenge of like doing 
things that are hard is enjoyable and 

1582
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,690
and succeeding at things that are 
difficult to do.

1583
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:19,930
It was also enjoyable.
Yeah.

1584
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:24,090
Why can't you be happy about winning?
Why can't you be happy about accepting a

1585
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:27,600
challenge willingly and nobody's forcing
you into it and when you're successful,

1586
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,960
you're not only happy with that success,
but you're happy with every step along 

1587
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:32,960
the way.
I don't see any problem with that.

1588
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,730
Well,
because they're Bernie Sanders 

1589
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:37,730
supporters.
I'm not qualified to talk on that topic.

1590
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,360
People are fucking with you right up 
until that point.

1591
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,560
I fucking love Bernie relaxed.
Joking around here folks.

1592
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

1593
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,240
I love it,
man.

1594
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,950
Even if you're not a hunter,
I mean,

1595
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:54,951
if someone doesn't want a Holland,
I think to take prolong trips to the 

1596
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:55,110
wilderness,
I think it's fucking great for you.

1597
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:58,710
I think I started doing it in 2012 and 
has changed my life.

1598
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,070
I whole heartedly agree.
I was dead serious when I say I don't 

1599
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,920
think he figured out who you are until 
you get into those environments.

1600
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,460
I have taken a sounding on the depth of 
who I am as a human being in the worst,

1601
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:12,250
most

1602
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,680
physically arduous moments of my life 
and I,

1603
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:18,490
and I wish that more people would 
willingly go to that point.

1604
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,180
I think that it would,
it changes my perspective for sure.

1605
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:27,450
It changes my appreciation for things.
Nothing will make you appreciate the 

1606
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:31,110
little things in your life more than 
nearly dying and having,

1607
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,130
you know,
and like,

1608
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:37,170
oh wow.
Like I have all of these things that I 

1609
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,170
wasn't paying attention to and people 
don't know that.

1610
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:39,280
People who didn't listen to your earlier
podcasts don't know your story.

1611
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:41,350
So tell,
tell people what happened when he almost

1612
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:46,351
died on the jumping side of the house.
Let's go to the military first and then 

1613
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:48,070
we'll go to the jumping side.
Yeah,

1614
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:49,900
I mean,
I don't know if it seems like to me like

1615
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,560
you might be supplementing your need for
danger with this jumping thing.

1616
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,140
Talk about how you described me as a 
psychopath.

1617
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,340
Every time you have this fucking Grazie 
nude,

1618
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,040
you,
you're crazy person that I know.

1619
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,280
Then I texted you that once and you 
responded that crazier than,

1620
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:07,930
you know,
I said I think on the.

1621
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,130
Yeah.
What?

1622
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,420
Yeah,
because like,

1623
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:16,080
well for one you willingly used to enter
into fights and you have said before 

1624
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:18,460
that you would have gone into the 
octagon and earlier age.

1625
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:21,370
To me that's insane.
It just,

1626
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:23,680
for whatever reason,
like going in there and did willingly go

1627
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:25,420
in and just getting into a fistfight 
with somebody.

1628
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,220
How much martial arts experience do you 
have?

1629
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,360
Exactly.
Zero.

1630
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,910
Yeah,
that's martial arts a lot.

1631
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:35,911
Like bowhunting.
How many of you got into base jumping 

1632
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:35,911
experience?
Do you have fucking zero.

1633
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,830
You're making my point zero on the 
ledger.

1634
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,320
Look at that fucking picture.
That suit got.

1635
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,260
Damn.
It looks weird.

1636
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,280
Fish islands,
Joe Thailand's.

1637
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,910
What I've been able to determine from my
jumping is that yes,

1638
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,160
people,
the world is round.

1639
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,050
You sought from the sky.
You could tell me.

1640
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,630
Sure when I jumped from pretty high.
Here's something you little curve.

1641
01:15:58,631 --> 01:16:01,720
Here's something that someone pointed 
out that's a really good point on,

1642
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:02,410
uh,
reiterate it.

1643
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,520
I retweeted it.
You could look at the moon with the 

1644
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,981
telescope.
I was going to go to the same place 

1645
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:10,981
because I read that.
Yeah,

1646
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:10,981
clearly.
Right folks.

1647
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:15,150
Okay.
Try to look and find Mount Everest with 

1648
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,400
a telescope and then explain why you 
can't.

1649
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:21,530
You can't because it's on the other side
of the fucking planet.

1650
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:26,050
You dummies crazy people.
It's so sad to me.

1651
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:28,840
It is.
People love mysteries though.

1652
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:30,820
They love things that are hidden,
hidden,

1653
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,200
hidden information.
Anyway,

1654
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:36,730
that's why the seal books right there.
You answered why people will buy because

1655
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:38,620
of that symbol they look at.
They're like,

1656
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,940
oh,
I want to know the secret.

1657
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,860
Of course it's.

1658
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,940
Yeah,
and there is no secret.

1659
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,740
That's what I.
that's the point I can get.

1660
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,920
I want to get to that definitely,
but what?

1661
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:52,410
How did almost martial art thing,
but the martial art thing I think is a 

1662
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,610
lot like the bow hunting thing and that 
it's very,

1663
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:58,000
very difficult and once you start doing 
it you get better at it and then you get

1664
01:16:58,001 --> 01:17:03,001
addicted to it and it's not crazy.
People like I'm not even talking about 

1665
01:17:03,001 --> 01:17:06,061
like actual competing and fighting,
but just training because when you're 

1666
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:07,480
training you're competing.
Like when you go onto the mat,

1667
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,380
you train,
you're trying to improve yourself,

1668
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:09,980
but you're also

1669
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,520
trying to tap someone who's trying to 
tap you and you go,

1670
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,560
you're both going at it and when you do 
it and you get better at it and you get 

1671
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:21,221
better at it,
you develop this kind of understanding 

1672
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:22,340
of what it is and it becomes this like 
very addictive thing.

1673
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:25,480
Like guys are addicted hard to Jujitsu.
Well,

1674
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:28,400
is it possible to master or is it a 
never ending evolution?

1675
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:33,490
Well,
you'll be a master in comparison to 

1676
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:33,490
someone who doesn't know what the fuck 
they're doing,

1677
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,310
but yeah,
we'll definitely.

1678
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,670
Physically,
the only problem is your body starts to 

1679
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,190
break down as you get into your older 
ages.

1680
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:45,191
Like most guys that I know that are in 
their forties and for sure in their 

1681
01:17:45,191 --> 01:17:48,701
fifties,
like I was in Hawaii recently with Ed 

1682
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,850
O'neil,
who's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.

1683
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:56,600
A lot of people don't know big Ed 
O'neill from married with children and a

1684
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,620
modern family.

1685
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:58,700
That guy,
he's a beast.

1686
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,850
Seriously?
Yes.

1687
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,670
Legit black belt in Jujitsu.
Under the gracies.

1688
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,470
Yeah.
Would have never guessed that.

1689
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:11,530
We'd never done so many fucks with them 
and getting thrown in their head and 

1690
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:11,750
choked unconscious.
But he was telling me this.

1691
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:16,780
He was there.
He is right there at o'neill black belt 

1692
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,660
training with Horian Gracie.
That what's the average journey to a 

1693
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:23,711
black belt years was I'd say 10.
Ten is average and that's grinding like 

1694
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,910
getting after.
Not Thursday.

1695
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:26,960
Every other week.
Yeah.

1696
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,110
But some,
some people get there quicker than 10.

1697
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,240
You know,
Bj Penn got his three.

1698
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:36,320
I was a brown belt for eight years.
Eight years of brown belt.

1699
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,850
I like your stone job.
I was fuming.

1700
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:43,870
I can train together.
Let's train him like twice a week and 

1701
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:43,870
you know,
trying to have a career,

1702
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,740
but you know,
for,

1703
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:50,330
for the people that really get into it,
they really get obsessed with it.

1704
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,600
It becomes just as addictive as archery,
hunting.

1705
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:54,910
Anything else?
It's.

1706
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:00,040
I and I think what we were talking about
earlier when we were talking about 

1707
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,891
people being angry and like on social 
media because they're not getting those 

1708
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:09,161
natural rewards and the natural struggle
of life and their life is very muted in 

1709
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,220
that regard.
No struggle or no struggle.

1710
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:15,250
I think that's one of the reasons why 
Jujitsu is so appealing to people and 

1711
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,600
even though you get injured in Jujitsu,
but most of the injuries like a tweak my

1712
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:20,540
back or I fucked up my elbow or my knee 
gets screwed up.

1713
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:25,570
It's not like brain injuries.
The brain injuries were the ones that 

1714
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:25,870
were the most disturbing to me because I
was.

1715
01:19:25,871 --> 01:19:29,540
I was recognizing at like 21 that I was 
having some issues.

1716
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,190
You were talking about this recently 
about this,

1717
01:19:31,191 --> 01:19:32,480
the headaches laying in bed.

1718
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,880
I have and I know a lot of guys from 
previous career who are suffering from 

1719
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:43,150
we're discovering or the military is 
doing research into the causes of the 

1720
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,550
brain injury issue.
It's not.

1721
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:51,610
It's not awesome to read your future 
when you get diagnosed with that and 

1722
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:51,610
like,
okay,

1723
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:54,340
so what does it look like when I'm 60?
What does it look like when I'm 78,

1724
01:19:54,341 --> 01:19:56,090
late?
That's not good at all.

1725
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:59,090
Those aren't good Tarot cards to read.
My good friend Dr.

1726
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:04,180
Mark Gordon,
who is an expert in traumatic brain 

1727
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,020
injury and does a lot of work with 
soldiers and uh,

1728
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,220
Andrew Morris Foundation,
he

1729
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,580
has a warrior Angel Foundation and Dr 
Gordon does a lot of work with him and 

1730
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:18,531
they,
they have developed some really good 

1731
01:20:18,531 --> 01:20:21,921
protocols for helping guys and these 
helped a shit ton of guys and he does a 

1732
01:20:21,921 --> 01:20:25,500
lot of the work for like nothing.
Just trying to help as many people as he

1733
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,300
can because you know,
he's,

1734
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,640
he's,
he's doing well financially,

1735
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:30,180
you know,
he doesn't,

1736
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:33,060
he's not desperate for money to eat.
He does a lot of charity works.

1737
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:38,061
My point.
He's dedicated a significant amount of 

1738
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:41,700
his professional time to try to find 
solutions for soldiers.

1739
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:46,701
And also he's done a lot of work with 
football players and boxers and 

1740
01:20:46,701 --> 01:20:47,960
fighters.
Anybody who's going to get that enclosed

1741
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:52,970
brain trauma it at the end of the day,
I think on the chart it ends up looking 

1742
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,400
the same.
It doesn't matter how he necessarily got

1743
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:58,401
it.
The UFC is in involved in some new 

1744
01:20:58,401 --> 01:20:58,401
protocols now too.

1745
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:02,050
They.
They've developed some stuff in San 

1746
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:02,050
Diego.
In fact,

1747
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,620
I forget what the.
A medical institution that's doing it,

1748
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:09,890
but they've got something.
They're dealing with some sort of 

1749
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,890
electro magnetic therapy,
magnetic resonation with touch.

1750
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:15,570
I have heard there is a.
It may well be the same clinic.

1751
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,960
There's a couple of buddies that I have 
who came to San Diego,

1752
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:24,020
La Jolla area.
They would go in once a day or twice a 

1753
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,291
day for a quick session.
I'm pretty sure it was magnets placed 

1754
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:27,291
either across from each other,
whatever.

1755
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:31,881
It was a protocol.
I think it was for a month and to a 

1756
01:21:31,881 --> 01:21:35,961
person.
They all actually said that they had a 

1757
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:36,810
significant benefit,
whether that be.

1758
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,840
Most of them were saying they were 
sleeping better and I don't know the 

1759
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,140
causality or correlation there,
but they had improvement.

1760
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:45,330
It could have been their mood function,
whatever it may be,

1761
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,840
but so how did the fighters,
what do they think about if you get 

1762
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,770
knocked out in the UFC,
like you're just flatlined,

1763
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,750
do you have a minimum amount of time 
before you can back?

1764
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,650
I think most of the time they give them 
a 90 day suspension,

1765
01:21:58,651 --> 01:22:01,260
which in my opinion is way too short.
I was going to.

1766
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,520
Yeah,
because first of all they say like 90 

1767
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:06,520
days,
no contact,

1768
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,110
but those guys are going to be sparring 
before then.

1769
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,130
That is the issue that I've heard with 
some of the active duty guys now.

1770
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:16,131
They'll go in and from a perspective 
that they kind of want to preempt and 

1771
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,240
get an idea of where their head is at 
currently.

1772
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:20,490
They'll go in and they'll get a scan or 
however they.

1773
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,790
They couldn't give me the scans because 
I have retained metal in my body,

1774
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:29,180
but I think a lot of it is based off of 
Mris and the magnets and stuff and 

1775
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:33,590
they'll recognize that they have the 
precursors or they'll.

1776
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,420
They'll have damage to their head and 
the guys,

1777
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,640
they don't want to take any time off.

1778
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,960
They went,
just want to get back into it.

1779
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:40,330
It's,
it's,

1780
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,370
it's a struggle.
They're like,

1781
01:22:41,371 --> 01:22:41,970
hey,
listen,

1782
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,520
this is could be what it could look like
for you in the coming years.

1783
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:45,330
And the guy's like,
yeah,

1784
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,520
I get it,
but put me back in coach.

1785
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,010
It's a struggle to get them to take time
off,

1786
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,530
which that doesn't surprise me that the 
UFC guys were the same way.

1787
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,140
No,
that's,

1788
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:56,130
that's absolutely the way they are.
Especially the real savages.

1789
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:58,410
The ones where the winners like Michael 
Bisping,

1790
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:03,750
you know,
he lost the George St Pierre and then 

1791
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,411
three weeks later fought against Calvin 
gasoline and got stopped and a lot of 

1792
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:06,411
people criticize

1793
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:07,000
that,
me included,

1794
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:09,300
and they shouldn't let them in there.
You know what I mean?

1795
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:11,700
He needs time to recover.
You got battered in that fight,

1796
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:16,710
got choked unconscious.
Then you've got them fighting again 

1797
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:16,710
three weeks later.
It's just not smart,

1798
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:16,710
but he

1799
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:21,290
probably a not knowing a thing about it.
Fought tooth and nail to get into that 

1800
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:25,671
ring with you.
I guess 102 weeks later it's a fucking 

1801
01:23:25,671 --> 01:23:29,481
animal until you're,
until you're done 60 and then you're 

1802
01:23:29,481 --> 01:23:30,450
drooling on yourself and you know,
you're thinking or the Easter bunny.

1803
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:31,570
I mean,
that's not,

1804
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,430
that's not a good look.

1805
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,320
No.
And it's possible.

1806
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,520
Yeah,
for sure.

1807
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:40,850
Yeah.
You have to almost protect people from 

1808
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,191
themselves or may be.
There could be an argument that there 

1809
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:47,961
should be sort of a comprehensive 
education for fighters at least because 

1810
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:48,750
this is an elective thing,
right?

1811
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,660
And which you're definitely going to get
hit for soldiers.

1812
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:58,530
My good argument as well,
but there should be some sort of 

1813
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:00,700
elective or uh,
you know,

1814
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:03,540
um,
some sort of an education thing.

1815
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:08,520
That's the word I was going to say.
At least at least educate to the,

1816
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,760
just go in,
go into whatever situation you're going 

1817
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,951
to go into,
whether it's the UFC or the nfl or the 

1818
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:18,320
military,
whatever it just go in with an educated 

1819
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:18,320
perspective instead of going in blank 
and,

1820
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,690
and at the end of it not understanding 
where you're at and why it happened.

1821
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,060
So what do you think it is that makes 
you want to jump out of planes?

1822
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:27,070
Perfectly.
Good.

1823
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:31,450
Airplane.
You put a squirrel suit on a.

1824
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,550
do you think this is what I asked you 
before?

1825
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:38,551
Do you think that this is like your 
fulfilling some sort of a desire for 

1826
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,270
excitement?
Some.

1827
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,660
Some need for extreme situations?
Well,

1828
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:48,640
so skydiving,
jumping out of an airplane,

1829
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:52,090
is it to me,
if you,

1830
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:57,230
if you follow some very basic principles
of being current and maintaining your 

1831
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:00,300
gear and taking your time to pack your 
parachute the most difficult or not most

1832
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:05,301
difficult.
The most dangerous portion of a day 

1833
01:25:05,301 --> 01:25:06,340
skydiving will be your drive to the drop
zone and your drive home from,

1834
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:11,341
uh,
what happens to those people that fuck 

1835
01:25:11,341 --> 01:25:11,341
up and die?
Well,

1836
01:25:11,341 --> 01:25:11,341
there's two.
So you get a separate two categories.

1837
01:25:11,341 --> 01:25:16,071
There's jumping out of an airplane with 
a parachute and a reserve parachute and 

1838
01:25:16,071 --> 01:25:20,841
a lot of altitude and a lot of time.
And then there's base jumping which is 

1839
01:25:20,841 --> 01:25:24,681
off of a static object with one 
parachute generally closer to the 

1840
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:25,980
ground.
And that lack of altitude and separation

1841
01:25:25,981 --> 01:25:28,410
from the ground gives you less time,
less options.

1842
01:25:28,411 --> 01:25:31,920
You got to be really tight on your,
a game in both of those worlds.

1843
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:35,760
What I think in my opinion is that kills
the most people is complacency.

1844
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:41,270
There has not been a gear related 
fatality is far back as I can really 

1845
01:25:41,611 --> 01:25:43,890
find it,
at least in the last 10 to 15 years.

1846
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:46,290
It's people killing themselves,
not the gear killing them.

1847
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:47,640
How's that work?
What do you mean?

1848
01:25:47,641 --> 01:25:49,600
How did they kill themselves?
Uh,

1849
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:55,820
getting in over your head,
attempting a maneuver that you have no 

1850
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:56,820
ability to recover from if it were to go
wrong,

1851
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,200
uh,
in the skydiving world.

1852
01:25:58,201 --> 01:26:01,080
So to use the,
the wingsuit as an example,

1853
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:06,050
if you keep the suit flying straight,
it feels incredibly stable.

1854
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:07,610
It feels like you're laying in an air 
mattress.

1855
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:12,611
It's not hard at all that you literally 
get out of the aircraft and you spread 

1856
01:26:12,611 --> 01:26:15,671
your arms and legs out.
There's Ram air inlets that inflate the 

1857
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,731
suit and you can lay on it.
You can literally just relax and lay in 

1858
01:26:18,731 --> 01:26:21,311
the suit and you'd fly at 60 percent of 
your performance to make up a number 

1859
01:26:21,311 --> 01:26:24,140
that's probably somewhat accurate,
but then you know,

1860
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:26,990
maybe you want a flat on your back,
you know Jesus.

1861
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,060
Then maybe you want to fly next to 
people.

1862
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:34,330
Then maybe you want to do an intricate 
formation that's both vertically and 

1863
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:36,360
horizontally separated.
I've heard of people colliding while Sky

1864
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,520
Dot yes.
Has catastrophic results.

1865
01:26:38,521 --> 01:26:40,670
Like Louise get ripped off a.
yeah.

1866
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:45,671
There was a pair of Golden Knights that 
guide to capitate and it didn't 

1867
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:45,950
decapitate the guy from the pelvis down.
Cut off both legs,

1868
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,850
but you can get yourself going 100 miles
an hour forward speed.

1869
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:51,870
So you got off both.
Yup.

1870
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:55,650
What hit his head?
Hit his shoulder head is a,

1871
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,700
I believe the lower portion of his legs.
And what happened to the guys shoulder?

1872
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:03,230
He had a vacation in the hospital for a 
little bit and the other guy died.

1873
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,680
Yeah.
Actually knew what I think.

1874
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,870
I might be wrong on that.
I think the dude with no legs,

1875
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,090
I think the dude with no legs is the one
who lived because he jumped again.

1876
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,070
The guy who hit him is the one that 
died.

1877
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:19,100
Fuck,
it's a.

1878
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,930
it's jumped again after that.
Yeah,

1879
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,250
nearly.
Yeah,

1880
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:23,210
of course.
Of course he did.

1881
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:28,570
It's like when you text me like,
would you do this shit and France into 

1882
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:28,570
the planet?
I'm like,

1883
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,000
don't ask me rhetorical questions.
I'm gonna.

1884
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,280
Ask you a guy was trying to get into the
plane.

1885
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,350
He was doing the squirrel suit into the 
plane,

1886
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:34,430
but he missed.
Yeah.

1887
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:39,470
Sometimes you miss.
He bounced off the plane and it didn't 

1888
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,711
look good,
so that was a the same red bull dudes 

1889
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:44,300
and that is probably the worst situation
you could get into because you could see

1890
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:47,990
he was spinning in the suit and that is 
how you can kill yourself in a wing suit

1891
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:51,800
if you try some crazy maneuver that 
you're not capable of doing,

1892
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:57,090
essentially stole the suit and then you 
end up on your back spinning out of 

1893
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:57,090
control.

1894
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,730
You'll black out in,
you know,

1895
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,940
whatever happens happens.
What happened to that guy that bounced 

1896
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:03,940
off the plane?
He pulled it out.

1897
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:04,610
He did.
He did.

1898
01:28:04,611 --> 01:28:06,410
Because you know later on that day.
Yeah.

1899
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,950
I mean,
but those.

1900
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:09,890
So that guy that is fred invents their 
red bull dudes,

1901
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:14,910
they are at the absolute apex of what's 
possible and yeah,

1902
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:20,350
I mean he hit it.
He was able to recover because later in 

1903
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:20,350
that video they were both able to 
successfully get in,

1904
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:25,301
but that guy has been jumping for 
decades in tens of thousands of jumps.

1905
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,390
So of course he can recover from that.
If you've got 10 jumps,

1906
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:32,930
you're dead.
But the problem is people see that video

1907
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:35,090
and they're like,
I know what I'm doing on Thursday,

1908
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:39,050
and he died.
They do stupid shit and they're not.

1909
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:44,080
They're not aware of their ability or 
their skill or they're just not looking 

1910
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,450
in the mirror and being honest with 
themselves.

1911
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:49,780
They attempt something crazy,
but most common in skydiving thing is 

1912
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,290
somebody to die under perfectly 
functioning equipment.

1913
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:56,640
They'll have a really small main canopy,
like most main canopy.

1914
01:28:56,641 --> 01:29:01,641
The canopy or suspended under in your 
harness when you're learning is about 

1915
01:29:01,641 --> 01:29:03,450
300 to 360 feet.
It's like driving a school bus.

1916
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,850
It really slow turns.
It doesn't dive,

1917
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,600
and a lot of people try to get to these 
little postage stamp parachutes.

1918
01:29:11,611 --> 01:29:14,520
There are 71 square feet,
69 square feet,

1919
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,880
and in those canopies,
if you initiate a turn,

1920
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,610
regardless of what you do after that 
turn,

1921
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:25,640
you cannot pull the canopy out of the 
dive until it goes through its natural 

1922
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:29,601
recovery arc,
so if you initiate that turn 300 feet 

1923
01:29:29,601 --> 01:29:30,120
low,
you're done.

1924
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You'd be.
You'd be lucky to walk away with a set 

1925
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,301
of powdered femurs,
which is exciting to watch from the 

1926
01:29:38,301 --> 01:29:40,761
ground.
It's a very interesting noise to hear 

1927
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:40,761
happen.

1928
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:42,630
That's best case scenario.
Middle of the ground would be wheelchair

1929
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:44,340
with a colostomy bag for the rest of 
your life.

1930
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:49,341
Worst case scenario,
you're getting carted off in an 

1931
01:29:49,341 --> 01:29:50,670
ambulance and you're dead and it's just 
a rush to get to that super small canopy

1932
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,510
or you just started jumping,
so this is like a status thing.

1933
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:57,780
Guys want to show you that they're 
jumping on the super small up.

1934
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:02,940
You ever see people in the mixed martial
arts world who just started and they 

1935
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:02,980
think they're ready for the cage?
Yes.

1936
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:06,150
It's the exact same thing.
I bet you would happens in Motorcross as

1937
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,720
surfing guy learns to serve as like 
north shore.

1938
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:11,250
Let's go like.
Excuse me,

1939
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:16,251
sir.
You're using a foam surfboard that's 12 

1940
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:16,251
feet long to go to the north shore.
You're going to die,

1941
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:18,720
but nothing you say to them easier to 
use a foam on this 12 feet long.

1942
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:23,810
I don't know.
I don't know where it came from that 

1943
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:23,810
from probably on a smaller way.
Maybe I should get a foam surfboard,

1944
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:26,910
but I think I think either way though on
the north shore they're going to die,

1945
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,710
but to you try to tell that to that 
person.

1946
01:30:28,711 --> 01:30:31,130
They don't want to hear it.
They're ready and not only that,

1947
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:36,140
they're ready.
I need to go to best buy and get about 

1948
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,241
four Gopros and then we're going to send
this thing and you're dead and it 

1949
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:41,130
presents this and it creates this.
That's what I like.

1950
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:46,150
Uh,
I don't like to talk about the risk 

1951
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:46,150
necessarily because there are,
there is,

1952
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:50,571
in my opinion,
a community of people that really 

1953
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:53,151
romanticize that risk and they define 
themselves by that risk or that's not 

1954
01:30:53,151 --> 01:30:53,370
for me.
That's not what I'm looking for at all.

1955
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,710
But when it comes to skydiving,
it's just fun,

1956
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:56,040
man.

1957
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:00,420
I cannot not smile when I'm flying that 
wingsuit.

1958
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,360
You're doing 120 miles an hour forward 
face first.

1959
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,280
They've got a bug in the mug.
Oh yeah.

1960
01:31:05,281 --> 01:31:10,281
You'll come down to speckled all sorts.
I've almost hit a bird base jumping in 

1961
01:31:10,281 --> 01:31:10,281
Switzerland,
like it's just,

1962
01:31:10,281 --> 01:31:10,281
Oh yeah,
it's.

1963
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:15,770
But again,
there's a difference between skydiving 

1964
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,661
and base jumping.
Skydiving is if you have enough 

1965
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:20,781
experience and you learned that you can 
handle with most likely what's going to 

1966
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:21,390
come up,
you can just focus on having fun.

1967
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:23,790
Base jumping is a different activity for
sure.

1968
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:27,360
It looks the same.
It's a different sport,

1969
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,070
different act.
I don't even call it a sport.

1970
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:34,071
It's an activity.
How many guys have you seen die base 

1971
01:31:34,071 --> 01:31:37,881
jumping,
skydiving in a squirrel suit?

1972
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:39,000
Actually,
not that many.

1973
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:44,040
I have seen more people die under the 
super small canopies turning to low and 

1974
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,180
just impacting the ground.

1975
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:50,780
I mean it's,
it's a sight to be seen where the 

1976
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:53,160
candidates in such a steep dive,
like as you're the canopies up top,

1977
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:56,250
as your pitch over your body is actually
above the canopy,

1978
01:31:56,251 --> 01:31:58,530
so it hits and they them into the 
ground.

1979
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,990
It's a,
it's like a wet,

1980
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,700
wet meat on concrete it,
you know.

1981
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:08,701
Exactly.
And you can hear it coming because the 

1982
01:32:08,701 --> 01:32:10,501
canopy is whistle.
The lines that suspend you underneath 

1983
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:11,340
the canopy that are cutting through the 
air and you just hear it.

1984
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:14,630
You look up and then Wham,
uh,

1985
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:19,860
as far as actually physically watching 
people go in May too,

1986
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,330
I think.
But you know,

1987
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:25,450
my last trip to Switzerland in 2016 last
year,

1988
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:31,260
I was in a,
in the valley with my buddy Alex and we 

1989
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:31,840
were there for two weeks and 15 people 
when in 15.

1990
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:35,650
Yep.
Now how many people were there that it's

1991
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:36,190
hard to say.

1992
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,240
And that's why,
again,

1993
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:42,241
I think you have to be careful talking 
about the stats and the risk because I 

1994
01:32:42,241 --> 01:32:43,630
don't really know how many people 
partake in that activity,

1995
01:32:43,631 --> 01:32:45,280
but I can tell you this,
of those 15,

1996
01:32:45,281 --> 01:32:46,390
zero,
we're gear related,

1997
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,960
not a single one was because their gear 
failed.

1998
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:55,650
It was in my opinion,
somebody attempting or just living there

1999
01:32:55,660 --> 01:33:00,660
or walking on a razor blade and 
sometimes when I go over there I'll I 

2000
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:02,770
will do that as well.
I'll fly close to the ground or I'll fly

2001
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:07,771
in between.
Trees were all fly through a crack and 

2002
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:07,771
mess around with that.
But I,

2003
01:33:07,771 --> 01:33:09,760
I try to do it on a very limited time 
period.

2004
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:14,761
I try to have outs and I try to work my 
way into that position and what I have 

2005
01:33:14,761 --> 01:33:15,700
seen personally,
which doesn't mean that this.

2006
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:20,710
This is the norm.
What I have personally seen with my own 

2007
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:23,161
eyes is people that don't take that 
route and they want to go straight to 

2008
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:23,161
just,
hey,

2009
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:25,920
hold my beer and there's just no room 
for air.

2010
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,600
Yeah.
That's a lot of people though.

2011
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:29,380
Like W,
w,

2012
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,530
w,
what percentage of the people don't 

2013
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:34,530
like,
how many people were there?

2014
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:34,530
I don't know.
Probably a couple hundred as far.

2015
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:37,360
Oh Jesus.
Well that's just 115 people.

2016
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:40,630
Croaked yeah,
that's a lot.

2017
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:45,220
That's a login.
I tried it.

2018
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,300
Again,
I try to be honest.

2019
01:33:46,301 --> 01:33:48,970
I accept the activity.
Here's my thing.

2020
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:53,971
I don't ever want to gamble but I am 
willing to take risk and I know that 

2021
01:33:53,971 --> 01:33:57,301
that activity has some risk associated 
with it but for me personally the 

2022
01:33:57,301 --> 01:34:00,901
benefit outweighs the risk and I also 
spend most of my year trying to put in 

2023
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,050
place things that can mitigate that 
risk.

2024
01:34:02,051 --> 01:34:07,051
Like jumping all the time and being 
current in my suit and I like I'll walk 

2025
01:34:07,051 --> 01:34:11,221
away but I've been at plenty of exit 
points where the weather wasn't good or 

2026
01:34:11,221 --> 01:34:12,100
the wind wasn't good or I just wasn't 
feeling it.

2027
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:17,190
And I think a lot of other peanut pool 
probably had the same feelings and 

2028
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:17,190
there's zipping up their suit,
getting ready to go.

2029
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:18,460
And I'm like,
peace out man.

2030
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:23,461
I'll see you later.
I'm going go drink a bottle of red wine 

2031
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:23,461
and you know,
have a glass.

2032
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:23,461
Yeah,
I don't,

2033
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:27,720
I don't,
I would love to be the base jumper that 

2034
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:28,240
has walked away from more exits than 
anybody else on earth.

2035
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:33,241
More than I would like to be the base 
jumper that's done more extreme shit 

2036
01:34:33,241 --> 01:34:36,150
than anybody else on earth.
Like how many times you think you've 

2037
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,251
walked away,
how many times have you gotten to a 

2038
01:34:38,251 --> 01:34:38,251
situation where you're at the starting 
line?

2039
01:34:38,251 --> 01:34:38,251
You're like,
this doesn't feel right.

2040
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,180
15,
20.

2041
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,410
Wow.
And some of those things will give you a

2042
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:43,300
two hour hike on the way down,
you know?

2043
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:48,320
And I kinda don't want to hike down.
That's what gets a lot of people too is 

2044
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,320
they'll get,
they'll,

2045
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,410
there's a lot of hiking involved,
like the youtube videos.

2046
01:34:50,411 --> 01:34:52,810
That's about five percent of what it 
actually takes.

2047
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:58,110
My favorite jump in Switzerland is about
a two and a half to a three hour walk 

2048
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:58,110
for a 92nd flight.

2049
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:02,510
So the ratio of busting your ass to 
smiling is very askew.

2050
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:07,540
It's like Disneyland pretty much,
except it's actually fun and it's not 

2051
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,410
full of pedophiles.
So does anyone else feel a pedophile?

2052
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,150
Of course really working.
The kids are.

2053
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,220
Where would you go if you were a 
pedophile?

2054
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,260
And think of it that way.
Come on now.

2055
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:16,850
It's like being a freak and go into the 
Strip club.

2056
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,350
Come on.
There you go.

2057
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:23,540
You know what kills me about Disneyland?
My kids love Disneyland,

2058
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:26,750
so we go there quite often.
There's these gangs,

2059
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,630
Disneyland gangs.
Have you ever seen them before?

2060
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:34,950
What are you talking?
They were vests like they're in the 

2061
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,210
hell's angels and their vests are 
covered with a Disneyland buttons and 

2062
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:39,370
Patches and Disneyland Employees.
You're talking about?

2063
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:44,510
Oh No.
These are gangs of Disneyland fans and 

2064
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:49,661
they used to have entry a admission 
things where like to get in there there 

2065
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:50,660
see the Disneyland gangs.

2066
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:55,720
Do you remember what I was saying?
His empire a second ago about the 

2067
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:55,720
pedophiles?
Yeah.

2068
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,050
Hitchhikers.
Disneyland Waltz,

2069
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,700
misfits.
So cow.

2070
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,190
Yeah,
with a skull with Disneyland hat on.

2071
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,900
And these people go in there.
They have a things that would have.

2072
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
They would have to have like little 
things too that they would have to 

2073
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,730
accomplish to get entry into these 
gangs.

2074
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,540
And one of the things was they would 
have to have one of the rides go down so

2075
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:19,541
they'd have to make a ride go down in 
order to get entry into this stupid 

2076
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:20,600
fucking gang.
How does one do that?

2077
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:24,290
Throw something into the gears.
That's good.

2078
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,420
Thank you for that.
When we were there,

2079
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:31,190
this one dumb lady,
this is how fucking geniuses dummy was.

2080
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,480
California screaming is the roller 
coaster where you do that loop where you

2081
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:36,720
go upside down.
Okay.

2082
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:38,480
On the top of the loop.

2083
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,430
This dummy through her purse and wanted 
to catch it on the way down.

2084
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:46,820
Like she had this idea how that work.
It didn't work.

2085
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:50,690
It hit the ground.
The it hit first.

2086
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:55,780
The rollercoaster ran over,
it stopped the rollercoaster and they 

2087
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:57,320
got stuck like three quarters of the way
up through loop.

2088
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:00,700
And you know everybody's like yet,
yeah,

2089
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,050
they stopped the rollercoaster.
She went to jail.

2090
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:05,090
Another you want to hear something 
really gross.

2091
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,930
One couple.
They had a two year old kid and they 

2092
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:11,000
caught them on security cam after the 
fact.

2093
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:16,300
They hung back and they put their kid 
near a Disneyland employee and they 

2094
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:17,190
went,
uh,

2095
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,580
went away and stepped away.
So the kid was like,

2096
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:24,581
confused in what to do.
So this Disneyland employee kept an eye 

2097
01:37:24,581 --> 01:37:27,941
on the kid and then called security and 
the security took care of the kid and 

2098
01:37:27,941 --> 01:37:31,181
then they went to dinner and they had 
drinks and they went out and then they 

2099
01:37:31,181 --> 01:37:32,510
went and retrieved a kid afterwards.
Security.

2100
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:36,740
Not everybody should have kids,
but just imagine the monster.

2101
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:39,230
Do you have to be to take your two year 
old kid?

2102
01:37:39,231 --> 01:37:40,400
You're like,
I'm tired of having this kid.

2103
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:41,480
Hey,
I've got a great idea.

2104
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,160
Oh,
I'm sure their home life is amazing.

2105
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:46,430
Very nourishing monsters,
man.

2106
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:51,990
And you wonder,
like when you see a school shooting or 

2107
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:52,970
something crazy like what happened?
This kind of shit does.

2108
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:56,130
You're raising a potential human being.
This kind of shit happens.

2109
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:00,060
You have some fucking morons.
They're allowed to have kids.

2110
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,140
And then basically shit shit on an 
innocent victim,

2111
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:06,250
which is my biggest issue with it.
Yeah.

2112
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:11,510
I cannot,
I don't like the victimization of 

2113
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,510
innocent people.
It drives me nuts.

2114
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,510
Yeah,
man,

2115
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:14,130
especially little two year olds,
it's crazy.

2116
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:19,460
It's crazy that someone has that in them
that they could be that fucking stupid 

2117
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,810
that they have that in them and you 
know,

2118
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,790
I wish that this was an isolated 
instance.

2119
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:25,350
I'm sure there's like quite a few of 
those.

2120
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:31,970
I'm sure there probably is.
I can't believe you're drinking that 

2121
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:31,970
Kombucha stuff.
That's good.

2122
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:31,970
I love it.
It doesn't.

2123
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:34,050
The Brian Brain do the same thing for 
your gut.

2124
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,790
No,
no.

2125
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,070
That's a nootropic and the right brain 
is alcohol.

2126
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:40,560
It's probably bad for your gut.
I'm trying to counteract the effects.

2127
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:46,190
I had a sense of Kimchi either.
Absolutely not from for the mind,

2128
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:52,070
spent some time in Korea and watch this 
guys pulling that stuff out of the 

2129
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,070
ground and they would offer.

2130
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,070
It's like,
I'm,

2131
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,790
no,
I don't want to Kimchi.

2132
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:58,850
I'm more convinced now than ever that.
Plus having a bunch of really good 

2133
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:03,591
podcasts,
guests that explained the benefits of 

2134
01:39:03,591 --> 01:39:06,150
probiotics and about how probiotics 
literally affect your gut ecosystem that

2135
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:11,151
affects your personality and your immune
system and just all sorts of different 

2136
01:39:11,151 --> 01:39:14,700
aspects of your life.
But I've been eating Kimchi sheet almost

2137
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:18,330
when I'm at home daily.
Pretty much daily food by itself.

2138
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,380
One,
pair it with a meal,

2139
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:24,500
a pair it with a meal usually,
but sometimes I'll just open up a jar 

2140
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,710
and just eat a whole jar of the shit.
That's disgusting.

2141
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,840
Don't do books.
Today I had Kimchi with elk and 

2142
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:35,970
Jalapenos and uh,
some stuff called no bread.

2143
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:39,690
Knows a company that makes k n,
O,

2144
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:44,691
w.
They make these gluten free breads that 

2145
01:39:44,691 --> 01:39:48,381
are made with nuts and almonds.
And how's it taste good?

2146
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:51,030
It's actually tastes good.
No,

2147
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:54,720
not totally.
Not like a good piece of San Francisco.

2148
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:56,550
Sour dough bread does not taste like 
that,

2149
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:59,160
but that's what it tastes like,
but it tastes good enough.

2150
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:01,680
It's good for me.
And most importantly,

2151
01:40:01,681 --> 01:40:04,200
it doesn't Jack up your glycaemic index.
It doesn't,

2152
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,120
you know,
you don't have an insulin spike.

2153
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,580
You feel good after you eat it,
you still,

2154
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:10,380
uh,
you still reading the Quito train?

2155
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:13,380
Most of the time I will fuck off on 
occasion.

2156
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,450
I will fuck off.
I fucked off all.

2157
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:18,070
Last week I was in Hawaii and I fucked 
off hard.

2158
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,590
Thanksgiving was an interesting 
adventure diet for me too.

2159
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,910
I drank every night a dessert every day 
I ate whatever I wanted.

2160
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:28,080
I said,
I'm on vacation.

2161
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:33,320
I'm going to treat this like a vacation.
I'm going to have no restraint and I'm 

2162
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,010
only gonna gain four pounds.
And I worked out every day.

2163
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:40,700
I worked at every day.
Why does it only take one week to 

2164
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,100
unravel what seems like a lifetime of 
work.

2165
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,030
And then you start climbing back into 
the saddle,

2166
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:43,590
like,
okay,

2167
01:40:43,591 --> 01:40:45,630
cool.
I guess I'll just move an inch at a time

2168
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:48,660
here in the last two miles along the 
way.

2169
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,800
Well,
the good news is I kept working out so 

2170
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,520
it wasn't like I came back home like 
terribly out of shape,

2171
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:57,070
feeling terrible and having gotten drunk
every night.

2172
01:40:57,071 --> 01:41:02,071
I bet if I didn't work every day,
I probably would have gained like seven 

2173
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:02,071
or eight pounds.
Oh,

2174
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:06,660
100 percent,
you'd probably at least still kept your 

2175
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:06,660
metabolism.
Metabolism of the high.

2176
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:07,780
Yeah,
but I was like,

2177
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,270
this is what I'm going do.
I'm gonna treat it like this.

2178
01:41:10,271 --> 01:41:12,430
I'm going to work out every day so that 
I don't have to think about it,

2179
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:15,580
so I could just go crazy.
You're managing guilt?

2180
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:16,890
Yeah,
I eat.

2181
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:22,190
I ate breakfast one day and uh,
we stayed at this place that had a 

2182
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:26,071
buffet and they had chocolate croissants
I had for chocolate croissants and then 

2183
01:41:26,071 --> 01:41:30,130
I had two pieces of banana bread and I 
had to sticky buns,

2184
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,900
these sticky buns.
Then.

2185
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:34,630
Then I had all sorts of other food on 
top of that.

2186
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:37,450
I just ate like a,
like a glutton.

2187
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,700
Isn't that amazing?
I don't usually do that.

2188
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:42,250
So it was nice to do it for a vacation.
Amazing.

2189
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,600
For a day or two.
Yeah.

2190
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:45,880
But I felt so weak,
like when I would go to the gym,

2191
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:48,070
I literally felt like it was working out
underwater.

2192
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,400
Like my brother just combating all the 
booze and all the shitty food.

2193
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,980
Would that.
Or I'll find my gas tank is just done.

2194
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:55,780
Like you start,
you normally like,

2195
01:41:55,781 --> 01:42:00,781
okay,
I'm going to warm up and you're just 

2196
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:00,781
like,
oh yeah,

2197
01:42:00,781 --> 01:42:01,090
I think I'm done here,
let's place that a heavy bag.

2198
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:06,270
And I knew they had a heavy bag so I 
bought boxing gloves and hand wraps and 

2199
01:42:06,270 --> 01:42:09,991
everything and I have a timer on my 
phone so I set the timer up and I just 

2200
01:42:09,991 --> 01:42:13,111
wailed away.
It's fucking great because you know 

2201
01:42:13,111 --> 01:42:15,031
those apple ear pods pod,
probably the best apple not to make an 

2202
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:16,630
ad for apple.
Probably the best thing I've ever bought

2203
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,790
from apple.
Airpods are great.

2204
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:20,290
And here's the thing,
when you have a um,

2205
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:25,970
this timer,
it would play me music but then the 

2206
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:26,260
timer,
like the noise of the time,

2207
01:42:26,261 --> 01:42:27,950
but it would also go through the air 
pods.

2208
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:28,990
Didn't given both.
Yeah.

2209
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:31,940
So when it was getting like 10 seconds 
it would alert me through the.

2210
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,580
But I would think like,
oh man,

2211
01:42:33,581 --> 01:42:35,350
punching the bag and even kicking the 
bag.

2212
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:36,840
Those air pods are gonna fall out.
Nope.

2213
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:37,810
Yeah,
they didn't.

2214
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,720
I've actually yet to have them fall out.
Yeah.

2215
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,570
Regardless.
The only time I've had them falls when I

2216
01:42:42,571 --> 01:42:45,220
was doing chin ups because my shoulders 
are so fucking massive.

2217
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,390
It touched my ears so it didn't fall 
out.

2218
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:51,070
They were ripped out by your massive 
shoulders.

2219
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:56,150
They just.
My ears bumped up against my my 

2220
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:56,150
shoulders,
but that's it.

2221
01:42:56,150 --> 01:42:57,790
That's the only time I've ever ever 
accidentally fallen out.

2222
01:42:57,791 --> 01:43:02,470
But what's interesting is you take one 
out and it knows that you have it out.

2223
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:06,400
So the sound stops like,
how the fuck did they figure that out?

2224
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:11,320
Wizardry out have no problem talking to 
you while you have headphones on.

2225
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:16,650
They just start talking like they see 
the headphones and they just start 

2226
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:19,510
talking to you to pretend like you can't
hear them and you pointed the headphones

2227
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:20,410
and they're like,
no,

2228
01:43:20,411 --> 01:43:20,830
no,
no.

2229
01:43:20,831 --> 01:43:21,630
You have to talk to me.

2230
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,680
They talk louder.
I don't give a fuck if you're on the 

2231
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:29,611
phone.
I don't give a fuck if you're in the 

2232
01:43:29,611 --> 01:43:30,640
middle of the most important audio book 
ever getting the secrets of the universe

2233
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:32,110
right now,
people won't talk to you,

2234
01:43:32,111 --> 01:43:37,111
man.
I think that might be more of a problem 

2235
01:43:37,111 --> 01:43:38,140
that you deal with as opposed to others,
but I think girls get it more than me.

2236
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:43,470
I know words.
I know women who have put a headphones 

2237
01:43:43,470 --> 01:43:45,400
into their ears and not even attached it
to a device.

2238
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:47,520
That's good.
Just so people will leave them alone.

2239
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:50,230
Just stick it right in there posting.
I don't know if you can hear.

2240
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:50,710
Yeah,
I don't.

2241
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:52,250
I don't know if would necessarily

2242
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:55,010
work.
What island did you go to?

2243
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:56,230
Hawaii?
Um,

2244
01:43:56,510 --> 01:44:01,510
my favorite is Lanai.
Is that where you guys went for 

2245
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:01,510
Thanksgiving?
We went to the big island this time.

2246
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:05,830
Nice split.
I think Linda is the way to go because 

2247
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:07,850
they ain't nobody there.
And you gotta take two flights from La.

2248
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,120
Hulu?
Yeah.

2249
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:10,730
You got to go to Honolulu and then you 
take a little puddle jumper.

2250
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,070
A little one of them.
Little buddy holly killing planes.

2251
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17,760
I guess.
Imagine backpack

2252
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:20,270
you can borrow.
They ask how much your packs.

2253
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:22,840
Oh No,
don't say that.

2254
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:24,000
How much do you weigh,
sir?

2255
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,410
Don't lie.
Please don't lie.

2256
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,700
Actually padded by about 10 percent.
You're going to be okay.

2257
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:32,960
I wonder if what they do,
if they get like a really overly weight 

2258
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:32,960
person who they know might be full of 
shit.

2259
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,080
Like I don't want to find out what 
happens ladies.

2260
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:40,160
I know what happens.
They Jack up a couple of pounds when I 

2261
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:40,160
was super young.
Like I just,

2262
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:44,110
I remember that I went on a cruise with 
my grandparents to Alaska.

2263
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:49,200
I don't know where we started,
but we went up to Alaska when we were 

2264
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,361
flying back from Alaska puddle jumper to
probably do now to get on the plane and 

2265
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:54,610
they looked at my grandfather like a 
little up and down.

2266
01:44:54,611 --> 01:44:55,310
Like,
sir,

2267
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:56,350
you're on the next flight.

2268
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:57,430
Really?
Yep.

2269
01:44:57,790 --> 01:45:00,880
They bumped him.
GRANDPA had a gut grandpa.

2270
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:04,510
He was,
he was built big boy.

2271
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,840
He was.
He was built from the belly button up to

2272
01:45:07,841 --> 01:45:10,810
the chest,
like a beach ball.

2273
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:17,570
Hey Man.
Some like I wouldn't want to be in a 

2274
01:45:17,570 --> 01:45:17,570
puddle jumper with a really big guy that
was full of shit.

2275
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,840
No,
you'll kill everybody at some point.

2276
01:45:19,841 --> 01:45:20,560
The plans like,
Hey,

2277
01:45:20,561 --> 01:45:23,170
I know you're pulling back on the yoke,
but I actually can't take off,

2278
01:45:23,171 --> 01:45:25,570
so you're all going to die now,
and that's not the way to go either.

2279
01:45:25,571 --> 01:45:30,571
Right?
Because someone has an ego and they 

2280
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:30,571
can't tell you.
There are 400 pounds,

2281
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:30,571
not 50.
Yeah.

2282
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:34,740
So they.
I think they actually took his luggage 

2283
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:34,740
off and he had to come back like that.
I think it was the next day.

2284
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:38,790
Well,
the real problem is for someone who's 

2285
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:40,201
400 pounds,
they have to find a scale that goes up 

2286
01:45:40,201 --> 01:45:41,440
to 400 pounds or you get a time and as 
it goes around.

2287
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:43,960
But Joey Diaz was telling me that when 
he was 400 pounds,

2288
01:45:43,961 --> 01:45:45,250
like they,
he didn't.

2289
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:49,420
He didn't know how much you weighed 
because the scale at his doctor's office

2290
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:51,600
only went to 300 pounds and you have 
that.

2291
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:56,610
Imagine that pegged bang,
and then he'd lose 50 pounds and it 

2292
01:45:56,801 --> 01:46:01,570
would still be pegged.
I think that's not a good sign.

2293
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,830
No,
I mean I'm not a doctor obviously,

2294
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:11,160
but I think that all this stuff,
when you see all these people that are 

2295
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,370
like morbidly obese,
I think this is all a.

2296
01:46:13,371 --> 01:46:15,910
there's a lot of things right?
This shitty food.

2297
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:21,240
There's a bad gut flora addict addiction
to like refined carbohydrates and 

2298
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:24,920
sugars,
alcohol,

2299
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:26,710
a lot of things that make people that 
fat,

2300
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:32,250
but on top of that,
I think a lot of it is that they don't 

2301
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,510
have like real physical challenges in 
their life on a daily basis.

2302
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,910
Especially physical challenges that they
enjoy.

2303
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:41,940
That forces them to be disciplined about
their health and to understand that 

2304
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:44,260
their body is.
It's not just your body,

2305
01:46:44,530 --> 01:46:48,220
okay.
It's like you have this variable vehicle

2306
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,070
and the time you put

2307
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,050
into it,
the more you pay attention to it and the

2308
01:46:52,051 --> 01:46:54,600
more discipline you use to keep this 
thing running,

2309
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:57,000
the better it's going to work for you 
and if you use it all the time,

2310
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:02,270
you're gonna appreciate it.
But if you just use it to walk over to 

2311
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:04,350
the couch and crack a beer and start 
fucking filling your face with chips and

2312
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:07,560
cookies,
you don't think about what it is and you

2313
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:10,770
don't have to rely on it to survive.
You don't have to chop wood.

2314
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:12,750
You have to.
You don't have to carry anything.

2315
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,660
You gotta go.
You gotta.

2316
01:47:14,690 --> 01:47:17,210
Look on your phone for the right APP to 
have uber.

2317
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:21,260
Deliver your food so you don't even have
to get off of your ass.

2318
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,180
That's a new thing.
It's a new thing,

2319
01:47:23,181 --> 01:47:28,181
but I bet she gets pretty popular.
But it doesn't come to your neck of the 

2320
01:47:28,181 --> 01:47:28,181
woods.
I bet I wouldn't order it.

2321
01:47:28,181 --> 01:47:30,830
Even if it did.
I don't have restaurants in your town.

2322
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,210
Well,
yes.

2323
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:33,830
We also have electricity and running 
water.

2324
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,680
No,
we do a lot.

2325
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:40,740
You had a.
well I do at my house we have in the 

2326
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:40,740
woods.
Oh,

2327
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:41,270
that's amazing.
Well you should come visit sometime.

2328
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:44,710
Wells.
I liked the idea of water is God damn.

2329
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:45,840
It's good.
Oh yeah.

2330
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:48,620
Unbelievably clear.
Spring water.

2331
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:51,130
It just tastes different.
It tastes different to A.

2332
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:52,490
Yeah,
I it,

2333
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,940
I liked the small town we have,
we have everything we need.

2334
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,520
Probably a couple things that we 
probably still need and not much of what

2335
01:48:01,521 --> 01:48:03,860
we don't.
Is there any crime?

2336
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:05,900
I'm sure.
I actually.

2337
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:07,580
Yeah,
I bet you there's some,

2338
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:09,950
a little bit off the rails.
Crime I think any place,

2339
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,750
so we don't live in white fish.
White fish is like 15 miles north of us.

2340
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:18,390
I'm pretty sure there's a large like 
white nationalists,

2341
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:19,310
white supremacists.

2342
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:26,110
I've read some stuff about it.
I haven't really looked into it too 

2343
01:48:26,110 --> 01:48:28,271
much,
but I knew that they were getting ready 

2344
01:48:28,271 --> 01:48:28,271
to do a little bit of a march type 
action rally.

2345
01:48:28,271 --> 01:48:29,000
You should walk around everywhere in 
black face.

2346
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:34,750
I don't think that's the call.
I don't have an Afro.

2347
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:41,830
I was thinking of just driving my truck 
through the white nationalist rally is 

2348
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:42,170
because my truck is black so.
Right.

2349
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,260
Yeah.
That would be the metaphor.

2350
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,790
So if one of them Tiki torches and see 
if you feel me,

2351
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:50,960
man,
let's fucking dickheads.

2352
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:56,470
Oh,
those dickheads in Charlotte walking on 

2353
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:58,271
the street with home depot torches.
I still can't figure out if they're 

2354
01:48:58,271 --> 01:48:58,530
serious.
Oh,

2355
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:02,510
they're serious.
There've been with Home Depot Tiki torch

2356
01:49:02,511 --> 01:49:04,280
in your hand.
You're serious.

2357
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,210
Yeah,
they're serious.

2358
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:07,970
They just want a torch and they're so 
fucking stupid.

2359
01:49:07,971 --> 01:49:09,560
They don't really tell that that's going
to be mocked,

2360
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:10,730
you know?

2361
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:13,270
I don't know if they even care.
I think they're just glad they're either

2362
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:18,310
getting coverage so that they feel that 
their message is getting out to 

2363
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,310
everybody who needs to hear it in their 
mind,

2364
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:20,660
but he didn't need to hear it because 
most people didn't know that there was a

2365
01:49:20,661 --> 01:49:23,690
group that duck fucking stupid that's 
willing to go into the streets like that

2366
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:29,020
and do it in this day and age when 
you're on the Internet and people are 

2367
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:29,020
gonna Realize,
Oh,

2368
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,220
you're a Nazi swastika on your chest.
You dumb cunt.

2369
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:32,300
Oh,
okay.

2370
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,470
Yeah.
There you go,

2371
01:49:33,471 --> 01:49:38,471
buddy.
I don't know if it's that bad up in 

2372
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:38,471
white fish,
but I do know that there is.

2373
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:40,520
I have found is like you eat to the 
remote areas.

2374
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:44,750
It seems like a drug related crime might
be a tad higher.

2375
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:46,430
Gets a little messy.
Yeah.

2376
01:49:46,431 --> 01:49:47,830
I was gonna say,
but I'm not sure.

2377
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:48,040
I mean

2378
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,160
anecdotally I think from my perspective,
that's what it seems to be like,

2379
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:53,650
but I haven't.
I mean I feel super comfortable.

2380
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:56,510
I don't feel.
Yeah,

2381
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:57,300
I mean,
I don't know.

2382
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:02,460
It feels,
it feels smaller is the only way that I 

2383
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:02,460
can describe it and that feeling fuels 
awesome.

2384
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:03,190
Yeah,
it's peaceful,

2385
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:03,550
right?
Yeah.

2386
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:08,020
So like not a great word for sure.
It's slower to it is.

2387
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,780
Like I said,
the only regret is that I wish we had.

2388
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,240
I wish we had been able to do it.
Well we would.

2389
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:14,830
We were able to do it.
We just didn't do it.

2390
01:50:14,831 --> 01:50:16,600
I wish we had done it a couple of years 
ago.

2391
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:18,790
Yeah,
I felt that way about boulder.

2392
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,170
Boulder feels like that too.
Vain.

2393
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,010
Boulder feels to me like,
you know,

2394
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:24,340
it's only a 100,000
people,

2395
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:26,890
which is way bigger than your town.
Twenty 2000.

2396
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,420
That's crazy.
But it just,

2397
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:29,630
everything is like,
oh,

2398
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:32,350
it's just a calmer folders and 
interesting town.

2399
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,350
It reminded me a lot of where I grew up 
in Santa Cruz,

2400
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:38,770
very left like great place.
If you're selling Tofu,

2401
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,780
Santa Cruz is a great place to grow up.
The problem is,

2402
01:50:41,781 --> 01:50:43,420
is that a lot of people don't leave 
Santa Cruz.

2403
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:48,740
It's,
it's so far left that it ends up on the 

2404
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:48,740
right somehow there.
Yeah,

2405
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,540
it's insane.
And I,

2406
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:54,541
you know,
the guys and girls that I went to high 

2407
01:50:54,541 --> 01:50:54,590
school with,
a couple of them have never left and not

2408
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,440
that I haven't really maintained contact
with them,

2409
01:50:56,441 --> 01:51:01,441
but even if I did,
I don't know if I'd have anything to 

2410
01:51:01,441 --> 01:51:02,230
talk to them about.
It's such an insulated and the like.

2411
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,700
So the small town that we live in,
I'm like,

2412
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:05,530
I want my kids when they grow up and 
they get to that age,

2413
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:10,531
they get to leave.
They got to go and experience something 

2414
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:10,531
else.

2415
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:10,531
I don't want them to think that that 
22,000

2416
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:11,770
people is,
this is how the world is.

2417
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:16,030
It's not the best thing I did in Santa 
Cruz was leaving at some point.

2418
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,480
Um,
friend of mine has been on the podcast 

2419
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,311
before,
used to be on this podcast called 

2420
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:23,311
citizens radio and he was a,
um,

2421
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:27,610
like a real heavy duty lefty social 
justice warrior type character.

2422
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:32,850
And somewhere along the line he ran 
afoul of them because he dates girls 

2423
01:51:34,241 --> 01:51:39,241
like girls.
Girls were calling them a Predator or 

2424
01:51:39,241 --> 01:51:39,241
something like that.
It really didn't do anything wrong.

2425
01:51:39,241 --> 01:51:40,060
Like if you look at it on paper,
like,

2426
01:51:40,061 --> 01:51:41,590
okay,
what did he do wrong?

2427
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:43,690
There was nothing.
There was no rape,

2428
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:46,930
there was no assault,
there was no harassing.

2429
01:51:46,931 --> 01:51:50,260
It was him trying to get laid a which I 
thought was normal,

2430
01:51:50,350 --> 01:51:52,540
but I guess not in that world it's 
problematic.

2431
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:57,070
But in the social justice world,
it's problematic to be an aggressive.

2432
01:51:57,071 --> 01:52:01,900
A Sexual Predator she did is actually 
had attorney and really not cool at all.

2433
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,780
But what he said was that when he was in
that world,

2434
01:52:04,781 --> 01:52:09,781
he didn't even,
wasn't even aware of dissenting 

2435
01:52:09,781 --> 01:52:13,231
viewpoints because he was so insulated 
because everybody in that world thought 

2436
01:52:13,231 --> 01:52:17,461
a certain way.
And so you just get accustomed to these 

2437
01:52:17,461 --> 01:52:21,660
very rigid sort of channels of thinking 
and everybody sort of follows these 

2438
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:28,141
channels and he literally wasn't even 
aware of the possibility of there being 

2439
01:52:29,891 --> 01:52:31,570
a dissenting point of view that was 
rational.

2440
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:34,630
How do people not realize that that's 
inherently dangerous?

2441
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,170
They get caught up in it.
People are super tribal,

2442
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,090
you know,
I don't have to tell you that I made.

2443
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,530
Yeah,
I agree.

2444
01:52:41,531 --> 01:52:44,350
But it's at the same point,
like I try to recognize myself,

2445
01:52:44,351 --> 01:52:47,630
like if I'm whatever,
consuming anything information.

2446
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:48,470
If I'm like,
okay,

2447
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:53,471
I need to go and figure something else 
out or hear another viewpoint or at 

2448
01:52:53,471 --> 01:52:55,250
least try to balance it to me.
Like the spidey senses started going up.

2449
01:52:55,251 --> 01:52:57,050
If too many people are saying the same 
thing,

2450
01:52:57,051 --> 01:53:02,051
if everybody is all chanted in the sense
like what's going on with you might be 

2451
01:53:02,051 --> 01:53:02,600
down the rabbit hole here.
We need to take a few steps back.

2452
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:04,740
Yeah,
but that's because you are a winner.

2453
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:08,720
Some people are just not tiger blood,
but I'm trying.

2454
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,780
There's some things that people have 
that are like unfortunate.

2455
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:17,170
And one of the things that people have 
is this deep desire to have other people

2456
01:53:18,051 --> 01:53:23,051
like them and to fit in and to cause 
zero friction and to,

2457
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:29,150
to be amenable to the group think,
you know,

2458
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:34,510
it's like it's a real.
It's a common issue with folks like you 

2459
01:53:34,510 --> 01:53:37,721
see them like just slotting into group 
think ideology and whether it's group 

2460
01:53:37,721 --> 01:53:39,140
think on the right side,
a group thing.

2461
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:44,150
I mean there's a lot of fucking really 
dumb people that I follow on twitter 

2462
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:46,190
that are a make America great again.
People like,

2463
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:51,240
I'll go to Hashtag Maga every now and 
then and just start reading tweets and 

2464
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:54,380
just just like fucking macaulay culkin 
from home alone.

2465
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:56,030
My hand on my head going,
oh my God,

2466
01:53:56,031 --> 01:53:57,800
these people are serious.
No,

2467
01:53:57,801 --> 01:54:00,200
drain the swamp.
Hashtag drain the swamp.

2468
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:04,070
And I'll go and I'll read these people's
tweets.

2469
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:07,430
I'm like,
these people are just apes that are in a

2470
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:08,650
tribe.
They,

2471
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:09,800
they,
they are really,

2472
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:11,840
really.
Not all of them folks,

2473
01:54:11,841 --> 01:54:16,841
don't get me wrong.
There's a lot of people that are making 

2474
01:54:16,841 --> 01:54:18,691
America great again.
People that really do feel like it's a 

2475
01:54:18,691 --> 01:54:18,950
good thing to have this guy in office,
stock market's up,

2476
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,520
I'm not talking about you,
but I'm talking about people that have 

2477
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,371
this tiny little brain and this tiny 
little brain just needs to slot into a 

2478
01:54:27,411 --> 01:54:31,760
place and this is where they found this 
is their spot and then you go onto their

2479
01:54:31,761 --> 01:54:36,761
twitter page and these motherfuckers are
on all day arguing with people about 

2480
01:54:37,461 --> 01:54:40,850
trump all day accomplishing nothing.

2481
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
No,
but they feel like they've got a huge 

2482
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:46,000
microphone and they're getting 
absolutely nowhere.

2483
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,510
Yeah.
And they just everyday they just 

2484
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:50,510
constantly checking their responses,
checking their tweets,

2485
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:50,510
chicken.
They're thing back and forth,

2486
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:53,350
back and forth.
You know what scares me about that is it

2487
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:59,050
again,
I feel like I'm late to the game to 

2488
01:54:59,050 --> 01:54:59,600
everything and,
and social media late to the game.

2489
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:04,810
A podcasting late to the game.
Like I was telling you like I'm trying 

2490
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:09,131
to play catch up and I used to look at 
the news and largely accept,

2491
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:12,350
you know what?
I could corroborate on each side and now

2492
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:15,410
I can't look at any of that.
And so I just have to use my own eyes,

2493
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:20,860
but I see with my own eyes,
people arguing with their head down so 

2494
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:24,311
much about what they believe that 
they're actually not seeing what's 

2495
01:55:24,311 --> 01:55:27,221
happening around them and because nobody
trusts anything and they only repeat 

2496
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:31,331
what they say,
it provides the seams for people to do 

2497
01:55:31,331 --> 01:55:34,781
shit that as a country,
I don't think we want to go in that 

2498
01:55:34,781 --> 01:55:37,631
direction in that distraction moves are 
being made that people aren't paying 

2499
01:55:37,631 --> 01:55:37,631
attention to.

2500
01:55:37,631 --> 01:55:42,330
Yeah.
And I feel like with all this thing 

2501
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:44,021
about trump and Russia and everybody 
thinking that flint is going to turn on 

2502
01:55:44,021 --> 01:55:45,310
trump and this is it.
We're going to.

2503
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,430
Trump's going down,
trump's going down like,

2504
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:52,560
hey guys,
North Korea's got nuclear capability and

2505
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:57,380
they've just launched some new fucking 
missile icbm.

2506
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:58,890
Yeah,
high end orbit.

2507
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:01,410
That's cable reaching America.
Do you understand what's happening?

2508
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:06,760
And we're,
we're sending stealth bombers over to 

2509
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,991
South Korea like we are.
We are literally a few steps away from 

2510
01:56:08,991 --> 01:56:10,890
the brink of a nuclear war.
We're not there yet,

2511
01:56:10,891 --> 01:56:12,130
but we're in the.
We're,

2512
01:56:12,220 --> 01:56:14,070
we're where we should.
Everybody should be going,

2513
01:56:14,071 --> 01:56:14,630
hey,
hey,

2514
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:15,060
hey,
hey,

2515
01:56:15,210 --> 01:56:17,700
what was the fuck is going on over here?
Yeah.

2516
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,610
Like what is this?
Why are we even battling them?

2517
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,670
What the fuck is the issue?
Other than the fact that.

2518
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:29,160
I mean if you want to talk about going 
somewhere where you have a real 

2519
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:32,630
communist dictatorship,
that is a ruth ruth iron fist military 

2520
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:37,821
dictatorship that has an entire country 
of people in slaved North Korea's a 

2521
01:56:38,021 --> 01:56:38,400
spot.

2522
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:43,660
I mean it really is a video of that 
defector whole Lee Shit.

2523
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:49,150
My pulled out a mama hen got Swiss 
cheese and just kept the foot on the gas

2524
01:56:49,261 --> 01:56:50,720
pedal.
Kept going there.

2525
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,830
Not as truck shot him.
Oh,

2526
01:56:52,831 --> 01:56:56,940
you have five or six times.
Six times riddled with like parasites.

2527
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,290
Yeah.
Big Parasites.

2528
01:56:58,291 --> 01:57:00,330
Like two feet long.
My man.

2529
01:57:00,331 --> 01:57:01,050
I mean,
there you go.

2530
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,930
Well,
what motivates somebody to run that hard

2531
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,330
and that fast and he made it and he made
it.

2532
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,480
He must be sleeping so good right now.
Yeah.

2533
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,240
Was probably getting fed for the head on
the pillow.

2534
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:18,950
I mean,
just imagine how he'll kind of look at 

2535
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:18,950
this dude.

2536
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:18,950
Get Out,
get some.

2537
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:19,380
I'll fall down,
buddy.

2538
01:57:19,381 --> 01:57:20,090
Nice.
Okay.

2539
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,240
I probably played it off though.
He's like,

2540
01:57:21,241 --> 01:57:22,870
yeah,
I wouldn't want to shoot syrup.

2541
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,170
Is that all they have now?
They have the full thing.

2542
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:30,220
You know,
you get the nightline version of it so 

2543
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:31,160
you can get the full actual video of the
full actual video of.

2544
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:33,300
It's pretty interesting.
He was getting shot at in the car.

2545
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,280
Yeah.
You can see the trace around and they're

2546
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:37,060
really close to them.
Yeah.

2547
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:39,050
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.
I've missed close shots.

2548
01:57:39,150 --> 01:57:41,140
Panicking.
It's welcome.

2549
01:57:41,950 --> 01:57:44,820
Here it is.
This guys just hauling ass.

2550
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:50,270
Here's my question.
You think he was playing the radio like 

2551
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:50,270
metallica planned?
Kickstart my heart.

2552
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,840
Yeah.
Metallica.

2553
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:54,600
I'm going forward North Korea.
Soldiers for sue,

2554
01:57:54,601 --> 01:57:57,030
the man while he flees and a military 
vehicle.

2555
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,430
What kind of cars you got there?
It looked like a jeep.

2556
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:03,660
It looks like a land rover down,
so he stops the car.

2557
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:08,610
He gets out and he's running and they're
shooting at him from six feet away.

2558
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,860
Fortunately the guy on the far right's 
got a pistol.

2559
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:13,290
He's not hitting shit.
He's tripping over his buddy back.

2560
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,640
Ooh,
that guy's got a rifle though.

2561
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:22,190
Oh my God.
The Korean soldier accidentally clock 

2562
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:22,560
crosses into South Korea during the 
pursuit.

2563
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:25,590
So that's the line right there.
I do not know.

2564
01:58:26,190 --> 01:58:28,680
So that's all you have to take.
Turns around.

2565
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,650
So there's not a fence.
I don't know.

2566
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:36,740
You just have to get to that spot and I 
don't know about the DMZ shot and 

2567
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:40,281
injured.
The factor is pulled to safety by the 

2568
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:40,281
South Korean military.
Whoa,

2569
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:40,670
that's amazing.
Oh,

2570
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:43,510
these people crawling.
That looks like the South Korean people.

2571
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:44,710
Yeah,
they're dragging him.

2572
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,380
Holy Cow.
I didn't know about this.

2573
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:49,450
Oh my God.
See the blood trail.

2574
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:50,710
Oh,
that's what.

2575
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:52,540
That is.
More than likely on a thermal.

2576
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:55,810
Oh,
that's intense.

2577
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,000
That's intense.

2578
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:03,070
So you want to talk about an iron fist 
dictator that's happening right now and 

2579
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:05,120
people,
all they can think of is just looking at

2580
01:59:05,121 --> 01:59:06,620
that guard.
Go look at him.

2581
01:59:06,621 --> 01:59:11,621
Go.
He's out gear.

2582
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,100
Yeah,
I don't.

2583
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:16,670
I don't know the rules on the DMZ or 
where the actual line is.

2584
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:19,070
If this video on like South Korea's 
side,

2585
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:21,140
is that how they.
Someone saw this taken place.

2586
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:24,140
So it looks like he's driving from north
to south.

2587
01:59:24,230 --> 01:59:29,230
Yeah.
Does he just have to get across that 

2588
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:29,230
gate?
So this is this like a DMZ.

2589
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:32,570
It's almost like an unedited version.
The second at 10 minute version of it.

2590
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:33,560
Wow.

2591
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,640
I guess they just constantly monitor 
everything.

2592
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:40,690
How weird must that tension between the 
north and south of staring at each other

2593
01:59:40,691 --> 01:59:44,260
in the opposite side of the line.
And they both look exactly the same.

2594
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,960
They're both Korean,
you know,

2595
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:49,900
it's like the US wall with Mexico.
People go,

2596
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:51,010
oh,
it's racist,

2597
01:59:51,011 --> 01:59:56,011
it's racist because one,
people are proud and when people are 

2598
01:59:56,011 --> 01:59:56,410
white they can't even say it's racist 
over there.

2599
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:59,590
They're both the same race just looking 
at each other.

2600
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:02,530
And then there were a war.
They hate each other and one's the enemy

2601
02:00:02,531 --> 02:00:04,780
and one's not.
One has no money.

2602
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:09,840
One is under the iron rule of a 
communist military dictatorship where 

2603
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:10,420
they kill everybody.
The other one,

2604
02:00:10,421 --> 02:00:12,040
they're making the best cell phones in 
the world.

2605
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:16,270
Chicks were all getting plastic surgery,
you know,

2606
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:21,450
the boys are all fucking hip hop break 
dancers and shit and like they have mma 

2607
02:00:22,061 --> 02:00:24,160
over there.
They have everything that South Korea is

2608
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,470
that tag windows pretty fucking awesome

2609
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,770
souls and awesome town.
Yeah,

2610
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:31,440
I've been there.
I spent my 20th birthday in Seoul,

2611
02:00:31,441 --> 02:00:32,250
Korea,
and a bar.

2612
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:38,060
People that think that socialism and 
communism is the answer to the woes that

2613
02:00:39,141 --> 02:00:42,270
capitalism creates.
Do not understand you.

2614
02:00:42,271 --> 02:00:47,271
Just missing the point that is.
It's so contrary to human nature and it 

2615
02:00:47,281 --> 02:00:48,000
is,
by the way,

2616
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:50,700
never been pulled off successfully in 
human history.

2617
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:55,790
Yeah.
I would love an example and that's what 

2618
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:57,321
I always ask people.
Just give me the example of what you 

2619
02:00:57,321 --> 02:00:59,631
want to use as the foundation for those 
principals where it's been executed 

2620
02:00:59,631 --> 02:00:59,910
properly,
where it's thrived,

2621
02:00:59,911 --> 02:01:02,970
where it's survived and I'll just sit 
here and wait,

2622
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:08,030
and another part of the problem is that 
the people that are really like the 

2623
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:11,811
people that are in the left that are 
really progressive and support Marxism,

2624
02:01:13,261 --> 02:01:17,340
the idea of Marxism and socialism,
those people are in general,

2625
02:01:17,341 --> 02:01:20,370
very supportive of gay rights,
very supportive of women's rights.

2626
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:25,700
Those are the first things that get 
trampled and his communist 

2627
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:29,031
dictatorships.
That is the first thing that goes like 

2628
02:01:29,031 --> 02:01:31,410
every single one of these communists,
Marxists rules,

2629
02:01:31,650 --> 02:01:35,520
homosexuality is treated as the devil 
like these people.

2630
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:37,860
Did they live in hell that you don't 
understand.

2631
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,070
It is very for me,

2632
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:45,110
after a long period of time,
the majority of my adult life to pick my

2633
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:47,120
head up and look around

2634
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:48,190
and

2635
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,710
and it most of the interaction,
like I said,

2636
02:01:50,711 --> 02:01:55,711
as social media,
I sit back and I watch and I see the 

2637
02:01:55,711 --> 02:01:57,751
things that people say and I see the 
complaints that they have and oppressed 

2638
02:01:57,751 --> 02:01:58,600
this,
this,

2639
02:01:58,601 --> 02:02:01,450
that or the other,
and I'll be the first person to say that

2640
02:02:01,451 --> 02:02:06,451
there is inequality in the US.
Just like there is an every nation on 

2641
02:02:06,451 --> 02:02:09,841
the face of the planet.
But to hear how people think,

2642
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,560
how bad we have it,
and then to have seen with my own eyes.

2643
02:02:15,220 --> 02:02:16,980
Places where people would

2644
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:19,650
claw their way,

2645
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:24,110
cross the border,
to have the opportunities that people in

2646
02:02:24,111 --> 02:02:28,220
this country have just waking up.
The Sun rises over the United States and

2647
02:02:28,221 --> 02:02:30,830
they wake up and they have so much 
opportunity that they don't appreciate.

2648
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,070
It's very difficult for me to make sense
of what's going on.

2649
02:02:34,071 --> 02:02:37,730
It's a bizarre place to be in because 
it's just like who?

2650
02:02:37,731 --> 02:02:40,230
Who are you people and where do you get 
these ideas there?

2651
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:43,950
Idealistic and they think that we can do
better and I think that we can do better

2652
02:02:43,951 --> 02:02:48,951
too,
but I think where people go a foul is 

2653
02:02:48,951 --> 02:02:52,701
where they start saying that they want 
equality of outcome and equality of 

2654
02:02:52,701 --> 02:02:57,441
outcome is contrary to equality because 
when you have a quality,

2655
02:02:57,790 --> 02:03:02,790
a quality,
really quality meaning you can do 

2656
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:04,710
whatever you want to do.
That breeds inequality.

2657
02:03:04,711 --> 02:03:09,711
Yes,
because some people are going to work 

2658
02:03:09,711 --> 02:03:12,501
harder and competition is what pushes 
things and some people think that 

2659
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:16,971
competition is bad and the reason why 
they think it's bad because it makes 

2660
02:03:16,971 --> 02:03:20,031
them feel bad.
Like I put something on twitter today 

2661
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:23,690
where they were saying that fit bits 
that people using fitbit's is fat 

2662
02:03:24,091 --> 02:03:29,091
shaming and abelist and it's problematic
and it causes all sorts of issues and 

2663
02:03:29,191 --> 02:03:30,750
these,
these educators,

2664
02:03:30,751 --> 02:03:35,751
we're looking at fitbit's as being a 
real problem with the emotions of 

2665
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:35,751
people.

2666
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:37,490
You know,
they find out like in.

2667
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:41,010
They start comparing and it can cause 
all sorts of issues with people,

2668
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:43,650
so they were literally saying that 
fitbit's,

2669
02:03:43,890 --> 02:03:48,150
they're just devices that give you data 
that these things can be a problem.

2670
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:50,790
How about competition's a good thing?
It's a good thing.

2671
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:55,970
Yeah.
How about it's okay to finish last 

2672
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:55,970
because it will motivate you to get off 
your ass.

2673
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,420
You still on the leaderboard?
Exactly.

2674
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:58,170
Yeah.
Go again.

2675
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,850
You don't win every time.
Stupid.

2676
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:03,900
It scares me that people are in 
positions like I'm looking at.

2677
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:06,660
My oldest son is 14 and

2678
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:12,470
I mean I realized that at some point in 
time in the very near future he's going 

2679
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:15,231
to go off and you know,
he's gonna want to pursue a higher 

2680
02:04:15,231 --> 02:04:17,181
education and I almost would rather send
them to a trade school where he learns 

2681
02:04:17,181 --> 02:04:18,330
something with his hands or I would hope
that he would.

2682
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:23,360
I would never tell him to do that.
I would hope that he would want to go 

2683
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,061
down that route instead of going into an
environment that is completely 

2684
02:04:26,061 --> 02:04:29,451
artificial where people portray this 
world of no rounded corners in nerfed 

2685
02:04:31,501 --> 02:04:34,320
everything and you,
your feelings in words hurt and all.

2686
02:04:34,321 --> 02:04:38,010
He talks about it all the time.
Actually I don't my son to go into

2687
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:43,010
that environment.
He's already experiencing that a little 

2688
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:45,111
bit in the school system that is in like
he uses the word triggered and heal.

2689
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,430
His teachers will use that word 
triggered and I'm like,

2690
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:51,120
listen,
it's okay to have somebody say something

2691
02:04:51,121 --> 02:04:55,890
to you that invokes a reaction or 
emotion in you that causes conflict.

2692
02:04:55,891 --> 02:04:58,230
That's okay.
Don't run away from that conflict.

2693
02:04:58,231 --> 02:05:03,231
Once you go directly,
add that conflict and figure out what 

2694
02:05:03,231 --> 02:05:03,930
your problem is with it or figure out 
why you have an issue with that and then

2695
02:05:03,931 --> 02:05:06,420
work through that and you'll be a better
person on the other side of the house.

2696
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:10,800
I feel like these were in a place now 
where people are creating.

2697
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:13,980
It's an artificial environment that as 
soon as you leave that environment,

2698
02:05:13,981 --> 02:05:17,650
you're going to get your teeth kicked in
and I don't.

2699
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:20,050
I see it trending more and more and more
in the u.

2700
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:25,050
s and I almost think we're getting ready
to fall flat on our face and I almost 

2701
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:29,361
think we need to to figure out who the 
fuck we are and to pick ourselves back 

2702
02:05:29,361 --> 02:05:33,351
up into,
into realize that those artificial 

2703
02:05:33,351 --> 02:05:35,640
environments that people are trying to 
force onto the world.

2704
02:05:35,641 --> 02:05:40,260
It just doesn't work in campus.
Cities and towns that have campuses.

2705
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,530
Yeah.
It's just,

2706
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:46,940
it's just really heavy duty leftwing 
people that are just committed to this 

2707
02:05:46,940 --> 02:05:50,160
ideology and they don't have a.
I mean,

2708
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:55,430
it's good to have both sides.
I think it's good to have people that 

2709
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:56,430
lean left and people that lean right and
you try to figure out which,

2710
02:05:56,510 --> 02:06:01,510
yeah,
balanced way works and by the way it's 

2711
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:04,071
gonna work better for some way.
Some people to be left and is going to 

2712
02:06:04,071 --> 02:06:04,071
work better.
For some people it'll be right,

2713
02:06:04,071 --> 02:06:08,600
but this lack of tolerance for other 
people's ideas is one of the most 

2714
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,590
shocking things about the left these 
days is this,

2715
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,650
this need and desire to shut down 
speech.

2716
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:14,920
You know,
um,

2717
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:17,580
there was also the people who are on the
forefront of saying,

2718
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:18,660
you know,
freedom of speech,

2719
02:06:18,661 --> 02:06:20,130
but not that,
not anymore,

2720
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,270
you know,
they used to be.

2721
02:06:21,530 --> 02:06:26,530
The new left is more stifling of free 
speech than the right by far the new 

2722
02:06:27,571 --> 02:06:28,470
left would,
you know,

2723
02:06:28,471 --> 02:06:32,970
you'd call neo Marxism or postmoderns.
I guess I look at it differently,

2724
02:06:32,971 --> 02:06:37,050
like freedom of speech to me in my mind 
is not about what I can say to you.

2725
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:39,350
It's not about me saying I'm going to 
say something,

2726
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,640
you know,
messed up and try to offend you.

2727
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:46,641
To me,
freedom of speech is how much can I 

2728
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:49,161
tolerate from somebody else?
How much am I willing to listen to an 

2729
02:06:49,161 --> 02:06:53,181
opinion that I absolutely hate,
but I'm going to allow it to exist 

2730
02:06:53,181 --> 02:06:56,601
because I'm grateful that we have an 
environment that that can exist in and 

2731
02:06:56,601 --> 02:06:57,300
you're not going to get pulled into a 
public square and get your head cut off?

2732
02:06:57,360 --> 02:06:58,260
Well,
there's certainly that,

2733
02:06:58,261 --> 02:07:02,580
but there's also the only way you find 
out which idea is correct is you have to

2734
02:07:02,581 --> 02:07:04,590
have debate.
You have to have open debate.

2735
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:08,250
You have to have the ability to 
communicate your ideas freely,

2736
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:13,730
and if you don't have the ability to 
communicate your ideas freely and the 

2737
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:16,251
other person just bulldozes you with 
their ideas because they think they're 

2738
02:07:16,251 --> 02:07:18,950
right and I'm going to shut down 
everyone else's opinion because I'm 

2739
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:20,430
right.
That's not how you handle free speech.

2740
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:22,710
The way you have to tell you that 
opinion isn't allowed,

2741
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:23,260
right?
Yup.

2742
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:26,310
You handle bad speech with more better 
speech you,

2743
02:07:26,311 --> 02:07:28,230
you,
you become.

2744
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:33,210
You have to have your arguments laid out
in a way that's convincing to the people

2745
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:38,211
that are paying attention and you can't 
do that if your speech is stifled and 

2746
02:07:38,211 --> 02:07:39,790
that's what's really a problem with the 
left these days and it's just.

2747
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:45,180
And I think a big part of it is these 
artificial environments you're talking 

2748
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:45,180
about the they,
they,

2749
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:47,020
they live in these insulated things.
Like I was saying,

2750
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:52,021
Jamie Kilstein used to live in.
They live in these insulated 

2751
02:07:52,021 --> 02:07:54,541
environments where they think they're 
right and they think they're doing the 

2752
02:07:54,541 --> 02:07:54,810
right thing by behaving like this,
but it's so short sighted.

2753
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:55,960
And I,
and again,

2754
02:07:55,961 --> 02:07:57,790
I don't,
I don't try to make a character judgment

2755
02:07:57,791 --> 02:08:01,330
on them,
but to me in my mind again with,

2756
02:08:01,331 --> 02:08:06,331
with my own eyes,
I think the biggest threat to this 

2757
02:08:06,331 --> 02:08:06,331
country is political correctness and 
safe spaces.

2758
02:08:06,331 --> 02:08:11,070
Yeah.
I truly think that teaching people in 

2759
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:11,650
that manner or getting them,
not getting them,

2760
02:08:11,651 --> 02:08:16,651
allowing them to think that that is how 
the world outside of that environment 

2761
02:08:16,651 --> 02:08:19,870
operates is setting you up for a very 
longterm failure because you're going to

2762
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:24,871
just get crushed because there are 
plenty of other entities throughout the 

2763
02:08:25,631 --> 02:08:27,670
world that we'll look at what you're 
doing and say,

2764
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:28,720
oh,
that's awesome.

2765
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:31,540
You're just teeing it up for me.
That's a complete vulnerability.

2766
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:34,630
They're going to leverage that against 
us and manipulate,

2767
02:08:34,870 --> 02:08:39,870
not manipulate,
just attack the fact that those people 

2768
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:42,990
feel that way.
They'll take it as a weakness and 

2769
02:08:42,990 --> 02:08:42,990
they'll leverage that for their success 
and with them we're fucked.

2770
02:08:42,990 --> 02:08:47,140
Yeah.
I don't necessarily think we're fucked 

2771
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,961
because I think there's enough people 
that are paying attention to think it's 

2772
02:08:48,961 --> 02:08:51,181
terrible and there's a lot of us,
but I think that when something like 

2773
02:08:51,181 --> 02:08:54,631
nine slash 11 happens,
one of the things that I thought that 

2774
02:08:54,631 --> 02:08:56,461
was really interesting right after nine 
slash 11 was his rallying cry of 

2775
02:08:56,461 --> 02:09:01,260
patriotism.
Like everybody had an American flag on 

2776
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:02,440
their car just like this is.
This is interesting to me.

2777
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:05,110
Did they have them hanging over the 
overpasses up here in la?

2778
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:08,050
Oh yeah,
in San Diego that week.

2779
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:10,030
I would say it was about a week after 
nine slash 11.

2780
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:14,210
I have never in my life,
felt a level of solidarity of,

2781
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:16,030
of just.
Not only that,

2782
02:09:16,031 --> 02:09:20,050
but people were nicer.
They were nicer.

2783
02:09:20,051 --> 02:09:21,400
They were more upset.
There wasn't.

2784
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:23,290
They weren't really worried that you cut
them off in traffic.

2785
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,850
You know what?
Take the parking spot.

2786
02:09:24,851 --> 02:09:25,210
Yeah,
no,

2787
02:09:25,270 --> 02:09:28,720
you can put your cart in front of me.
Not Grocery store for us against them.

2788
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,960
How fleeting was that freedom hall,
but it was amazing during that time 

2789
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:38,011
period to the overpasses and San Diego,
American flags hanging like not just an 

2790
02:09:38,011 --> 02:09:41,080
American flag covered the entire thing.
It was unbelievable.

2791
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:43,660
I've in longer in New York,
New York,

2792
02:09:43,661 --> 02:09:46,690
it lasts for a long time.
They kind of have a daily reminder.

2793
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:49,210
Yeah.
The feeling there was different.

2794
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,690
They were just to change the Way New 
York City was New York City.

2795
02:09:52,691 --> 02:09:57,691
It was almost like a village,
so we have a friendly village that had 

2796
02:09:57,691 --> 02:10:00,571
been attacked and everybody was like 
super thankful that they were alive and 

2797
02:10:00,571 --> 02:10:02,290
supportive of each other and also the 
solidarity.

2798
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,530
You know,
Sebastian younger is a war journalist.

2799
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:10,531
You ever heard of him?
I've listened to every podcast you've 

2800
02:10:10,531 --> 02:10:12,871
done with him.
Restrepo is one of my favorite 

2801
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:12,871
documentaries.
He's fucking amazing.

2802
02:10:12,871 --> 02:10:14,950
His book tribe changed the way I 
understand that.

2803
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:15,970
I'm like,
oh,

2804
02:10:15,971 --> 02:10:20,971
this is a natural part of being human,
and like we were talking about these 

2805
02:10:20,971 --> 02:10:24,301
reward systems that are built into 
animals that loud tigers and like they,

2806
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:29,770
they don't get the natural release.
These natural reward systems for good or

2807
02:10:29,771 --> 02:10:32,620
for bad human beings are designed to 
deal with conflict,

2808
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:33,770
look real conflict,

2809
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,980
and when we don't have real conflict,
we make up our own bullshit conflict and

2810
02:10:39,141 --> 02:10:44,141
when real conflict shows itself,
then everything sort of normalizes and 

2811
02:10:44,141 --> 02:10:45,590
that's.
I mean it's for good or for bad.

2812
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:48,740
We haven't evolved past that.
Whatever our DNA is,

2813
02:10:48,741 --> 02:10:53,240
whatever our programming is and are very
almost at a cellular level.

2814
02:10:53,540 --> 02:10:57,950
We're designed to have a certain amount 
of risk and when we don't have that risk

2815
02:10:57,951 --> 02:11:02,951
and we don't have that danger,
we don't feel good and you lash out at 

2816
02:11:02,951 --> 02:11:04,670
people with your egg icon.
These motherfuckers,

2817
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I'm going to kill you unless you were 
here in my face and then I wouldn't say 

2818
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,140
that I'm going to kill it.
Yeah,

2819
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:12,380
it was a credit.
I mean,

2820
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:15,140
I remember watching the second airplane 
go in live,

2821
02:11:15,141 --> 02:11:20,141
standing in an apartment in San Diego 
thinking this might change some things.

2822
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:22,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2823
02:11:22,011 --> 02:11:24,590
I remember just waking up.

2824
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:29,620
Someone called me.
Where were you living at the time I was 

2825
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:32,381
here,
was getting some phone calls from 

2826
02:11:32,381 --> 02:11:32,381
friends.
I was like,

2827
02:11:32,381 --> 02:11:32,381
what?
Turn on the news.

2828
02:11:32,381 --> 02:11:33,890
Turn on the news.
He turned on the news and you're like,

2829
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:36,950
just having an all sink in.
Like what the fuck?

2830
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:40,450
And then me and man,
I used to have a picture of it.

2831
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:45,460
Me and Eddie Bravo and Joey Diaz went to
get burritos and there wasn't a fucking 

2832
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:48,680
plane in the sky and we're hanging out 
that day because all air travel had been

2833
02:11:48,681 --> 02:11:52,750
suspended and we were just hanging out 
thinking how fucking bizarre it as we're

2834
02:11:52,751 --> 02:11:53,120
like,
dude,

2835
02:11:53,121 --> 02:11:55,460
are we at war?
Like what the hell?

2836
02:11:55,490 --> 02:12:00,490
How is this going to change everything?
Did Eddie feel better because there 

2837
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:01,280
weren't econ trails up there.
He wasn't the same guy back then.

2838
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,260
He wasn't that deep into it.
No,

2839
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:04,760
no.
He liked aliens back then.

2840
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:10,220
He was into like Nibiru.
He as he became older,

2841
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:14,330
he became way more conspiratorial.
I have a hard.

2842
02:12:15,070 --> 02:12:17,030
I know I've texted you before like,
hey,

2843
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:20,570
does he actually think those things or 
is he.

2844
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:25,960
He loves conspiracies.
I think he thinks of them almost like 

2845
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,770
some people like paying attention to 
sports,

2846
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:33,850
but then there's also like Illuminati 
stuff that he legitimately worries that 

2847
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:38,351
like Hillary Clinton is going to off him
because he talks to his shed about I 

2848
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:44,390
fucking.
I think it's entirely possible the 

2849
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:47,501
Clintons are murderers.
I think it's entirely possible 

2850
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:47,730
themselves are outsourced.
Outsourced yet.

2851
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:49,980
I don't think they have the stones to do
something,

2852
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,670
so I don't think so,
but I think they've definitely made some

2853
02:12:52,671 --> 02:12:56,270
calls or at least had some meetings.
I,

2854
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:58,250
uh,
just too many bodies,

2855
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:02,450
many people attached to them that were 
in critical positions that either like,

2856
02:13:02,451 --> 02:13:07,451
one recent guy vanished.
Does that Seth Rich Guy who is the New 

2857
02:13:07,451 --> 02:13:08,570
Yorker Dad worked at the DNC that got 
shot.

2858
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:13,630
There's,
there's enough of them and then they go 

2859
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:13,630
away.
The stories go away.

2860
02:13:13,630 --> 02:13:16,120
The one that I pulled up the other day 
who was a who's who would,

2861
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:21,160
who would we do in the podcast was the 
guy who had dirt on the Clinton 

2862
02:13:21,160 --> 02:13:23,300
campaign.
It was an academic and he vanished.

2863
02:13:23,301 --> 02:13:25,430
The guy vanished and you don't hear 
about it.

2864
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:29,930
This guy was about to like give dirt on 
the Clinton Foundation and they're like,

2865
02:13:29,931 --> 02:13:31,680
whoops.
He's just not around anymore.

2866
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
Can't find them.
I think their ability to hide and not 

2867
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:40,911
just their academic at heart of Clinton 
dirt champion vanishes leaving trail of 

2868
02:13:40,911 --> 02:13:42,480
questions because he's still missing.
Oh,

2869
02:13:42,481 --> 02:13:43,920
this is a part of the Russia 
investigation.

2870
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:45,450
That's right.
It wasn't the Clinton campaign.

2871
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:48,080
It wasn't the Clinton Foundation.
Yeah,

2872
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:48,840
he's gone,
man.

2873
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:51,570
It's fucking missing.
Poof,

2874
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:56,690
I did.
I just think it's amazing the ability 

2875
02:13:56,690 --> 02:13:57,000
for people to have the public face and 
then who they are.

2876
02:13:57,630 --> 02:14:02,630
I have A.
I have not personally had any 

2877
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:05,361
interactions with Hillary Clinton,
but I have some firsthand friends that 

2878
02:14:05,361 --> 02:14:10,221
have had direct interactions with her 
from either a security detail 

2879
02:14:10,221 --> 02:14:14,841
perspective or being on the ground and 
securing an area that she was traveling 

2880
02:14:14,971 --> 02:14:19,971
through and the public face that she 
puts on and how she treated those 

2881
02:14:19,971 --> 02:14:24,891
individuals up to and including people 
that were tasked with her personal 

2882
02:14:24,891 --> 02:14:25,980
security,
upclose detailed the store is that those

2883
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:30,981
people have would melt your hair,
but none of those stories come out.

2884
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:36,650
There's the person that she portrays 
herself to be during the election cycle 

2885
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:40,581
and this is who I am,
and then he talked to all these people 

2886
02:14:40,581 --> 02:14:42,531
who live at a day to day level with 
these people and the difference between 

2887
02:14:42,531 --> 02:14:43,230
the two is like sitting there trying to 
broad jump the grand canyon.

2888
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:48,740
It absolutely blows my mind.
The is about her in particular and her 

2889
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:53,301
hatred or what they had told me her 
hatred for basically in essentially 

2890
02:14:53,301 --> 02:14:55,830
people in military or people who were 
there to support her doing her job.

2891
02:14:56,280 --> 02:15:01,280
Just the anger and vitriol that she 
would attack those people with on a 

2892
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,160
daily level is unbelievable anger at the
military and angry 100 percent of the.

2893
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:09,920
She was literally campaigning to be the 
commander in chief of the military just 

2894
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:15,630
because it comes out of how did she 
behave to them?

2895
02:15:16,290 --> 02:15:21,290
Uh,
one of the best stories that I have was 

2896
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:25,520
a,
I won't say the Agency of the person 

2897
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,150
worked for was basically she was exiting
the White House and he said,

2898
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:28,170
good morning,
Ms Dot Clinton.

2899
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:33,470
And he was in a uniform at the time and 
she stopped and turned around and she 

2900
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:33,470
said,
hey,

2901
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:33,630
why don't you go fuck yourself?
Don't talk to me when I'm,

2902
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:35,640
you know,
in going in between place a to place b,

2903
02:15:35,641 --> 02:15:37,200
wherever she was going,
got back in her car.

2904
02:15:37,201 --> 02:15:42,201
Fuck yourself more that I have that 
version of the story again,

2905
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:48,290
not personally for me.
I'm basically saying the things that 

2906
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:48,290
I've heard other people say to me in 
confidence directly,

2907
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:50,820
but their uniform,
these stories correct.

2908
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,380
Uniformed,
whether that be.

2909
02:15:52,381 --> 02:15:54,450
It could be a military secret service,
fill in the blank.

2910
02:15:54,451 --> 02:15:57,150
They wear a uniform also in the way 
these stories.

2911
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:02,360
She 100 percent.
It's exactly the same behavior when the 

2912
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:03,960
cameras are not rolling and it's fucking
terrifying because yes,

2913
02:16:03,961 --> 02:16:07,620
she is.
She is campaigning or was campaigning to

2914
02:16:07,621 --> 02:16:11,310
be the commander in chief of,
from what I can tell again,

2915
02:16:11,311 --> 02:16:13,980
having no direct relations with this 
person,

2916
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:17,740
a person that despises almost I would 
describe,

2917
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:20,070
I would describe it at that is what the 
organization stands for.

2918
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:23,340
Unbelievable.
I'm not surprised.

2919
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:28,660
Uh,
what stunned me is how the left was 

2920
02:16:28,660 --> 02:16:30,160
willing to just absolve her of her.

2921
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:35,640
She was against gay marriage until 2013.
Her obvious belief system,

2922
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:43,860
the like,
who she actually is versus like what 

2923
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,100
she,
you don't know what she's doing is being

2924
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:47,320
a slick politician just like her husband
publicly.

2925
02:16:47,321 --> 02:16:49,930
She is the tide.
She may also rise and fall with whatever

2926
02:16:49,931 --> 02:16:54,931
the trend is.
The 2013 thing like the fact that like 

2927
02:16:54,931 --> 02:16:54,931
how could you,
who,

2928
02:16:54,931 --> 02:16:58,900
who the fuck who's educated,
who the fuck was a Democrat at 2013,

2929
02:16:58,901 --> 02:17:02,650
still thought that a marriage should be 
between a man and woman who gives a shit

2930
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,680
like she did because that's what she 
does.

2931
02:17:05,681 --> 02:17:08,590
She licks her fingers,
she finds out whether it was blowing and

2932
02:17:08,591 --> 02:17:11,830
she goes that way and when you see the 
difference between what call me,

2933
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:16,831
sad about the investigation and what the
investigation and found on her emails 

2934
02:17:16,831 --> 02:17:20,941
and what the illegal activity that she 
had participated in versus what she 

2935
02:17:20,941 --> 02:17:25,141
said,
you know what the deleted emails at 

2936
02:17:25,141 --> 02:17:27,300
30,000
deleted emails and all that stuff and 

2937
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:28,060
there's a video that shows what he said 
versus what she said.

2938
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:31,420
Play them back to back with each other.
It's like how anybody could support her.

2939
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,640
The idea that you wanted someone other 
than Donald Trump,

2940
02:17:33,730 --> 02:17:38,730
I get it.
The idea that you wanted a woman and 

2941
02:17:38,730 --> 02:17:39,400
historical first for equality of women.
Do I get that too?

2942
02:17:39,401 --> 02:17:44,401
But this is not your one.
There's got to be a lot of women out 

2943
02:17:44,401 --> 02:17:44,750
there.
The two choices we had at of what,

2944
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:48,370
360 plus million people now God do 
insane.

2945
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:50,650
It just,
it's proof that the system is broken.

2946
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:51,700
Yeah,
I agree.

2947
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:53,620
It's compromised for sure.
You know,

2948
02:17:53,621 --> 02:17:55,800
the only thing good about having a guy 
like trump in his,

2949
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:59,740
he's not from the system has that he 
used all of his money and kind of jumped

2950
02:17:59,741 --> 02:18:03,190
in and the financial system is still 
being supported obviously because he's a

2951
02:18:03,191 --> 02:18:05,530
big part of it,
but the political system is in chaos.

2952
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:08,590
I mean he's not a part of that at all 
and never was so,

2953
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:13,640
so besides donating money to them,
that was the only thing that people 

2954
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,050
thought was a saving grace about him 
being an office.

2955
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:16,120
Like let's see.
But I think he's crazy.

2956
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:18,550
I think he might literally have 
dementia.

2957
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:23,520
I just wish that somebody would grab his
film.

2958
02:18:23,750 --> 02:18:25,120
Just real.
Do they try?

2959
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,980
No,
just like real quick and just modify the

2960
02:18:26,981 --> 02:18:27,460
APP.
So,

2961
02:18:27,461 --> 02:18:32,461
but before he hits tweet,
it goes to like one or two people who 

2962
02:18:32,461 --> 02:18:33,230
give it just a quick sanity check,
Da.

2963
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:38,110
And then they're like proof check 
twitter chats.

2964
02:18:38,111 --> 02:18:43,111
He checks his comments,
he fucking people I know people are 

2965
02:18:43,111 --> 02:18:46,741
proud about that.
I've heard you talking about now I've 

2966
02:18:46,741 --> 02:18:46,741
looked at like I'm blocked by presidents
like man,

2967
02:18:46,741 --> 02:18:47,830
hilarious.
But again,

2968
02:18:47,831 --> 02:18:51,010
I look at that as people have their head
down,

2969
02:18:51,011 --> 02:18:56,011
not paying attention to what they should
be paying attention to because in those 

2970
02:18:56,011 --> 02:18:56,800
seams that people blowing their mind 
over a tweet,

2971
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:02,400
what the hell is getting passed through 
in regulations and bills and unlike if 

2972
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:05,700
that's the shit that scares me,
the EPA shit scares me the most because 

2973
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:07,270
you know what they're doing with the 
national monuments.

2974
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:08,920
There's people that are.
They had a meeting this morning.

2975
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:10,610
What's up?
Yeah.

2976
02:19:10,650 --> 02:19:13,360
What do you do to the different parks 
that.

2977
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:19,320
I can't remember him,
but he shrunk by a whole lot to pull it 

2978
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:19,800
up.
Yeah.

2979
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:24,900
It's very scary because you're carving 
out a land and national monuments for 

2980
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:26,920
privatization.
And there was one that um,

2981
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:30,890
they were,
they were talking about in Alaska that's

2982
02:19:30,891 --> 02:19:34,430
very close to a gigantic salmon fishery.
Trump's shrinks,

2983
02:19:34,431 --> 02:19:39,431
Utah monuments in historic move.
I wonder which one make that bigger 

2984
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:41,120
police or to read it.

2985
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:46,040
If only the sandstone stands,
stones could sing.

2986
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:48,050
Imagine the stories they tell of 
dinosaurs.

2987
02:19:48,051 --> 02:19:51,140
Mammoth hunters and ancient ones known 
as the Anasazi.

2988
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:56,950
All Rome southern Utah.
Over the eons longer for the native 

2989
02:19:56,950 --> 02:19:57,530
Americans struggled to hold their land 
against the Mormon settlers.

2990
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:02,531
Modern life.
And now Donald Trump scroll as president

2991
02:20:02,541 --> 02:20:05,030
trump arrives in Utah.
Monday afternoon.

2992
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:09,260
It's this rocky corner of the wild west 
is a battlefield once again,

2993
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:12,680
but this time the warriors were carried 
briefcases and lawsuits.

2994
02:20:12,681 --> 02:20:15,370
Trump by signing to presidential 
proclamations on Monday,

2995
02:20:15,371 --> 02:20:20,371
shrunk the size of bears ears national 
monument by more than 80 percent and the

2996
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:26,180
grand staircase Escalante National 
Monument by roughly 45 percent.

2997
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:30,770
Fundamentally reshaping the two large 
national monuments.

2998
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,050
Man.
Fuck that guy.

2999
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:34,220
I mean,
what?

3000
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:39,280
Can you give me a why other than to say 
there's got to be an economical 

3001
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:43,740
motivation behind it.
Be Resources has got to be national 

3002
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:45,770
resources got to be minerals or oil or 
something like that.

3003
02:20:45,770 --> 02:20:46,610
So.
And that's my thing.

3004
02:20:46,611 --> 02:20:49,430
Like why?
So if you go to Fox News,

3005
02:20:49,431 --> 02:20:50,480
right?
Every,

3006
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:53,540
every leading above the brake article is
Hillary.

3007
02:20:53,541 --> 02:20:54,790
This hillary.
Why?

3008
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:59,330
Why is that not leading really 
Americans,

3009
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:01,520
their little puppets.
I mean,

3010
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:03,630
this idea that they're there just for 
America.

3011
02:21:03,631 --> 02:21:05,450
No,
you're a puppet of the GOP.

3012
02:21:05,451 --> 02:21:07,940
That's what they are.
Not Really American.

3013
02:21:08,170 --> 02:21:11,510
They're fucking corrupt.
They're corrupt as everybody else's.

3014
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:13,370
They're the worst.
Like that.

3015
02:21:13,371 --> 02:21:14,300
The thing that you,
if you're,

3016
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:17,510
you have blind allegiance towards the 
president when he does stuff like this.

3017
02:21:17,511 --> 02:21:19,120
That's crazy.
You have to call it.

3018
02:21:19,121 --> 02:21:21,140
And some people do like that.
Shepherd.

3019
02:21:21,141 --> 02:21:23,660
What's his name?
Shepard Shepard Smith.

3020
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:24,500
Yeah,
that guy.

3021
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,040
The perfect eyebrows.
He calls the president and I don't know 

3022
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,800
if I've ever seen as eyebrows,
but I'm going to take.

3023
02:21:31,801 --> 02:21:36,801
Seems it seems like he could have been 
one of those guys that was upset at 

3024
02:21:36,801 --> 02:21:37,970
Hillary Clinton up until about 2013.

3025
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:39,120
Yeah.
Um,

3026
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,200
I think,
I think I hear what you're putting down 

3027
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:44,200
there,
but again,

3028
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:44,200
you know,
so people are,

3029
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:48,920
they're losing their mind about tweets.
And then in the monument got cut by 80 

3030
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:50,620
percent and another one by 45 percent.
And I mean,

3031
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:53,940
and that's one example.
I don't know that and I agree with you.

3032
02:21:53,941 --> 02:21:56,510
They are corrupt and what I have found 
myself in,

3033
02:21:56,530 --> 02:22:01,530
again,
what I think is dangerous is that I've 

3034
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:01,530
stopped paying attention and as soon as 
that happens,

3035
02:22:01,530 --> 02:22:03,800
I don't know what the hell is going on.
Yeah.

3036
02:22:03,801 --> 02:22:08,801
That's what happens with a lot of people
and a lot of people just want to eat 

3037
02:22:08,801 --> 02:22:11,591
meat.
You feel like you can't do anything 

3038
02:22:11,591 --> 02:22:11,990
other than vote right.
Boat and protest and you have a job at a

3039
02:22:11,991 --> 02:22:13,730
family.
How do you have time to protest?

3040
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:18,940
And so a lot of people shut out because 
they just don't feel like they don't 

3041
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:21,971
feel like they can represent their 
opinions in a way that's going to be 

3042
02:22:21,971 --> 02:22:24,890
meaningful and impactful and it's just,
it's a terrible.

3043
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:29,430
The job of having one chief monkey,
the controls,

3044
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:32,370
300 plus million people and your 
definition.

3045
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:34,350
Yeah.
And then here's the thing,

3046
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:38,070
if you are the chief monkey,
if they show that you're a liar,

3047
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,830
if they can show,
if there's proof that you're a liar,

3048
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:43,860
should be removed from office.
If you get,

3049
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:46,740
if you are,
if you are in court,

3050
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:52,520
right?
And you swear on a Bible and the you 

3051
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:56,960
commit perjury you'd go to jail.
Like why is swearing into office for the

3052
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:05,030
United States?
Why is that less of a like a a situation

3053
02:23:06,121 --> 02:23:11,121
where you can be charged with perjury 
like that seems to me to be far more 

3054
02:23:11,121 --> 02:23:11,121
significant.
You're,

3055
02:23:11,121 --> 02:23:13,200
you're literally in control of the 
country.

3056
02:23:13,201 --> 02:23:18,201
You can do things like this fucking 
thing that he signed that shrinks these 

3057
02:23:18,201 --> 02:23:21,891
monuments,
these horrible reductions in the power 

3058
02:23:21,891 --> 02:23:24,771
that the EPA has.
The fucking environmental protection 

3059
02:23:24,771 --> 02:23:26,730
agency is to protect our very 
environment.

3060
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:27,050
He's like,
no,

3061
02:23:27,051 --> 02:23:27,230
no,
no.

3062
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:28,530
We don't need that.
We don't even protection.

3063
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:29,820
Trust me,
we got me.

3064
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:35,780
Yeah.
You would think that he would be held 

3065
02:23:35,780 --> 02:23:37,700
more accountable because the stakes are 
so much higher and it affects so many 

3066
02:23:37,700 --> 02:23:37,700
people.
Yeah,

3067
02:23:37,700 --> 02:23:41,040
I mean the amount of lies that he's told
since office or they're stunning and you

3068
02:23:41,041 --> 02:23:46,041
can just get away with them.
You shouldn't be able to get away with 

3069
02:23:46,041 --> 02:23:46,041
lies.
As a president,

3070
02:23:46,041 --> 02:23:47,490
I think lies as a president willingly 
lie.

3071
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,430
There's one thing to be misinformed but 
willingly lying as the president,

3072
02:23:51,431 --> 02:23:56,431
if they can show that you had 
information to the contrary of what 

3073
02:23:56,431 --> 02:23:57,240
you're saying,
you should be removed from office should

3074
02:23:57,241 --> 02:23:59,610
be a disqualifying factor for sure 
percent,

3075
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:05,030
100 percent,
but we've never had someone that lives 

3076
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:05,270
this much.
We just don't know about it.

3077
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:10,670
Well,
no one has been able to be proven to be 

3078
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:10,670
this much of a liar.
We've never had that.

3079
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:11,280
Where someone lies so much.
You're like,

3080
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:16,560
wow.
Like there's a website that was 

3081
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:19,161
documenting the number of times trump 
lied or it was like they documented all 

3082
02:24:20,111 --> 02:24:23,250
of the trump lies over the past year and
it's.

3083
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:28,580
It's crazy.
It's just so frustrating.

3084
02:24:30,271 --> 02:24:33,390
As of June 23rd,
every day.

3085
02:24:33,391 --> 02:24:34,890
Here's a different one.
Yeah,

3086
02:24:35,070 --> 02:24:36,240
I mean,
what's that?

3087
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:41,540
What's the website?
Calls from the New York Times flies on 

3088
02:24:41,540 --> 02:24:44,481
top to scroll up and we could make it 
larger so I could read it here.

3089
02:24:44,730 --> 02:24:45,960
Yeah.
I don't know,

3090
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:46,260
man.

3091
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,060
I don't want to.
I don't even want to read them.

3092
02:24:51,061 --> 02:24:56,061
I'll just get super depressed where the 
only issue I have with that is that 

3093
02:24:56,061 --> 02:24:59,601
people are really quick to jump on that 
bandwagon and all I would say is you 

3094
02:24:59,601 --> 02:25:01,260
should be prepared to have that level of
scrutiny thrown back on yourself.

3095
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:03,200
True.
Because my,

3096
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:05,850
I mean how fucking long,
but everybody else's list B,

3097
02:25:05,870 --> 02:25:10,870
you know,
I mean that's the one thing that 

3098
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:10,870
happened,
like once you get into office,

3099
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:11,190
would that list be the same?
Like if you knew,

3100
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,280
like if I say Andy Stump,
do you swear to take the office of the 

3101
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:20,420
United States president and then to do 
the whole thing hand on the Bible from 

3102
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,390
there on,
you've got to know that you have to keep

3103
02:25:21,391 --> 02:25:23,130
your fucking shit together a hundred 
percent.

3104
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:23,950
You can't lie.

3105
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,300
Yeah,
I agree.

3106
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:26,710
And like I said,
I'm not,

3107
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:32,130
I'm just,
I wish people would take that level of 

3108
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:32,130
accountability on themselves as well 
too.

3109
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:34,720
I think the country would be a better 
place if people acted as if there was an

3110
02:25:34,721 --> 02:25:38,710
organization ready to write down a list 
of their deficiencies at any given time.

3111
02:25:38,711 --> 02:25:39,640
I think you're totally right.

3112
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:44,990
I think you're totally right,
but I think that what we're seeing is 

3113
02:25:44,990 --> 02:25:48,830
for the first time,
like a president that is showing why we 

3114
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:53,250
have a real flaw with this idea of one 
person being chief

3115
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:56,260
dog.
I think he scared the piss out of people

3116
02:25:56,350 --> 02:26:01,350
and usually a topic swings back around 
to like nuclear weapons or nuclear war 

3117
02:26:01,350 --> 02:26:04,801
and like,
can this one guy really go and just hit 

3118
02:26:04,801 --> 02:26:04,830
the button while also the real problem?

3119
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:06,770
Ms Dot Muniz.is
very strategic.

3120
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,500
I mean he's thinking.
He thought about reelection.

3121
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:12,110
He filed for reelection almost 
immediately or did he really?

3122
02:26:12,170 --> 02:26:14,600
Yeah,
there's a strategy for that too.

3123
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:19,810
Meaning that any like,
I forget exactly what the strategy is,

3124
02:26:20,301 --> 02:26:25,301
but it's in terms of how people are 
addressing him and how people are 

3125
02:26:25,301 --> 02:26:27,170
talking against him because they'll.
They would be running for president.

3126
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:32,770
They would also be if they're running 
for president because he is a 

3127
02:26:32,770 --> 02:26:35,171
presidential candidate.
There's like certain rules to behavior 

3128
02:26:35,171 --> 02:26:35,840
and this is a very calculated.
Yeah,

3129
02:26:36,290 --> 02:26:37,770
chest movement.
It's a very.

3130
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:42,800
It's a big chess move,
so this is what disturbs me the most 

3131
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,700
about North Korea because there's one 
way to ensure that people want to keep 

3132
02:26:46,551 --> 02:26:51,551
the same president and that that way is 
wore it like once you are in a war,

3133
02:26:51,860 --> 02:26:56,860
say if we are three plus years in,
he's campaigning for president again and

3134
02:26:58,641 --> 02:27:03,641
it escalates with North Korea.
That propaganda escalates the lies the 

3135
02:27:03,641 --> 02:27:06,020
bullshit and who knows,
who knows what the fuck happens and then

3136
02:27:06,021 --> 02:27:11,021
all of a sudden there's actual military 
action that is going to ensure a 

3137
02:27:11,021 --> 02:27:11,021
reelection,

3138
02:27:12,200 --> 02:27:17,200
I think or would I could see that or it 
would flip everybody against him.

3139
02:27:18,951 --> 02:27:20,840
I could see a swing in both ways.
It could.

3140
02:27:20,841 --> 02:27:23,750
It depends on.
It depends on how scared people aren't.

3141
02:27:23,751 --> 02:27:25,700
Depends on if we get attacked.
If we get attacked,

3142
02:27:25,701 --> 02:27:30,701
I guarantee you he wins again because 
nobody's going to want Bernie to in 

3143
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:34,271
this.
I'm going to go there and I'm going to 

3144
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:36,291
promise them equality.
I think if we got attacked by North 

3145
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,170
Korea,
yeah,

3146
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,790
his escalation might be nucular in and 
level and then it's.

3147
02:27:40,791 --> 02:27:42,800
We're all.
We're glowing in the dark.

3148
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:45,680
If that shit works,
if this stuff works,

3149
02:27:45,830 --> 02:27:47,090
I don't know.
That's I tell you what,

3150
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:48,470
you want to talk about a war that I 
would want.

3151
02:27:48,471 --> 02:27:49,700
No part of.
North Korea.

3152
02:27:49,730 --> 02:27:50,860
Oh,
Daddy.

3153
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:51,920
Yeah.
No,

3154
02:27:51,921 --> 02:27:55,610
thank you.
Rugged terrain controlled environments.

3155
02:27:55,611 --> 02:27:57,290
No,
thank you very much.

3156
02:27:57,291 --> 02:28:02,291
And they got some big old army's just 
call on Elon Musk and sending the 

3157
02:28:02,291 --> 02:28:02,291
drones.

3158
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:07,500
Those Boston dynamic drones that could 
do backflips get those fucking new 

3159
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:12,101
robots that they have to tell you what.
Right now the drones are carrying the 

3160
02:28:12,101 --> 02:28:12,101
lion's share.
Are they?

3161
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,280
Um,
yeah.

3162
02:28:13,370 --> 02:28:15,890
I don't know if people realize how much.
I mean it's,

3163
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:19,520
they are carrying probably the lion 
share of the kinetic activity throughout

3164
02:28:19,521 --> 02:28:20,290
the globe.
I mean they're,

3165
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:25,240
they're doing as as they can with that 
really know like how much drone activity

3166
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:28,420
things going on that we don't know about
that we don't know about.

3167
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:33,440
I have absolutely no idea but about that
would have to imagine that it is.

3168
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:35,840
I would have to imagine that it's 
substantial.

3169
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:41,230
It's,
it's less risk from a risk to force 

3170
02:28:41,230 --> 02:28:45,821
perspective because if you're looking at
it as you're the person who has the 

3171
02:28:45,821 --> 02:28:49,841
drone,
it's less risk because you're not 

3172
02:28:49,841 --> 02:28:51,550
putting a physical human being at risk 
or launching a forest or an asset or a 

3173
02:28:51,550 --> 02:28:52,370
helicopter that could fill in the blank 
go wrong.

3174
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:58,690
And then on the other side of that risk 
though is that how are you really sure 

3175
02:28:58,690 --> 02:28:59,420
the person that you're going after is 
there.

3176
02:28:59,421 --> 02:29:04,421
Are you really sure that they're alone?
Are you really sure that you can action 

3177
02:29:04,421 --> 02:29:04,421
this target in a way that's not going to
have collateral damage?

3178
02:29:04,421 --> 02:29:05,830
So there's two different tides of,
uh,

3179
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:11,470
two different sides of the risk and I 
think that right now at the American 

3180
02:29:11,470 --> 02:29:16,000
populace would probably rather not see 
flag draped coffins and just assume that

3181
02:29:18,021 --> 02:29:19,220
business is being taken care of.

3182
02:29:22,250 --> 02:29:26,220
So disturbing the idea of that getting 
turned around on us.

3183
02:29:26,221 --> 02:29:31,221
And even more disturbing,
I think about it from that perspective 

3184
02:29:31,221 --> 02:29:34,101
of somebody launched a Tomahawk missile 
into downtown or not Tom Hall because 

3185
02:29:34,101 --> 02:29:37,511
they're not on fire.
How far they go or j dot m or fill in 

3186
02:29:37,511 --> 02:29:40,250
the blank in an La.
China flies a drone over or whatever.

3187
02:29:40,251 --> 02:29:45,251
North Korea flies a drone over and they 
just juiced the US bank building in 

3188
02:29:45,251 --> 02:29:46,400
downtown La.
How would we respond to that?

3189
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:48,980
It's,
I mean,

3190
02:29:48,981 --> 02:29:53,981
I sit back and I freaked.
I kick my.

3191
02:29:54,291 --> 02:29:59,291
I just do mental judo in my head trying 
to figure out what the Hell I did with 

3192
02:29:59,631 --> 02:30:02,900
almost 20 years of my life and did it 
actually do anything important and where

3193
02:30:02,901 --> 02:30:07,901
whereas everything going and like,
what the fuck was I doing for so long it

3194
02:30:08,361 --> 02:30:11,020
I struggled with it quite often.
How so?

3195
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:17,110
I worry that.
So my biggest fear is that my children 

3196
02:30:17,151 --> 02:30:19,220
would have to finish something that I 
started,

3197
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:24,880
but I also think that the success that 
we had as a military drove the creation 

3198
02:30:26,961 --> 02:30:30,530
of the enemy that we're fighting.
We took an organization that was largely

3199
02:30:30,531 --> 02:30:35,531
geographically co located and we were so
effective at finding them when they met 

3200
02:30:35,531 --> 02:30:37,640
in groups of people that they splintered
and they spread apart,

3201
02:30:38,150 --> 02:30:43,150
which is,
you know why now it's more effective to 

3202
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:43,150
fly a drone over as an example.
Yemen,

3203
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:47,921
I have no idea if that's happening,
but it's easier to have a drone over 

3204
02:30:47,921 --> 02:30:49,250
Yemen than an aircraft carrier sitting 
off the coast to do something about it.

3205
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:53,900
So now we have a an enemy that was in a 
couple of countries that's now in 30,

3206
02:30:53,901 --> 02:30:54,500
40,
50,

3207
02:30:54,501 --> 02:30:59,501
60,
70 countries and you can't really cut 

3208
02:30:59,501 --> 02:30:59,501
the head off of that snake anymore.

3209
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:04,660
And I look at did I do anything that 
made my kids lives safer to do anything 

3210
02:31:07,701 --> 02:31:12,701
too major daughter's life safer?
And I would say in the moment I feel I 

3211
02:31:12,701 --> 02:31:14,030
feel like I had a difference in the 
moment,

3212
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:18,140
but I think in the grand scale of thing,
looking for things,

3213
02:31:18,141 --> 02:31:21,180
looking back that everything that I was 
involved with,

3214
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:26,720
I almost think that the tide is washed 
it away and it's very frustrating 

3215
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:31,700
because I was.
I was only able to impact the 

3216
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:32,110
battlespace that I was physically in.
Right.

3217
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:33,810
But imagine if you weren't there.
Well,

3218
02:31:33,811 --> 02:31:36,520
so and so and I imagine for others like 
you weren't there.

3219
02:31:36,570 --> 02:31:40,200
The role that we played I think is 
absolutely essential and looking back on

3220
02:31:40,201 --> 02:31:45,201
my career,
I think the role of what I did was to 

3221
02:31:45,201 --> 02:31:47,961
create space and a barrier and a 
boundary so people in this country can 

3222
02:31:47,961 --> 02:31:51,900
be complete cunts and complain about 
their rights and freedoms and oppression

3223
02:31:51,901 --> 02:31:52,730
and inequality,
all that stuff.

3224
02:31:52,730 --> 02:31:56,610
We have to create an environment where 
those things can thrive and flourish and

3225
02:31:56,611 --> 02:32:00,150
be in a melting pot and figure out who 
we are so we have to have that role,

3226
02:32:00,810 --> 02:32:05,810
but I just would frustrates me is seeing
what's going on in the country or in 

3227
02:32:05,810 --> 02:32:10,581
seeing what's going on in the world and 
thinking that I was involved in 

3228
02:32:10,581 --> 02:32:11,310
something that was important,
but just realizing all I was was a point

3229
02:32:11,311 --> 02:32:16,311
in time is sticking my finger in the dam
that had 15 different water spouts 

3230
02:32:16,311 --> 02:32:18,060
coming out of it.
So you didn't have a total solution,

3231
02:32:18,061 --> 02:32:20,670
but you certainly mitigated the problem.
We admitted a good problem,

3232
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:25,200
only been in that moment in time and if 
you weren't there to mitigate it in that

3233
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:30,201
moment in time,
who knows how much it could have 

3234
02:32:30,201 --> 02:32:30,201
escalated,
who knows,

3235
02:32:30,201 --> 02:32:33,350
but who knows if the time that I was 
there mitigated the problem or the 

3236
02:32:33,350 --> 02:32:38,220
football down the road and made it worse
and it's a problem that your kids are 

3237
02:32:38,220 --> 02:32:39,150
mine are going to have to solve in the 
future and I don't know those answers.

3238
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:40,980
I don't.
I really.

3239
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:46,360
I was 100 percent and still am 100 
percent committed and very proud of the 

3240
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:49,941
actions that I took because at the end 
of the day I made the decisions of my 

3241
02:32:49,941 --> 02:32:53,511
actions.
I got to where I'm super lucky and 

3242
02:32:53,511 --> 02:32:55,701
privileged where the American flag on my
uniform and I got to be the example and 

3243
02:32:55,701 --> 02:32:57,690
the beacon of what I wanted the US to 
be.

3244
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:02,960
Every time that I got.
I mean I've encountered people didn't 

3245
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:02,960
know what the US was.
They'd never seen an American before and

3246
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:07,641
how I acted was the u s to them.
So I think it was important and I'm 

3247
02:33:07,641 --> 02:33:11,091
proud of those things,
but I just hope at the end of the day I 

3248
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:11,091
made a difference,
you know,

3249
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:13,620
instead of trying to run up hill on a 
soft sand berm and go nowhere.

3250
02:33:13,710 --> 02:33:16,050
Isn't that part of the problem with 
military action too?

3251
02:33:16,051 --> 02:33:18,930
So you don't really know what the result
is ultimately going to be.

3252
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:20,640
I mean,
everybody hopes in urine,

3253
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:22,470
you know,
there's two sides,

3254
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:23,130
right?
Correct.

3255
02:33:23,190 --> 02:33:28,190
They both hope that they win.
You don't really know what the fuck the 

3256
02:33:28,190 --> 02:33:31,160
results can be and it's not a difference
in commitment on either one of those 

3257
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:34,431
sides.
People need to understand that as well 

3258
02:33:34,431 --> 02:33:36,201
too.
It's not that I was more committed than 

3259
02:33:36,201 --> 02:33:37,290
the people that we were engaging with in
with on a battlefield or anywhere in the

3260
02:33:37,291 --> 02:33:39,180
world.
It's a difference of opinion.

3261
02:33:39,270 --> 02:33:44,270
They believe what they believe just as 
much as you and I believe what we 

3262
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:46,600
believe,
whatever the issue may be and who.

3263
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:47,540
I don't know.
I'm not,

3264
02:33:47,570 --> 02:33:48,810
I'm not.
I can't say who's right.

3265
02:33:49,150 --> 02:33:54,150
You know,
I just did the best that I could do to 

3266
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,150
try to fight for what it is that I 
believed in and I don't know,

3267
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:56,100
it's tough at the end of the day to sit 
back and think and be like,

3268
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:59,160
God damn it.
What I do with my time.

3269
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:02,700
Yeah.
It is a,

3270
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:08,660
it's a daunting feeling to think that 
there's never going to be a time where 

3271
02:34:08,660 --> 02:34:10,590
we really are a peace worldwide.
I don't think we ever will be,

3272
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:13,080
but I also don't think we ever have 
been.

3273
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:15,330
No,
I don't think we ever have been either.

3274
02:34:15,331 --> 02:34:17,480
But do you think we ever would be.
We were to,

3275
02:34:17,560 --> 02:34:18,190
were attacked.

3276
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:19,480
You remember that last,
uh,

3277
02:34:19,810 --> 02:34:22,090
one of the Reagan's speeches were talked
about,

3278
02:34:22,120 --> 02:34:23,890
uh,
how quickly we would put our differences

3279
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:26,410
aside if we were attacked by an alien 
force from another world.

3280
02:34:27,130 --> 02:34:28,850
I think it would change some things 
instead of

3281
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:33,870
being local in San Diego and having or 
an la the flags up if the entire world 

3282
02:34:33,870 --> 02:34:35,320
was challenged with something that we 
had to come together with.

3283
02:34:35,380 --> 02:34:40,380
I bet you that would be that feeling and
it would cross probably any and all 

3284
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:40,380
borders.

3285
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:42,580
The UFO dorks though they grabbed that.
They thought,

3286
02:34:42,581 --> 02:34:45,130
oh my God,
this is proof proof.

3287
02:34:45,131 --> 02:34:47,790
Reagan knows Reagan knows,
but I,

3288
02:34:47,791 --> 02:34:51,220
I do feel like almost like what we were 
talking about with nine slash 11,

3289
02:34:51,221 --> 02:34:56,221
right?
Like that being attacked made people 

3290
02:34:56,221 --> 02:34:57,970
more,
more acceptable to each other more.

3291
02:34:57,971 --> 02:35:00,250
They felt more connected to each other.
You know,

3292
02:35:00,251 --> 02:35:01,750
let people in front of you on the 
highway,

3293
02:35:01,751 --> 02:35:02,380
that kind of shit.

3294
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:07,760
Hey,
when you have your mortality in your 

3295
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:07,760
life thrown in front of you,
I think he creates a pallet that is much

3296
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:11,100
easier to appreciate the little things 
and I don't think most people experience

3297
02:35:11,101 --> 02:35:11,310
that.

3298
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:16,350
Is it weird for you when you spend so 
much time in combat and spend so much 

3299
02:35:16,481 --> 02:35:21,481
time overseas to come back and see all 
these people that really don't know the 

3300
02:35:21,551 --> 02:35:26,551
darkest side of the world currently mean
people have a view of what the earth is 

3301
02:35:27,791 --> 02:35:30,820
in 2017 and if you live in San Francisco
and all you do is,

3302
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:35,821
you know,
you work at Silicon Valley and hanging 

3303
02:35:35,821 --> 02:35:36,130
out in the tech industry,
you think that this is the world in 2017

3304
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:39,580
because this is your world.
This is zero insulated look like we were

3305
02:35:39,581 --> 02:35:44,581
talking about.
You don't really know the world until 

3306
02:35:44,581 --> 02:35:44,581
you go into the forest.
You go into the forest,

3307
02:35:44,581 --> 02:35:44,581
you go,
oh,

3308
02:35:44,581 --> 02:35:46,360
this is the world to the back.
Country is still.

3309
02:35:46,361 --> 02:35:47,560
The world is just,
Oh,

3310
02:35:47,561 --> 02:35:52,561
this is what it's really like when we 
don't have these artificial structures 

3311
02:35:52,561 --> 02:35:54,910
and when you spent so much time in 
combat and you come over and you see all

3312
02:35:54,911 --> 02:35:59,911
these people that are fighting over 
these insignificant things and 

3313
02:35:59,911 --> 02:36:03,780
squabbling about the use of the 
preferred gender pronouns and all this 

3314
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,950
crazy shit that people find significant 
today.

3315
02:36:07,310 --> 02:36:12,310
It is very challenging for me to listen 
to the things that people feel are 

3316
02:36:16,310 --> 02:36:21,310
important in the lack of.
I would say it's the lack of what I 

3317
02:36:21,310 --> 02:36:25,541
would consider to be perspective and 
it's funny if you do say I did 17 years 

3318
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:28,400
in the military.
Let's say a guy does 20 years,

3319
02:36:28,460 --> 02:36:31,130
you actually don't spend that much time 
in combat.

3320
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:36,760
Let's say you do a six month deployment,
you're working even at every night of 

3321
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:38,210
that six month deployment,
which isn't gonna be the case,

3322
02:36:38,211 --> 02:36:43,211
so every other night,
so now you're working 90 days of that 

3323
02:36:43,211 --> 02:36:46,451
time.
You might spend 30 minutes in combat in 

3324
02:36:46,451 --> 02:36:46,451
those 90 days,
multiply that by five,

3325
02:36:46,451 --> 02:36:46,451
six,
seven,

3326
02:36:46,451 --> 02:36:48,140
eight,
nine deployments in 20 years.

3327
02:36:48,141 --> 02:36:53,060
That's your total time combined in an 
actual combat environment.

3328
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:58,120
Not a theater of war,
but a combat environment where you're 

3329
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:00,611
directly involved in it,
but that time period for me changes the 

3330
02:37:00,611 --> 02:37:01,460
way that I view the world.

3331
02:37:02,480 --> 02:37:07,480
Not only that time period,
but just the time spent in those 

3332
02:37:07,480 --> 02:37:09,911
countries in seeing what's the standard 
in other countries and what's the 

3333
02:37:09,911 --> 02:37:13,001
standard here and when I hear,
and again I think we talked about 

3334
02:37:13,001 --> 02:37:13,001
before,
I,

3335
02:37:13,001 --> 02:37:16,870
you know,
people talk about inequality or 

3336
02:37:16,870 --> 02:37:20,710
oppression here in this country and I'll
be the first to admit that there's 

3337
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:22,190
inequality which is fun because there's 
inequality everywhere.

3338
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:25,490
But let's take a little bit of 
perspective here.

3339
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:29,750
If you are fortunate enough to wake up 
in the United States of America,

3340
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:35,260
the water that you sit down on the 
toilet over to take a shit is cleaner 

3341
02:37:35,260 --> 02:37:37,610
than most of the water people on Earth 
are going to have access to.

3342
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:43,240
You go to starbucks and you may pay more
per ounce for a cup of coffee,

3343
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:48,431
for the fluid.
Then you do the gas coming out of your 

3344
02:37:48,431 --> 02:37:50,831
pump going into your car that exceeds 
the annual income of most people on the 

3345
02:37:51,741 --> 02:37:52,710
face of the planet.

3346
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:57,720
Are you living in a first world country 
where instead of spending your time 

3347
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:02,561
trying to find that water,
you get to spend your time sleeping in 

3348
02:38:02,561 --> 02:38:03,710
line in front of the apple store,
waiting for the new iphone to come out,

3349
02:38:04,370 --> 02:38:08,270
and then you have the balls to bitch 
about how bad you have it.

3350
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:13,870
That to me is a super tough pill to 
swallow because you want to talk about 

3351
02:38:13,870 --> 02:38:17,360
oppression and suppression of freedom of
speech.

3352
02:38:17,361 --> 02:38:22,361
I've seen street corners.
They're still red from lopping dudes 

3353
02:38:22,361 --> 02:38:25,241
heads off because they voiced opinion 
that was counter to the opinion of the 

3354
02:38:25,241 --> 02:38:29,320
day.
That will change your perspective on 

3355
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:30,140
whether or not words hurt you and you 
know,

3356
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,360
what rights actually mean.
And you'll be like,

3357
02:38:32,361 --> 02:38:37,361
you know what?
What you say is actually really 

3358
02:38:37,361 --> 02:38:37,361
offended.
You know,

3359
02:38:37,361 --> 02:38:40,150
it's offensive to me,
but I'm glad we live in a place where 

3360
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:40,150
you can say those things.

3361
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:43,540
Moving on with my day.
How much does that changed your 

3362
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:43,850
perspective on human beings when you're 
in those environments?

3363
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:49,450
Uh,
what you think a human being actually 

3364
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:51,641
is?
I have an inherent distrust of most of 

3365
02:38:51,641 --> 02:38:52,500
most human beings.
If I'm being totally honest,

3366
02:38:52,660 --> 02:38:57,660
I don't want to say that I'm antisocial.
My wife would say that she probably 

3367
02:38:57,660 --> 02:38:59,840
wishes that I was more social,
but I just kind of just take a step back

3368
02:38:59,841 --> 02:39:04,670
and just try to avoid interactions with 
just about everybody that I encountered.

3369
02:39:04,760 --> 02:39:08,180
While I would imagine that your spectrum
is so much wider than the average person

3370
02:39:08,181 --> 02:39:10,970
spectrum in terms of the atrocities that
people are capable of committing,

3371
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,610
you've seen mean most of the time,
right?

3372
02:39:13,611 --> 02:39:18,611
You're operating in this one small 
little sort of village in the spectrum 

3373
02:39:18,611 --> 02:39:19,820
that most people are that are in 
civilization.

3374
02:39:19,821 --> 02:39:22,700
You're in this one little tiny area,
but you've seen the full thing.

3375
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:24,770
I mean,
you've seen horrible,

3376
02:39:24,771 --> 02:39:25,920
horrible shit.
Yeah.

3377
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:31,960
That's got to mean there's no way that 
wouldn't have some sort of no effect on 

3378
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:33,380
how you would approach people.
Like I said,

3379
02:39:33,381 --> 02:39:38,381
I have to.
It puts me in a position where I almost 

3380
02:39:38,381 --> 02:39:40,271
have to sit back and I have to bite my 
tongue because I don't share the 

3381
02:39:40,271 --> 02:39:42,980
opinions that most people share because 
if the military service that I have gave

3382
02:39:42,981 --> 02:39:47,981
me anything,
I think it gave me a different 

3383
02:39:47,981 --> 02:39:50,111
perspective on the world and it's only 
because I traveled to more of it than I 

3384
02:39:50,111 --> 02:39:52,460
think most people get the chance to do 
and I got to see more of it.

3385
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:55,730
Not Through my phone and my instagram 
screen,

3386
02:39:55,850 --> 02:40:00,850
but through my own eyes and that all it 
really did is just changed my value 

3387
02:40:00,850 --> 02:40:03,500
perspective of life,
of the little things.

3388
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:04,730
Uh,
it,

3389
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:06,170
it just,
it makes it,

3390
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:11,290
it makes it hard sometimes.
It was there like a single or any 

3391
02:40:11,290 --> 02:40:14,040
significant moments that you can recall 
that shifted the way you

3392
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:19,040
think about things.
In what perspective?

3393
02:40:19,570 --> 02:40:23,530
Just knowing the people capable of 
horrible shit.

3394
02:40:25,010 --> 02:40:30,010
I think the times they got me the most 
on that is where you would see adults 

3395
02:40:30,890 --> 02:40:33,230
talking kids into becoming suicide 
bombers.

3396
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:38,440
Just the evil,
evil motherfucker who instead of having 

3397
02:40:38,631 --> 02:40:43,631
the stones to come and face you will go 
and try to talk some innocent kid and 

3398
02:40:43,631 --> 02:40:47,171
strapping on a suicide vest or a suicide
belt and walk into a crowd and clack it 

3399
02:40:47,331 --> 02:40:48,080
off.
I mean that.

3400
02:40:48,440 --> 02:40:53,440
That is,
to me the most insidious type of evil 

3401
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:53,440
because

3402
02:40:54,430 --> 02:40:57,070
they're not willing to actually engage 
in themselves.

3403
02:40:57,071 --> 02:41:02,071
They want to prey on victims and I,
that's if I have anything I hate in the 

3404
02:41:02,071 --> 02:41:05,041
world,
is that it's the victimization of 

3405
02:41:05,041 --> 02:41:06,811
innocent people watching that and seeing
that that forever throws a different 

3406
02:41:06,821 --> 02:41:11,821
shade on your glasses for sure.
Just knowing that people are capable of 

3407
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:11,821
doing it.
I am.

3408
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:14,680
I am not surprised by any behooven human
behavior that I see,

3409
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:16,990
which doesn't necessarily make me any 
more prepared,

3410
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:22,650
but I also probably in the back of my 
head have a different thought process 

3411
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:23,380
when I enter into situations.
It's not like,

3412
02:41:23,381 --> 02:41:23,830
oh,
hey,

3413
02:41:23,831 --> 02:41:28,831
everything's going to be great.
Like I get my plan to kill everybody 

3414
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:28,831
first and then I relax a little bit.

3415
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:29,300
Yeah.
Who,

3416
02:41:29,830 --> 02:41:30,340
who,
uh,

3417
02:41:30,370 --> 02:41:32,920
who said that?
Tim Kennedy.

3418
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:39,650
Yeah.
Have have a plan to kill everybody in 

3419
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:39,650
the room,
but.

3420
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:40,450
And that's the thing,
and it was it mcmaster's.

3421
02:41:40,930 --> 02:41:41,920
It might've been,
yeah,

3422
02:41:41,921 --> 02:41:44,830
it would be a be friendly,
be courteous,

3423
02:41:44,831 --> 02:41:49,831
but have a plan to kill everybody in the
room and if you're around human behavior

3424
02:41:49,871 --> 02:41:51,760
that would put people on their heels

3425
02:41:51,850 --> 02:41:54,070
and turn them white in the face long 
enough,

3426
02:41:54,071 --> 02:41:55,630
that is going to become your default 
position.

3427
02:41:55,631 --> 02:41:58,780
Whether or not you want it to be or not.
I'm not in a violent person.

3428
02:41:58,781 --> 02:42:00,910
I'm probably the last person you could 
draw into violence,

3429
02:42:00,911 --> 02:42:05,911
but I'm not also surprised by violence 
and I'll react to it accordingly if I 

3430
02:42:06,071 --> 02:42:07,540
encounter it because it doesn't surprise
me.

3431
02:42:07,950 --> 02:42:09,780
Right.
So yeah,

3432
02:42:10,650 --> 02:42:13,150
I would just think that.
I mean,

3433
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:18,170
I've just got to believe that a person 
like you that has experienced that 

3434
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:21,500
insane level of cruelty and evil,
that your view of the world,

3435
02:42:22,290 --> 02:42:27,290
that you would be really intolerant to 
people that do have this sort of narrow 

3436
02:42:27,290 --> 02:42:31,480
minded view of what the United States is
and our,

3437
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:36,540
our role in the world and how the rest 
of the world views us and who the rest 

3438
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,700
of the world is and I'm incredibly 
appreciative that they live in

3439
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:43,800
place that provides an environment for 
them that they can have that narrow 

3440
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:47,671
minded view.
I'd rather them be that than have that 

3441
02:42:47,671 --> 02:42:52,101
place not exist.
You can be the biggest asshole you want 

3442
02:42:52,101 --> 02:42:52,101
to and I'm going to sit back and be 
grateful that,

3443
02:42:52,101 --> 02:42:53,160
that place on earth

3444
02:42:53,530 --> 02:42:55,180
for you to be like that.
You know,

3445
02:42:55,181 --> 02:43:00,181
and I understand the idea of the non 
interventionist foreign policy that if 

3446
02:43:00,181 --> 02:43:01,600
you know,
we'd never were in these places,

3447
02:43:01,601 --> 02:43:05,140
we would never have issues and I just,
just 100 percent false.

3448
02:43:05,170 --> 02:43:07,090
This is just another way to look at 
yourself as a victim.

3449
02:43:07,630 --> 02:43:08,770
Is it?
I think so.

3450
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:10,360
In my opinion.
Yes you can.

3451
02:43:10,361 --> 02:43:12,070
It's easier to blow,
well if we didn't do this

3452
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:14,380
then they wouldn't do that.
No.

3453
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:19,530
How about real evil does exist and there
are always going to be people who want 

3454
02:43:19,530 --> 02:43:20,320
to do something about that.
Regardless.

3455
02:43:20,321 --> 02:43:22,180
If you're a pacifist,
you're a Catholic,

3456
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:27,450
fill in the blank,
you will have your access somewhere on 

3457
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:27,450
earth and they're coming for you.
Well,

3458
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:32,191
it's also those parts of the world in 
particular are so ancient and people 

3459
02:43:32,191 --> 02:43:35,791
have been living there for so long.
I believe that they have the echoes of 

3460
02:43:35,791 --> 02:43:38,440
the past and them so deeply embedded in 
their culture and their actions.

3461
02:43:38,800 --> 02:43:43,800
I mean you're,
you're talking about parts of the world 

3462
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:46,081
that really.
They've had people living there for 

3463
02:43:46,081 --> 02:43:46,081
five,
6,000

3464
02:43:46,081 --> 02:43:48,601
years and the,
the ancient barbaric instincts of those 

3465
02:43:49,661 --> 02:43:54,661
people just have got to be those.
Those echoes have got to be sort of 

3466
02:43:54,761 --> 02:43:58,720
reverberating through those cultures.
Some of them are very interesting.

3467
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:03,780
I think one of the biggest difference 
differences that I saw between Iraq and 

3468
02:44:04,271 --> 02:44:08,530
Afghanistan and the United States and 
you know a couple actually no def,

3469
02:44:08,980 --> 02:44:13,980
definitely those two countries in the 
Middle East is that there's just a 

3470
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:13,980
different appreciation for life.

3471
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:19,350
They,
there's less of a value of life because 

3472
02:44:19,350 --> 02:44:22,270
I think they almost find or expect that 
it's going to just end sooner.

3473
02:44:22,271 --> 02:44:26,920
It's very,
very different culturally and yeah,

3474
02:44:26,921 --> 02:44:31,921
I don't know.
I don't know if that oil in water will 

3475
02:44:31,921 --> 02:44:34,861
mix or if ever can mix or we need to 
have a third party that acts as 

3476
02:44:34,861 --> 02:44:36,280
something in between that allows us to 
gel or man,

3477
02:44:36,310 --> 02:44:37,270
I don't know,
it's.

3478
02:44:37,660 --> 02:44:39,520
I don't have a solution for it,
that's for sure.

3479
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:43,210
And when you look at like how long there
has been conflict in the Middle East,

3480
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:46,180
it almost seems like an insurmountable 
issue.

3481
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:48,790
There's been conflict with man since the
history of man,

3482
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:50,500
right?
I mean,

3483
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:52,870
and so I say I think we're in a forever 
war right now.

3484
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:55,360
We probably were in a forever war before
it just.

3485
02:44:55,361 --> 02:45:00,361
I think the face of warfare has changed 
along the way and the access to 

3486
02:45:00,361 --> 02:45:01,480
information about that has drastically 
increased,

3487
02:45:01,481 --> 02:45:03,100
was changes people's perception about 
it,

3488
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:03,910
right.

3489
02:45:03,910 --> 02:45:06,070
Like we're always involved in some sort 
of a conflict,

3490
02:45:06,071 --> 02:45:11,071
but we think of as a war is when we have
our troops over there are citizens over 

3491
02:45:13,391 --> 02:45:14,530
there and listed.
Then we said,

3492
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:16,150
okay,
well now we're actually at war.

3493
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:17,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

3494
02:45:17,301 --> 02:45:20,620
And this war especially what's going on 
in Afghanistan.

3495
02:45:20,621 --> 02:45:22,440
It's been going on for so long,
you know,

3496
02:45:22,750 --> 02:45:25,720
coming up on 17 years.
That's so crazy.

3497
02:45:25,721 --> 02:45:27,940
Yup.
And what's happening over there?

3498
02:45:28,060 --> 02:45:29,530
I mean,
what are we accomplishing?

3499
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:35,580
A.
I don't have a complete answer for that 

3500
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:37,711
in my opinion.
I would say that they are trying to do 

3501
02:45:37,711 --> 02:45:40,441
their best to stabilize that region of 
the world by supporting the government 

3502
02:45:41,621 --> 02:45:44,200
would be my best.
Chuck just murderous,

3503
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:47,170
murderous in the sense of not being able
to describe it properly,

3504
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:52,050
explanation of what's going on.
Man and Iraq is the same way.

3505
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:55,420
Don't think for a second that we ever 
had boots off of the ground in Iraq.

3506
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:00,480
It's just talked about a lot less.
We still have a presence there that 

3507
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:01,510
people don't understand.
We still have a presence in Korea.

3508
02:46:01,990 --> 02:46:06,990
We still have a presence in Europe.
That's how long you have to stay if 

3509
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:09,010
you're willing to invest the time for 
stabilization,

3510
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:14,020
which the US military I would argue is 
not very good at those types of 

3511
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:14,390
operations.
You can do it,

3512
02:46:14,990 --> 02:46:19,990
but you could also probably do open 
heart surgery with a shovel to it 

3513
02:46:19,990 --> 02:46:19,990
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to 
be the cleanest.

3514
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:25,420
So you should probably have a military 
and then you should probably have some 

3515
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:26,670
sort of fix up crew.
Yeah.

3516
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:31,840
Uh,
I mean I think they try to do that with 

3517
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:31,840
all the,
uh,

3518
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:32,660
non government organizations or other 
government organizations.

3519
02:46:32,661 --> 02:46:34,610
I just think it's really difficult.
And in you know,

3520
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:35,900
in the Middle East,
like you said,

3521
02:46:35,901 --> 02:46:39,200
you're talking about people who have 
been there for five and 6,000

3522
02:46:39,230 --> 02:46:44,230
years,
this 17 years that we've had a presence 

3523
02:46:44,230 --> 02:46:45,850
there and they're like,
talk to me later sun when it's at 1700.

3524
02:46:47,390 --> 02:46:48,740
I don't know how the solution for it at 
all.

3525
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:49,400
I mean,
it's,

3526
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:54,050
these are the things I think about.
The solution might be moved to a town of

3527
02:46:54,051 --> 02:46:55,450
22,000
people here.

3528
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:56,540
God Damn Right.
It is.

3529
02:46:56,720 --> 02:47:01,280
It might be just disengage.
I do better somebody enjoy your time.

3530
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:03,180
I do better with it there,
but I mean it's,

3531
02:47:03,650 --> 02:47:07,370
I'd spend an inordinate time amount of 
time thinking about that stuff,

3532
02:47:07,371 --> 02:47:11,270
trying to make sense of that,
that amount of time in my life.

3533
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:16,330
How could you not?
It's 20 years of your existence on 

3534
02:47:16,330 --> 02:47:16,330
planet earth almost.
Damn,

3535
02:47:16,330 --> 02:47:16,840
that's a lot of time.
Nope.

3536
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:19,340
And it probably would have been more if 
you didn't get shot.

3537
02:47:20,210 --> 02:47:24,890
Well actually nursed it out for eight 
more years after I got shot.

3538
02:47:24,891 --> 02:47:26,780
I did another deployment after I got 
shot,

3539
02:47:26,781 --> 02:47:28,740
which was probably not the best call,
uh,

3540
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:34,000
because I had some residual effects from
it and almost gotten to the point where 

3541
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:34,310
it's like,
okay,

3542
02:47:34,311 --> 02:47:36,620
I need to call a helicopter in and come 
pick me up because I'm,

3543
02:47:36,770 --> 02:47:38,720
I'm inhibiting the other people that I 
was with.

3544
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:40,580
Wow.
I didn't want to be done.

3545
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:43,280
I mean I got shot.
I got shot in 2005,

3546
02:47:43,340 --> 02:47:48,340
so I was 27 super,
super young in comparison to where I am 

3547
02:47:50,571 --> 02:47:54,410
now at a place I wanted to be operating 
at a level that I wanted to be operating

3548
02:47:54,411 --> 02:47:55,760
at and then,
you know,

3549
02:47:55,761 --> 02:48:00,761
I'm in an Indycar,
do an 800 around the track and it's 

3550
02:48:00,761 --> 02:48:00,761
like,
oops,

3551
02:48:00,761 --> 02:48:03,880
just put it in reverse by accident.
There goes the tranny down on the track 

3552
02:48:03,880 --> 02:48:05,370
and just to try to rebuild that.
And it took awhile.

3553
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:10,480
But yeah,
I ended up strapped it on one more time 

3554
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:10,480
and then at the end of that it was like,
okay,

3555
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:12,170
I can't do it.
Why did you want to go back?

3556
02:48:12,171 --> 02:48:13,120
Like,
what was what.

3557
02:48:13,330 --> 02:48:16,410
I mean this was something that Sebastian
younger talked about a lot in tribe.

3558
02:48:17,210 --> 02:48:20,630
I think for me it was more I needed to.

3559
02:48:21,380 --> 02:48:24,080
I needed to do it for myself.
Uh,

3560
02:48:24,230 --> 02:48:26,240
when I got shot,
it scared the shit out of me.

3561
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:28,100
You know,
there's a lot of,

3562
02:48:29,130 --> 02:48:34,130
there's a lot of times in the movies,
there's this just blind heroism and it 

3563
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:34,130
doesn't matter what's going on and 
you're like,

3564
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:38,651
oh,
I'm just going to run through the hail 

3565
02:48:38,651 --> 02:48:38,651
of bullets.
Well,

3566
02:48:38,651 --> 02:48:40,691
I was flat on my back and but when the 
round hit me in my hip and by the time I

3567
02:48:40,851 --> 02:48:45,851
had hit the ground,
my first thought in my head was that my 

3568
02:48:45,851 --> 02:48:48,131
femur had just been shattered and I was 
going to bleed to death in the space of 

3569
02:48:48,131 --> 02:48:52,241
your hamstring and your quality,
you can fit your entire blood volume 

3570
02:48:52,241 --> 02:48:52,241
there like I'll be dead in about a 
minute.

3571
02:48:52,241 --> 02:48:55,370
That's what I was thinking in my head 
before I hit the ground.

3572
02:48:55,940 --> 02:48:58,760
And then what ended up happening that 
night happened.

3573
02:48:58,790 --> 02:49:02,090
Eight people ended up getting wounded.
I was one of the least wounded people.

3574
02:49:02,091 --> 02:49:03,980
So they were flying people out on 
helicopters.

3575
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:09,460
I got put into a Bradley fighting 
vehicle and taken to the Green Zone in 

3576
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:10,440
Iraq.
But it scared the crap out of me.

3577
02:49:10,560 --> 02:49:12,420
And not only did it scare the crap out 
of me,

3578
02:49:12,421 --> 02:49:15,510
it absolutely crushed my confidence in 
my ability to do my job,

3579
02:49:15,570 --> 02:49:20,570
which up until that point,
I thought that I was at the very least 

3580
02:49:20,570 --> 02:49:24,231
competent and capable of doing my job 
and I had everything was going great up 

3581
02:49:24,631 --> 02:49:29,631
until that moment and then it and then 
it didn't and I had nothing but 

3582
02:49:29,631 --> 02:49:33,081
questions and avoid that I had to pull 
myself out of and it was probably very 

3583
02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:38,090
selfish in my desire to go back and my 
desire to continue doing what I was 

3584
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:43,071
doing,
but I had to build myself back up to a 

3585
02:49:43,071 --> 02:49:43,110
point where I thought I could operate 
again.

3586
02:49:43,111 --> 02:49:48,111
And I remember very distinctly going 
back to Afghanistan in 2010 in standing 

3587
02:49:48,691 --> 02:49:53,691
outside the door,
getting ready to go into a door on a 

3588
02:49:53,691 --> 02:49:53,691
house,
thinking in my head,

3589
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:58,170
do you still have it?
And then going into the door and I,

3590
02:49:58,171 --> 02:50:02,640
I needed for myself to do that again 
too.

3591
02:50:02,641 --> 02:50:07,440
I guess regained for me a sense of who I
was and to regain my confidence.

3592
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:08,640
Wow.

3593
02:50:11,150 --> 02:50:12,680
What did,
what did you fear would happen?

3594
02:50:12,681 --> 02:50:17,681
If you didn't do that,
I feared that I wouldn't know who I was 

3595
02:50:17,681 --> 02:50:22,540
because when I was younger,
I'll be the first to admit that I 

3596
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:25,280
believe I put too much weight into what 
I did as opposed to who I was.

3597
02:50:28,100 --> 02:50:31,400
I had too much attached to being a seal.
It was,

3598
02:50:32,810 --> 02:50:33,390
and I,
I,

3599
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:35,270
and I again,
in my opinion,

3600
02:50:35,300 --> 02:50:40,300
the problem that I see with people that 
struggle when they get out of the 

3601
02:50:40,300 --> 02:50:43,181
military is if they attach too much of 
their identity to an occupation that 

3602
02:50:43,181 --> 02:50:46,040
they've walked away from,
they really struggle most times.

3603
02:50:46,041 --> 02:50:47,270
Not Always,
but most times,

3604
02:50:47,271 --> 02:50:52,271
and those people can end up getting 
themselves into some pretty bad 

3605
02:50:52,271 --> 02:50:54,551
positions.
And when for guys who cut out from that 

3606
02:50:54,551 --> 02:50:55,070
career,
when they go off the rails,

3607
02:50:55,130 --> 02:50:58,100
fuck me Nag,
go off the rails in a big way because we

3608
02:50:58,101 --> 02:51:00,050
have two speeds.
We have fifth gear and hold my beer.

3609
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:02,520
That's the only two speeds that we have.
Yeah,

3610
02:51:03,110 --> 02:51:08,110
and I thought I had lost that and I,
I was at a point in my life where,

3611
02:51:08,301 --> 02:51:13,301
like I said,
I was where I wanted to be doing what I 

3612
02:51:13,301 --> 02:51:13,301
was wanting to do.

3613
02:51:13,301 --> 02:51:15,050
I thought I was doing it right and I 
mean it.

3614
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:18,860
I thought I was going to die in 36 hours
after getting shot.

3615
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:24,340
I got off the stairs of an airplane in 
Virginia beach and my wife had my son in

3616
02:51:24,441 --> 02:51:26,330
a stroller and was pregnant with my 
second,

3617
02:51:26,331 --> 02:51:31,331
my middle son.
It just was such a bizarre series of 

3618
02:51:31,331 --> 02:51:34,280
events that happened so quickly and I 
went from going so fast to nowhere,

3619
02:51:34,580 --> 02:51:39,580
to having nothing to do,
to not understanding why I couldn't 

3620
02:51:39,580 --> 02:51:41,000
train my body to get back to where I was
because the only job I'd had in my adult

3621
02:51:41,001 --> 02:51:43,100
life other than working for my father,
I had too much.

3622
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:48,510
I had too much invested in that 
occupational title and I think one of 

3623
02:51:49,011 --> 02:51:52,280
the best things that I was able to do in
my military career was to survive it and

3624
02:51:52,281 --> 02:51:53,300
get out and to move on.

3625
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:56,440
That's one of the hardest things for 
fighters as well.

3626
02:51:56,450 --> 02:51:59,150
It's a big thing with them and may 
fighters boxers too.

3627
02:51:59,180 --> 02:52:00,740
They just don't know what to do when 
it's over.

3628
02:52:01,010 --> 02:52:06,010
They have.
They become these incredible winners in 

3629
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,810
this one avenue and then once that's 
done,

3630
02:52:07,840 --> 02:52:12,840
they rarely achieved that same kind of 
success in anything else where they're 

3631
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:17,431
probably not thinking about anything 
else when they're in the middle of 

3632
02:52:17,431 --> 02:52:20,040
fighting,
which is very common with people in 

3633
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:20,040
military too,
right?

3634
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:21,370
Because the job does require a very 
focused,

3635
02:52:21,400 --> 02:52:25,510
myopic sense of drive.
This is what you need to do,

3636
02:52:25,511 --> 02:52:27,730
especially in the seal teams.
It's the team comes first,

3637
02:52:27,731 --> 02:52:28,810
team gear,
personal gear.

3638
02:52:28,811 --> 02:52:33,811
Then take care of yourself,
worried more about the person to your 

3639
02:52:33,811 --> 02:52:33,811
left and to the right and then worry 
about yourself,

3640
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,190
you know,
consider the impacts of your actions and

3641
02:52:36,191 --> 02:52:38,230
your words on the people around you and 
then on yourself.

3642
02:52:38,230 --> 02:52:43,230
So it's very.
It is very driven down into a laser like

3643
02:52:43,301 --> 02:52:48,301
focus,
but that's also required to survive and 

3644
02:52:48,301 --> 02:52:48,301
thrive in those environments.
But if left unchecked,

3645
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:53,400
you'll end up at the end of your career 
not prepared for the next phase of your 

3646
02:52:53,400 --> 02:52:54,280
life and say you do 20 years in the 
military,

3647
02:52:54,281 --> 02:52:56,020
which is what you need to do to get a 
retirement.

3648
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:58,020
You joined when you're 18,
so hey,

3649
02:52:58,030 --> 02:52:59,110
you're 38.
Well,

3650
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:00,850
the average lifespan of American is 
what?

3651
02:53:00,851 --> 02:53:01,960
80,
85.

3652
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:04,690
You got a lot of time left.
What are you going to do?

3653
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:08,170
And if you haven't thought about it,
it's,

3654
02:53:08,230 --> 02:53:10,690
it's it.
As see guys who struggle.

3655
02:53:11,470 --> 02:53:13,320
I see guys and I struggled myself,
but I,

3656
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:18,460
I think I,
I think I went through that struggle 

3657
02:53:18,460 --> 02:53:21,840
while I was still in and I think that 
struggle allow me to lift my chin up 

3658
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:24,430
just a little bit to look around and 
start thinking about the future.

3659
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:29,390
You're a bad motherfucker and just dump.
Let's wrap this up.

3660
02:53:29,391 --> 02:53:32,780
I don't know about that,
but let's wrap this up right there.

3661
02:53:32,930 --> 02:53:33,770
Cool.
Thanks brother.

3662
02:53:33,771 --> 02:53:35,660
Appreciate you man.
All Right,

3663
02:53:35,661 --> 02:53:37,400
ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back tomorrow.

3664
02:53:37,490 --> 02:53:38,120
See Ya.
