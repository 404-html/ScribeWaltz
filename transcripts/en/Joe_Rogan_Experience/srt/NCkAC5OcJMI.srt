1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,143
Okay,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,460
three,
two.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,883
What the fuck are you saying Joey?
I said that once you clean for 29 days 

4
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,180
without smoking reefer.
That's it.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,600
Why go back?
Yeah,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,920
I like it.
No,

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,030
if I fucking stayed clean from reef for 
29 days,

8
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:21,864
I go,
I'd let my lungs fucking hill from the 

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:27,870
abuse I have inflicted on him.
The last 30 fucking edibles.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,840
What about spring?
First of all,

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,674
I haven't had another bull since,
like I broke it in Boston September 

12
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:37,190
29th.
So out of respect for Sobrato,

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,660
but I didn't do another book.
I haven't done that at booth.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
Something was wrong with my stomach so I
figured out how I was a lactose 

15
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:48,000
intolerant,
lactose intolerant.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,990
I fucking eat much cheese or milk and 
I'm fucking up,

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,840
you know,
it's a nightmare.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,730
So I had to cut that out of my diet.
No much without cheese.

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,900
American cheese now know Swiss no more.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
No Cuban sandwich is really fucking 
crazy.

21
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,070
And then I had to cut out the edibles 
that give me a weird feeling like he had

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,013
just gone,
just gone somewhere else and I didn't 

23
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,760
like the hunger issue.
Oh,

24
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,730
the munchies,
the hunger issues after 11:00

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,073
with just monstrous.
Like here I am working hard to lose 

26
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,600
weight.
I'd stick to it and then I go home.

27
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:30,570
I start with an apple,
another apple banana,

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,413
another banana.
Then you got to bust out the Salami 

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,880
Sandwich with the fucking,
you know,

30
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,830
it was just a.
It was just getting bad.

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,963
I could not control it.
CanNot uncontrollable to hunger from 

32
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:46,240
edibles every minute after 11:00
for me was uncontrolled.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,193
Well you can't blitzkrieg do.
You don't just get to know and it's 

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,780
totally.
It was starting early.

35
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,590
Two in the afternoon can pop another 
tool at fucking six.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,060
Do you like vaporizing?

37
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,740
No.
No.

38
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,800
Just smoking.
I thought your lungs,

39
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:05,640
you don't.
Vape is at a hotel party.

40
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,790
Started in the morning while I'm having 
coffee in my hotel room.

41
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,791
Writing my notes for the thoughts of the
day because I don't wake up with hunger.

42
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,900
She,
that was my problem.

43
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:20,901
All those years I would need to one,
if you want to be a fat fuck the only to

44
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,880
one when you wake up because then you 
gotta make up for it.

45
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,400
The rest of the day,
so now I have to force myself to eat.

46
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,263
What do you mean?
Because how do you guys like the 

47
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,103
intermittent fasting?
I can't live with that money mean my 

48
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,070
shit goes up and down.
My blood pressure,

49
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,610
my blood sugar so I could never have 
intermittent fast.

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,110
But in the old days I'd be coked up and 
I'd wake up speedy still.

51
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,340
I wouldn't eat breakfast,
but I started eating at one or 2:00

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,990
and would not stop till fucking do in 
the morning you saw me eating those pink

53
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,680
dots sandwiches like they will not to 
meatball sandwiches the 12:00

54
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,570
because I wouldn't eat breakfast.

55
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,300
I forced to eat,
you know,

56
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,080
for years we was eating every six hours 
as opposed to a smaller portion.

57
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,220
You know what I'm saying?
So yeah,

58
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
that's what people were thinking.
I got a breakfast and I got two egg 

59
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,870
yolks,
a piece of wheat toast and fruit and I'm

60
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,080
good like for Sobrato,
but I gave a bacon.

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,430
I only two pieces of Bacon.
It's 45 points on weightwatchers.

62
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,383
That's all I'm allowed,
but at least I'm allowed two pieces of 

63
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,830
bacon to pieces.
Megan's all you really need.

64
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,630
That's all you need.
Two pieces of Bacon.

65
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,320
Let me tell you what I was for 18.
Between you and I,

66
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,543
my wife,
who's on the south would make the whole 

67
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,231
packet of Oscar Meyer Center Cut Bacon,
the whole pack every morning.

68
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,120
That was my breakfast.
Eat the whole package.

69
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,840
The whole package with three eggs,
a half a loaf of wonder,

70
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,110
bread and butter and a 16 ounce coke.

71
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,180
The boot.
A coke on top of it.

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,460
Oh yeah.
I could drink two cokes for breakfast.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,770
Oh,
remember I grew up in the east coast and

74
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,260
I caught a bad habit early on after my 
mother died.

75
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,100
I caught that and I wouldn't eat it on.
I would leave and eat at the Deli.

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,530
I went on the member one fucking cream 
cheese and jelly on a.

77
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,960
on a roll was big.
Oh yeah.

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,080
You know what that does to your system?
Clear cheese and jelly.

79
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:14,914
For breakfast I used to.
I used to open up with cream cheese and 

80
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:18,514
jelly on a poppy seed role with a 16 
ounce of coke for breakfast for years 

81
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,840
and I was in shape that that's the 
thing,

82
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,090
you know,
you can't be with liver.

83
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,203
Remember that?
Nobody eats cream cheese and jelly for 

84
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,180
breakfast on a roll.
No more cream cheese and jelly.

85
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,090
No,
because people know better now in Jersey

86
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,130
and those diners,
they got those brand muffins.

87
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,230
You go in there and get those bran 
muffins.

88
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,000
They put them on the grill with butter 
on them.

89
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,170
Good Google.
Oh my goodness.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,570
You just chop now.
I got.

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,421
I got young.
I'm done.

92
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,990
It's not going to bran muffin with 
raisins in it and when I know Butler and

93
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,824
nothing,
but they cut them in half on the east 

94
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,140
coast.
Those east coast breakfast as well.

95
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,400
How long have you been doing this 
weightwatchers thing now?

96
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,130
Since December ninth.
So almost a year.

97
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,810
Eleven months now.
Eleven months ish.

98
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,130
Thirty.
Pretty good.

99
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
Thirty pounds.
So that's nice and that's a good weight 

100
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,250
over that amount of time because it's 
gradual and I didn't.

101
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,670
The only week I missed my fitness goals,
I have to have 72 points of activity and

102
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,340
I only missed it one time I had the flu.

103
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,900
What's a point of activity?
How do you,

104
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,510
what do you get?
So if I go to a movie tie at nine,

105
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,703
I only really.
It's an hour class but I only put 30 

106
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,180
minutes down.
The more we tie training,

107
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,650
if we do circuit training with a ball or
ropes and shit,

108
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,083
then I put whatever the amount.
If it's eight stations at 30 seconds of 

109
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:43,894
station,
you wear a heart rate monitor or 

110
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,170
anything or no?
No.

111
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,650
Listen,
I don't want to hear.

112
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,200
I want to see.
You know,

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,073
when I had that fucking ear infection,
I used to have to work out with ear 

114
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,410
plugs on and I get high and go throw 
kicks with Jesus.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
You don't what life is when you had the 
ear infection.

116
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,730
The earplugs kept your equilibrium and 
balance.

117
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,390
Keep sweat going in my ear.
I don't know what life is.

118
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,250
When you're working out,
you can hear your heartbeat,

119
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,850
but yet pump pump.
That's trippy shit.

120
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,913
You know everlast has a ticker.
He's got an artificial valve and he put 

121
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,860
the microphone up to his chassis here.
No,

122
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,130
I don't wanna hear that shit.

123
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,220
Fuck you tripping in there for.
What did he say?

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,970
Like 18 years I think.
Yeah.

125
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,470
He had a heart attack a long ass time 
ago.

126
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

127
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,040
Bad Valve.
Yeah.

128
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,680
But if I was clean of off we for 29 
days,

129
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:38,900
I might as well go for it for at least a
year.

130
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,960
Yeah.
Let's run around marijuana.

131
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,220
Just make a comeback just to see what 
would it be like.

132
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,253
I'll tell you one thing that did happen 
last year when we did sober October and 

133
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,500
it took a month off when I started back 
again.

134
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,780
I'd get nervous,
real nervous,

135
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,790
scared to do it,
and I'd go on stage.

136
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,620
I feel real strange.
Somebody once told me,

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,240
a great woman once told me that,
uh,

138
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,140
if you think getting high in life is 
weird with you,

139
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,983
stop getting high and it's a different 
fucking adventure and she's truly a lot 

140
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,810
of aspects.
I called you I one October,

141
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,210
second one night I got home from the 
comedy store.

142
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,910
You know when you get home from the 
original room dog,

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,553
especially when you go.
It was one of those nights when I went 

144
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:27,350
in there and that was rocky Balboa.
I just touched gloves and I measured and

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,410
I just started going through the body 
for 15 minutes.

146
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,810
I remember driving up Laurel Canyon 
going,

147
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:35,360
what am I going to do with myself?
And I went home.

148
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,030
It was like October second.
It was 1130.

149
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,883
I started smoking reefer,
the calm down a little bit and I went 

150
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,254
down and I started with sign of the 
times by Prince and I just left it on 

151
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:46,634
auto play and they just took me into a 
prince fucking cave and I ended up on 

152
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,780
beautiful ones.
When he starts singing,

153
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,540
do you want him?
And I called you up.

154
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,374
I'm like,
this is why I can't do sober October 

155
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,920
because I get so high and mighty.

156
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,820
Come down off the stage and you're going
to upstage.

157
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,020
You need something.
Since I don't drink,

158
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm scared to come up that hill.
Drinking.

159
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,050
I have to smoke reefer to come down at 
night and music.

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,810
That's the only thing that calms me down
at night.

161
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,690
Do write at night after your sets.
I write about what happened.

162
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,130
Yeah.
I tried to about how lucky I am that I'm

163
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,940
still performing at the store at 55.
I right about that.

164
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,160
I ate a bag of Dicks,
but I'll get them tomorrow night,

165
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,500
you know,
like whatever.

166
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,400
Whatever just is flowing through my head
while I have music on.

167
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,170
I'm drinking a water and I'm just going 
to back and fucking Toca fucking 22 hits

168
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:40,820
off a bike and I love listening to music
at night.

169
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,700
That's my hobby.
It's a thing to like when you get out of

170
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,534
the store,
it's a thing to sit yourself down and 

171
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,890
make yourself work and right.
You know,

172
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,740
because you're like,
I'm done.

173
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,270
I did it.
Got a good set in.

174
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,370
I'm good,
but that's the best time to write.

175
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,770
I think everything's popping while go 
home and make corrections.

176
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,083
Maybe I said that fuck too early or 
maybe I said that and I shouldn't have 

177
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:03,510
said it,
but uh,

178
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,403
no.
I won't try to ride it and I'm gone at 

179
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,460
night.
Might drive unless something's really.

180
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,210
I think my brain is shot at night 
because.

181
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,740
Is it because you did your,
uh,

182
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,390
did your standup,
you've got ramped up.

183
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,820
Did the stand up playing with the 
fucking kid,

184
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,193
you know,
did a podcast talk to people all day 

185
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,940
about shit that doesn't matter by night.
I liked the,

186
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,460
I liked to get up.
I play with mercy.

187
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:32,640
I talked to my wife.
I'll do a protein shake,

188
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,140
I'll drop mercy off,
I'll go home and then I go to the coffee

189
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,760
shop and for 30 minutes I'll call my 
peeps in jersey,

190
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,594
check in,
and then I'll get eggs at the coffee 

191
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,450
shop bacon.
Once my breakfast is gun,

192
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,793
I write my page down for the day,
then I take my ipad up and I either 

193
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:55,134
write a chapter in the book.
I try to write towards the book and 

194
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,400
while I'm writing another book,
you're writing a book,

195
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:00,234
right?
I'm trying,

196
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,650
I'm trying.
How long have you been doing this?

197
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,630
Twenty two fucking years.
Joe Rogan.

198
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,590
Twenty two fucking years,
you know?

199
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,760
Um,
but I forced myself and with the IPAD,

200
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,380
you know,
this is a whole thing on,

201
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,243
there's a whole writing thing so I could
just turn that chapter off and go to 

202
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:18,684
another document and click on the post 
netflix material and then I got a thing 

203
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,350
that we're working with immigrant 
mentality.

204
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,210
So I think about that.
I'll go to that.

205
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,130
So now my,
that's all great.

206
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,030
I think just doing that exercise every 
day is good for me.

207
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,864
I don't need to write comedy every day.
I'd rather just go down to the store to 

208
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,250
throw something out there and fucking 
get excited.

209
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:44,130
And like I told you,
I'm not going anywhere else no more than

210
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,310
Los Angeles.
I'm going back to the school,

211
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,173
no Improv soft spots,
especially after I shot the Netflix 

212
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:54,920
special and everything.
It all came to me after they had that 10

213
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,790
years and especially after she died,
you know,

214
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,624
people you ever go to like an acting 
class and people refer to Stanislavski 

215
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,523
and all this shit.
Ten years from now people going to be 

216
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:04,614
referring to the Mitzi shore technique.
There was something that every I was 

217
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,670
talking to Duncan about.
I talked to rob about it.

218
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,720
I know she said something to us at one 
point that we were like,

219
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,710
wow,
something

220
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,410
I remember I was telling him this on my 
podcast,

221
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,720
that there was a time she didn't like 
doing that in the cobit and wouldn't let

222
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:30,090
me do it in the main room in the 
original fucking crazy is that,

223
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,110
that's to show you a genius in a way.
Like she was like,

224
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,240
Joe,
you could light yourself on fire and the

225
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:39,510
original,
I don't give a fuck,

226
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,260
but in the main room you can't do that 
because you're killing my room.

227
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,840
Like the comics afterwards just could 
not follow it.

228
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,310
Like they could just not following that 
lesson right there.

229
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,930
That was about.
It was brilliant,

230
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,560
but it

231
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,013
think about it.
It's no good versions of that bit 

232
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,680
anywhere.
This one version that I did that's up on

233
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,461
you.
It's terrible.

234
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:03,930
It's terrible version that there's no 
solid versions of that pit,

235
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,170
but that bit was right when that guy 
died.

236
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:12,171
J Howard Marshall was him getting Anna 
Nicole Smith to do shit to him before he

237
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:17,130
died,
but she's trying to take your money.

238
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,870
I don't give a fuck.
I want to get my boss' leg,

239
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,580
a sunlight crazy bit.
But Mitzi didn't like it too because she

240
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,414
didn't like bits that were making fun of
old people because her health was 

241
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:29,090
deteriorating too.
She.

242
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,100
There was a couple of bits of that.
She didn't fucking picture him.

243
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,970
He's a million years old and she's hot 
as the sun and she sit on his lap,

244
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
look,
look at the smile on his face.

245
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,110
Dog.

246
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,010
Yeah.
Oh Man.

247
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,290
I loved him.
I loved that whole scene.

248
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,770
I loved what it was.
I loved that because it was so blatant,

249
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,660
you know?
It was just so blatant,

250
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,853
but she didn't like that,
but she didn't like the Hugh hefner bit 

251
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,670
either.
She didn't like that bit.

252
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,810
Those when you have to hold those,
she's kissing him.

253
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,830
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh,

254
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,370
he's in a wheelchair.
While she's married him.

255
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,030
I mean,
it was a damn classic that,

256
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,893
that,
that,

257
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,140
that scene of him and her getting 
married,

258
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,040
she's so young and so hot and he's so 
old wrecked,

259
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,880
enriches fuck in a wheelchair.
It's such a classic scenario.

260
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,380
It was so good.

261
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,450
Good.
You called the Kentucky Fried Hookah.

262
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,670
Him Car Kentucky Fried it.
Like if she wanted that money shit,

263
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,430
doing shit to keep doing shit.
And then that's.

264
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,860
Yeah,
he's calling father.

265
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,220
He's going like,
it's time to look back.

266
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,820
It's time.

267
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,480
Oh yeah,
man.

268
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,750
I just loved the fact that that guy was 
that wealthy and yet still.

269
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,710
I mean,
I guess when you're that.

270
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,603
Well,
was he at that time more than a billion 

271
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,870
dollars?
He was a billionaire.

272
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,380
He was an oil magnate,
right?

273
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,160
I wasn't even.
I don't think she got the money though.

274
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,670
I think the kids fought her hundred 
million,

275
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,420
but that's peanuts.
Yeah,

276
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,060
it got her dog

277
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,110
and Nicole Smith's daughter is now the 
fourth richest woman in the US.

278
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,320
It's what?
Oh,

279
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,750
I know it says $37 billion though.
Koch brothers.

280
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,621
Oh,
I see.

281
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,960
I see.
He was 69th on the list.

282
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,780
Oh,
but fourth richest woman.

283
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,210
Do you know?
Out of the richest women in the world,

284
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,450
Google the richest women in the world,
like where they got their money from.

285
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,540
It's rough.
It's rough out there guys.

286
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,550
Then they fucking starting businesses 
that mary had dummies,

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,810
divorce.
Almost all of it's divorced money.

288
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,663
The feminists do not want to hear this,
but there was one woman who was the 

289
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:14,060
richest woman ever from a startup 
company,

290
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,300
a Elizabeth.
What was her name from thread knows?

291
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,480
What was it?
What was her name?

292
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Elizabeth something.
Not Smith.

293
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,750
What was it?
Something homes.

294
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,643
Elizabeth Holmes.
She had a ran a company called 

295
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,060
Toronto's.
She started herself,

296
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,750
dropped out of college to start this 
company and it was a total fraud.

297
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,510
It was all fraudulent.
She's going to jail forever.

298
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,690
She was with $34,000,000,000
at one point.

299
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,703
It was a blood testing company and what 
it was was they just take a trickier 

300
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,060
blood instead of taking a bunch of your 
blood or you get a.

301
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,820
your blood drawn.
Did.

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,833
Her thing was like,
let's just be able to take a prick of 

303
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:53,304
the blood.
Just a little tiny prick like you go to 

304
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,970
a store,
get pickier blood,

305
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,983
and they're going to be able to do a 
battery of tests on you and find out 

306
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,324
what's going on.
Problem was it didn't fucking work and 

307
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,234
they.
They falsified all sorts of data and 

308
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,530
they lied to investors and all sorts of 
shit.

309
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,690
This lady,
she used to dress like Steve Jobs.

310
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,613
She wore a black turtleneck and 
everything and I saw her speak once 

311
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,383
here.
Coast Elizabeth Holmes indicted on 

312
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,160
fraud.
Oh the Gotcha.

313
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,450
With the fucking pop up.
Add New York to air.

314
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,610
She is.
She's going to jail.

315
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,550
She's fucked.
Oh,

316
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,730
but she was.
She was at one point in time,

317
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,220
the richest self made person in the 
world.

318
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,083
Richest self made woman in the world.
She was worth billions of dollars to 

319
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,490
ship.
People do.

320
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,100
I watched a thing.
The idea crazy.

321
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,590
Eddie,
do you remember Crazy Eddie?

322
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,090
His prices are insane.
Crazy.

323
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,330
I need to tell them to go crazy.
It was crazy.

324
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:51,980
It was a guy that had stores in all five
boroughs of New York wholesale outlets,

325
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,010
tca radios,
tvs and everything like that.

326
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,060
I saw.
I was watching them SNBC greed to have a

327
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:03,220
series called us.
Let me hear this motherfucker

328
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,470
remember we are not,
we will not be undersold and now

329
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,153
he's wearing a Santa Claus outfit.
He's going fucking crazy with fake snow 

330
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:32,160
in the background.
He fucking like,

331
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,420
just like he did it out of the park.
Didn't he go to Israel?

332
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,343
You went to high,
but the most brilliant thing he did was 

333
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,440
he took it.
You don't.

334
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,830
Don't fucking check back me on this.
He took it either his nephew,

335
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,150
his son in law,
somebody that was related to

336
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,730
blood,
put them through college so he could get

337
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:58,731
a job at the irs so they could figure 
out how to rob from the irs.

338
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,493
This is how fucking insane this guy was.
I'm watching this diet and how they got 

339
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,010
crazy yet.
Right.

340
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,993
Crazy.
Eddie fled after he started just buying 

341
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,620
boxes.
You know how you met me years ago,

342
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:17,870
you would be driving in New York and 
there was some guy selling stereos.

343
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:18,750
Speakers.
Yeah.

344
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,460
And then you'd take them home and it was
two bricks.

345
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,100
Yep.
Well he did the same thing to investors.

346
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,383
He took boxes,
filled them up with bricks and just 

347
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,490
stuck them in a warehouse and then he 
went public,

348
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,403
so he got everybody to come down and 
look at all his inventory and all these 

349
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,704
fact checkers.
They're checking boxes as a brick sort 

350
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,450
of.
Whoa.

351
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,353
And he had,
I mean five fucking warehouses all 

352
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,174
around.
They will all fake and he got all this 

353
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,154
money.
He fled to Israel and he fled for a 

354
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,210
while,
but they knew he was a pussy hound.

355
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,650
Right.
So they got them like Escobar style.

356
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,640
They got them like,
you know,

357
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,890
on the phone,
like I'm going to a store or something.

358
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:56,724
Crazy.
And what they did was they put a blonde 

359
00:18:58,621 --> 00:18:59,454
on the side of the road with a mini 
skirt and they knew eventually he would 

360
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:05,580
drive by and stopped.
No,

361
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,593
he stopped.

362
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,853
That's how they nailed them.
What is the Google the way the richest 

363
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:15,720
woman in the world where they got their 
money from.

364
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,560
He's a bad motherfucker,
paramus syosset,

365
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Long Island.
And he had commercials.

366
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,660
So he was the first one that pushed to 
commercial barrier,

367
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,440
like made fun.
I miss and him like I,

368
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,010
Ms Dot had the pimp with a bunch of his 
hose that will go.

369
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,130
Did you hear with my man said this 
morning.

370
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,600
Oh really?
Yeah,

371
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,300
and he had a bunch of those crazy.
Eddie had the best one.

372
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,570
He had Frankenstein Dracula and the wolf
man.

373
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,480
Peanut,
the peanut,

374
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,314
the men's urinal.
Miss the imus thing because I came in 

375
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,290
like I remember I found out about 
Ironman skews.

376
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,970
Howard stern was talking shit about him 
and I was like,

377
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,030
who is this?
I'm Ms.

378
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,863
Guy.
Hi Ms Dot was around when I was a kid 

379
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,480
was late.
He was already.

380
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,040
I miss was the fucking King of New York 
when I was eight,

381
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,913
nine.
I'm Mr Kumar in the morning and talk 

382
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:14,574
shit.
When I saw him he was wearing like a 

383
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,400
turquoise,
one of those weird ties,

384
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,263
those Bolo ties that like cowboys went.
He had a fucking cowboy hat on and his 

385
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,450
whole studio was done like a.
well,

386
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,750
like the West.
It was real weird.

387
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,780
Yeah,
he got weird at the end he put really?

388
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,740
He's wearing cowboy boots and shit.
It was like,

389
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,574
are you a rancher?
Am Radio show from New York City like 

390
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,850
this got fucked up and they were paying 
him.

391
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,970
I mean he was on for a while and he said
nappy headed hoes and they're like,

392
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,960
cut that sin.
He

393
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,860
called people nappy headed,
tried to compete with stern.

394
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:51,850
Right.
That's what it was.

395
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,030
There wasn't a sudden.
It was definitely some of that.

396
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,130
So he was,
you know,

397
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,840
he was trying to be outrageous.
Even before Stern,

398
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,170
I believe it just wasn't at the same 
level.

399
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,470
Sterns outrageousness was nationwide.
Ims was really like an east coast thing,

400
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,763
like people knew about them in New York.
I had never heard about him in New York 

401
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,600
or in Boston,
but I had heard about stern.

402
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,460
We all knew about stern but nobody,
nobody really knew about it.

403
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,150
Never made it there,
you know.

404
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,850
And then when I came to New York it was 
at the end,

405
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,713
like when stern was already the king and
I'm us was just sort of like this guy 

406
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,830
that he hated and I was like,
who is this man?

407
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Who is this I guy?
And then he had a TV show for awhile and

408
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:35,530
then during the TV show we'd see him in 
the studio and it was,

409
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,420
you know,
no disrespect,

410
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,310
but it was really fucking boring.

411
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,490
It was boring.
Like there was no life to them.

412
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,680
Like their opinions weren't that 
interesting.

413
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,514
It was him.
And there was another guy there that 

414
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,210
looked like it was just waiting for the 
Buzzer,

415
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:49,900
the ring,
he's waiting to go home.

416
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,390
And then there was a woman that was with
them.

417
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,300
It was,
it was.

418
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,210
There was no life in the room.
Like can you watch the stern show?

419
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,253
There'd be midgets shooting bottle 
rockets out of their ass halls and porn 

420
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:02,350
stars riding dildos.
And it was chaos.

421
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,480
There was a plastic all over the 
grounds.

422
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,840
Girls would be squirting.
It was just madness like no one had ever

423
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,370
done.
Not that that's good or bad,

424
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,170
but it was,
it was exciting.

425
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,330
Like you're,
you're driving to work in the morning,

426
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,313
you're hearing some girl freaking out 
because she's riding on some fucking 

427
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,820
that Sybian thing.
He'd make girls right on.

428
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,520
Like,
that was madness.

429
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,563
So like that,
that like you had never heard anything 

430
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,790
like that on the radio before.
So then you would hear about ims and I'm

431
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,653
as a rural water.
We brought her to this warning or like 

432
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,990
what's the hr just be at the end?
It was just,

433
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,500
it was in comparison.
It was so it was dead.

434
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,423
It was like,
it was dry and I said on stern it was 

435
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,670
great flavor.
Flavor.

436
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,660
The one time on Stern.
I mean there's so many great steroids to

437
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,030
already was so great back already was 
the best party was fucking the May.

438
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:56,500
Have you listened to an old already when
we had just gotten off the subway.

439
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,830
He just shot heroin.
He had sunglasses on.

440
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,860
Yeah.
You fall asleep.

441
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,350
Shit.
Fucking insane.

442
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,590
And he said that they encouraged him,
you know,

443
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:09,424
but man,
what are you going to do when a guy's 

444
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,240
like that?

445
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,073
You're going to help them if you help.
The problem with people that are that 

446
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:20,170
fucked up is the only thing that ever 
helps them is themselves.

447
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,093
The only thing it's like they have to 
hit rock bottom and then they have to 

448
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,980
decide they're going to do something 
about it,

449
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,120
but when you do get a lot of love for 
being fucked up,

450
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,960
that is kind of a problem because you do
start to think,

451
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,380
this is my thing.
My thing is being a fucked up guy.

452
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,200
People love me when I'm fucked up.
This is what I do.

453
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,600
You know,
and you can fall into that.

454
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,440
Couple Belushi had the same.

455
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,460
The other guy got arrested,
so I had the same problem.

456
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,060
There's a neat you fall into.
I remember there was a pizza parlor when

457
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,410
I was a kid.
His name was nick,

458
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:57,890
the Greek fucking tremendous pizza.
Even though he was Greek,

459
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:01,870
like we let it slide.
He put the Sicilian by the window and it

460
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:05,720
was the flies will land on it.
It was like the airport for the flies.

461
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,460
They will land.
We will break his balls neck,

462
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,970
but I'm in my wedding gown.
Acquaint load one night fucked up to the

463
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:11,804
gills,
would vomit all over my shirt and every 

464
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,130
time he'd see me call me fucking 
Belushi.

465
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,310
Belushi almost died.
It was,

466
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,144
and he would ever,
for years he called me fucking Belushi 

467
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,780
and there was another kid who had a 
beard.

468
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,460
The Columbine,
I told her Khomeini,

469
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,900
like he had nicknames for us,
but that's a weird.

470
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,303
It bothered me.
After a while he would call it Belushi 

471
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,183
and Belushi died.
It really started bothering me like my 

472
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,913
next.
He would call me Belushi till my face 

473
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,100
who according to his fucking Belushi,
well,

474
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,220
I was fucked up.
I wouldn't have done that on a quail and

475
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,970
open up the red pepper and threw it at 
him,

476
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,470
but I used to sell them jewelry like I 
was selling stolen.

477
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,500
Jimmy and nick were tight.
Nick was the pizza parlor,

478
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:55,334
50 yards from the high school and you 
could run a tab with nick and nick used 

479
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:01,760
to.
I used to give nick jewelry and he would

480
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:05,150
look at me and he would go speak.
How much do you think that's worth?

481
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,390
Because jewelry was $800 an ounce at 
that time.

482
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:13,220
Gold and I would bring him jewelry.
He would look at it and then take it,

483
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:17,570
give me money and put it in.
One of his pockets from is the apron.

484
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,000
So two days later I'd go in and go,
nick,

485
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:20,834
let me use your bathroom,
and I go in there and stick my hand in 

486
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,084
the apron and take the jewelry back.
And then a week later I go back to nick 

487
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,260
how much with the ring and he looked at 
me and he was racist as fuck.

488
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Like he really the quality Belushi a 
Spec to my face,

489
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:34,820
like it didn't matter.

490
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,900
There was a kid,
you know,

491
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:39,734
this is on Kennedy Boulevard,
this is a big boulevard and there was a 

492
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:45,460
kid that would come in.
Then I'm still dear friends with that.

493
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,620
His family had money and he would go in 
there and buy a slice of pizza,

494
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,053
but he would cross the street because 
the ice t across the street was a dime 

495
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:57,870
cheaper and more ice tea came in those 
fucking cardboard and milk cardboards.

496
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,433
He will always cross the street.
So nick will be having a conversation 

497
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:02,884
with like what's going on and also to go
west and when he went across the street 

498
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,410
to get the ice cream,
he would fucking flip out.

499
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:12,710
He run from behind the counter,
run onto Kennedy Boulevard.

500
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,520
Hundreds of people be out there and he 
yell at the Kid,

501
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,920
Tony,
you fucking jewel.

502
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,550
You fuck you.
Fuck.

503
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,140
He wasn't Jewish.
He was Italian.

504
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,560
He was just cheap and shit like that.
That's it.

505
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,860
Damn Center that you've got to be pretty
cheap to run across the street.

506
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:32,930
But it was forty five cents for the ice 
tea,

507
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,810
but it Ashley's was thirty five cents 
across the street.

508
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,013
Then the ashtrays,
Delhi was great because the mother was 

509
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:41,534
losing their hair.
Every time you got a sandwich you get a 

510
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,470
little piece of hair,
so get you wouldn't get here.

511
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,540
You'd go ms dot.
You didn't get any mail today.

512
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,710
Everything had a little piece of Aaron 
and the macaroni salad and you hate it.

513
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,840
Gave a fuck.
It was tremendous.

514
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,480
She made the best roast beef on Rye in 
the world,

515
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,733
but every.
No.

516
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,290
In fact,
the whole family to her.

517
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,620
And the son will losing the hat,
and I learned from her son.

518
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,583
Her son was losing his hair,
but he couldn't control his emotions 

519
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:09,114
about it.

520
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,590
He went to everything.
Joe,

521
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,600
he did the fucking stitches.
He would spray paint his hand.

522
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,280
He was one of those guys,
the hat,

523
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,400
like he tried,
but the head just kept falling out.

524
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:23,790
He had a male pattern.
Whatever we were kids.

525
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,030
The mom had it to.
The mom had was something in the house.

526
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,190
I don't know what it was.
Nuclear tests.

527
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,043
The Dad had.
The brother had it and fucking 

528
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,760
everything you got there.
Had a little piece of hair on it.

529
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,683
Whatever.
You got to always say if you didn't get 

530
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,740
beat going,
ms dot hatch.

531
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,570
But say it to her face.
Oh,

532
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,423
we used to to her all the time.
We Love Mrs Hesh a dude were losing his 

533
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,930
hair.
It's fucking devastating.

534
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,870
But a woman losing her hair way more 
devastating.

535
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,400
There's something about a woman,
woman,

536
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,910
women losing their hair.
It kills them really hard.

537
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,230
So sad.
Yeah.

538
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,580
So I've seen women lose their hair.
It's,

539
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,650
it's awful.
You know,

540
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:07,020
they get alopecia.
Alopecia is.

541
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,550
We're like,
you could lose your eyebrows.

542
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,880
People lose their eyebrows.
He looks like sometimes shit just starts

543
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,460
falling off.
I had,

544
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,783
there's a singer,
there's a popular singer in a band and 

545
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,520
he's got alopecia and I just saw it.
They bust on my 30 years later,

546
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,354
you didn't know that was awake even then
and I knew about him growing up and he 

547
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:27,830
would just lose his hair.
You know,

548
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,180
from time to time,
you guys lose their eyelashes.

549
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,920
They lose everything.
That's fucked up.

550
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,470
That's crazy island and I'm getting 
older,

551
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:39,471
like my hairline is receding,
but my line's getting bushy eyebrows,

552
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,480
eyebrows.
It's crazy.

553
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,800
I'm getting bushier is shit.
Sometimes I'm driving at night.

554
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,630
There's something my vision and I got to
go home,

555
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:49,720
but I got to fucking shop.

556
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,220
It's like a satellite.
I go,

557
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,420
I asked my wife,
don't you see this shit?

558
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,920
Old guys like old Scottish guys,
all the Irish guys,

559
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,540
Scottish guys,
fucking caterpillars grown out of there.

560
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,870
I was.
I got no hair on my legs.

561
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,930
I got minimal hair on my shoulders.
I got no hair on my back.

562
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,670
I'm on.
Those guys have any hair on your arms?

563
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,630
Nothing.
Nothing.

564
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,460
I got hair that grows out of my ears 
this time.

565
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,343
That's typical qtip in my ear and I 
could hear the head twisting in my 

566
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,320
fucking.
You know what that's like.

567
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,273
My eyebrows broke at bushy is fuck.
I got to bring scissors with me on the 

568
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,880
road to trim and you're in your mirror 
at home.

569
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:27,714
You don't see this shit.
You get on the road with white in the 

570
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:31,430
hotel room and you're like,
well,

571
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,273

572
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:39,030

Oh good.

573
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,770
Good.
From a news week in.

574
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,980

577
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:50,010

According to Forbes worlds,

578
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,923
15 wealthiest people are men.

wealthiest woman.
The world.

Most of their money comes from their 
male relatives or husbands.

582
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,073
Yeah.
The top 10 wealthiest men made their 

583
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:07,240
fortunes themselves.
Now who will the top 10 wealthiest woman

Good voice.

588
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,513

U I n f e I zoo wouldn't fee who was 

592
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:28,720
born to a poor family of China,
dropped out of school at 16.

593
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,020
She went on to found in an enormously 
successful technology company.

594
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,483
Uh,
but if you put men back into the 

595
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:38,494
equation,
she's only 198th richest person in the 

596
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:44,010
world.
No matter how you feel about the concept

597
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:44,844
of few people hoarding enormous wealth.
The notion that women can only access 

598
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:51,970
money and power through their families 
or husbands seems medieval at best.

599
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,710
Yet we see it occur at the very top of 
many professions outside of the business

600
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:57,544
world.

601
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,350
Most people.
Can you read the next stuff?

602
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,470
Yeah.
A recent high profile examples.

603
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:07,570
Hillary Clinton,
during her presidential campaign,

604
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,613
the first female major party nominee,
she campaigned on a ticket of 

605
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:12,604
empowerment.
Yet although she is accomplished in her 

606
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,560
own right,
she entered politics as the wife of Bill

607
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,393
Clinton.
And his undoubtedly benefited from his 

608
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:22,260
prestige and connections.
Yeah.

609
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,050
Well that's true.
But also it was,

610
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,903
it was a lot of money.
I didn't mean for you to read that she 

611
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,110
was a lawyer and uh,
you know,

612
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,680
she was a senator.
No,

613
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,440
oprah is up there as the world's richest
women,

614
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:33,274
period.
Like it's a weird thing because they're 

615
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:39,010
saying I'm not a big fan of Hillary 
Clinton.

616
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,030
But by saying she definitely entered 
because she was,

617
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,100
you know,
she was married to him,

618
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,950
but she was a lawyer.
I mean,

619
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,510
she's,
she's an accomplished person.

620
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:50,740
She's,
she's educated.

621
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,030
Accomplish who's a senator.

622
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,090
I don't think that makes sense.
I hate when people say,

623
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,550
shit,
I ain't know what you at the right place

624
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,690
at the right time,
bitch.

625
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,240
I know you jumped in,
you jumped,

626
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,790
you jumped bitch.
So that's the problem.

627
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,800
I'm not mad at nobody.
You can't say she got into.

628
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,580
She may be a little help.
A push here,

629
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,200
a call here.
But she jumped.

630
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,000
There's a great book I'm reading right 
now.

631
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,760
It's called outliers by Malcolm 
Mcdowell.

632
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,653
It's fucking great.
And it's all about what makes people 

633
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:24,070
successful and why they were successful.
And there are a lot of factors,

634
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:24,904
man.
There's a lot of factors in when you 

635
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:27,550
were born,
like what?

636
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:30,640
Like a lot of it he goes on about hockey
players,

637
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,563
about professional hockey players that 
almost all of them were born at a 

638
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:38,530
certain time so that they were at the 
end of the age cutoff.

639
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,040
Like say if

640
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,850
you're between 10 and 11 when you go 
into what is that fifth grade?

641
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,300
You're,
if you're one of the oldest kids,

642
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,220
you have a way better chance of being 
successful at hockey because your body's

643
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,054
more mature than whether you're one of 
the youngest kids that goes into sixth 

644
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,430
grade.
So with your fifth grade or sixth grade,

645
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,060
like what year you were born is a big 
factor.

646
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,820
So the kids that were born later so that
they're older rather the kids over there

647
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:07,654
that are older,
when they enter into the fifth grade or 

648
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:10,064
sixth grade,
they're like across the board 

649
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,670
unanimously.
All the top level professionals.

650
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,790
We're all older kids in younger grades 
so that they're planning against smaller

651
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:23,450
kids.
They get more time,

652
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,560
they,
they're better,

653
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,320
so they get more coaching,
beget more hours playing.

654
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,333
There's a lot of factors,
has a lot of factors in like one of the 

655
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:32,294
things about Bill Gates that there was,
there's a whole great chapter on Bill 

656
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,970
Gates and about when Bill Gates was 
young,

657
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,650
the school that he went to had a 
computer class that,

658
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,380
uh,
allowed him to do coding and then he got

659
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:47,180
into the University of Washington.

660
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,230
They would let him get into their,
their computer room from 3:00

661
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,011
AM to 6:00
AM.

662
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:52,844
They had this open block,
so him and his friends would sneak into 

663
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,750
that place at 3:00
in the morning.

664
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,170
So all these,
all these different factors that lead to

665
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,160
someone being like super successful.
It's not just that you work hard,

666
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,030
it's sometimes you get these weird 
advantages in life.

667
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,530
There's a bunch of things like,
for sure hard work plays a factor.

668
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,430
If you don't do nothing,
he just sit around and,

669
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:16,264
and,
and woe is me and cry and think the 

670
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,090
world's fucked.
You're not going anywhere.

671
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,910
But the people that make it to the very 
top,

672
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:24,380
that Bill Gates,
the Steve Jobs,

673
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,420
they have a bunch of things going for 
them.

674
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:29,540
It's not just hard work.
It's also circumstance,

675
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,520
fortune,
where they are,

676
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,061
what,
you know,

677
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,490
who's around them,
who,

678
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:35,330
who,
who encourages them.

679
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,253
This.
There's a bunch of and what time they 

680
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,360
were born in,
what,

681
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,220
you know,
what age they were,

682
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:42,500
when certain things happened in the 
world.

683
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,860
There's a bunch of factors.
But for all those chicks,

684
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:46,850
just marrying the right dude.

685
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,020
Divorced,
getting.

686
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,773
I know a lady who uh,
just got aid from a divorce and she's 

687
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,460
just shooting shit into her face.
A bag and 20 year olds now.

688
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:04,400
It's hilarious.
She's in her late forties bag.

689
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,530
A 20 year old dudes.
Good.

690
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,250
Funny man to cut that check for the guy.
Yeah.

691
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,360
I've,
I've known guys I knew a guy who uh,

692
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,070
he cut a check for somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $50,000,000.

693
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,080
Yeah.
Two is x 30 grand a month.

694
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,980
G dirty GRANDPA.
He saw a couple of guys pay that.

695
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,113
That was,
that was not beside half million up 

696
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,390
front.
Oh yeah,

697
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,220
yeah.
House too.

698
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,980
Cars,
he just walked away.

699
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,660
I knew that guy was paying close to that
and he hasn't even seen his wife.

700
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,340
He's been married to a new woman,
a different woman for 14 years

701
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,520
at least.
Yeah,

702
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,353
14 years and he was only married to that
lady for 12 and he's still cutting her 

703
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:04,410
checks and no kids.
He's got kids with a new woman.

704
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,670
The old woman,
no kids still cutting her fat checks,

705
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,880
tries to bring it to court,
try to reduce the amount of money.

706
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,310
She fights him tooth and nail.
You lose sight of.

707
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:17,310
I bet you left me.
He left her 14 fucking years ago,

708
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,440
man.
They were only together for 12 years.

709
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,370
It's like she doesn't want to work is he
fucked her so hard.

710
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,330
She can't work anymore.

711
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,550
It's crazy.
If it was a man,

712
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,533
if the situation was reversed and a guy 
was dating a girl and they were dating 

713
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:34,700
for 12 years and she was like,
I'm tired of this.

714
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm gonna.
Go fuck some new dude.

715
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,530
And the guy took her to court,
got money from her and wanted money.

716
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:44,480
Still 14 years later.
What kind of a fucking man would that be

717
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,280
like,
get a job,

718
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,000
go do something with your life.
You're a human being.

719
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,790
You met another human being.
You spend some time with them.

720
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,690
They don't want to be with you anymore.
It's over like this.

721
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:57,524
There's no.
There's no children will told the judge 

722
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:00,554
that you want your lifestyle,
the lifestyle that you were accustomed 

723
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:03,411
to.
Maintain.

724
00:37:03,411 --> 00:37:04,640
My lifestyle,
judge,

725
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,640
I'd like to buy nice person.
I like to walk my little dog.

726
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,650
I like to put them into little little 
purse.

727
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,170
Now in California is different factors 
also.

728
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:15,200
You have to be with that person for 10 
years or something,

729
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:18,000
right?
There's a couple of ways.

730
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,580
There's this factors and they change,
you know,

731
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,770
depending upon the laws and they change 
depending upon how much money you make.

732
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,870
And you know,
my friend was pretty wealthy.

733
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,763
He did well,
but the guy who I know that had to pay 

734
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:32,370
$50,000,000,
he's real successful obviously that.

735
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,210
I mean you gotta make a lot of money to 
give your wife 50 million,

736
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,520
but he still had to give her $50 
million.

737
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,850
I see the list and I see the kid point 
zero,

738
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,210
baby.
I see the.

739

797
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,330
No,
he did not.

798
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,460
Do you see him?
You ever seen any of Joe Rogan machine?

800
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,020
Do you follow him at all?
I follow him,

801
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:40,854
yeah.
You see any of the videos that he does 

802
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:42,924

A man like him dancing still like 

803
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:48,920
Michael Jackson.
What?

804
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,920
That guy does not fuck around.
No,

805
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,170
and I still remember one particular 
story where he got the bold,

806
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,730
they played the with the Buffalo,
with a,

807
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,450
with the college plays.
He walked in and he goes,

808
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,940
what's wrong with those seats?
And they were like,

809
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:05,370
well Mr Jagger that behind the stage 
bitch,

810
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,343
you better get the selling because I 
ain't taking the stage until those 

811
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:15,060
motherfuckers are sold that I sold the 
tickets behind the stage and Mick Jagger

812
00:41:15,061 --> 00:41:17,160
was brutal.
They could pay for my ass,

813
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,790
they could pay for my ass.
Mick Jagger is brutal.

814
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,110
Pro.
He's brutal.

815
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,510
And that was back before they had those 
giant screens.

816
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,890
There was no distance distance.
80 eighth.

817
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,280
They didn't have those giant screens.
This is 88,

818
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:30,960
87.
They don't give a fuck.

819
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,230
They didn't have those big lcds.
We could see them.

820
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,010
Yeah.
Like if you go

821
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,490
see like say drake and he's at a theater
and around and like you see is.

822
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,100
But you're going to see his face on 
giant screens all around you.

823
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,840
You'll see it.
You know,

824
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,123
if you go to see like a real popular 
person and there's a lot of people 

825
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,050
playing in the round,
you know,

826
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,140
Jack is an interesting guy.
I don't think he,

827
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:58,620
he's like very tight watches.
Is this tight?

828
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,803
You know,
he's just like time as you have left 

829
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:04,190
though.
I mean he's like 76.

830
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,940
No,
72 maybes.

831
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Seventy to 75.
He's like 75.

832
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,780
How much time you got left?
If he keeps a lucky,

833
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,690
everything goes great.
You got 25 years,

834
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,763
but those last 25 or rough.
Not with what he's got because he could 

835
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,624
just lay there all day.
Have young girls massage and he's Mick 

836
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,933
Jagger.
They could just blow on his little 

837
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:30,620
knapsack and sing fucking.

838
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,490
He's probably getting blood transfusions
every day.

839
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:35,920
I know he takes good care.
He's looking at.

840
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,360
He used the backbone of the organization
and just the fact that Keith Richards is

841
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:42,194
still alive and kicking and there's 
people out there doing crossfit and 

842
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:48,830
didn't Keith Richards write a book where
he's Kinda Shitty about Mick Jagger?

843
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,940
He just told a talk shit about each 
other.

844
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:54,930
Right?
That's how they sell books.

845
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:55,461
Dog.
Yeah.

846
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:56,294
I know.
That's how they make probably called 

847
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:59,270
them and said,
do this.

848
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,740
The this,
the truth.

849
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,130
Fuck it.
Give me 10 percent at when that.

850
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:04,964
When.
I mean when I watched those little 

851
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,640
rehearsal tapes,
looky,

852
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,613
looky,
looky there,

853
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,780
his fingers.
Look at those fingers will.

854
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
We're looking at a Keith Richards.
Keith Richards.

855
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:19,280
Fingers is every knuckle is swollen to 
the point.

856
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:23,200
It's like double the size.
He looks like he's got Megaton Diaz,

857
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,670
his hands.
He's like a like a Jujitsu guy.

858
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,350
You ever seen Megaton Diaz?
His hands.

859
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:32,900
The big fucking Kensie turns dad.
The girl who wrote the made that video.

860
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,970
It was Hilarious,
but her dad,

861
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,340
Megaton doc,
the Jujitsu legend,

862
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,020
all his life.
He's done.

863
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,160
The guys who do the gear all the time,
they develop real bad arthritis in their

864
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,680
hands and their joints swell up like 
crazy.

865
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,550
See if you find megaton his hands.
That's not a good picture.

866
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,910
That's but there's pictures of his.
His knuckles that they're crazy.

867
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,830
They're all fucked up and twisted like 
this.

868
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,860
I can tell a little bit there.
There you go.

869
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,570
Zoom in on his bill.
He was.

870
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,180
Because he'd turn his day.
Yeah,

871
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,960
her dad is a fucking legend.
Look,

872
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,850
go zooming on his hands as much as I 
could go.

873
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,830
Oh,
that's as much as it goes.

874
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,260
But you see.
See how fucking flamed out.

875
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:19,220
Those Naacos.
Our guys have done this their whole life

876
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,280
and they're always grab it and hold onto
that game.

877
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,900
They get that.
Yeah,

878
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:26,240
that's okay.
We get the point,

879
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,373
but that.
That's what Keith Richards fingers look 

880
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:31,120
like.
Like he's secretly doing Jujitsu.

881
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,123
Sly,

882
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,600
but that's 40 years of planning.
Yes,

883
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,960
man,
that is crazy.

884
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,000
That's good to hop.
Playing 40 years,

885
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:42,030
50 years.
He looks just as good as Mick Jagger.

886
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,510
He's doing blow everyday eating 
cockroaches.

887
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,040
He looks as good as mcjagger.
Look,

888
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,830
they look great.
I don't think he looks as.

889
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,080
I think mcjagger looks fucking 
sensational,

890
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,153
but he doesn't in the face.
If you look at the two of them in the 

891
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:56,640
face,
get make that picture bigger.

892
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,440
Jeremy.
Look at them in the face.

893
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,760
Mick Jagger,
it looks older,

894
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,340
but that's just.
It's hard to tell because Keith Richards

895
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,090
is smiling.
We should go out.

896
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:08,250
Would love to see Mick Jagger still pull
21 year olds out of the audience.

897
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,890
I bet they feel so weird when he fucks 
him.

898
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,040
It must feel so weird like you want to 
do it.

899
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,020
Like if I was a girl,
I was 20 years old,

900
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,090
I would fuck Mick Jagger just for the 
story,

901
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,320
but when he climbs on top of you and you
smelled death,

902
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,750
this smell it coming out of his pores.

903
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,430
He's not old.
He's as bad cells.

904
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,590
You smiled,
misfiring cells all over the place.

905
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,010
This 70 year old people that don't look 
like that.

906
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:40,110
Seventy year old people are not going on
the road.

907
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,570
They weren't dancing like that.
Like that.

908
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:45,900
That's something that you have to,
and this is a new thing.

909
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,470
You have to take all these.
First of all,

910
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,010
all these bands that are going on,
I run this.

911
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,820
How about somebody called me a day and 
they're like,

912
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:57,654
hey man,
I'm doing thinking of doing something 

913
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,020
New Year's Eve downtown.
You know,

914
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:01,854
I hate new years eve and I hate downtown
even more fucking Ozzy Osborne just 

915
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,840
doing the forum.
New Year's Eve,

916
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,770
the western forum.
The only forum I fucking know.

917
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,290
And La Way.
Yeah,

918
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:20,550
with Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson,
fucking just.

919
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,733
And I'm sitting there going 70 years old
and he's doing New Year's Eve at the 

920
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:32,190
fucking forgot to.
I forgot to.

921
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,220
His wife probably tells them,
fuck out of the house.

922
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,010
Go make money,
make money.

923
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,120
New Year's Eve at the forum,
Joe it.

924
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,670
Connect his ankles together with rubber 
bands so we can't make big steps.

925
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,840
Ever.
See I walks.

926
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,340
Is that true?
If you're trying to pull a Mickey,

927
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Mickey made fucking rocky.
Put the tire lights together is the same

928
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,290
problem.
Rocky had.

929
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:03,291
He told me you saw the trailer for creed
for Creek.

930
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,240
The first one's good.
Did you watch it?

931
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,440
I told you.
I called you and said watch it.

932
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:15,540
If you have an academy award winner,
man for years.

933
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,350
I don't know.
I don't know.

934
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,560
I don't know how I felt about so vested 
stolen.

935
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,120
I'm a fan.
I just didn't.

936
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,253
Then I went to your house that time and 
your wife was goofing on you and she's 

937
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:25,651
like,
I think he's got.

938
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:30,040
He's in love with Sylvester stallone.
The you like.

939
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,180
Look at this.
Look at him.

940
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,850
And you had a picture of his phone when 
he was 65.

941
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:36,390
He was just jacked.
Yeah,

942
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,090
like all that shit and stuff.
And then I was on a plane and I said,

943
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:40,924
let me watch this creed,
and I had tears in my eyes because I'm 

944
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:45,934
like,
this guy has got no respect for years 

945
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:52,130
and you look at them now people goof him
and shit dog.

946
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,920
He wrote to his whole back done.
He's wow.

947
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:58,930
Look at that.
Like in on his back.

948
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,993
Wow.
I didn't know he had his whole back 

949
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:03,160
done.
That's crazy.

950
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,900
Like this guy wrote a fucking two or 
three franchises.

951
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,380
Yeah.
This guy started like when you.

952
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,243
The other day they had some things about
facts about a guy like he was fucking 

953
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,340
broke.
Had to sell his dog.

954
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,470
He had to do all this shit to make 
rocket lawyer.

955
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,320
That picture right there.

956
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,990
Yeah.
Look at this Guy Jack.

957
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:31,170
Seventy one.
Jacked fucking jacked.

958
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:35,890
When I saw that commercial for the first
one with creed,

959
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,510
I was watching this shit.
And then AMC lately,

960
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,830
every Sunday or something,
they throw a rock here and you say,

961
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,053
what the fuck?
I got 10 minutes before world news 

962
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:48,334
tonight.
And you start watching it and you see 

963
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:53,110
the brilliance of what this man has 
done.

964
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,310
Yeah.
It's brilliant,

965
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,420
it's just completely brilliant,
whether it's cheesy with dri,

966
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,523
when he gets beat up and Apollo creed 
takes them to the ghetto and makes them 

967
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:08,051
look at brothers and they teach them and
now and then create.

968
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,440
That kid by the way is a bad ass 
motherfucker.

969
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,750
Michael Johnson.
Oh,

970
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,090
black pants and Black Panther.
Greatness.

971
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,280
Christ.
He's the other guy.

972
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:22,450
A fucking superb but this now and you 
look at it and you're like,

973
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,720
like me and you at the store behind it,
like you would say to me,

974
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,260
really Jodie is he's going to fight the 
Russian son.

975
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,840
I could have wrote that idea on a 
fucking.

976
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,060
It's still huge.
It's still coming out Thanksgiving Day.

977
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:39,970
This guy is coming.
It's going to be huge.

978
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,230
It's going to be huge.
I'll be there front and center at 1:00.

979
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,690
Crises,
that franchise started in the seventies,

980
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,723
Seventies.
He made rocky one and I remember I 

981
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:52,624
watched it when I was a little kid.
I drank raw eggs and a ran around the 

982
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:56,794
block.
Like I just listened to a David Goggins 

983
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,750
fucking motivational speech.
I just,

984
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:02,584
uh,
I read about this when this first 

985
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:05,284
started shooting this,
he told him to hit him for real and he 

986
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,000
put him in Icu for nine days.
Don't flunk.

987
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:13,510
And he said to try to knock them out.
What?

988
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,040
Why would he do that?
I don't know.

989
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:20,410
It was a legit kill and karate champion.
Dolph Lundgren is a bad motherfucker,

990
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,130
like legitimate bad motherfucker like,
you know,

991
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,100
and he did a bunch of those crazy action
movies and he played the punisher

992
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,100
and all the sudden.
But that guy is a,

993
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,620
was a legit karate champion.
He's a bad motherfucker.

994
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:35,450
Talk longer than I would not want that 
guy hit.

995
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:37,670
And what's this?
What's this one called?

996
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,280
London put me in the hospital during 
rocky for.

997
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,250
Why would he let him hit him?
Well,

998
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:44,480
you know,
who else knocked him?

999
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:47,600
Antonio Tarver knocked Sylvester 
stallone out when they,

1000
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,990
when he was doing that movie where he 
was still boxing.

1001
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,143
Remember just a few years ago,
he was in his sixties and he was boxing 

1002
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:59,300
in one of those movies.
A font.

1003
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,310
Antonio Tarver.
Magic man.

1004
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,153
Tarver was a heavyweight champion.
Light heavyweight champion knocked out 

1005
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,610
Roy Jones Jr member when he stood in 
front of Roy Jones,

1006
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,720
Roy Jones,
go got excuses tonight,

1007
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:09,554
Roy.
And then he knocked him out and Tonio 

1008
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,153
Tara is a bad motherfucker.
And apparently when they were doing 

1009
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,420
scenes in a movie,
he clipped him and k Odom,

1010
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:21,400
here's the quick story.
He said he,

1011
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:22,234
uh,
for the first 45 seconds he tried to 

1012
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,210
really knock them out.
He hit him.

1013
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:28,330
So hardest chest started to serve,
his heart started to swell,

1014
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:29,164
his blood pressure went up.
I had to go back on an emergency jet to 

1015
00:51:32,111 --> 00:51:35,590
America and he was in Icu for five days.
Whoa.

1016
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:38,850
And the insurance company,

1017
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,560
now I'm intensive care for five days 
with nuns walking around.

1018
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:46,610
Insurance Company will not pay out of 
this other footage of the incident.

1019
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,560
Once they did,
they wrote the check,

1020
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,280
he hit my heart so hard,
it banged against my ribs and started to

1021
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:53,114
swell.
And that usually happens in car 

1022
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:55,664
accidents.
So I was hit by a truck that is 

1023
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:58,784
ridiculous when it's slow.
And also talks about why you hated 

1024
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:04,430
London from the get go.
They're friends now.

1025
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,353
Oh,
probably because a big handsome fella 

1026
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,470
from fucking Norway or wherever the hell
he is from.

1027
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,110
Where's he from?
Dolph lundgren with that name.

1028
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,123
Sweden.
I think he's from some justice and 

1029
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:16,903
cousin.

1030
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,810
His cousin or something.
Sweden.

1031
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,930
He's a legit bad motherfucker though.
I didn't know that.

1032
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:26,960
He was a cute guy.
Was a karate champion?

1033
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,660
Yeah,
I think he was a national champion.

1034
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,250
Cookie Shins.
No joke,

1035
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:31,820
man.
Those,

1036
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,170
those,
those fucking guys.

1037
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:34,004
That's a hard style.
Very hard style isn't a GSP stone was 

1038
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:40,454
so.
Yeah,

1039
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:46,570
I think you almost killed Christian.
I'm pretty sure they really hard hitting

1040
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:50,320
motherfuckers.
It's a very hard kicks.

1041
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,030
Lot of wheel kicks.
What they do in the tournament's.

1042
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,850
Kilkee shouldn't tournament's they'd 
punch to the body full blast,

1043
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,800
but kick to the legs,
the head,

1044
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:58,634
the body,
and they're standing right in front of 

1045
00:52:59,631 --> 00:53:01,400
each other and beat the fuck out of each
other.

1046
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:02,234
It's horrific.
It's like kind of the opposite of 

1047
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,970
taekwondo was a lot of kicks and punches
only to the body too.

1048
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,760
But Kyoko Shin,
they,

1049
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:13,623
they through leg kicks in there and 
there wasn't a lot of foot work with 

1050
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:17,060
most of those guys.

1051
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,060
Most of those guys stood in front of 
each other and battery each other.

1052
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,283
But a lot of killed Christian guys went 
on to be really successful in 

1053
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,160
kickboxing.
In fact,

1054
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,420
a lot of,
um,

1055
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,493
a lot of the Holland influence in 
kickboxing came from qcc shouldn't 

1056
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,113
background,
like they started out with kewill 

1057
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,910
cushion and kickboxing and then they 
learned Thai Thai techniques as well.

1058
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,230
But a lot of those guys had a,
an influence of a cube auction.

1059
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:47,290
Karate is very big in Europe.
Started in martial arts.

1060
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:49,830
The big thing was just sweep,
sweep,

1061
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,420
delay.
Early seventies,

1062
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:56,510
everybody swept to high kicks and even 
if it was a spinning back kick your,

1063
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,710
the third one was a sweep and that 
motherfucker was gone.

1064
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,603
I used to go to all those karate 
tournament and that was my shit I throw 

1065
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,323
to high spinning back kick.
So he doesn't even want them to hit 

1066
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,920
sweeps allergenic and nobody's sweeps 
anymore.

1067
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,890
Nobody sweeper still do an MMA and more 
tied to a little bit,

1068
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,370
a little bit.
Never made,

1069
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,920
but not as much as I'd expect.
Good sweep with a good fucking leg.

1070
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,100
If you set them up with good old 
fashioned and sweep.

1071
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,700
I mean,
what's his name as that little sweep the

1072
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:27,810
leg.
Push your back.

1073
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:30,020
Uh,
you know your boy here,

1074
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,480
Jon Jones?
No,

1075
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,333
the other guy,
John Jones has it to all those 

1076
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,214
restaurants.
Does that show that little sweep that I 

1077
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:38,640
liked,
that little sweet,

1078
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:39,474
but I'm talking about from the fighters 
position to just coming to you with a 

1079
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,600
sweep and throw your legs out for 
Monday.

1080
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,510
It takes a bunch of fakes or I'm here 
with them.

1081
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,820
It's basically off like blah,
blah blah.

1082
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,530
And instead of the elbow coming around,
your leg comes around and sleeps.

1083
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,393
That guy off his feet.
He lands on his back and you went back 

1084
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,140
with your left.

1085
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,973
There's still some,
some guys that are really good at 

1086
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:02,070
sweeps.
The thing about mma is just,

1087
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:03,720
there's so many different things going 
on,

1088
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,750
you know,
but in Moy,

1089
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,220
Tai sweeps are huge and more tied to a 
big part of the sport.

1090
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:09,163
You know,
that's why I got cast when fights in 

1091
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,263
Bellator,
he's so high level and more now he's 

1092
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,970
getting into mma and he's fucking guys 
up,

1093
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,010
not just with sweeps and spinning 
elbows,

1094
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:21,760
all sorts of shit.
That is,

1095
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,130
that his level of more tie,
like,

1096
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,520
more time involves a lot of grappling,
a lot,

1097
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:27,354
a lot of weird stuff.
Listen to Kenny Florian one time and he 

1098
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:31,510
goes that,
uh,

1099
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,553
you know,
more tire even as a couple of aspects 

1100
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:37,260
from Jujitsu in it,
I guess not Jujitsu,

1101
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:40,190
but something Roman Greco Roman 
mountains.

1102
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,063
Right behind that though is clenching.
There's a lot of clench work and those 

1103
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:45,684
guys develop really strong cores and 
knacks that grabbing her by the back of 

1104
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:51,180
the neck,
moving each other around,

1105
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:55,440
sweeping each other all the time.
There's so much involved in framing with

1106
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:58,980
your forearms and sweeping the legs out 
and twisting and,

1107
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,053
and changing angles.
It's a great one when you learn the 

1108
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:08,160
other aspects of wrestling,
when you learn takedowns and control and

1109
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:08,994
then when you learn Jiu Jitsu and all 
these other like having that background 

1110
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:12,834
from the clench or Moitai is so gigantic
because so many different things opened 

1111
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,873
up from their elbows open up from their 
knees to the body open up from their us 

1112
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,980
in high school.
I wrestled one year in high school.

1113
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,913
Why didn't you wrestle for?
Because I was still doing taekwondo at 

1114
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,940
the time.
I had to figure out what.

1115
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
What was more,
you know,

1116
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,000
what was more important to me?
I just.

1117
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,690
I couldn't do both.
It's just too exhaust.

1118
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,000
That wrestling shit,
Mr.

1119
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,680
he used to have that fucking weight room
down 290.

1120
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,593
They were doing the yoga before Hatha 
Yoga was invented that room and it was 

1121
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:50,980
hotter than bestest.
Covered off the ceiling.

1122
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,320
I was like,
what is covering these pipes?

1123
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,150
No one's checked these pipes.
I'm like,

1124
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:57,250
I don't want cancer.
What's happening in this?

1125
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:02,370
The fucking best.
Those that we breathe as best as I paint

1126
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:06,580
chips,
get a guide and all the water had led.

1127
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,110
It didn't have land.
You'd be like,

1128
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:09,970
what?
I went to the park yesterday,

1129
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,200
my daughter and there was a lady next to
me and she asked me where I was from and

1130
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:15,034
she goes,
her father was from Brooklyn and we 

1131
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:16,654
started talking and she had beautiful 
two year old and a two year old got 

1132
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:20,794
caught on one of the monkey bars and the
father had to go over and help her and 

1133
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:24,903
she goes,
I remember going up to my father's 

1134
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,380
neighborhood and seeing this play art 
that were nothing like these are.

1135
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,200
I still remember coming from Cuba and 
doing that,

1136
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,370
you know,
in monkey bars,

1137
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,443
but then you get so good that you put 
your legs up and you hang by your knees 

1138
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,070
and one day Brian and hanging right.
And I landed on that concrete.

1139
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,850
There was no rubber in those days.
It was just straight up concrete.

1140
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,920
Half the first grade I fucking torched.
I switched the first grade.

1141
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,990
I landed right on my fucking neck.
I never got on a monkey bar.

1142
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:55,943
Got Break.
A lot of kids don't fuck around with 

1143
00:57:58,901 --> 00:57:59,734
monkey bars at all.
Thought I broke my arm in the monkey 

1144
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:02,374
bar.
My daughter broke her arm in a monkey 

1145
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,414
bar.
My another kid in my daughter's class 

1146
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,760
broke her arm in a monkey body down with
a monkey bar.

1147
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,710
Fall down.
Try to catch yourself.

1148
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,020
Put poster arm snap.
Yeah,

1149
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,363
you got a real common monkey bars or 
fucking dangerous because you're don't 

1150
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,190
have the hand strength yet.

1151
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,340
You're six years old,
so you grabbing ahold of bars and you're

1152
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:25,174
swinging and you just don't really have 
the dexterity of the hand strength and 

1153
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:28,174
it slips and you fall back and your post
and you got to see my daughter on that 

1154
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,240
monkey bars.
She gets it.

1155
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:38,920
She does it until my hands bleed.
Dog little blisters.

1156
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:41,290
The mother's got to put a bandaid on.
It's fierce.

1157
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,040
Yeah.
I liked that about it.

1158
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,290
She's fierce.
I take it to.

1159
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,600
I put a lot of time into that shit.
I,

1160
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,530
you know,
it's really weird because of the cabinet

1161
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:56,320
on situation and the Harvey Weinstein 
situation.

1162
00:58:56,321 --> 00:58:57,790
You're a dad.
I'm a dad.

1163
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,160
It's different than how you got to raise
your daughter.

1164
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,870
Now.
This has affected me in a way.

1165
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,183
The capital thing was pissing me off for
a few weeks because I don't like the 

1166
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:07,384
idea that they could come back to you 
for something you did in high school 

1167
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,480
that that's just not right in my world.

1168
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:17,350
Unless I fucked you in the ass in 
highschool and covered your mouth.

1169
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,320
I didn't do nothing.
You know what I'm saying?

1170
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,040
I think that was the thing he did do 
though.

1171
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,890
He did cover covered amount or whatever,
but who knows what really happened?

1172
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:26,180
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

1173
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,400
Nobody knows.
So it was 36 years ago.

1174
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,713
I know for a fact.
I've known you for 20 and I've seen you 

1175
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,970
sweeten up over the years.
We all change.

1176
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,760
You're not the same Joe Rogan I met 20 
years ago.

1177
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,350
I'm definitely not the same guy was in 
highschool school.

1178
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,070
Come on please.
But he was a.

1179
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,933
He was a guy that was hanging around 
with a bunch of drunk jocks and we all 

1180
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:48,770
remember drunk and you know,
you know,

1181
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:49,221
and that,
that,

1182
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,740
that environment that,
that,

1183
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,790
that sort of in the environment of being
around a bunch,

1184
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,440
a bunch of drunk guys who are constantly
one upping each other,

1185
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,120
I'd say that's a sketchy fucking 
environment.

1186
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,850
And that's the frat houses.
Well,

1187
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:04,010
the Yale thing scared me.
That's what I thought.

1188
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,900
You know,
those guys that rich kids,

1189
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,343
you know,
what happened was I got a little bit of 

1190
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:08,744
money.
Everything's been covered up all their 

1191
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:11,690
lives.
Everything has been covered up all their

1192
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,524
lives.
You know,

1193
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,510
when I was a kid,
I knew this girl,

1194
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,190
they used to call them Monday and Friday
nights to get in a car and they drive it

1195
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:23,210
to like fucking Connecticut and those 
yet to suck all the decks to get home.

1196
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:24,463
God knows of that poor girl is today.
Last time I saw it was 1993 getting 

1197
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:30,470
coconut building in Harlem and she's 
like,

1198
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:32,900
you gotta save big with some guy in the 
car.

1199
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:34,190
He doesn't want to leave me alone.
I'm like,

1200
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,470
listen bitch,
I'm walking to my car.

1201
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:41,060
I never saw you before my life.
I swear to God.

1202
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,650
I bumped into an cop house on 181st 
street,

1203
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,083
10 years after high school.
I'm in a fucking fourth floor with some 

1204
01:00:50,151 --> 01:00:50,984
Dominican's.
I'm walking down the stairs and there's 

1205
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,740
mindy had and she's like,
what are you doing here?

1206
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:55,574
The same thing you're fucking doing.
They obviously what's fucked up is for 

1207
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,140
some people their experiences in high 
school define them.

1208
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,560
You know,
I just watched that.

1209
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:09,320
A Stephen King movie it the most recent 
one with the clown.

1210
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,120
Yeah,
pretty fucking good.

1211
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:15,140
But one of the things that I was 
thinking when I was watching it was like

1212
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:18,770
how fucking mean kids are in school to 
each other.

1213
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,243
I guess you kind of forget about that.
And then you watch one of those movies 

1214
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:25,370
about people being mean to people and 
you're like,

1215
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,000
oh yeah,
I remember going around to get away from

1216
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:32,180
a guy that was picking on me that was 
fuck with me.

1217
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,013
And like you would be scared of running 
into him at the bus stop and scared of 

1218
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:36,674
seeing them after school.
And that's how I got into martial arts 

1219
01:01:39,231 --> 01:01:41,720
in the first place.
I got tired of being scared,

1220
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,560
scared of people's judgment.
I was still fucking kid.

1221
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,800
Let me tell you the funniest thing about
the movie.

1222
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:52,430
It was so they fuck with clowns.
So two months later,

1223
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:54,620
a bunch of clowns and got together and 
went on strike.

1224
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,020
They went downtown and they had a 
parade,

1225
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,240
like a,
not a Perretta,

1226
01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:00,930
what do you call it when people get 
together and.

1227
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,353
And they fucking have science.
This is right after that movie was 

1228
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,510
released.
Whenever that movie was released,

1229
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,670
a month later,
two months later,

1230
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:11,923
a bunch of clowns in the California area
got together downtown and picketed 

1231
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,450
Stephen King because they will lose work
as clowns Christ.

1232
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,900
Because they had lost a bunch of clowns 
got canceled.

1233
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,260
They lost all their clown season work or
some shit.

1234
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,260
I read the book a long time.
Which one?

1235
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,900
I remember I was like,
man,

1236
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:32,010
how are they?
Gonna make a movie out of this.

1237
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:32,963
And they made a movie out of it way back
in the day with John boy from the 

1238
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,104
waltons.
I mean the dude with the mole on his 

1239
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:39,940
face got a pony.
Talented.

1240
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:41,183
I watched it the other night on tv,
just flipping through the channels it 

1241
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:44,574
was on and it was after a couple of days
after I'd seen the most recent version 

1242
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,460
of it.
It was hilariously bad.

1243
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:55,110
Who is so stupid.
But it was John boy with the Waltons in.

1244
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:59,080
Might've been.
How many versions of that it movie?

1245
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:02,860
Did they make that?
Was it just two?

1246
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,050
The first one was the first one with 
Tim.

1247
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,320
The guy from the rocky horror picture 
show that will allow.

1248
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,170
It was who the clown was.
Yeah.

1249
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,400
It was so stupid.
It was like,

1250
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,570
it wasn't scary at all.
I mean,

1251
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:19,590
not,
not even remotely,

1252
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,750
but the new one was pretty fucking 
scary.

1253
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,693
Well,
Stephen King dog is so fucking crazy 

1254
01:03:24,741 --> 01:03:26,840
motherfucker.
We both read on writing.

1255
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,370
Well we both did.
You see him on the songs and he ever.

1256
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,530
No,
he went,

1257
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,070
they contacted from like,
we want you to be on a Sunday.

1258
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,500
And he's like,
it was the only way I'll be honest,

1259
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:41,990
it's like if I could ride my motorcycle,
they had to go back and forth,

1260
01:03:41,991 --> 01:03:42,824
like we don't need just what I just tell
you if I go on Sunday and I had to ride 

1261
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:50,510
my motorcycle.
So he played a creepy guy that makes you

1262
01:03:50,511 --> 01:03:53,540
disappear after they kill you.
Really?

1263
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,433
Like he comes in and measure like you 
were on the floor dead and he walked in 

1264
01:03:57,851 --> 01:04:00,260
and measure you and tell you what he 
needs.

1265
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,290
I need a rope.
I need some gasoline.

1266
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,720
I need a club.
I also need a selection of Seventies.

1267
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:06,554
Classic rock.
And then you disappeared when you come 

1268
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:11,570
back.
There's nothing there.

1269
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,390
And they walk them out.
He tells you what you want.

1270
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:15,310
How much?
800.

1271
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:18,170
You pay on the 800.
If you only have six,

1272
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:21,170
he'll look around the room.
It just take like a statue.

1273
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:25,700
Just walk out of your house.
Ties a statue on the motorcycle.

1274
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,520
He was classic Sunday Attic,
you know?

1275
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:30,970
Uh,

1276
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:35,970
the crazy thing about him was his battle
coming back from getting hit by that guy

1277
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:39,290
in a car.
He was a walking,

1278
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,150
I think it was in Maine,
right?

1279
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,373
It was walking and some guy wasn't 
paying attention and fucking hit him in 

1280
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:49,520
his car and just destroyed his body,
like just destroyed his body.

1281
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:52,670
Like,
I mean he was fucked up for long.

1282
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,010
The motorcycle and a motorcycle.
Yeah.

1283
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,170
Shattered his.
No,

1284
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:57,230
no.
He was walking.

1285
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:01,950
He was just walking.
Then we got hit by a guy in a van talk.

1286
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:04,760
When I read that,
I think you turned me onto it.

1287
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:05,594
When I read that chapter on Carrie,
how he got written half a carry and 

1288
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:15,281
threw it away and his wife found him 
finish it and it was about a girl with a

1289
01:05:16,011 --> 01:05:17,900
period or something and

1290
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,190
like I was in shock.
Great Book.

1291
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,250
Carrie is a great book.
Carrie and Cujo,

1292
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,200
my favorite Stephen King books who?
Joe,

1293
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:27,034
till this day I have it.
I look at it and I respected the site 

1294
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,320
cocaine.
I don't even open that book.

1295
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,110
I just look at it and touch it from time
to time and I go,

1296
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,703
Ooh,
I don't know if I want to get into that 

1297
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:38,310
thing.
No,

1298
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:42,020
it's a great book that they like the 
movie version of it.

1299
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:42,854
It's just like,
Eh,

1300
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,420
was pet cemetery.
Pet cemetery is a book.

1301
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,590
Here's some things about books.
You know,

1302
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,400
I hate the cliche that books are better.
Oh,

1303
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:52,234
the book's better.
But what is interesting about books is 

1304
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:59,260
there certain things that you shouldn't 
really see?

1305
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,010
You should only imagine like they work 
out better in,

1306
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,950
in your,
in your imagination,

1307
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,813
like there's something much creepier 
about them in your imagination and pet 

1308
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,430
cemetery.

1309
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:12,910
Think he was right about something 
creepy.

1310
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:13,813
Done.
Like whenever I have a hard time 

1311
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,250
sleeping or something like that,
something's going on with me.

1312
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,640
So instead of sitting in bed and having 
what's called insomnia,

1313
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,240
I get up and I write it up.
When you read that back,

1314
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:27,520
it's like when I write about something I
did as a kid,

1315
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:30,210
whether it's Robin,
Freddy at Putnam field.

1316
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:31,044
When I was a kid,
I used to rob this gas station every 

1317
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:35,800
eight weeks and you know,
like when I was in West Palm Beach,

1318
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:40,630
your kids showed up.
Kid showed up in my school when I was in

1319
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:42,610
West Palm Beach and he goes,
I will have something,

1320
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:46,270
and he goes,
this is a map you drew of us.

1321
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,110
We're about to rob a gas station in 
1981.

1322
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,340
He still had the map with me with stick 
man grabbed this.

1323
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,190
We would rob this gas station every six 
to eight weeks.

1324
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,920
Come in from the left,
coming from the north.

1325
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,590
I don't even know what the fuck.
The point I'm trying to make was,

1326
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:05,830
I forgot it somewhere along the line,
but right about things that you did that

1327
01:07:05,831 --> 01:07:08,200
were even when I write about that and 
you read them,

1328
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,180
it's different.
Iphone.

1329
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,760
Fuck you.
Reading is fucking phenomenal.

1330
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,313
Build imagination.
That's why when you read silence of the 

1331
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:17,044
lambs and you watched a movie,
you got to get everybody in that room 

1332
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:23,200
and give him a big hug because they kept
it honest.

1333
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:24,034
They kept it real.
When you read William Blake leaves the 

1334
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:27,274
excesses and then the emphasis has been 
on for the last two weeks on AMC and 

1335
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,500
I've been watching bits and pieces of it
and I can upload it more.

1336
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,490
You know,
it was fucking great.

1337
01:07:36,491 --> 01:07:39,550
That moving the priest.
That's Jackie gleason son in law.

1338
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,240
Is it really?

1339
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,590
Yes.
Jason,

1340
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,050
who's Jason?
Whatever his father,

1341
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,273
Jason,
whatever it was that he was in sleepers 

1342
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,520
with,
uh,

1343
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,610
with uh,
with uh,

1344
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:54,510
Brad Pitt Deniro.
He played the newspaper reporter.

1345
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,220
That's his fucking father.
But Damien,

1346
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:59,800
charisse plays the priest.
That's Jackie gleason,

1347
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:01,480
his son in law.
He married Jackie gleason,

1348
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:02,314
his daughter.
And it's funny because last week I was 

1349
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:08,140
in my office typing and my wife called.
She goes,

1350
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:10,870
I'm gonna be home in 20 minutes with the
baby,

1351
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,350
so I don't know what you're doing.
I go,

1352
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,680
right.
So I want the living room.

1353
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,053
I turned the TV on just to be out there 
because unless you're going to want to 

1354
01:08:18,851 --> 01:08:19,684
watch cartoons or whatever,
and I saw the exorcisms and I turned it 

1355
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:26,660
on and dog it came on when the priest 
comes through the door,

1356
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,573
which if I bump into that director,
I will take this deck out and suck it 

1357
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,860
because that's what real directing is he
scheduled without showing you anything.

1358
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,383
When the priest comes through the door,
all you see is an image and you don't 

1359
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:45,230
see what his face looked like and it 
scares you,

1360
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,333
but when he walks in,
he takes this motherfucker and the guy 

1361
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:50,990
says to him,
can I get you something?

1362
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:53,120
How was your trip?
Can I get you something?

1363
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:54,860
And he goes,
do you want some coffee?

1364
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:55,694
And he goes,
no,

1365
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,930
let's do this.
And this guy's a psychiatrist.

1366
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,840
You have to watch the gun.
This guy's a psychiatrist.

1367
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:07,140
Not only is he a priest and he starts 
dropping and psycho and the priest looks

1368
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:08,270
over and goes,
knock it off.

1369
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,620
The devil is cutting,
you know,

1370
01:09:10,621 --> 01:09:14,210
tack your psychological like nobody else
to not listen to him.

1371
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:18,020
And he just breaks it down.
And then the guy says to him,

1372
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,260
do you want to know the three levels of 
manifestation?

1373
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,010
And he looks at him.

1374
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:23,900
He goes,
no,

1375
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:29,650
there's only one st and St.
so it's just right there.

1376
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:34,160
You're like,
so my daughter walks in while it's on.

1377
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:38,450
The five-year-old walks in and she sits 
on my lap and she's a Bible beater.

1378
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,820
I don't know if you know this,
that mercy is a Bible beater.

1379
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,830
She loves anything with God and you know
I got a little fucking thing she gave me

1380
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,650
with Jesus of fish.
Yeah,

1381
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,460
mercy.
My daughter is a Bible beater.

1382
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:52,040
Even though she goes to fucking public 
school,

1383
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,350
she'll come home and they didn't talk 
about God today.

1384
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:55,663
So she's watching this whole 
manifestation of these two priests 

1385
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:00,634
talking about God is powerful.
God is going to kill Satan and all of a 

1386
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:09,680
sudden they walk into the room and she's
sitting up and she's like,

1387
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,733
my daughter caught it.
Took like 30 seconds to just look at me 

1388
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:20,840
and she just ran out of the room like 
she doesn't know who Satan is,

1389
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,890
nothing.

1390
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:26,330
She just ran out of the room.
This is one of the scariest movies.

1391
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:29,960
One of the finest movies.
She elevates himself.

1392
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:31,483
Comes down.
What about when they say they do the 

1393
01:10:33,171 --> 01:10:37,280
first thing they walk out and what about
when they walked back in and he's a,

1394
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,143
he's a doctor so he's checking her heart
and she turns into the mother and the 

1395
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:46,420
hospital and start saying bme while you 
do this to me and,

1396
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:47,254
and the priest told him,
don't listen to them that the devil's 

1397
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:50,590
cunning,
you know,

1398
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,090
and all of a sudden,
what about when he comes in?

1399
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:52,924
He goes,
father,

1400
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,830
I bought sparing fine science but on all
off the bar because the devil start.

1401
01:10:56,831 --> 01:10:57,664
I mean Bro,
you have to watch it and while all this 

1402
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:00,464
is going on,
you have to remember that there's a 

1403
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:04,004
murder going on.
Because the first night when she came 

1404
01:11:06,411 --> 01:11:07,244
down,
before the devil came and some guy was 

1405
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:09,650
talking,
shit,

1406
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,690
I'm not saying he was talking shit.

1407
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:15,210
A Jewish guy was talking shit about a 
Nazi or something and she comes down and

1408
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:17,460
piece and says,
you're going to die,

1409
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:21,900
motherfucker going to die up there to an
astronaut wasn't,

1410
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:24,850
it wasn't an astronaut.
He was something downstairs.

1411
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,090
Didn't she say something like that?
You're going to die up there.

1412
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,051
No,
no,

1413
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:31,000
he was downstairs in the living room and
they was sending like a,

1414
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,843
didn't she?
She was talking to a guy who was an 

1415
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:37,641
astronaut and she said you're gonna die 
and then she peed the carpet and then it

1416
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:39,803
was a dinner party and then a couple 
nights later they found the guy on the 

1417
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:44,850
bottom of the stairs,
but it couldn't have been a girl because

1418
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:46,680
they twisted this neck all the way 
around.

1419
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:47,280
Right?
Yeah.

1420
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,113
So it had to be a man and that's why you
have to watch that movie when the cop 

1421
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:52,734
comes to talk to her mother was a famous
actress last time I watched it was like 

1422
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,990
five or six years ago.

1423
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,380
It's first one,
it's a deep moving.

1424
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:05,090
That girl got fucked up doing that 
movie,

1425
01:12:05,091 --> 01:12:06,560
you know,
listening.

1426
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,620
How can they make a 12 year old girl 
just took a crush on her pussy.

1427
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,390
I mean,
let's talk about truth now.

1428
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,790
She stuck across no pussy.
Took it out,

1429
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,300
grabbed her mother by the ears,
put her,

1430
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,950
said suck it,
eat me,

1431
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:21,330
let me.
Yeah.

1432
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,223
Alright.
And then picked her up and smacks her 

1433
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:26,190
and throw it across the fucking room.
She says,

1434
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:27,660
your mother's sucks.
Cox in the house.

1435
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:31,230
She told her one breaks.
Then you show that in the movie theater.

1436
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,423
Shame on them.
Like if I could sue the union city 

1437
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:38,220
cinema today,
I was sue them because they didn't check

1438
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:40,530
my id.
They didn't give a fuck.

1439
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,220
They took my $2 and let me threw me to 
the fucking walls.

1440
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,670
But I also saw.
What was her name again?

1441
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,660
Linda Blair Blair.
She showed up.

1442
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:51,510
Twenty years later she started hanging 
out with Rick James.

1443
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,540
Oh Man.
She.

1444
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,300
She shown up 20 years later.
Richard.

1445
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,460
I wonder what Linda Blair is doing for 
that,

1446
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,713
but I hope they paid her a lot of money 
because she never really recovered from 

1447
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:04,220
that.
She never really worked after that.

1448
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:06,530
It's something at work after you put a 
cross in your pussy.

1449
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:07,763
I mean that's Ginger Lynn.
It's tough to get a commercial for 

1450
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:13,700
fucking bounce.
I.

1451
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:14,900
Yeah.
Well it's also.

1452
01:13:14,901 --> 01:13:17,480
People never forget you were that 
person.

1453
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,343
Like it's very difficult for people to 
have a changed perception was she walks 

1454
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,364
down the stairs backwards.
What about when a head spins around in 

1455
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:29,180
front of the priests?
It's just too out there for a movie.

1456
01:13:29,181 --> 01:13:30,014
They could never.
They think of remaking that every once 

1457
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:37,750
in awhile and they looked at each other.
Jesus Christ.

1458
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,000
That was a creepy fucking movie and you 
kind of realize that back then there was

1459
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:51,001
nothing like this before this movie,
this movie was so extreme like there had

1460
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:55,960
been horror movies before,
but it was like Frankenstein or Dracula.

1461
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,033
They were kind of scary,
but the warm blooding though there was 

1462
01:14:00,071 --> 01:14:00,904
nothing like this movie.
This movie was so over the top and 

1463
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:05,854
people,
a lot of people at the time or like 

1464
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:08,464
this,
the movie represented something and 

1465
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,850
representative of boundaries that 
people,

1466
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:13,684
these young kids,
these people today like what the fuck 

1467
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:16,834
are they doing?
What kind of movies or they may 

1468
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,290
category.
I remember being,

1469
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:24,310
I remember being in Catholic school and 
they will just piss.

1470
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:25,960
They would tell them it's not to go see 
it.

1471
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:29,140
We weren't allowed to go see it,
bro.

1472
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:29,974
That's,
I was right there when the movie got 

1473
01:14:32,021 --> 01:14:36,600
released and I had to say it and they 
tell you can't see it.

1474
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:37,601
You're gonna.
See,

1475
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:40,510
it blew my fucking.
That's where I saw rocky,

1476
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,110
where everybody was on their feet 
yelling for rocky.

1477
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,860
This was different.
Everybody was young,

1478
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:51,040
rocky,
and they also saw the longest year I the

1479
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:51,874
original,
and this was a movie theater that was 

1480
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,830
basically Irish,
Italian and Cuban.

1481
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,620
But they,
they,

1482
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:01,570
they talked,
they yelled at the screen,

1483
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:04,960
you know,
they threw things at the screen and when

1484
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:08,290
the fucking longest yard,
when burt reynolds was coming back,

1485
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:13,000
the whole place is on their feet.
This was a great movie data and they let

1486
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:16,750
you in and they played the last movie at
1130.

1487
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:17,584
I just thought,
you know how many times I saw enter the 

1488
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:19,114
dragon.
They man,

1489
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,840
the late movie.
My mother let me walk up there.

1490
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,290
It was on 48th street and my mother's 
brother was on 29th street and she'd go,

1491
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:30,280
go and I saw everything that fist of 
fury,

1492
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,350
the outlaw Josey Wales,
all those fucking movies.

1493
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,330
I saw that.
And even when they played,

1494
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,164
I just go there as a Spanish kid and 
watch and learn the language and loved 

1495
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:44,140
it.
They had limitations,

1496
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,003
what they could do with special effects.
And so because of that you had to 

1497
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:51,880
accomplish much more with even with 
American Werewolf in London,

1498
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,140
right?
The original.

1499
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,730
The original.
What year was that made?

1500
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,250
I want to say 81.
I'm going to guess.

1501
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,820
Look at what year was it?
Was it 81?

1502
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:09,070
I'm the special effects.
Even though they were groundbreaking for

1503
01:16:09,071 --> 01:16:09,904
the time,
like when he's lying on the floor and 

1504
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:15,340
his body stretching Isaac and he's 
turned into the wolf.

1505
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:17,320
Like that shit when his face is 
stretching out.

1506
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:20,470
I mean those are groundbreaking special 
effects.

1507
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:22,600
Like no,
no one had ever seen anything like that.

1508
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,720
I enjoyed this.
I enjoyed.

1509
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,140
It's watching a movie now and 30 percent
of it.

1510
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,240
Forty percent of the CGI.
Yeah.

1511
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:32,920
Well that's what drives me fucking 
crazy.

1512
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,320
I watched that shit drives me crazy the 
other day.

1513
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,330
Which one?
Underwater?

1514
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,360
Kevin Costner?
No,

1515
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:37,750
no,
no.

1516
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,450
That was with the girl,
the vampire and the,

1517
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:46,420
the Lichens Kate beckinsale Christ.
She's just tremendous.

1518
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:47,690
She's tremendous,
tremendous.

1519
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:49,780
She's so hot.
She's just tremendous.

1520
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,990
I fell in love with him with the move 
when she got caught with heroin,

1521
01:16:52,991 --> 01:16:55,060
with Claire Danes at the jail in 
Thailand.

1522
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,160
Oh,
that's how long I've been in love with.

1523
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,340
It goes with,
with her and Claire Danes.

1524
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:04,750
Kate beckinsale something.
They both fell in love with the same guy

1525
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:07,360
and he put heroin on him and they put 
them in a prison.

1526
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,310
So I was flipping through the channels 
while I was broke down palace

1527
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,241
when uh,
oh,

1528
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:13,070
there it is.
When I was doing that,

1529
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:15,560
uh,
I'm doing this fucking fitness channel,

1530
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,453
this fitness challenge with Ari and Bert
and Tom and I just watching anything I 

1531
01:17:20,661 --> 01:17:21,494
can on TV while I'm on the elliptical 
machine or the rower or whatever the 

1532
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,920
fuck I'm doing.
And I was watching one of the underworld

1533
01:17:27,921 --> 01:17:30,230
movies and I realized there's like 10 of
them.

1534
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:33,620
I mean,
how many fucking underwear world movies.

1535
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:36,710
Is there been more than that?
How many is.

1536
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:40,100
She's been all of them.
She's the main star.

1537
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:44,510
They're so stupid.
The fucking one that I saw,

1538
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,643
I've been deep in.
She has a daughter now and there's five 

1539
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:50,750
of them.
I don't know which one I saw,

1540
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,733
but uh,
for the first two and I think the one 

1541
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:57,800
that was watching a lot of control for 
me that was,

1542
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,680
I think I was watching blood wars.
It was so dumb.

1543
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,860
But anyway,
the CGI,

1544
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:07,100
the Werewolf's are so corny.
They show you too much.

1545
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:09,350
It looks fake.
And the thing about an American Werewolf

1546
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:10,184
in London is they showed you a little 
quick snippets of the thing before we'd 

1547
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:17,870
kill people and it was just enough 
likely that they look so stupid.

1548
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,750
It just looks fake.
Like Cgi just does not look.

1549
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:24,584
And that was something that Pat Mcgee,
the guy who made that the werewolf out 

1550
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:30,380
there in the lobby,
it's what he had told me.

1551
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,910
He's like,
when you see your,

1552
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:36,110
your brain can tell that's not real.
Like even if it looks really good,

1553
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,630
your brain can tell it's not real.
He's like,

1554
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:39,493
what your brain.
If your brain sees special effects like 

1555
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,210
makeup,
like that kind of stuff.

1556
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,021
Like,
like,

1557
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:48,320
uh,
a face that's been done with prosthetics

1558
01:18:48,321 --> 01:18:50,300
and teeth and fangs.
Your brain says,

1559
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:51,500
oh,
that's a real thing.

1560
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,090
That's the thing that's right in front 
of you.

1561
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,133
Yeah.
Look,

1562
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,760
these worlds are so corny.
When they're running,

1563
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,330
it looks fake.
There's shadows.

1564
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:02,810
Look fake,
but pull up scene from American Werewolf

1565
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:03,880
in London like,
uh,

1566
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:07,760
like the actual werewolf.
They had very,

1567
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,540
very quick scenes.
He didn't see much of the Werewolf.

1568
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,420
It was very fast.
Like you see running through the streets

1569
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,220
of London.
You see it snapping it.

1570
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:17,054
Things like in that one that's in the 
beginning when they first got jack by 

1571
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:21,410
the war.
Jesus.

1572
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,713
Yeah.
Like this.

1573
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:30,000
Give me some volume here.
It puts it back.

1574
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:31,560
It up for a second.
Bag it up.

1575
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:34,160
So.
So they're running.

1576
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,710
You're really scared me.
You shithead going to help me up.

1577
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:57,050
Why?

1578
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:20,840
So you didn't see much?
Well,

1579
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:23,550
here's the,
here's the corny.

1580
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,690
It's 1981 right now.
I remember seeing Joe Rogen.

1581
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,640
You said it best a couple of minutes 
ago.

1582
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,790
That the thing that pisses me off the 
most is.

1583
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,880
And today's the whole movie business.
I grew up on the movies.

1584
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:39,210
I'm a fucking immigrant kid.
I love movies.

1585
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:43,110
Remember when they have Tony Montana in 
the fucking detention thing and he goes,

1586
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:44,850
how'd you learn how to speak Spanish?
English?

1587
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,530
Because I watched a movie set Gleesa 
Bro.

1588
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,373
What Cubans?
Anybody Philippe's bars have told me 

1589
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:52,610
that learned from watching TV by 
everybody.

1590
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,453
So you watch TV.
The problem that happened somewhere 

1591
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:57,713
between 85,
maybe 87 today is the disconnect of the 

1592
01:21:03,451 --> 01:21:07,080
director and you asking me Joey,
what's the disconnected?

1593
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:09,600
The director,
the imagination.

1594
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:11,813
I just watched something on scarface.
I almost called you because it was so 

1595
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:18,930
interesting about the dilemmas they had 
scarface.

1596
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:24,350
When they gave it an x rating,
scarface came out.

1597
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,770
Pachino said that at the release,
at the party,

1598
01:21:27,771 --> 01:21:30,030
a scarface,
he just sank.

1599
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,300
People were getting up and leaving 20 at
a bunch.

1600
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,360
They took Joan Collins aside and they 
said,

1601
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:38,070
the gentleman's Collins,
what did you think of the movie?

1602
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:40,190
And she goes,
I left after I know.

1603
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:41,063
She goes,
I think $100 bucks is enough flux for a 

1604
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,960
person's lifetime.
Like they it.

1605
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:48,873
So.
But they showed that's enough of 

1606
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,070
persons,
not that I left,

1607
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:57,000
that they counted how many fucks he said
and all this stuff.

1608
01:21:57,001 --> 01:22:01,920
But that's not my point.
The point is that when they,

1609
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,533
uh,
the guy that directed that had to go in 

1610
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:09,651
front of a board,
it's a big difference about me showing a

1611
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,163
chainsaw going through your arm.
Then you seeing it and then seeing your 

1612
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:19,980
face and you bleed.
You follow me,

1613
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,260
the right.

1614
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:24,630
That's why they had to go to that.
That was better.

1615
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,610
That yes,
you know,

1616
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:28,280
they have the x rating,
you know,

1617
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,990
when it's a beautiful story,
this,

1618
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,850
it's supposed to be me,
you and him.

1619
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:37,020
And he's supposed to make the decision 
to direct abroad violence specialist,

1620
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,080
psychiatrist,
but thought he brought 100 witnesses.

1621
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:42,600
They were there all fucking day to prove
his point.

1622
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:45,930
That take it from an x rated movie to an
r rated movie.

1623
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:49,770
When you watch once upon a time and the 
West,

1624
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,760
Sergio Leone,
he was the king of the directors because

1625
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:58,470
he gave you the decision to decide,
are you with me?

1626
01:22:58,471 --> 01:23:01,810
He gave it to you when Charles Bronson 
gets off the train,

1627
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:06,830
the beginning of once upon a time in 
America and the street dudes waiting and

1628
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:08,194
the train goes by and all of a sudden it
stops and all of a sudden you hear a 

1629
01:23:11,141 --> 01:23:11,974
harmonica and he hit Charles Bronson 
going and they look up when they see 

1630
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,120
Charles Bronson,
but they're not.

1631
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:20,613
They're not.
Look,

1632
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,410
it's not focusing on Charles Bronson.
Sir.

1633
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,293
Got All these fucking with you.
He keeps showing you this fucking thing 

1634
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:32,440
that keeps going like,
take me back,

1635
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:35,080
Sir Joey only let me watch this 
gunfight.

1636
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,730
He gave you a imagination.
Directors gave you an imagination.

1637
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
They gave you a split second to decide 
whether what was going to happen.

1638
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,940
Now I know the story before it happens.
The director was something special.

1639
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,160
That's why Sergio Leone,
he goes,

1640
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:58,500
guys don't spaghetti westerns with 
genius because they gave you.

1641
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:02,620
Are you with me?
You gave me a second to split the side.

1642
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,600
Yeah.
You have to think about what's going on.

1643
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,920
I did that scene.
I could have put it in his arm or showed

1644
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:11,920
Pachino his face.
Will you remember high plains drifter?

1645
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,873
Tremendous.
Is that the one where he's a ghost and 

1646
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,370
it was back there and paints it?
No paint time.

1647
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:16,851
No,
no,

1648
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:17,130
no.

1649
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:19,200
It's Hypo.
Is that high plains drifter?

1650
01:24:19,201 --> 01:24:20,680
Am I getting the wrong name?
I mean I'm.

1651
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,250
I'm,
I'm thinking about when it comes back as

1652
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:24,660
it goes.
That's the one.

1653
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:25,830
Yeah,
high plains.

1654
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,320
Was it?
Hang 'em high?

1655
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:29,190
I don't know if it was hang them high.

1656
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:31,873
What's the one that we as the shield 
underneath and he knows the emily shoot 

1657
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,970
for the heart and they keep shooting at 
him and he falls down and they shoot him

1658
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,140
and he falls down and shoot to them.
They fall down.

1659
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,070
I don't remember.
Janie put Google.

1660
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:43,904
Clint Eastwood comes back as it is.
High Plains drifter just isn't in the 

1661
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,810
description.
Yeah,

1662
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:55,280
I'm parked ghost story part revenge West
thing about that movie is like you don't

1663
01:24:55,281 --> 01:24:56,114
realize.
It's like they don't spell it out for 

1664
01:24:59,151 --> 01:24:59,984
the dummies,
that he's a ghost six cents then now 

1665
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,980
like you have to figure it out at the 
end of the movie.

1666
01:25:06,981 --> 01:25:09,770
If I remember correctly.
It's been a long time since I saw it,

1667
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,840
but at the end of the,
the end of the film,

1668
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,430
they sort of lay it out in the 
beginning,

1669
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,690
the beginning,
they show,

1670
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,270
God,
I might be wrong here.

1671
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,583
I feel like at the beginning of the 
movie is them beating him and killing 

1672
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,124
him.
They whipped him at the end of the 

1673
01:25:23,691 --> 01:25:27,500
movie.
You kind of realize it's him coming back

1674
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:28,423
towards the end of the movie,
but it's not like specifically spelled 

1675
01:25:31,161 --> 01:25:35,930
out like it was a curse and he came back
to haunt this town and kill everyone.

1676
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,053
It wasn't that cornball.
So if you go back to like the older 

1677
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,640
movies,
you'd go back to like,

1678
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:43,923
you know,
like a Frankenstein or Dracula type 

1679
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,633
film.
They spelled things out like they 

1680
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:49,844
treated you like you were a dumb ass and
they spell things out and then they 

1681
01:25:52,701 --> 01:25:53,534
eventually stopped doing that and they 
put mystery and imagination and films 

1682
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,900
and then somewhere along the line,
at least with modern blockbusters.

1683
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:04,100
If

1684
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:04,933
I had to guess,
I would say part of the problem is 

1685
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,940
there's so much money involved in these 
movies.

1686
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:12,043
If you're going to make a film and you 
know it's some gigantic thing with 

1687
01:26:17,151 --> 01:26:21,920
special effects and the studio's dumping
hundreds of millions of dollars into it,

1688
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:25,360
they want a return on their money.
I saw people discussing that.

1689
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:27,740
I think Johnny Depp was just kind of 
kicked off,

1690
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:28,574
isn't the right word,
but he's not going to be in the next 

1691
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:30,074
pirates movie.
I guess discussing under like in the 

1692
01:26:32,511 --> 01:26:33,344
comments section like it was the word 
last one was the worst one that of the 

1693
01:26:36,201 --> 01:26:37,034
of the lot and they spent $330,000,000
on the budget but it made $800 million 

1694
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,060
and they're like,
that's a failure.

1695
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:44,660
Some people were saying like that's a 
failure.

1696
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,640
Yeah,
for them it's a failure of $100.

1697
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:48,290
Million is a good.
Well,

1698
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:50,450
Johnny's off the rails right now.

1699
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,790
He shaved his head,
Johnny Depp.

1700
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:55,730
He looks like he weighs 35 pounds.
He shaved his head.

1701
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,903
He's fallen out of his jeans.
Whenever you get like two tattoos of a 

1702
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:01,694
woman,
the only been married to for like six 

1703
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,240
months.
These are all bad signs.

1704
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:06,463
Joking.
This is a very rough town to live egos 

1705
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,083
and motherfucker.
People blowing smoke up your ass as a 

1706
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:13,574
motherfucker.
I mean this guy is spending a half a 

1707
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,430
million dollars a month on wind.
Yeah,

1708
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,710
know exactly.
Don't quote me on that,

1709
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:23,280
but I know that when,
when the accounts,

1710
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:28,460
I read the caption that said that he was
spending $30,000

1711
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,353
and he goes,
it was a lot more than he was joking 

1712
01:27:30,621 --> 01:27:32,030
around about it.
It was a lot more than that.

1713
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:37,270
Like these pictures of him now stay 
humble or be humbled.

1714
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,080
He's wearing a shirt.
Dude,

1715
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:41,990
you're 55 years old.
Why the fuck would you wear that shirt?

1716
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:43,490
Well,
who's walking on?

1717
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,060
Meanwhile I got a Derrick Lewis.
My ball was a shirt on,

1718
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,083
but look,
these fucking inspirational quotes you 

1719
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:55,550
expect to see on some strippers,
instagram page.

1720
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:57,830
You're not supposed to be wearing those 
when you're Johnny Depp.

1721
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:58,820
Okay,
this is.

1722
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,320
This is outrageous.
Johnny Depp.

1723
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,563
Why are you wearing that on a shirt?
And I heard that this last movie he did 

1724
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,020
Mucho.
Mucho programas,

1725
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,450
which a lot of a lot of problems.
What was the moving the Tupac,

1726
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,970
but it's on shelf.
Right?

1727
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,400
And not put it out.
Is he the shelf?

1728
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:17,263
Yeah,
they're not putting it out for right 

1729
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:19,694
now.
It's not coming out as he to the cop 

1730
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,460
that broke a if you will.
I forget them.

1731
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,540
That's a good book.
Yeah,

1732
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,140
but whatever.
I forgot.

1733
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:30,380
I have it at the house.
He plays the cop in there that there was

1734
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,400
a little and the word got out.
That's it.

1735
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,333
Well,
you know Johnny Depp at one point in 

1736
01:28:36,141 --> 01:28:39,200
time when he had done that.
That movie dead man.

1737
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,150
Do you remember?
Dead Man?

1738
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:41,270
No.
Interesting movie.

1739
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:42,104
It was a weird black and white movie 
about a guy who was riding a fucking 

1740
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,633
train across the west.
He was talking in an interview about he 

1741
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:52,370
wants to do interesting projects.
He goes,

1742
01:28:52,371 --> 01:28:54,620
I'll.
I'll never be blockbuster boy.

1743
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:56,860
But then he became blockbuster boy.
Oh,

1744
01:28:56,861 --> 01:28:58,920
but he's bad ass pirates of the 
Caribbean.

1745
01:28:58,940 --> 01:28:59,800
Look,
he's fine.

1746
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:02,460
Don't give a fuck what anybody.
Phenomenal.

1747
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,280
Phenomenal for them.
He's really good.

1748
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,160
Good.
I love.

1749
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:07,290
He's a great actor.
They cut him loose.

1750
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:11,130
He made a ton of money for them.
They did five fucking movies,

1751
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,110
but you know he's boys with him,

1752
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,540
Stan Hope,
right?

1753
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:19,290
Essentially Johnny d,
this fucking motherfuckers with her.

1754
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:22,260
Everybody thinks you're going to spend 
money on their website.

1755
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,030
Guess what?
We're not.

1756
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,290
We're not paying to read your fucking 
website.

1757
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:31,110
We're not Johnny Depp.
What does it say?

1758
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:33,870
And biggie Tupac movie abruptly pulled 
from release.

1759
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,130
Forrest Whitaker.
Granted it looks like.

1760
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,700
Hmm.
Yeah.

1761
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,040
Like a month before it supposed to come 
out.

1762
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,320
They just pulled it.
Well in my suck.

1763
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,760
They don't pull it if it's awesome,
but the point is,

1764
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,120
you know,
Stan helps boys with him and he's like,

1765
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,660
he said that once he did those pirates 
movies,

1766
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:53,400
he couldn't go anywhere.
It was over.

1767
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,890
He can't go to restaurants.
You can't go anywhere.

1768
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:57,180
You just can't go anywhere.
He,

1769
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:00,870
he hit that upper echelon of fame where 
it's almost,

1770
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:01,704
there's no turning back.
When you get like Michael Jackson type 

1771
01:30:04,831 --> 01:30:06,150
frame,
you just get crazy.

1772
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:07,080
You,
your,

1773
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,530
your world is just,
it's no one can relate to you.

1774
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:13,410
What will they give them?
A movie he was making like $30 million a

1775
01:30:13,411 --> 01:30:14,244
movie with back end of everything.
I bet he was making more than more than 

1776
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:18,080
that,
right?

1777
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:18,920
Yeah.
That's.

1778
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:24,000
He's got like 18 houses a boat.
He's got 14 houses.

1779
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,940
You know.
I remember when I was in Colorado,

1780
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:28,540
someone said he had a ranch out there.
I go,

1781
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:29,640
has he ever go there?
And he goes,

1782
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:30,750
no,
no,

1783
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:31,740
just as a ranch.

1784
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,970
What about what I house sat for the guy 
that don't Tgi Fridays.

1785
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,800
She was on the board directors.
Did you?

1786
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,100
Yeah,
when I lived on 40 4:35,

1787
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:43,920
far away road and snowmass village,
Colorado.

1788
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,200
I have sat and the guy,
the two years I was there,

1789
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:53,520
he came a week and a half.
He came for three days and his daughters

1790
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:56,610
came for three days.
They spent 2000 on booze.

1791
01:30:57,150 --> 01:31:01,730
They all got drunk and they left two 
days later and I was talking to the door

1792
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:02,521
and she's like,
yeah,

1793
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:06,380
this is.
My Dad's got houses all over the place.

1794
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,440
He had three in Colorado alone,
like crusty crested butte,

1795
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:12,053
snowmass village,
and he had a house on the other side to 

1796
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:18,210
ski over there because he liked to.
Different types of powders.

1797
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,520
Yeah.
Jesus Christ,

1798
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:25,840
that world,
when people get that famous,

1799
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:28,030
when they get that rich,
when they get that,

1800
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,080
the point where they live in some sort 
of weird la La land.

1801
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:36,490
He had a brand new jeep delivered every 
year

1802
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,593
and part of my agreement was I had a 
driver like 50 miles a month to keep 

1803
01:31:42,891 --> 01:31:43,724
make sure because when he came to town 
he didn't want no problems with none of 

1804
01:31:46,671 --> 01:31:47,504
his houses.
So we had a different fucking house 

1805
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:53,660
sitter at every.
And if the background check on,

1806
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:55,790
you know,
I listened to me,

1807
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:56,624
I fucking grandfathered in to the house 
because my buddy from had it and his 

1808
01:32:00,581 --> 01:32:04,420
girlfriend came up to visit and he 
knocked her up but the guy was difficult

1809
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:06,730
to get ahold of because he was in 
England and whatnot.

1810
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,073
So my friend just said to me,
just just move and don't say Dick when 

1811
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:12,214
he comes in,
he'll see it to you and tell him I had 

1812
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:16,030
to leave and shit.
Keep my deposit.

1813
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,200
So I stayed there for like two months 
and he came and he's like,

1814
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:21,160
who the fuck are you?

1815
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,833
And I told them what had happened and 
that we couldn't get ahold of him 

1816
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:28,030
because he was in England and he asked 
me for a couple of names.

1817
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:33,200
I had already lived in snowmass for 
about a year.

1818
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:34,893
I left and then came back.
So I had a couple of nights references 

1819
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:38,764
for me,
gave me the thing and then left and I 

1820
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:41,614
was not allowed in this home.
So part of the deal was I had an 

1821
01:32:45,011 --> 01:32:49,600
apartment over the garage,
I could use this car and it was 18 hours

1822
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:54,601
a month to be the shoveling snow or 18,
18 hours a month of work or.

1823
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,233
So it was essentially a shoveling snow 
in the winter and the along in the 

1824
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:02,584
summer he would give me little 
assignments like paint the wall or 

1825
01:33:05,381 --> 01:33:08,210
whatever.
I would do keep the trim up and ship.

1826
01:33:08,211 --> 01:33:09,044
It was zero rent.
I think he paid me $100 a month and I 

1827
01:33:13,361 --> 01:33:15,940
got to get a day job and ski and Shit 
like that.

1828
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:20,500
It was found to have man,
you're a volunteer fireman because.

1829
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,170
Alright.
So cocaine was $1,800

1830
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:24,880
an ounce at the time.
And snowmass,

1831
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,900
my buddy said,
give it to me for $800,

1832
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:27,903
Jersey.
So I would go back and forth and I was 

1833
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:34,110
making all this dough on and the people 
found that the guy that they blew up the

1834
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:36,820
pipe bomb in this guy's car and they 
blew him up.

1835
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:37,654
His name was Steven Gray Ball.
He left a big gap in this fucking drug 

1836
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:42,900
place.
So I was them.

1837
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,020
Oh yeah,
they killed.

1838
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:49,021
This boy passed in Colorado and Aspen 36
days before he was to stand trial.

1839
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,733
They could never get him for cocaine.
He was making $6 million every six 

1840
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:53,824
weeks.
I spoke about this a million every six 

1841
01:33:56,231 --> 01:34:01,231
weeks in 1984,
they arrested him the first time and 83,

1842
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:03,243
they brought him to Denver.
They found 9 million altogether cash 

1843
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:11,490
that in 84 was when he went.
Every night he'd worked out.

1844
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:14,770
It was a good looking dude that kept in 
shape.

1845
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:15,983
He had 20 different cars and every night
he gives her the guy at the door to 

1846
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:23,170
start the car.
That night the guy took the night off.

1847
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:26,670
He started his own car.
They put a pipe bomb in his car and blew

1848
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:28,300
them up.
He lived,

1849
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:33,330
he made it all the way to the hospital,
but something went so deep or possess it

1850
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:34,750
just bled to death.

1851
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:38,773
So left this gap.
So this guy approached him and then he 

1852
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:41,711
was like,
man,

1853
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:42,544
these people are mad at you.
They want to do business with cotton 

1854
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:49,630
amount.
So I had to talk to them and they said,

1855
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:50,500
listen,
for you to buy.

1856
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:51,403
We never do a face to face.
So they have an aspen club and have a 

1857
01:34:56,261 --> 01:34:58,010
place called the CEO of the Aspen Club

1858
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,210
is through,
you know,

1859
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,570
in those days these places were thousand
dollars a month to walk it.

1860
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,273
And I knew a girl that used to go to the
Aspen club and she used to telling me 

1861
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:08,340
she used to take showers right next to 
Barbie,

1862
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:12,410
Barbie Barbie.
Ben had a beautiful Bush.

1863
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,113
She would tell me every night,
bobby Benton's got a beautiful fucking 

1864
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:16,934
bullshits perfect.
So there's the Aspen Club in the 

1865
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:21,560
snowmass clubs.
No mass club as golfing,

1866
01:35:21,561 --> 01:35:23,090
you know,
condos around the thing.

1867
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:26,720
It was like $900 a month to be a member.
I couldn't have been a member.

1868
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:30,280
So the only way I could become a member 
with my being a volunteer fireman,

1869
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,100
then they'd give you admission.
And so for 90 days I had a train,

1870
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:35,910
you know,
go up two flights,

1871
01:35:35,911 --> 01:35:36,744
this thing I'll add a carry a rope,
but basically it was putting out when 

1872
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:43,580
tourists come,
they don't know how to fucking turn on a

1873
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:44,420
fireplace.

1874
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:45,883
So they clean out the showers and they 
put them in and then these people would 

1875
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:50,980
put them in a dumpster.
So 10,

1876
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,290
10 or you're doing this dumpster fire,
that's all you're doing,

1877
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,690
but you've got access to the snowmass 
club.

1878
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:02,240
So basically I was walking to this 
moment has club give the girl a $10,000,

1879
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:04,500
but I need gym clothes,
workout.

1880
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,360
By the time he got back to your locker 
was in the locker.

1881
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,760
It was all in.
They were all.

1882
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:13,280
And everybody's involved.
Everybody was involved.

1883
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:14,114
So the girl that worked there,
she was getting a piece of whoever knew 

1884
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,590
we had to do this or hi,
how you doing joe?

1885
01:36:18,591 --> 01:36:19,424
Yeah.
Okay.

1886
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,160
Wow.
And then later on I go into the locker,

1887
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,590
the coke would be that I get like a 
half,

1888
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,270
eight ounces,
you know,

1889
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:27,104
I was a dealer and I take it home.
But then I started getting choked up 

1890
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:35,970
every time there was a fire I went to 
like two dumpsters and this is 16 idiots

1891
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:38,300
with a fire hose.

1892
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,100
I'm like,
is this necessary?

1893
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,710
They even gave me like a little fire 
truck,

1894
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:43,544
like a little,
uh,

1895
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:48,480
Toyota truck with like a bell on it to 
go to the Fi's athlete.

1896
01:36:48,481 --> 01:36:53,210
That third fight stopped showing up for 
two months.

1897
01:36:53,211 --> 01:36:54,230
They could.
Where are you?

1898
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,910
Zero base?
Where are you?

1899
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,640
Listen,
I'm just going to go get my dick.

1900
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,320
You want me to go put out a fire with a 
dumpster?

1901
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:04,220
Go fuck these.
They came over and took the dumpster and

1902
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:06,540
then I went to work for this other Dude 
Dick.

1903
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:07,650
There was three,
six.

1904
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,820
The Guy I worked for,
Dick Self,

1905
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:14,270
the Kelly and Dick Boone was the mayor.
So I had a buddy that used to go,

1906
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:16,310
you're surrounded by dik dik,
dik,

1907
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:17,300
dik.
Dik.

1908
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:22,060
Kelly had one of those snow companies.
And they wanted me to go in there.

1909
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,680
I don't know what they called.
Joe Rogan so straightened me out.

1910
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:28,550
It's a high low that shovel snow.
What's a high,

1911
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:29,241
low,
high,

1912
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:34,241
low in their warehouse truck that pushes
snorer.

1913
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,990
So he was another poor best that made a 
mistake in hiring me that winter.

1914
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:41,150
And I had to be that four in the morning
for the morning.

1915
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:41,984
I'm on my second gram of blow.
He'd been in front of my house beep and 

1916
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:49,490
I'm gonna go fuck itself not working 
tonight.

1917
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,360
He came and took his truck.
I was on a roll up.

1918
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:56,350
Their role for food tastings.

1919
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:00,360
Plowed snow guys who had snow trucks 
when it would snow out,

1920
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:01,580
man,
that was the.

1921
01:38:01,581 --> 01:38:03,390
You aren't getting any sleep.
Uh,

1922
01:38:03,391 --> 01:38:05,770
there was a bunch of guys that I knew in
Colorado.

1923
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,230
Boston,
Boston.

1924
01:38:07,231 --> 01:38:07,741
Yeah.
That's,

1925
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:08,574
that's,
that's a business to business in the 

1926
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,020
wintertime.
We don't.

1927
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:14,400
As soon as your business,
those people start fucking getting happy

1928
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:17,190
and people would look out the window 
with their coffee and making sure you're

1929
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:22,191
out there with the truck up the driveway
pushing snow around my buddy Jimmy.

1930
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:26,460
He had a,
that was one of his side businesses.

1931
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:28,080
He was an electrician.
The side business.

1932
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:33,081
He had a hit a plow on his pickup truck.
It was just fucking plow people out.

1933
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:36,390
Do People's driveways.
You know,

1934
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:37,224
it's,
I was,

1935
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:39,390
I went home this year,
March 20th.

1936
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:40,224
I went home to Jersey.
I had to do a show one night or Nyack 

1937
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:44,490
and me.

1938
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:46,230
And Are you hooked up in the city?
We had a,

1939
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:49,200
but we walked around the city and the 
snow had just started the snow,

1940
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,073
you know,
and by the time I got up the next 

1941
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,770
morning,
it's no like a foot.

1942
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:56,700
I'd never seen anything like that.
Like when I was a kid in jersey,

1943
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:57,534
if it snowed,
that shit was the light that should 

1944
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,500
stay.
Stay.

1945
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,333
There is,
there was no school stacked up on the 

1946
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,350
sidewalk.
Snow Bro.

1947
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,830
My town by the fucking ounce of snow 
land.

1948
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:15,180
Not An inch really bad.
Fucking tremendous that night.

1949
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:20,181
The roads would clean the east coast.
I'll never forget how when I left Jersey

1950
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:23,670
and 83,
like if it snowed,

1951
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:26,280
like let's say if it snowed and I'd had 
to take the bus up here,

1952
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:30,000
I would just call you and say Joe,
which smeller you'd expect me to 11.

1953
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:32,003
And you know,
everything was late whenever it snowed 

1954
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:34,634
in Jersey.

1955
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:38,610
He is this big metropolitan area,
New York City and it snowed.

1956
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:41,000
The crippled the city.
They didn't know how to handle it.

1957
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:45,570
Loose papers wouldn't come.
People get pissed off the New York Post.

1958
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,040
And I remember moving to snowmass and 
getting a job at aspen electric and that

1959
01:39:51,691 --> 01:39:54,600
meant they had a gun on the bus and 
snowmass go to the bottom of the hill,

1960
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:59,601
transfer and shoot the bus to snowmass.
I did this and I remember the first time

1961
01:39:59,671 --> 01:40:03,600
we got woke up one day and you know in 
Colorado you wake up more than this.

1962
01:40:03,601 --> 01:40:05,070
12 inches.
It's just another day.

1963
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:09,570
Just another day.
And I remember the 1983,

1964
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,433
they couldn't fucking clean up New York,
but I'll never forget that morning 

1965
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:17,060
waking up and asked him like at 6:30
in snowmass and going,

1966
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:19,890
they're not going to expect me to about 
10.

1967
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,750
And I walked in there at 10 people like,
what the fuck have you met?

1968
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:26,070
And I'm like,
it snowed out.

1969
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:27,450
The buses are running late.
They go,

1970
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,870
everybody don't say came on a bus and 
they all got here on time.

1971
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,333
They'd fucking busted me.
Ride out like Colorado was that far 

1972
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:37,710
ahead of the game while they're just so 
used to it.

1973
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,633
It was so.
But like here I was living in this big 

1974
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:44,880
metropolitan city that four inches 
crippled,

1975
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,010
didn't Colorado,
they throw down salt,

1976
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:50,070
they throw down something.
Yes.

1977
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:52,800
They throw it out on something because 
then you wash your car in Colorado,

1978
01:40:52,801 --> 01:40:54,070
they push to

1979
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,890
do the underwater carrots to the 
prevention.

1980
01:40:56,891 --> 01:40:57,724
Because Russ Russ travels fast and 
Colorado in Boston to that salt 

1981
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,720
assaulted puts.
It'd be you'd buy old cars and uh,

1982
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,230
in the fenders,
you know,

1983
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:10,000
in the back of the fenders,
like at the corner,

1984
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,060
that's where the salt would pile up and 
you always have rust there.

1985
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,430
He'd always have like these big pockets 
of rust.

1986
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:18,670
The corner of Morocco.
Yeah.

1987
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,713
That's why California cars,
everybody was wanting to rust free 

1988
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:24,790
California car.
If you're buying a muscle car,

1989
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,510
like an older,
you know,

1990
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,980
hot rod,
you'd find a rust free California Kar,

1991
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,000
Woo,
California.

1992
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:33,100
I mean salt,
big thing with salt,

1993
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,590
destroy cars,
destroy that frame,

1994
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,750
destroy everything.
That's salt.

1995
01:41:37,751 --> 01:41:38,584
Get up in there,
just sit there and just rot away the 

1996
01:41:41,051 --> 01:41:44,260
metal guy to take the metal,
buffet that with edge it out.

1997
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:48,040
And then you would have to spray 
rustoleum on it and then you'd have.

1998
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:48,893
Because I would see the guys in Colorado
how they would fix the cars and they 

1999
01:41:50,991 --> 01:41:55,060
would take like a missing bumper colored
strategically welded in.

2000
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,270
And then you bumped that in.
You colored your buffed,

2001
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:02,210
you kept putting primer on it.
And that's how they got the rust.

2002
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:04,950
Died in Colorado,
got a bike.

2003
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,850
Jersey Bodywork,
man.

2004
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,090
Lot of east coast cars had a tremendous 
amount of body work.

2005
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:13,150
If you wanted a constant job fixing 
cars,

2006
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,110
bodywork was always good,
not just because accidents,

2007
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,953
but also just because of the rust work.
Now is the rest of the product of the 

2008
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:23,330
humidity.
Also on the east coast,

2009
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,503
Colorado wasn't that human.
See a little bit of rest from the 

2010
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,350
Colorado.
You getting it from the moisture,

2011
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,590
you getting it from Saul.
I'm sure if they salt the roads,

2012
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:34,530
but the east coast,
you definitely getting more.

2013
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,210
You know,
there's a variety of factors that caused

2014
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:42,211
cars to rust out older cars,
but if you can find an old rust free car

2015
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:45,400
now that is like,
that's what everybody wants.

2016
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,263
You know,
you find out 1968 Camaro that's rust 

2017
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:50,710
free.
Like whoa.

2018
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,020
You know,
it's beautiful thing about corvettes.

2019
01:42:53,021 --> 01:42:55,150
They didn't rust.
They are made out of fiberglass,

2020
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:56,343
so you get an old corvette.
Most of the bodies were pretty good if 

2021
01:42:58,511 --> 01:43:01,570
it wasn't cracked,
wasn't damaged because they didn't rust.

2022
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:04,103
I'm cutting myself.
I'm one of those fiberglass quote vetch 

2023
01:43:06,241 --> 01:43:07,074
one time my leg or something.
My ran past them because this is the 

2024
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:10,870
seventies,
right?

2025
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:16,090
The fiberglass,
my 65 corvette.

2026
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,140
That things fiberglass.

2027
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,103
Why did they fight boot glass to make 
make it lighter and because they could 

2028
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:27,160
make cooler shapes.
If you look at a 1965 corvette,

2029
01:43:27,161 --> 01:43:29,420
that shape is fantastic.
We look at it,

2030
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:30,723
pull up mine.
I think I have an idea how it looks 

2031
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:34,120
like.
It looks like a sportster.

2032
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

2033
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:39,430
That's the one that 65 to six.
Well the defenders have curves to them.

2034
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:40,264
Everything has curves.
It's like such a curvy car and if you 

2035
01:43:42,761 --> 01:43:43,594
had to do that all by banging out metal 
and there's mine look fucking humps in 

2036
01:43:47,981 --> 01:43:50,650
the curves and that thing.
Just offenders alone,

2037
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:54,050
like there's so much.
That's when I had my gross old wheels.

2038
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:59,730
I got rid of those stupid wheels,
but the,

2039
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,451
the,
the,

2040
01:44:00,451 --> 01:44:02,580
the shape of those things,
man.

2041
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:05,220
I mean,
I mean they could do that with metal,

2042
01:44:05,221 --> 01:44:07,410
but there are so many complicated curves
to.

2043
01:44:07,411 --> 01:44:10,190
It just occurred over the door to the 
fender.

2044
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,300
The back fender.

2045
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:14,460
Yeah.
You're a fan of the car.

2046
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:19,330
Is this car compare as a drive?
But that's not a,

2047
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,080
that's not a real.
I mean if you,

2048
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:24,600
if you drove a regular 19,
65 corvette,

2049
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:28,200
they're sloppy,
they're suspension sloppy.

2050
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:30,030
The brakes at dog show,
this one here,

2051
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,330
that thing is not regular with that 
things.

2052
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:37,320
What's called a resto mod.
So what that is is a 1965 corvette,

2053
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:42,650
but it has a 2007 corvette engine in it 
that supercharged.

2054
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,830
And then it has an entirely modern 
suspension.

2055
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:50,970
Everything is modern coilovers,
modern brakes,

2056
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,290
big ass corps vet breaks,
big fucking fat wide tires,

2057
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,163
sticky rubber on them.
That thing doesn't handle anything like 

2058
01:44:59,491 --> 01:45:02,220
an old car.
That thing handles like a new car.

2059
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,010
As much as you can get a car like that 
to handle like a new car.

2060
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,690
I'm wished you drive it.
I tried that.

2061
01:45:06,691 --> 01:45:09,060
Fuck her all the time.
I take to the store all the time.

2062
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:12,040
You ever seen me take that thing to 
store?

2063
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:14,290
You should go for a ride with me.
It's so fun.

2064
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:19,320
I'm thinking I'd fit more telephone,
made more people under 65

2065
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,753
things.
You know the youth fit and that totally 

2066
01:45:23,561 --> 01:45:26,340
soprano trying to get johnny's sex.
What's the,

2067
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:30,070
what's the Italian car line?
Lamborghini or Ferrari or Lamborghini?

2068
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,630
I don't remember.
Yeah.

2069
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:38,270
And he couldn't fit in their skinny 
italies yeah.

2070
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:41,560
But those,
uh,

2071
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:42,483
you know,
when you're making a car out of 

2072
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:44,030
fiberglass,
you know,

2073
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:44,864
it's pretty weird.
Just to go back to the lady that quit 

2074
01:45:47,531 --> 01:45:48,364
high school when she was 16,
she was one of the most wealthiest 

2075
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:52,420
people in the world.
Like they're Chinese lady,

2076
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:55,000
whatever her name was.
We pronounced it wrong.

2077
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:01,020
It's so weird how much stock we put it 
in high school.

2078
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:05,560
How much stock is really in high school 
right now?

2079
01:46:05,561 --> 01:46:09,310
You have children I don't know about 
high school.

2080
01:46:10,890 --> 01:46:11,723
Like,
I don't know.

2081
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:16,020
I don't know about high school still and
I don't know.

2082
01:46:16,021 --> 01:46:16,854
I,
I've met so many people have quit high 

2083
01:46:18,421 --> 01:46:20,730
school that have done better with their 
lives.

2084
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:24,750
I thought when I quit high school I was 
done.

2085
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:25,733
I was fucking done.
That was the one of the worst points in 

2086
01:46:27,871 --> 01:46:30,210
my life.
I remember I was going to get a tattoo.

2087
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:34,140
I wanted to get like an Ozzy Osborne has
ozzie on his fingers.

2088
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,820
I wasn't really a cocoa on both fingers.
Coo,

2089
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:41,480
CEO and I remember walking up there that
day and on,

2090
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:44,160
so wait a second,
I'm going to get nausea,

2091
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:47,550
cocoa tattooed on my fingers and I'm 
going to quit high school.

2092
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:51,660
Like what am I made meet my chances of 
really doing anything.

2093
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:56,040
Like I already quit high school and I'm 
going to put that Tucson on my fingers.

2094
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,630
I'm never to do anything on my life.

2095
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,730
And that's why chicken not from tattoos,
you know,

2096
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,360
because you're afraid you're going to be
a loser in 1982.

2097
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:06,000
A Tattoo was not a work of art.
That tattoo was,

2098
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:09,120
you went to jail,
you killed somebody,

2099
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:14,070
but he had that in 69.
He's had that in [inaudible].

2100
01:47:14,071 --> 01:47:17,400
Sixty nine.
He was cooler than fuck.

2101
01:47:17,401 --> 01:47:19,620
He was Ozzy Osborne and I always known 
Razi.

2102
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:22,380
I was born.
I was just some fucking drugs criminal,

2103
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,970
but I knew that if I quit high school 
and put ceo,

2104
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:31,770
Ceo I was doing for awhile,
like I'm both hands housing.

2105
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,790
This is a true story.
Pro Walking to the tattoo place.

2106
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:36,624
It was in cliffside park and how much 
weight they put on high school and like 

2107
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:45,120
I quit high school my junior year.
Was I good at it?

2108
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:46,590
Yes.
I was very good at it.

2109
01:47:46,650 --> 01:47:47,483
I was very good at school.
I just had to quit school because of 

2110
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,843
necessity.

2111
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:51,623
I had no parents,
you know how to quit fucking high 

2112
01:47:53,011 --> 01:47:53,910
school,
you know,

2113
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:55,513
it's so weird how many people over the 
years I've read and the only reason why 

2114
01:47:58,051 --> 01:47:59,490
I got my ged.
Let me tell you something.

2115
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:05,240
I refuse to get my ged because if I 
would've failed my ged I would've killed

2116
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:06,144
myself.
Like if you quit high school and then 

2117
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:10,260
failure ged you're really doing from 
life.

2118
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,960
I didn't even want to know about the ged
thing,

2119
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:14,153
but when I got arrested you got to have 
a ged because you got an extra point to 

2120
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:22,960
your sentence.
Thing like this is a variable that I had

2121
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,470
to.
You not going to prison for that long.

2122
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:29,790
So if you get arrested and you don't 
have a ged and you're not working at the

2123
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:30,624
time of your arrest,
this all counts towards your sentencing 

2124
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:33,834
guidelines.
So the only reason why that ged fucking 

2125
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:38,513
thing,
because I was petrified to taking the 

2126
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,630
Joe Rogan because once you fail your 
ged,

2127
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:43,770
they ain't no coming back.

2128
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:49,040
So I got a tattoo on my fingers.
I fucking quit high school and I fucking

2129
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:52,560
failed the first ged thing.
Like I would have died.

2130
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:56,610
Like I studied hard for my ged.
I bought the fucking thing.

2131
01:48:56,611 --> 01:48:58,290
I took a night class with a bunch of 
people,

2132
01:48:58,291 --> 01:49:00,660
didn't speak English.
I studied hard.

2133
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,583
I passed my ged with flying colors.
But it's so weird how they put such a 

2134
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:09,180
stress on it.
When I was growing up and I know tons of

2135
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:10,014
kids that sophomore year said my father 
owns a fucking mechanic garage or we 

2136
01:49:15,061 --> 01:49:15,894
have a fruit company or my father was in
the stock market and he's got me a job 

2137
01:49:19,461 --> 01:49:21,240
and I know these kids and they're doing 
fine.

2138
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,373
I just saw one in West Palm beach that 
he was one of the first guys to quit 

2139
01:49:25,141 --> 01:49:27,230
school when I was like worried about my 
good.

2140
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,120
How the fuck the quit school.
He's doing fine.

2141
01:49:30,150 --> 01:49:31,770
He's rich as fuck.
Well,

2142
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:32,693
quitting an education like getting 
quitting learning is what's really 

2143
01:49:38,481 --> 01:49:40,190
scary.
Quitting school.

2144
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:43,830
The problem with school is school,
standardized education,

2145
01:49:43,831 --> 01:49:44,664
right?
The education that they would like you 

2146
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:48,010
to get is you go through

2147
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,930
school,
get out of high school,

2148
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,793
you go to a good college,
you get a degree and then you go to 

2149
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:55,180
graduate school and then your real 
success,

2150
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:58,930
but there's a lot of people that did 
that that there was no job for them.

2151
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:03,580
They have graduate degrees and they're 
not doing well and it's just.

2152
01:50:03,581 --> 01:50:05,200
It's not a.
it's not a guarantee,

2153
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,450
and especially in this weird fucking 
economy.

2154
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:12,400
The problem with a guy like you or a 
problem with a guy like me is that we're

2155
01:50:12,401 --> 01:50:15,640
never going to have regular jobs.
It was never going to work.

2156
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,370
We're too fucked up for whatever reason,
for both.

2157
01:50:18,371 --> 01:50:21,780
Fucked up for different reasons.
I quit every fucking job,

2158
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:24,220
every job.
I've never had a job for days.

2159
01:50:24,221 --> 01:50:27,180
I was like,
label and make 50 bucks.

2160
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:30,910
I got to wash dishes.
I wash dishes for four months,

2161
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:35,940
but nobody recognized that you had the 
potential to be an entertainer.

2162
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:38,620
Nobody ever says like,
you could be an entertainer.

2163
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:40,100
You're funny,
entertaining guy.

2164
01:50:40,101 --> 01:50:43,120
Nobody ever brings that up as a viable 
job option.

2165
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:47,020
Meanwhile,
it's obviously a giant job option.

2166
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,400
All of our friends that are like you are
that are are comics,

2167
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,890
they're all,
we're all fuck ups in high school.

2168
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,260
They all barely made it through whatever
job they had.

2169
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:58,810
They hated every second of it and they 
all thought they were losers.

2170
01:50:59,050 --> 01:50:59,883
That's one thing we all have in common.
We were all worried that we were going 

2171
01:51:02,301 --> 01:51:03,960
to be a loser,
but none,

2172
01:51:04,030 --> 01:51:06,250
no one,
none of us had someone who said,

2173
01:51:06,251 --> 01:51:09,160
Hey Joey,
you're fucking funny man.

2174
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,890
You could be a comic.
Try being a comic.

2175
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:12,724
Go to an open mic night,
give it a shot and how much comics make 

2176
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:19,090
a weekend comic headline and a club and 
the meek and Mike made $1,500.

2177
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:20,170
You'd be like,
what?

2178
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,480
$1,500
for telling jokes.

2179
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:25,360
I can $1,500.
And you'd be like,

2180
01:51:25,361 --> 01:51:27,970
that is crazy.
And you talked about what regular people

2181
01:51:27,971 --> 01:51:30,100
were making,
busting their ass all week.

2182
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:33,850
You could just show up on a Friday,
do two shows on a Friday,

2183
01:51:33,851 --> 01:51:36,400
two shows on a Saturday,
one show on Sunday,

2184
01:51:36,401 --> 01:51:39,220
you'd make $1,500.
He'd get home.

2185
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:42,130
A lot of times it was cash.
He would be like,

2186
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,150
what?
How do I.

2187
01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:45,020
How do I do this job?
What are you going to start off with?

2188
01:51:45,021 --> 01:51:47,560
The bike night?
You got to become an apprentice.

2189
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:48,603
If so weird.
I could look you in the face and tell 

2190
01:51:50,411 --> 01:51:53,290
you something.
I knew my freshman year of high school.

2191
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,210
You Ready?
Yeah,

2192
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,550
I knew one thing for sure.
What?

2193
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,710
I did not want a day job.
No job.

2194
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:00,341
No,
no,

2195
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:01,380
no.
Yeah,

2196
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:05,950
I didn't say that I wanted the job,
but not a job in an office.

2197
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:06,803
No,
no.

2198
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:08,770
There was no day job.
I'm not a future.

2199
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,500
I was either going to be a bartender or 
a waiter.

2200
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:13,950
I was going to work in a warehouse like 
a,

2201
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:15,280
uh,
there was a company,

2202
01:52:15,281 --> 01:52:16,114
white rose and seacaucus was frozen 
warehouse where you just got lobster 

2203
01:52:19,421 --> 01:52:20,440
tails and shit.
You had a.

2204
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:21,490
well,
I bumbled up.

2205
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:22,683
They paid your 20 to one hour.
They gave you a thousand every 90 days 

2206
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:28,390
to buy clothing.
Like I was set to do that.

2207
01:52:28,391 --> 01:52:29,224
I had no problem working nine to six.
I knew one thing about my life that I 

2208
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:38,530
was not taking a day job because the 
people I grew up around,

2209
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:42,250
my mother did not avid day job.
My mother went,

2210
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:45,620
opened the bar.
I set the up,

2211
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,110
be

2212
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:50,570
a boom and by 10:30
she was in Harlem picking up this,

2213
01:52:50,571 --> 01:52:52,820
going to a met game,
eating Chinese food.

2214
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,890
She didn't go back.
There was 7:00

2215
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:56,270
at night.
Then she worked until three.

2216
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,673
I had no problem with working.
My first big job was bartending from 

2217
01:53:00,891 --> 01:53:05,890
five to one in Manhattan.
I just knew that my days were mine.

2218
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,973
I liked that I didn't.
I wanted to be opposite of everybody 

2219
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:11,750
else.
I wanted you to leave the fucking house.

2220
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:14,120
When I walked in,
I'm going to make my own eggs.

2221
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:15,680
I'm going to smoke a joint.
I'm gonna.

2222
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:19,020
Watch TV for an hour.
Sleep till to get uplift.

2223
01:53:19,090 --> 01:53:21,170
Way descendants.
That's what I want.

2224
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:24,740
I did not want a day job that I want the
opposite.

2225
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:27,470
Some people's personalities that they 
want to go somewhere with,

2226
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:30,290
someone tells them what to do.
They want to sit in a very safe,

2227
01:53:30,291 --> 01:53:32,630
structured environment and do boring 
shit.

2228
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,400
I didn't.
I was.

2229
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,390
There's a company in my town,
they may pa Anthony Impairment Torah.

2230
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,290
When I was a kid,
APA fed everybody.

2231
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:44,420
The deal was you went down in 1982,
let's say it was a 1750 an hour.

2232
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:48,980
So you shaped.
Did you ever shape.

2233
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:51,200
What's that mean?
Shape is you just go down there and they

2234
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:54,200
look at you like Marlin Brando on the 
waterfront.

2235
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:56,870
You stand there like a fucking moron and
they come up to you.

2236
01:53:56,871 --> 01:53:58,900
We need six people tonight.
You,

2237
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,773
you look pretty strong.
You and there's 30 people going to 

2238
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,410
shape,
shape up work.

2239
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:04,244
You got to go sign up at the hall.
So if you're a long shoreman all that 

2240
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:08,960
shit.
If you don't have work,

2241
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:09,794
you'd go do shape up work.
So you just go down there and wait for 

2242
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:15,260
your badge number to be called and then 
they give you a work.

2243
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:20,480
So I used to work at APA is a shape guy.
She got on Apa,

2244
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:23,570
right,
and the first night Joe Rogan picks me.

2245
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,810
He sees I'm a fucking meal,
a meal,

2246
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:31,070
like you ain't going to break me.
The shift started at seven and they went

2247
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:33,470
through a six,
but sometimes it's six,

2248
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:34,304
a load of fucking Volkswagen engine.
She came in and here you are with 

2249
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:41,240
another fucking gorilla picking up 
Volkswagen engines.

2250
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:42,463
So I used,
what I used to do was you couldn't work 

2251
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:47,510
more than six days a month or they had 
to put you in the unit.

2252
01:54:49,150 --> 01:54:52,940
So I would work apa,
a white truck route,

2253
01:54:52,941 --> 01:54:53,721
whatever.
That was.

2254
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:56,540
Three different companies that you could
shape for.

2255
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,520
So what you did was to get into the 
union was once I found that Joe was cool

2256
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:04,910
and Joe knew I worked at drew joe a 
yardstick.

2257
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,590
I agree a 100.

2258
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,423
So I had guarantee two days a week work,
which is still $18 an hour plus 

2259
01:55:12,351 --> 01:55:13,184
overtime.
So I did shapeup work and then if you 

2260
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:20,840
complete it like 12,
if they made a mistake and that gave you

2261
01:55:20,841 --> 01:55:21,674
12 days in a month,
now they had a high year full time and 

2262
01:55:24,441 --> 01:55:26,840
your life changed forever.
Apa,

2263
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,990
that guy in tour that owns it,
nobody owns now.

2264
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:31,860
The fucking fairy.
Hmm.

2265
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:33,770
Like the ferry that goes back to New 
Jersey,

2266
01:55:33,771 --> 01:55:35,600
back and forth from Jersey and New York 
City.

2267
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:38,090
That's imperatore.
He didn't stop growing,

2268
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:40,970
but when we were kids,
his facility,

2269
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:45,690
he took such care of his employees,
his gym.

2270
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:51,110
When the New York mets went from a long 
island to New Jersey,

2271
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,660
that's where they practiced the first 
year.

2272
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:59,220
That's how good in the seventies is.
Jim was like,

2273
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:01,740
have you loaded trucks?
You were allowed to use that gym.

2274
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:03,960
He already had shit that nobody had.

2275
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:08,280
He had fiberglass backboards.
He had water weights.

2276
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,870
He had shit that nobody had.
Like at that time I saw.

2277
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:15,840
But my point being that that was what I 
had in high school.

2278
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:16,763
I could do shape work and I could still 
make a living and eventually somebody 

2279
01:56:20,241 --> 01:56:23,550
was gonna hire me.
I was going to work like a fucking meal,

2280
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:29,040
but I'd still be making $1,500
a week when you're in 1980,

2281
01:56:29,041 --> 01:56:31,020
which,
which wasn't a lot of money back then,

2282
01:56:31,870 --> 01:56:32,703
which wasn't bad.
Those are the guys that buy the boats 

2283
01:56:34,141 --> 01:56:34,974
and they go to Atlantic city and they 
wear white shoes on the weekends more 

2284
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:39,354
than everybody else.
Because you've made great money down 

2285
01:56:41,191 --> 01:56:41,900
there.
Yeah,

2286
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,733
so you shape.
You could also do that as long shoreman 

2287
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:46,703
you go down to Newark and stay there and
then after 15 days if they get the 

2288
01:56:49,801 --> 01:56:52,770
union,
they'll charge you $500 for a book,

2289
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:55,870
which is means that you get $5,000
and unit,

2290
01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:59,190
but you got benefits the rest of your 
life insurance and a pension and.

2291
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:01,553
Yeah.
And you realize that you weren't going 

2292
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:04,080
to work in a cubicle.
I did not.

2293
01:57:04,081 --> 01:57:07,110
I knew that,
but I liked that might load and shit.

2294
01:57:07,111 --> 01:57:09,780
You don't know how many nights I walked 
home on route three with no money.

2295
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,900
I'm a days after loading a truck all 
night,

2296
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,520
walking home on route three because I 
didn't have enough money for the bus.

2297
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:22,290
I just had enough money for a breakfast 
and I would walk up and get breakfast at

2298
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:26,400
a diner and I go wherever I was sleeping
and fucking go to sleep.

2299
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:27,293
I didn't know anything.
Comedy didn't come into my radar to a 

2300
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:36,270
month before I went to prison,
a month before I got locked up,

2301
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,850
a month before I got arrested for the 
crime,

2302
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:39,743
nevermind prison.
There was a salesman they hired and I 

2303
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:46,020
just.
We did not get along.

2304
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,990
Me and him as Carson,
he had this,

2305
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:49,883
he was American Indian,
a piece of them was American Indian and 

2306
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:56,550
he even had that Charles Bronson look in
his eyes and one day me and him got into

2307
01:57:56,551 --> 01:57:57,750
a beef over a customer.

2308
01:57:58,350 --> 01:57:59,183
He said the customers would say is and 
it was mine and me and him banged up 

2309
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:04,620
face to face and they had to break us 
up,

2310
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:06,383
but about a week later I was on the 
point that means you're outside waiting 

2311
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:11,580
for a customer to try to get a customer 
on point.

2312
01:58:12,430 --> 01:58:13,860
And he came out and he goes,
man,

2313
01:58:13,861 --> 01:58:16,350
listen,
I don't know what happened between us.

2314
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:20,070
His name was Brent.
I'll never forget that man,

2315
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:24,540
if I was 25,
he was about 40 something 44,

2316
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:28,380
45 and I had to fucking,
you know,

2317
01:58:28,381 --> 01:58:29,214
I was doing drugs and I had the tough 
guy mentality and I rang and I would 

2318
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:34,344
never raise my hand to some of the old.
I don't know why I went after him that 

2319
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:37,583
day,
but he came up to me and put on his 

2320
01:58:39,331 --> 01:58:39,811
hand.
He goes,

2321
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:42,250
listen man,
I don't know nothing about nothing,

2322
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,203
but he goes,
you know what I was doing for the last 

2323
01:58:44,081 --> 01:58:44,920
20 years,
right?

2324
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:47,700
I'm not going to.
No Damn Bae.

2325
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,543
He was,
I was the entertainment coordinator for 

2326
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:53,830
Casino in Las Vegas.
And he goes,

2327
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,950
I don't know man.
You make me fucking laugh.

2328
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,570
And I was shaking his hand going,
thank you.

2329
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:02,140
Get the fuck away from me.
I make you laugh when you stupid.

2330
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,980
And he was telling me I had a career in 
comedy and I was listening to him.

2331
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:07,990
He said,
you should really give it a try.

2332
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:10,480
I'm like,
you're fucking crazy.

2333
01:59:10,481 --> 01:59:13,450
Standup comedy.
I like Freddy Prince.

2334
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:15,760
I like David Brandon.
I love Richard Pryor,

2335
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:19,180
but some fucking criminal.
I can't do this shit.

2336
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:20,523
Not a month.
And I got arrested and then when I came 

2337
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:27,580
out I didn't think about it and then 
when I fucking came out for reals,

2338
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:29,553
there was a guy that loosened a pismo 
beach now and he used to talk to me 

2339
01:59:36,731 --> 01:59:37,301
about it.
He goes,

2340
01:59:37,301 --> 01:59:39,610
you ever been to the standup comedy?
And I will come on though.

2341
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:43,900
Leave me the fuck alone.
I'm a drug addict in stand up comedy.

2342
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,770
I didn't know standup comedy was about 
work.

2343
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:51,020
I thought that Joe Rogan,
just call it the comedy store.

2344
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:54,060
Should have a camera in 10 minutes.
I'm gonna be down and you take an hour.

2345
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:56,760
I didn't know that you had to work 18 
months to get an hour.

2346
01:59:56,761 --> 01:59:57,594
Our material.

2347
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,840
Lucky what?
I thought.

2348
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:01,703
That's how fucking off I was.
I just thought that when I saw John 

2349
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:06,420
Leguizamo,
but he just went down it.

2350
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,530
He just went down into the.
Well,

2351
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:12,720
that's what I thought for all that time.
We're perceptions of it,

2352
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:13,913
but you know,
the thing about it is that it's a 

2353
02:00:15,811 --> 02:00:18,600
possibility and no one ever says that 
it's a possibility.

2354
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:20,970
It's not an easy possibility,
but it's an.

2355
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,430
It's an option.
But being a fucking physicians,

2356
02:00:23,431 --> 02:00:25,710
not an easy possibility either,
but he tells someone,

2357
02:00:25,711 --> 02:00:26,544
you want to be a doctor.
They don't look at you like you're 

2358
02:00:27,361 --> 02:00:29,490
crazy.
The amount of work,

2359
02:00:29,491 --> 02:00:30,324
it's probably pretty similar.
There's a lot of work involved in being 

2360
02:00:32,341 --> 02:00:33,174
a doctor,
but it's a path that's been taken by 

2361
02:00:36,031 --> 02:00:38,310
many people.
It's clearly established.

2362
02:00:38,311 --> 02:00:39,900
You go through school,
you go through medical school,

2363
02:00:39,901 --> 02:00:40,734
you go through your residency.
There's all these different steps that 

2364
02:00:42,331 --> 02:00:46,470
you have to take that everybody's really
aware of with the standup comedy career.

2365
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,200
No one who's other than the people that 
have done it.

2366
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:53,910
No one knows what it is.
You and I both know that in order to be,

2367
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,070
you know,
say I'm a physicist,

2368
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:58,440
you have to go through a certain amount 
of education.

2369
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:58,980
We,
we,

2370
02:00:58,980 --> 02:00:59,813
you know,
if you had.

2371
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,670
Oh Tim son,
he's really smart.

2372
02:01:02,671 --> 02:01:07,290
He wants to work for space x,
wants to build rocket ships.

2373
02:01:07,291 --> 02:01:07,830
Like,
oh,

2374
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,450
okay,
that's a possibility.

2375
02:01:09,451 --> 02:01:11,070
You can do that.
You're really smart.

2376
02:01:11,071 --> 02:01:12,750
You go to school,
you get a good education,

2377
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:15,120
you follow through you,
you eventually.

2378
02:01:15,121 --> 02:01:15,954
There's a path there with comedy,
like no one knows that path other than 

2379
02:01:18,421 --> 02:01:19,254
people like you were at people that have
actually done that path and make a 

2380
02:01:21,421 --> 02:01:23,220
living doing it.
We know it,

2381
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,870
but for everybody on the outside it's 
like,

2382
02:01:24,871 --> 02:01:25,704
what is that?
And sometimes you need someone to come 

2383
02:01:28,141 --> 02:01:31,500
along and tell you like the guy who you 
were working with.

2384
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:32,753
For me it was my friend Steve,
Dr Steve Graham for he was my friend 

2385
02:01:36,811 --> 02:01:37,700
when I was,
you know,

2386
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,940
he was telling me this when I was like 
19 and he's like,

2387
02:01:40,941 --> 02:01:43,430
you're really funny.
Like you should be a comedian.

2388
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:47,870
Funny to you have like other people are 
going to think I'm an asshole.

2389
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,030
That's all I was thinking is that I,
I just,

2390
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:54,440
I wasn't big on public speaking but got 
me into public speaking.

2391
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:57,140
Honestly.
What helped me was teaching,

2392
02:01:57,770 --> 02:01:58,603
when I was teaching martial arts,
I had to teach in front of all these 

2393
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:03,770
people.
I had never spoken in front of groups of

2394
02:02:03,771 --> 02:02:04,604
people,
but I was really good at the time at 

2395
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:10,050
teaching classes I had learned from,
you know,

2396
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:13,520
my instructor and there was a way to do 
it.

2397
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:16,010
I was very enthusiastic.
Obviously it was my life,

2398
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:16,844
so it was very intense about doing it 
and I got used to speaking publicly in 

2399
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:20,714
front of these large groups of people,
but it was because I was speaking about 

2400
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:23,474
something that I was good at and then I 
would teach at Boston University and 

2401
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:28,730
when I would go there and teach the 
classes,

2402
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:31,100
I'd start off the classes,
you know,

2403
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:34,580
and I basically said to them,
listen,

2404
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:37,010
you take this class,
try hard.

2405
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:39,110
You're going to get an a,
it's pass fail a.

2406
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:42,860
It actually counts for your GPA.
So this is an easy a,

2407
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,310
I don't want you to be fucking Bruce Lee
or Jackie Chan.

2408
02:02:46,311 --> 02:02:48,170
You don't have to do that.
I just want you to try.

2409
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:51,990
If you come here and try,
you get an a that's simple and so,

2410
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,993
you know,
became friends with a lot of the kids 

2411
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:56,780
because they were like my age.
Some of them were even older than me and

2412
02:02:56,781 --> 02:02:57,614
I was teaching them.
So that was how I got into public 

2413
02:02:59,601 --> 02:03:00,040
speaking.

2414
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,520
When was the first time to think before 
you even answer,

2415
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:05,830
besides standup comedy,
were you ever,

2416
02:03:05,831 --> 02:03:06,664
ever,
ever on the stage before that Improv 

2417
02:03:08,711 --> 02:03:12,190
troupe in grammar school,
a play in high school,

2418
02:03:12,191 --> 02:03:13,110
Playing Grammar School?

2419
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:14,760
Cool.
In College I took.

2420
02:03:14,761 --> 02:03:15,690
No,
I didn't do any.

2421
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:17,220
I don't,
I don't think I ever did anything.

2422
02:03:17,221 --> 02:03:18,840
Like maybe if I did,
I don't remember,

2423
02:03:18,841 --> 02:03:22,260
but I in college I took a course on 
public speaking.

2424
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:23,970
It was like some sort of,
um,

2425
02:03:25,170 --> 02:03:30,170
it was some sort of course where we 
would do like little play was terrible.

2426
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:31,223
The teacher was terrible.
She was just this short little lazy 

2427
02:03:34,561 --> 02:03:36,660
lady.
She was so lazy.

2428
02:03:36,661 --> 02:03:40,860
Like the way she would give classes was 
says it was continuing education program

2429
02:03:40,861 --> 02:03:42,750
at Umass.
She was just terrible.

2430
02:03:43,110 --> 02:03:43,943
And there was the people in the class 
where it was very loosely organized and 

2431
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:50,790
explain the lessons very well.
And uh,

2432
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,653
you know,
we had to put together some little play 

2433
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:57,860
I remember was me and this girl and this
guy we put together,

2434
02:03:58,201 --> 02:04:02,790
we made some little funny play.
We wrote it together.

2435
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,093
It was around the same age.
I was probably thinking about doing 

2436
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:08,520
standup.
I was probably 19 or 20 at the time.

2437
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:13,710
I never was.
I always shunned from all that stuff.

2438
02:04:13,711 --> 02:04:14,544
I was always embarrassed and my,
when I got thrown out of the Catholic 

2439
02:04:20,341 --> 02:04:21,960
school in the sixth grade,
I had this guy,

2440
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:22,794
Mr Lavato Fridays.
You had a choice to fucking go be part 

2441
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:30,930
of the ecology club or hang out in the 
class.

2442
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:34,500
I don't know what made me.
I was in love with Frankie Valli.

2443
02:04:35,290 --> 02:04:37,100
All right.
In my eyes adored.

2444
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:38,040
So he

2445
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:38,873
would make me every Friday go up to the 
front of the class and put my eyes 

2446
02:04:42,211 --> 02:04:43,680
adored John,
a record player.

2447
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:48,000
And I'd sing it like not lip sync it,
I'd really sing it because I really have

2448
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:49,080
a good voice.
Growing up,

2449
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:51,810
I was in a band as a singer.
You,

2450
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,610
you were in a band,
sixth grade.

2451
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,700
You've done that fucking rock and roll 
show.

2452
02:04:56,701 --> 02:04:59,170
What does that.
What does that just out of my more?

2453
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:00,480
Yeah,
it was formed as foot is.

2454
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,880
What does that show called?
God Damn God damn damn.

2455
02:05:02,881 --> 02:05:04,080
Comedy Jam.
Yeah.

2456
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:05,220
You've done that?
Yeah.

2457
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:08,070
What'd you say?
A killing in the name of love.

2458
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:11,550
That's right.
You did a recent anxiety ever.

2459
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:13,260
Did you?
Oh my God.

2460
02:05:13,261 --> 02:05:15,990
Singing and doing comedies.
Two different fucking worlds.

2461
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:18,510
Did you have to learn the song and 
practices?

2462
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:20,310
Yeah.
They wanted me to go to a rehearsal,

2463
02:05:20,311 --> 02:05:22,110
but I couldn't go to a rehearsal that 
day.

2464
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:24,090
She had no rehearsal,
no rehearsal.

2465
02:05:24,091 --> 02:05:26,160
I knew the song.
You know,

2466
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:27,770
and it's not.
Yes.

2467
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:37,400
This being held that this is that.
A couple of years ago,

2468
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:42,970
this is like a year and a half ago.
I love music.

2469
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:51,280
I love all this shit.
I just can't.

2470
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:06,490
Whatever

2471
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:08,500
happened to rage against the machine,
whether they doing these days,

2472
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:11,170
they all wanted different dirt.
They're there right now.

2473
02:06:11,171 --> 02:06:13,420
Today.
They're in that band would be real.

2474
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:14,913
Be Real.
Be Real is in the band with them public 

2475
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,280
enemy.
Why?

2476
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:22,250
They're all in the renegade super band.
Oh fuck.

2477
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:24,790
A tremendous super band.
What band is this?

2478
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:27,820
How do I not know about this?
Something of.

2479
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:28,773
Please don't come on.
Don't embarrass me and I can't pull it 

2480
02:06:30,701 --> 02:06:31,760
up.
Yeah.

2481
02:06:31,761 --> 02:06:35,770
Sons of rage or somethings of rage.
And it's Tom Morello.

2482
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:39,370
Uh,
the signal from public enemy be real.

2483
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:42,670
Chuck d,
Chuck D.

2484
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:44,140
Wow.
Flavor flavor in it?

2485
02:06:44,530 --> 02:06:46,950
I don't think so.
I think they'd tow flavor flavor.

2486
02:06:46,951 --> 02:06:49,180
You care.
Is he still married to his salons?

2487
02:06:49,210 --> 02:06:50,640
Ex Wife?
No.

2488
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:52,870
So long as x.
y just had a baby with soffits.

2489
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:55,510
Fits of rage is what?
Prophets who's in the band.

2490
02:06:55,930 --> 02:06:57,460
A couple of guys from rage.

2491
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,530
Public enemy and Cypress Hill?
Yes.

2492
02:06:59,531 --> 02:07:03,670
The loans ex wife had a baby.
She was 85 years old.

2493
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:09,190
How the fuck did she have a baby?
She had the last egg.

2494
02:07:09,191 --> 02:07:11,470
They found the last week there was 
tucked up in a quarter.

2495
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:14,500
The Fallopian tubes.
Listen man,

2496
02:07:14,501 --> 02:07:19,290
Mick Jagger's singing that 75 again with
the women have eggs a little longer now.

2497
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:21,280
I wonder if he's got to dig a little 
deeper.

2498
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:23,620
You've got to dig deep,
deep,

2499
02:07:23,621 --> 02:07:25,500
deep in that little monkey.
Oh,

2500
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:28,050
it's gotta be an A.
Janet Jackson had one of the 50.

2501
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2502
02:07:29,410 --> 02:07:30,243
I mean they're in there.
You just need a guy to give you a stab 

2503
02:07:32,971 --> 02:07:34,820
in the.
Generate everything at the same time,

2504
02:07:34,890 --> 02:07:36,250
be back a lot

2505
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:39,700
of loads.
Just keep those loads for weeks.

2506
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:41,830
No jerking off,
no nothing,

2507
02:07:41,831 --> 02:07:46,810
no wet dreams for weeks,
and then just release the hounds

2508
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:53,430
48 as a woman after 48.
From what I've read,

2509
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:56,460
46,
47,

2510
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:59,820
your chances of that child having autism
have very high.

2511
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:03,270
There's a lot of chances to have a lot 
of little things going wrong.

2512
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:04,400
Chances are with the male,

2513
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:05,333
well,
you know,

2514
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:08,640
really over 50 [inaudible] yeah,
with men.

2515
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:09,503
There's a bunch of factors,
but one of the factors is also the age 

2516
02:08:11,911 --> 02:08:12,744
of the father.
That's why you see more autistic kids 

2517
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:18,030
these days than before as people are 
putting off,

2518
02:08:18,330 --> 02:08:22,350
having children and having careers later
and there's complications.

2519
02:08:22,351 --> 02:08:24,840
It's one of the theories as to why this 
more autistic kids.

2520
02:08:25,290 --> 02:08:28,680
Another theory is that there's not more 
autistic kids would just.

2521
02:08:28,681 --> 02:08:29,514
We're just better at diagnosing what the
issue is with children than we used to 

2522
02:08:33,391 --> 02:08:35,880
be.
Before I say we very loosely,

2523
02:08:35,881 --> 02:08:39,390
obviously Bridgette Nielsen look at 
that,

2524
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:42,450
so she had her first kid.
This is her fifth.

2525
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:44,730
She had her first kid when she was young
and vibrant,

2526
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:47,970
and the fifth kid when she's basically a
monster,

2527
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,620
bless her.
God bless her.

2528
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:57,410
God fucking blephs and 55 healthy baby.
Good for her.

2529
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:58,050
I don't want to.
My.

2530
02:08:58,050 --> 02:09:00,180
My little girl was born.
I kept looking at her eyes.

2531
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,360
Her Age was 55.
Incredible.

2532
02:09:03,570 --> 02:09:05,180
I kept looking at my daughter's eyes.
She,

2533
02:09:05,210 --> 02:09:06,043
she was stoned because God knows tac was
in my rifle and I shut that load of 

2534
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:14,130
debt,
like shut that.

2535
02:09:14,131 --> 02:09:15,560
Stolen the load.
It's kind of

2536
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:16,121
funny,
man,

2537
02:09:16,121 --> 02:09:16,954
when you just think about the window of 
time that you have to get pregnant and 

2538
02:09:20,471 --> 02:09:23,560
impregnate someone.
Just so you know,

2539
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:26,770
you ever run into someone and you 
haven't seen them in like 10,

2540
02:09:26,771 --> 02:09:28,180
15 years and you see them,
you're like,

2541
02:09:28,181 --> 02:09:29,770
Whoa,
okay.

2542
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:31,750
Time.
Time is real.

2543
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:32,653
Just wears on people.
You don't think about it when you see 

2544
02:09:34,991 --> 02:09:36,250
people day in,
day out,

2545
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:38,740
I see you all the time.
You look the same to me,

2546
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:40,990
you know,
but if you don't see someone for 10,

2547
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:42,340
15 years like,
oh,

2548
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,081
oh,
with you,

2549
02:09:43,081 --> 02:09:43,914
look at a picture yourself in to a hotel
room and you go to a hotel room that 

2550
02:09:47,371 --> 02:09:48,900
mirrored on live liberate.
Yeah.

2551
02:09:48,901 --> 02:09:51,390
Officers of fucking bullshit.
All this stuff.

2552
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:55,170
Motherfucker hides curves and has and 
your nose.

2553
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:58,440
You go to vegas and you walked past the 
mirror and you're like,

2554
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:03,780
what the fuck happened?
That age is a month or you watch it.

2555
02:10:03,781 --> 02:10:05,880
I watch a tape of myself or something.
I'm like,

2556
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:07,320
wow man,
I'm getting old.

2557
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:08,573
But you'd be a monster.
Last week I fucking took a red eye to 

2558
02:10:11,941 --> 02:10:14,640
cleveland.
I get to Cleveland.

2559
02:10:14,641 --> 02:10:16,200
Who's,
who's the only direct flight?

2560
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:19,530
You know now that everything's fucking 
crazy to direct flights a day to clean.

2561
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:22,140
Everybody's got a flight potentially 19 
hours.

2562
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:23,513
So my job,
my or choices wouldn't leave at 11 in 

2563
02:10:25,381 --> 02:10:30,300
the morning and leave a day earlier 
which a happening or take a red eye that

2564
02:10:30,301 --> 02:10:34,130
night and I took the red eye and we at 
six in the morning,

2565
02:10:34,131 --> 02:10:34,964
which is three La time,
which I'm never a past fucking 1230 

2566
02:10:37,641 --> 02:10:38,474
anymore.

2567
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:42,260
And uh,
I took a thing for the whole town,

2568
02:10:42,261 --> 02:10:44,570
me and George Perez,
you know,

2569
02:10:44,571 --> 02:10:46,460
and for a couple of minutes I was a 
little like,

2570
02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:47,323
look at my fucking life.
I'm 55 and I'm fucking taking a red eye 

2571
02:10:50,861 --> 02:10:53,390
to do Cleveland.
And when I got into the hotel room,

2572
02:10:53,391 --> 02:10:55,430
I sat down and said my computer,
I'm like,

2573
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:57,210
I'll fuck.
I'm lucky in my.

2574
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:03,400
I'm still doing spots at the store.
I'm still going out and do on weekends.

2575
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:08,360
I never dreamt that this has 48 and I'm 
55.

2576
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:11,940
And the headline and having a great time
laughing my fucking balls off.

2577
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:13,033
We forget for a moment in time.
What happened was the car that didn't 

2578
02:11:15,981 --> 02:11:18,740
show,
and I didn't even get pissed off,

2579
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:20,960
I just said,
George,

2580
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:22,360
what's happened?
The car,

2581
02:11:22,860 --> 02:11:23,693
we walked 50 yards.
There was a cab and that was the end of 

2582
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:27,890
that.
You know what I'm saying?

2583
02:11:27,891 --> 02:11:29,000
I don't even know.
I told you that.

2584
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:29,530
I'm just saying,

2585
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:30,161
well,
you know,

2586
02:11:30,161 --> 02:11:32,080
it's perception.
I mean,

2587
02:11:32,410 --> 02:11:33,243
you know,
if you showed Brigitte Nielsen a photo 

2588
02:11:36,611 --> 02:11:37,444
of her today when she was 20 and said 
you're going to look like this and five 

2589
02:11:40,421 --> 02:11:43,270
minutes she'd probably freak out.
Probably be terrified,

2590
02:11:43,990 --> 02:11:45,550
but now that she's 55,
she's like,

2591
02:11:45,551 --> 02:11:47,020
yeah,
that's what I look like.

2592
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:49,480
We all,
we all become j Dot Howard,

2593
02:11:49,481 --> 02:11:50,141
Marshall,
Anna,

2594
02:11:50,141 --> 02:11:50,974
Nicole Smith's fucking husband.
We all were going to go this so much 

2595
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:56,890
time.
You don't stay beautiful forever.

2596
02:11:56,891 --> 02:12:00,670
This is going to be an amount of time 
where your body just stops working.

2597
02:12:00,671 --> 02:12:01,504
Right?
And your tissue starts to hang off your 

2598
02:12:03,671 --> 02:12:06,910
face and it's just.
It is what it is and it's perception.

2599
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:08,700
A lot of it is perception.
You broke it down

2600
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,220
for me.
What you owe Romero,

2601
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:11,690
your jeans.
Look,

2602
02:12:11,691 --> 02:12:13,280
he looked somebody like,
what's girl?

2603
02:12:13,281 --> 02:12:17,660
We'd discuss it thousand times.
She was married to Richard Gear with the

2604
02:12:17,661 --> 02:12:18,494
beauty mark.
You said you saw her somewhere and she 

2605
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:23,210
was still fucking beautiful.
What's her name?

2606
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:25,040
Who was married to Richard?
Good.

2607
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:29,540
Cindy Crawford was beautiful,
but the end of that song and said,

2608
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:32,120
you've got to be kidding me.
I ran into her six months ago.

2609
02:12:32,190 --> 02:12:35,890
There's two girls in my high school,
facebook.

2610
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:40,990
They have not aged a year and a poached 
by our kids and it's,

2611
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:41,853
it's,
it's also how you take care of yourself 

2612
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:45,830
to alcohol.
Yes.

2613
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,170
And whether or not you're happy to 
happiness.

2614
02:12:48,171 --> 02:12:50,650
The alcohol.
Tobacco,

2615
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,400
tobacco is tobacco.
Listen man,

2616
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,253
I was thinking about this.
I was so weird that once every two 

2617
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:59,780
years,
I don't know what Joe Rogan.

2618
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:04,610
I hate being this person sometimes.
I hate being this person.

2619
02:13:04,611 --> 02:13:05,444
I like to have something going wrong 
like I still have that bug is self 

2620
02:13:09,411 --> 02:13:11,900
sabotage.
Sabotage everyone.

2621
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:12,734
Once in awhile I go to the comedy store 
and I see everybody drinking and I see 

2622
02:13:16,761 --> 02:13:19,280
everybody doing everything else in here.
I am with a fucking water,

2623
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,123
like an asshole.
I don't smoke at night when I drive 

2624
02:13:22,401 --> 02:13:24,350
because I can't see at night.
You know what I'm saying?

2625
02:13:24,351 --> 02:13:26,570
So I can't smoke.
I can't get high.

2626
02:13:26,571 --> 02:13:28,320
Sometimes I go into the back and I get 
high,

2627
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,310
so every time I go a red band or give me
a fucking cigarette

2628
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:36,360
and I smoked five fucking cigarettes and
I'll smoke for a week.

2629
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:39,930
Do you know that Joe Rogan?
I'm a pack of cigarettes at 8:00

2630
02:13:39,931 --> 02:13:40,764
at night and smoked like a fiend and 
throw him out of the car on the way up 

2631
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:46,950
the hill.
You know how bad I feel the next day

2632
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:52,210
you could see how bad fucking cigarettes
are for you.

2633
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:54,620
And number two is alcohol.
You know,

2634
02:13:54,621 --> 02:13:55,620
you could sell.
When you say this,

2635
02:13:55,621 --> 02:13:57,110
like how many cigarettes would you 
smoke?

2636
02:13:57,590 --> 02:14:00,620
Like in one night?
12.

2637
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:03,590
Really all through all the other eight 
away in the garbage.

2638
02:14:03,650 --> 02:14:05,480
Wow.
And then the other day,

2639
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,270
that's a lot.
That's a lot because I'm a savage.

2640
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,700
One was.
When was the last time you did this?

2641
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:12,620
About two months ago.
Really?

2642
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:14,240
Yeah.
And you don't worry.

2643
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,310
I didn't do it.
No,

2644
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:16,761
no,
no,

2645
02:14:16,761 --> 02:14:17,520
no.
I could.

2646
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,350
All that shit is bullshit than me.
Why do you think I said that shit to you

2647
02:14:21,351 --> 02:14:23,420
last week about the Ambien?
I wasn't fucking around.

2648
02:14:23,421 --> 02:14:25,910
Where you're trying to be cute.
I do everything.

2649
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:27,670
I'm sober,
but I do everything.

2650
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:31,100
I'm sober right now,
but I do everything.

2651
02:14:31,101 --> 02:14:32,660
I don't do coke,
I don't do heroin,

2652
02:14:32,661 --> 02:14:33,494
I don't do oxycontins,
but on the road people give a shit and 

2653
02:14:36,351 --> 02:14:37,580
sometimes I put it in my pocket.

2654
02:14:37,990 --> 02:14:40,140
People give people give me shit all the 
time.

2655
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:42,350
Take the chip.
People give you all the time.

2656
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:45,110
I just took some acid.
Fucking.

2657
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:49,640
Somebody gave me blather.
Addison and I put it in the invite.

2658
02:14:49,641 --> 02:14:52,390
I put it in a battery thing.
I have like a shaver,

2659
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,980
like took the bladder acid and put it in
the battery thing.

2660
02:14:55,460 --> 02:14:57,830
So it became like battery acid.
They call Lee.

2661
02:14:58,330 --> 02:15:02,420
Like totally it was Wolfman.
Jack said he didn't know him as Jack was

2662
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:04,430
rough man.
Jack.

2663
02:15:04,490 --> 02:15:06,590
There's a guy.
Remember that guy?

2664
02:15:06,650 --> 02:15:07,670
That motherfucker.
What?

2665
02:15:07,671 --> 02:15:08,504
Other than episode?
He was on an episode of the hunting of 

2666
02:15:10,821 --> 02:15:11,654
the odd couple one time and Felix wanted
some music published and it was 

2667
02:15:16,281 --> 02:15:18,620
horrible.
So I asked who was her friend?

2668
02:15:18,621 --> 02:15:20,270
The wolfman Jackson.
He goes up,

2669
02:15:20,271 --> 02:15:21,980
man,
let me give it the Wolfman Jack.

2670
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,950
Maybe you don't like it.
And they're both outside the studio,

2671
02:15:24,951 --> 02:15:26,700
wave Wolfman,
Jack and Wolfman.

2672
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:30,290
Jack comes out with two freaks.
It's got a weird look on his face.

2673
02:15:30,291 --> 02:15:30,951
He's like,
man,

2674
02:15:30,951 --> 02:15:33,590
I dig noises,
a dig.

2675
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:38,030
But he goes,
I haven't been this depressed and alone.

2676
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:43,310
He goes,
this is just bad now if you don't mind.

2677
02:15:43,610 --> 02:15:45,650
He goes,
I got to come down on this battery as.

2678
02:15:45,651 --> 02:15:46,484
And I was drinking last night.
So I've never forgotten that line as a 

2679
02:15:49,131 --> 02:15:51,830
kid.
That Wolfman Jack Lew.

2680
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:56,210
Is he still alive?
I know there's a lot of videos.

2681
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:59,590
I didn't see his CV still alive.
He died in 1995.

2682
02:15:59,810 --> 02:16:01,730
Wow.
That's a long time ago.

2683
02:16:03,130 --> 02:16:04,870
Oh yeah.
It was born in 38.

2684
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:05,793
Jesus Christ.
Play that black and white video on the 

2685
02:16:07,511 --> 02:16:09,410
lower right hand corner.
Yeah.

2686
02:16:10,030 --> 02:16:13,270
Let me hear that.
Give me some volume.

2687
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:16,180
Wolf,
man.

2688
02:16:16,181 --> 02:16:17,490
Jack,
just going to get us kicked off.

2689
02:16:17,510 --> 02:16:18,343
Youtube

2690
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:20,243
volt.
Matt Jacket.

2691
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:26,650
Check from August 1979.
60 six w

2692
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:31,600
by NBC New York.
First air check.

2693
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,213
First night.

2694
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:37,510
No.

2695
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,630
Wow.
How weird.

2696
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:47,310
Give me a little.
Screw that up.

2697
02:16:47,311 --> 02:16:52,311
A little bit.
Theatrical back then before the guy.

2698
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:06,210
Even several minutes into the recording,
what the fuck?

2699
02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:18,810
No together

2700
02:17:25,610 --> 02:17:29,630
maybe got better as it went along.
It was a different world back then.

2701
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,760
All you have to do is have a big 
personality,

2702
02:17:31,761 --> 02:17:36,110
be loud and crazy and people got used to
listen to a certain person on the radio.

2703
02:17:36,470 --> 02:17:38,690
Radio personalities were different thing
men.

2704
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:39,553
It's like you would become accustomed to
listening to someone's voice and that 

2705
02:17:44,241 --> 02:17:47,030
was the person who wanted to hear.
I remember a certain Radio Djs,

2706
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:52,720
Charles Laquidara on the big mattress in
wbcn in Boston.

2707
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:54,970
Listened to it every morning.
Let's do.

2708
02:17:54,980 --> 02:17:55,813
When I was delivering newspapers,
he was the morning guy and like every 

2709
02:17:58,881 --> 02:18:02,450
place would have a morning guy and this 
is still a few of them out there.

2710
02:18:02,451 --> 02:18:04,100
There's still a few morning guys out 
there,

2711
02:18:04,101 --> 02:18:06,530
but man,
they're cutting those guys back there,

2712
02:18:06,531 --> 02:18:09,440
cutting those folks back there.
Widdling away their budget,

2713
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:11,520
taken away their money.
You know,

2714
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:14,870
they have to do personal appearance at 
wild wings and shit like that.

2715
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:18,590
Fucking shoot tee shirts out of a cannon
and all that nonsense.

2716
02:18:19,250 --> 02:18:22,010
It's a dying,
dying institution.

2717
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:26,630
The radio world is a dying world.
It's weird.

2718
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,560
Used to be everybody had a car radio.
You listen to the radio,

2719
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:32,630
drove around.
What do we got on the radio?

2720
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,040
Oh,
let's tune in.

2721
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:36,710
What's the good local stations?
You'd find them?

2722
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:39,980
Listen to some good radio such.
It's gone now,

2723
02:18:39,981 --> 02:18:41,030
man.
It's gone.

2724
02:18:41,150 --> 02:18:42,830
It's gone.
It's crazy.

2725
02:18:42,831 --> 02:18:43,664
It's gone.

2726
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:47,360
I was never like a talk radio guy.
I can't lie to you talk.

2727
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:50,650
People listen,
talk sports and people call it.

2728
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:52,060
Fuck you.
They love it.

2729
02:18:52,150 --> 02:18:54,040
The Yankees should've beat one last 
night.

2730
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:56,740
It was a rough job.
That shit drives me fucking crazy.

2731
02:18:57,060 --> 02:19:00,190
But by the way,
congratulations on the Boston red sox.

2732
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:03,850
They will fuck the tough.
Tough.

2733
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:06,580
I don't watch baseball throughout the.
I don't have time,

2734
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,863
but the Cuban once September comes.
I love the art form Joe Rowe and it's a 

2735
02:19:11,831 --> 02:19:13,450
beautiful,
by the way.

2736
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,313
Not only that,
I got left back and I got to read the 

2737
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:16,443
album only.
I'm the only Cuban like and play 

2738
02:19:17,861 --> 02:19:21,610
baseball.
I'm possibly the only Cuban that was the

2739
02:19:21,611 --> 02:19:23,380
worst baseball player in the fucking 
world.

2740
02:19:23,381 --> 02:19:26,650
Even my mother's have gone to the game.
I can't.

2741
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:30,140
I embarrass the shit out of me.
I was terrible,

2742
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:34,160
but during the playoffs I watched that 
shit religiously.

2743
02:19:34,850 --> 02:19:38,230
I talked to my uncle and he fills me in.
My uncle's tremendous.

2744
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:42,110
My uncle fucking knows he's eight.
He's been watching,

2745
02:19:42,111 --> 02:19:42,944
but he knows so I'd get on the phone 
with him during the playoffs and he'll 

2746
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:49,100
be watching and I've talked to him and 
he said,

2747
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:49,934
he said he's ratting me off in Spanish.
Look at the way he throws the ball and 

2748
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:55,770
look at his finger how it's whole.
I mean it just.

2749
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:59,250
It's a different art and Boston was just
too tough.

2750
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:00,290
This year.
Joe Rogen,

2751
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:03,510
they had thieves,
baseball player with the years.

2752
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,353
It's tough to play against.
That's why me and your old partner at 

2753
02:20:07,791 --> 02:20:11,990
the UFC with tight Goldberg,
we're both Cincinnati red fans.

2754
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:16,610
What do you mean by theme?
People still basis people still basis.

2755
02:20:16,611 --> 02:20:20,210
I love these because they don't let the 
pitcher get into a rhythm.

2756
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:21,903
They get into the pitcher's head and 
they start dwindling their arms and now 

2757
02:20:24,771 --> 02:20:25,604
the pitch has got to keep looking at the
show and if you ever get a chance to 

2758
02:20:28,221 --> 02:20:31,010
watch an old,
sincerely red bull park,

2759
02:20:31,310 --> 02:20:32,720
a good game,
if I find one,

2760
02:20:32,721 --> 02:20:35,620
I'll send it to you and you watch what 
that the pit.

2761
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:38,570
You're not wanting to read.
The coach comes out and get,

2762
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,553
takes the ball from the guy and the guy 
walks off and they call a reliever with 

2763
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:44,093
Cincinnati reds.
The coach would come on the pitch would 

2764
02:20:46,671 --> 02:20:48,500
go,
take this fucking boy.

2765
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:52,610
I don't want to pitch again because 
Cincinnati was the king of bunting.

2766
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:53,763
Get on first and then playing with your 
head start and they would steal second 

2767
02:20:57,710 --> 02:21:00,380
and they would hit a single.
The Cincinnati reds one.

2768
02:21:00,381 --> 02:21:03,590
Those all those years where Pete rose,
Pete rose was in the home run hitter.

2769
02:21:03,890 --> 02:21:08,000
Pete rose was headed.
That means every time he came up to bat,

2770
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:08,933
you're going to have a problem and him 
and concepcion and Morgan and all those 

2771
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:15,800
people,
they were just single hitters.

2772
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:18,110
Those are the worst.
At least a home run.

2773
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:19,243
I know where I stand,
but these motherfuckers that club you 

2774
02:21:21,531 --> 02:21:22,364
with singles and doubles,
that's a different game and then I'm 

2775
02:21:24,711 --> 02:21:25,544
stealing from you to really get down 
like I'm stealing second and stealing 

2776
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:30,620
third that that's,
that's uh,

2777
02:21:30,650 --> 02:21:32,420
that sparky Anderson,
that movie.

2778
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:34,910
I know you've never watched it,
but that's what it was about.

2779
02:21:34,911 --> 02:21:37,820
The movie with Brad Pitt,
he did about baseball.

2780
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:44,080
That's a great movie because he explains
to you that it's on base percentage.

2781
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:47,630
All that other shit is bullshit.
They're like,

2782
02:21:47,631 --> 02:21:49,010
yeah,
but this guy walks a lot,

2783
02:21:49,060 --> 02:21:52,400
but they get on base.
That's what it's all about.

2784
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:55,460
And that's the center and Boston play 
that same game.

2785
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:57,440
The thieves,
they steal.

2786
02:21:57,620 --> 02:21:58,453
It was heart attack baseball.
You couldn't watch it if you bet the 

2787
02:22:01,671 --> 02:22:04,660
last five games got blusher brush and 
try to attack.

2788
02:22:04,970 --> 02:22:07,100
I got back to my room and cleaned the 
tutoring in the morning.

2789
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:09,680
They were still planning to die in the 
morning.

2790
02:22:09,681 --> 02:22:11,540
I went to bed.
The dodger game was still on.

2791
02:22:12,770 --> 02:22:16,010
Its tremendous.
This is the time of the year that I love

2792
02:22:16,011 --> 02:22:18,050
playing baseball.
When it starts in April,

2793
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,131
I don't want,
I don't know,

2794
02:22:19,131 --> 02:22:20,900
nothing.
I don't watch none of that shit.

2795
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:26,010
None of that shit.
I played baseball

2796
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,420
when I was a kid.
Tara.

2797
02:22:27,450 --> 02:22:30,150
I stopped doing it.
When I got into martial arts,

2798
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:33,300
I found out about taekwondo because it 
was waiting for a red sox game,

2799
02:22:33,301 --> 02:22:36,720
waiting for the tea to get home and 
there was a big ass line to get to the t

2800
02:22:36,730 --> 02:22:41,730
because the fenway park would let out 
and walking back from fenway park to the

2801
02:22:41,941 --> 02:22:44,910
train station.
I saw the taekwondo school and I went up

2802
02:22:44,911 --> 02:22:45,744
there and there's this guy named John 
Leaves a national heavyweight champion 

2803
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:48,953
light heavyweight champion at the time 
and he was about to go to the World Cup 

2804
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:53,483
and he was up there kicking the shit out
of the heavy bag and I'd never seen 

2805
02:22:56,011 --> 02:22:59,280
anything like it in my life.
I would here in the sounds of it,

2806
02:22:59,281 --> 02:23:02,250
I was walking up the stairs at hearing 
lump Chink,

2807
02:23:03,470 --> 02:23:08,130
Chink in the womp was him kicking the 
bank and the bank was the chain.

2808
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:12,090
As the bag would go flying through the 
air and slammed against the chain.

2809
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:14,640
I was like,
that is the craziest fucking sound,

2810
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,710
and I walked in and there was this guy 
who was just at the peak of his physical

2811
02:23:19,711 --> 02:23:20,544
power.
He was just at his very best and he was 

2812
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:27,500
training for a world tournament and just
watching him do that was so terrifying.

2813
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:30,360
Thinking like if someone kicked me like 
that,

2814
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:31,373
like what it would do to my body and 
that's how I got into martial arts 

2815
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:37,140
because before I wasn't in the team 
sports man.

2816
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:40,290
That's one of the reasons why I got into
wrestling and Lisa wrestling,

2817
02:23:40,291 --> 02:23:43,350
it's me against that guy.
I hated team sports.

2818
02:23:43,351 --> 02:23:44,184
I hated the fact that we were losers 
because a little billy dropped the ball 

2819
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:49,290
like I didn't and I didn't play for the 
team either.

2820
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:51,750
Like they would tell her heart Rogan,
go try to get a single.

2821
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:52,151
I'd be like,
yeah,

2822
02:23:52,151 --> 02:23:52,770
yeah,
yeah,

2823
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:54,180
yeah.
Get the fuck out of here.

2824
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:55,383
I swung.
I either got a home run or I struck out 

2825
02:23:58,440 --> 02:23:59,273
every fucking time I was at bat.
I either could cause I got a home run 

2826
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:04,650
once and I was like,
oh,

2827
02:24:04,651 --> 02:24:06,840
that is so much better than getting a 
single.

2828
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,170
You could suck Dick for the rest of your
life or singles.

2829
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:11,920
I don't give a fuck about a single.
Didn't.

2830
02:24:11,930 --> 02:24:16,050
I felt bad if I go on base and I got a 
single because I connected once,

2831
02:24:16,290 --> 02:24:19,680
cock Kirouac and that ball and I can hit
pretty hard.

2832
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,783
Not Bald,
wet fucking full lion and it went into 

2833
02:24:23,641 --> 02:24:25,800
the stands and I was like,
oh,

2834
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:26,693
this is what it's about.
It's about doing that is the only thing 

2835
02:24:29,631 --> 02:24:32,760
that's any good about the stupid fucking
that and catching balls.

2836
02:24:32,761 --> 02:24:34,380
So many cracks went out there and catch 
it.

2837
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:35,214
That's pretty fun.

2838
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:39,390
I couldn't hit a ball like I a ball my 
life.

2839
02:24:39,391 --> 02:24:43,050
I used to bug the strike out.
I'll make like,

2840
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:47,220
I was just terrible at baseball.
I just had no nothing for I.

2841
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,860
When I went to Miami I used to go to the
red berries,

2842
02:24:49,861 --> 02:24:52,860
baseball camp in the summers just for a 
week.

2843
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:56,490
It was a week camp that you went that it
like basketball was my shit.

2844
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:59,130
Basketball,
real good,

2845
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:01,530
real fucking good.
Really real good.

2846
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:06,531
With the five star basketball camp with 
a RV Garfinkel anymore.

2847
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:08,343
You ever fuck around?
My shoulders are so bad that my 

2848
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:15,570
shoulders.
I can't do a jumbo Jujitsu.

2849
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:16,950
Yeah,
but I can't.

2850
02:25:16,951 --> 02:25:19,570
You can't get me an Americana like you 
can't.

2851
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:24,680
I tell people on American economy you 
would come more on me to that bad yet to

2852
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:28,810
go physical therapy.
Do you ever get an Mri?

2853
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:30,480
I should,
but by the,

2854
02:25:30,481 --> 02:25:31,420
you know,
I listen,

2855
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:34,900
you got to pick your battles and today's
insurance world.

2856
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:40,330
So they're to the point where I could 
lift to go to kickboxing.

2857
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:40,920
You know,
I got.

2858
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:43,000
Hold the microphone.
I'm fucking right.

2859
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:45,040
I'm fine for right now.
My left.

2860
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:45,874
My right knee is fucked up.
That's going to have to do something 

2861
02:25:48,821 --> 02:25:50,110
soon,
but for right now,

2862
02:25:50,111 --> 02:25:52,720
what's wrong with it?
It never fixed.

2863
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:54,940
I think the one I was doing physical 
therapy,

2864
02:25:54,941 --> 02:25:56,530
I read,
heard it after the surgery.

2865
02:25:57,100 --> 02:26:00,920
It never kind of surgeries.
You get municipal thrive,

2866
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:01,900
this,
that whole thing.

2867
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,170
So I'll go back in there again and let 
it all cleaned up.

2868
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,033
Now I love basketball,
but I also loved martial arts growing 

2869
02:26:08,711 --> 02:26:09,544
up.
I loved the whole thing of going to 

2870
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:12,153
forums and practicing and they can do 
some fucking tremendous shit with stem 

2871
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:16,180
cells right now.
Joey,

2872
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:21,220
they could fix all your problems.
I bet you didn't show this and yeah,

2873
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:22,150
my shoulders fixed.

2874
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:24,870
They fixed it.
How flexible are you?

2875
02:26:24,910 --> 02:26:28,240
Let me see you grab your hand and do 
that shit.

2876
02:26:28,241 --> 02:26:30,190
We go all the way back and we do all 
that.

2877
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:34,030
I can do everything.
Grab them.

2878
02:26:34,031 --> 02:26:38,230
Go and you do that shit like there's 
people could grab them,

2879
02:26:38,231 --> 02:26:40,770
but my kickboxing place and go all the 
oil.

2880
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:43,120
They could rally all the way over.
What do you mean?

2881
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:43,954
Yeah,
like they do something fucking 

2882
02:26:45,220 --> 02:26:46,053
different.
Like you're saying like do this and go 

2883
02:26:48,671 --> 02:26:49,720
all the way you.
Oh No,

2884
02:26:49,721 --> 02:26:50,100
no,
no.

2885
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:53,380
I know what to do.
They take the broom and they go that way

2886
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:54,970
all the way back.
I'm done.

2887
02:26:55,030 --> 02:26:57,370
I'm done.
You know what else is real good for you?

2888
02:26:57,650 --> 02:27:00,210
Hanging just hanging.
Just grab a hold of the bar,

2889
02:27:00,250 --> 02:27:02,890
Chin up bar and just hang from it.
Super good for your shoulder.

2890
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:05,910
Stretches them out.
Releases impingements too.

2891
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:09,220
Good for the joint.
Just go out there and my little gym area

2892
02:27:09,221 --> 02:27:10,054
out here.
Just stretch out the president's award 

2893
02:27:13,121 --> 02:27:17,590
either because I couldn't do a pull up.
You don't have to do a pull up.

2894
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:21,790
Pull up to greg still to this day.
Can't do one.

2895
02:27:22,690 --> 02:27:24,790
No,
never do a pull up.

2896
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:29,320
Even when I was one 80 lifting weights.
Which strife guys,

2897
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:31,390
you couldn't do a pull up when you were 
180.

2898
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:34,180
That doesn't even make any sense though.
What the fuck it was.

2899
02:27:34,570 --> 02:27:37,630
I moved to when I moved to when I'm to 
snowmass village,

2900
02:27:37,960 --> 02:27:38,793
my roommate was from Brown and he had 
another brother and that another friend 

2901
02:27:42,560 --> 02:27:45,580
and they had trained them to this guy 
named Ira Wolfe where I grew up.

2902
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,473
I went to the Olympics to be a trainer 
and these except for one guy to have 

2903
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:51,363
these guys are still alive and these 
guys did not believe in traditional 

2904
02:27:54,191 --> 02:27:55,024
lifting.

2905
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:58,630
They believed in slow motion,
heavy lifting,

2906
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:03,310
10 count on the way down and the 10 
count on the way up.

2907
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:06,850
A lot of guys still believe in that and 
the strength doubles.

2908
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:11,960
Your strength doubles the strength.
It's so slow motion.

2909
02:28:12,210 --> 02:28:15,390
It was really into that Einstein,
you know Eddie's a black belt.

2910
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:16,360
Scott Epstein.
Yeah.

2911
02:28:16,480 --> 02:28:19,060
He's really into slowmo training.
It was always in motion.

2912
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:19,923
Slow motion lifting.
These guys were really fucking into it 

2913
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:25,460
and say,
Hey,

2914
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:29,090
the one guy we were talking a while ago 
and he has no injuries.

2915
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:31,250
All that,
all that.

2916
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:34,130
Like they.
They switched me when I was doing behind

2917
02:28:34,131 --> 02:28:35,380
the next,
in front of the next.

2918
02:28:35,810 --> 02:28:37,130
They're like,
you're wasting your time.

2919
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:40,280
Just do squats.
Cleans a.

2920
02:28:40,300 --> 02:28:43,450
what's the other one they do that gets 
your fucking traps?

2921
02:28:43,451 --> 02:28:44,840
Jaden?
Ginormous.

2922
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:46,620
You just get 1:30
seconds.

2923
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:47,670
Impressed.
It's just first,

2924
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:48,920
just the first clean.

2925
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:51,590
Don't even press it.
Just just to first clean.

2926
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:54,100
Don't even price it.
All that shit out.

2927
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:56,530
Queens are tremendous.
I love all that shit.

2928
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,190
In fact,
I went back to a straight bar.

2929
02:28:58,191 --> 02:28:59,570
I've been using the straight bargain.
Yeah,

2930
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:00,530
totally.
Yeah.

2931
02:29:00,531 --> 02:29:02,780
I like the straight bar.
I've been squatting.

2932
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:05,990
You're doing kettlebell classes for 
awhile too,

2933
02:29:05,991 --> 02:29:06,730
right?
Weren't you?

2934
02:29:06,730 --> 02:29:07,730
Yeah,
but the kettle.

2935
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:08,613
See,
the problem with the Kettlebell is that 

2936
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:13,910
if you read that that guy's book or 
anything about Pavlov,

2937
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:16,820
he says that the Kettlebells,
I don't even know if that's his name,

2938
02:29:16,821 --> 02:29:21,821
was Selena.
It's supposed to be 20 to 18,

2939
02:29:21,861 --> 02:29:26,590
15 minute workout.
What they do is they the crow,

2940
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:27,493
the new crossfit community as taken 
kettlebells and you're just hurting 

2941
02:29:30,171 --> 02:29:31,004
people kettlebells or done for you to 
feel good and to enhance a different 

2942
02:29:34,041 --> 02:29:36,140
workout.
Like when I do kettlebells,

2943
02:29:36,141 --> 02:29:37,100
thank God for on it.

2944
02:29:37,530 --> 02:29:42,530
I combined it with a club well workout.
I berto crane taught me how to do swings

2945
02:29:43,371 --> 02:29:47,870
with club batch where you turn your 
inside of your wrist.

2946
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:49,880
So everything turned.
So yeah,

2947
02:29:50,090 --> 02:29:54,230
I burned a lot of Fascia on my shoulder 
because I do it that way.

2948
02:29:54,231 --> 02:29:58,550
So when I do a Kettlebell workout,
I incorporated with the batch from on it

2949
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:02,120
and I do it like a circuit training.
I do this a straight one,

2950
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:04,340
all this.
And even with that,

2951
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:07,370
even because I.
before I went to physical therapy,

2952
02:30:07,371 --> 02:30:08,204
I want them to try the club bats because
they have all the way down the end of 

2953
02:30:11,421 --> 02:30:14,390
the.
Helps pull that shoulder all the way the

2954
02:30:14,391 --> 02:30:15,820
fuck down.
Like for me to do anything.

2955
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:16,663
I had to stretch my shoulder before and 
after really deep I had to go to law 

2956
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:20,493
against the wall.
I remember the guy brought on Alberto 

2957
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:24,930
Magaziney,
Galena,

2958
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:25,930
glossy.

2959
02:30:25,930 --> 02:30:29,360
I do a lot of his little warmer,
great workouts and even,

2960
02:30:29,390 --> 02:30:30,223
uh,
right now,

2961
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,820
uh,
on.

2962
02:30:31,821 --> 02:30:35,480
It's got that Kettlebell six Kendall,
six winds of transformation.

2963
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:37,910
They got some great stuff on it.
The guy send it to me,

2964
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:40,760
the beginning,
they call it something else instead of a

2965
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:43,280
warm up,
they call it something else.

2966
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,470
[inaudible] name is Josh,
not Josh Wolfe,

2967
02:30:46,060 --> 02:30:46,970
John,
John Wolfe,

2968
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:47,870
John.
Both good.

2969
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:49,460
He's fantastic.
Fantastic.

2970
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:51,890
Fantastic clubs is that they're not that
heavy,

2971
02:30:51,891 --> 02:30:52,724
but they're odd.
So like you're holding onto the end of 

2972
02:30:54,441 --> 02:30:55,274
it,
but the way it is isn't the other end 

2973
02:30:57,320 --> 02:31:01,340
and it's this long thing.
So it's very awkward and you could get a

2974
02:31:01,341 --> 02:31:04,250
really good work on with 15 pounds,
you really can't.

2975
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:05,860
That's all I use.
Fifteen and 10.

2976
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:07,033
I got a five on it to break my wrist.
You get a five and you really could 

2977
02:31:11,511 --> 02:31:14,360
really break the flash on your risks.
With the five,

2978
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:17,930
they have an exercise that you go over 
and we had a full set of them out here.

2979
02:31:17,931 --> 02:31:19,740
If you don't want to use your men.
Tremendous.

2980
02:31:19,770 --> 02:31:20,340
Tremendous.

2981
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:22,590
So that's,
that's what I was doing wrong.

2982
02:31:22,591 --> 02:31:25,650
The kettlebell class.
Why am I swinging the gorilla?

2983
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:29,400
Why am I swinging the fucking gorilla?
Why are you swinging the grill?

2984
02:31:29,440 --> 02:31:30,273
I don't know.
And then you turned me onto Steve 

2985
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:35,760
Maxwell steady five pounds.
So now I do 35 and 44 pounds.

2986
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,700
I love Stephen Maxwell stuff.
So I keep.

2987
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:41,160
I keep Steve Max and then you will have 
one.

2988
02:31:41,490 --> 02:31:43,860
I called you with the last dilemma and 
you were like,

2989
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:45,420
well,
let's do it.

2990
02:31:45,450 --> 02:31:47,370
So now I do three,
three and three,

2991
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:48,750
and I'm out of there.
Oh yeah.

2992
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:49,753
Do three Turkish getups.
Three fucking set to cleans and three 

2993
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:54,600
swings out while they believe often with
you.

2994
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:56,880
Just do it a few days a week yet,
listen,

2995
02:31:56,881 --> 02:31:59,670
if I'm on the road,
most hotels now have kettlebells.

2996
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:02,580
Really?
Most hotels are starting to come around.

2997
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:04,470
I go to a hotel,
I check in,

2998
02:32:04,471 --> 02:32:05,550
I go up,
I rolled a joint,

2999
02:32:05,940 --> 02:32:07,680
I go downstairs,
I smoke on the way back.

3000
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,510
I checked by the gym.
If I see Kettlebells,

3001
02:32:09,511 --> 02:32:10,344
I'm very happy,
but I keep it to that read three and 

3002
02:32:13,021 --> 02:32:16,770
three because over 50 it should just be 
three days a week.

3003
02:32:16,771 --> 02:32:18,510
It takes a lot for you to recuperate.
Well,

3004
02:32:18,511 --> 02:32:22,890
it's also that you can get in more reps 
over the week.

3005
02:32:22,980 --> 02:32:25,470
That's really what you want.
If you do a lot of reps in one day,

3006
02:32:25,471 --> 02:32:27,180
the problem is you're destroyed 
afterwards,

3007
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:30,510
but if you do the same amount of reps 
over the course of five days,

3008
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:33,090
just do shorter workouts and do many of 
them.

3009
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:35,910
You don't get ever get destroyed.
Your body's fine.

3010
02:32:35,960 --> 02:32:38,130
You,
you do all the other things you do too,

3011
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:41,190
and I think you become more consistent 
with it.

3012
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:45,760
You don't.
I need to do to kickboxing.

3013
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,250
Conditionings to Jujitsu.
You know,

3014
02:32:48,251 --> 02:32:49,084
my Jujitsu incorporates my Jujitsu,
incorporates the class during the 

3015
02:32:52,861 --> 02:32:54,810
technique and three,
five minute roles.

3016
02:32:55,350 --> 02:32:56,183
After that I get up and walk away 
because then anything after that is 

3017
02:32:57,820 --> 02:32:59,490
defeating,
defeating the purpose.

3018
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:04,700
I hit the bed twice a week,
especially on Sunday.

3019
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:05,590
What?
The Nova.

3020
02:33:05,591 --> 02:33:06,750
So a bed.
What does that.

3021
02:33:06,930 --> 02:33:09,330
The a bed is the one I told you about 
the last time.

3022
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:12,630
I think they sent you some information 
because we were discussing it last time.

3023
02:33:12,631 --> 02:33:14,460
It's The red light therapy.
Oh,

3024
02:33:14,461 --> 02:33:15,294
okay.
I get the know Victoria bed twice a 

3025
02:33:16,441 --> 02:33:18,510
week.
Nova?

3026
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:19,800
Yes.
Nova.

3027
02:33:19,801 --> 02:33:22,040
Thor bed.
Look at up to Nova.

3028
02:33:22,060 --> 02:33:26,390
So a bed twice a week especially on a 
Sunday to take all the oxidation.

3029
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:27,930
That thing right there?
Yes.

3030
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:28,741
Thinner,
fitter,

3031
02:33:28,741 --> 02:33:29,580
healthier,
happier.

3032
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:31,150
And then I,
I,

3033
02:33:31,330 --> 02:33:34,980
I go in the Cryo therapy two or three 
times a week.

3034
02:33:34,981 --> 02:33:39,510
So what I did was I shortened my workout
and I could do it more often.

3035
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:40,503
Me going to a Jujitsu class and fighting
Eddie because that does nothing for 

3036
02:33:44,701 --> 02:33:45,430
them.
Yeah.

3037
02:33:45,430 --> 02:33:46,920
I'm not going to improve.
Right.

3038
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:49,440
And I'm not going to do that because I'm
not going to be able to row for three or

3039
02:33:49,441 --> 02:33:50,970
four more days now.
Yeah,

3040
02:33:50,971 --> 02:33:51,804
that's the thing is recovery.
I really went online and right after 50 

3041
02:33:56,570 --> 02:33:58,370
and I number one,
you gotta go,

3042
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:02,640
you got over 50 strength strength.
Oh Gosh,

3043
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:05,210
that's tough too because that 
sarcopenia.

3044
02:34:05,211 --> 02:34:07,770
I'll fucking kill you.
And that's when you start getting punchy

3045
02:34:07,771 --> 02:34:11,220
and we all become our grandfather.
And when you do stand up,

3046
02:34:11,390 --> 02:34:12,610
it's,
it's.

3047
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:15,960
You just got to be stronger.
So I went back,

3048
02:34:15,961 --> 02:34:19,290
I meet these guys a week and we pack it 
on.

3049
02:34:19,310 --> 02:34:20,143
I'll even go on what you put on there 
because it gives me anxiety and we open 

3050
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:26,710
up with a squat to really get the system
into a fucking frenzy.

3051
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:29,200
You will.
There's no jumping jacks.

3052
02:34:29,201 --> 02:34:32,110
There's no bench.
We opened up warm up first.

3053
02:34:32,290 --> 02:34:33,580
I will do a little warm up.

3054
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:36,370
And the first two sets I see the fucking
devil.

3055
02:34:37,720 --> 02:34:40,390
It's on a stopwatch.
There's no sets.

3056
02:34:41,260 --> 02:34:42,710
It's on a stopwatch.
What do you mean?

3057
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:46,180
So he'll go four hours,
four minutes go.

3058
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:49,870
So four minutes of squatting,
squatting for three minutes,

3059
02:34:49,871 --> 02:34:51,940
three minutes or so.
A lot of times squatting,

3060
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:54,250
but it's 10 seconds up,
10 seconds back.

3061
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:56,680
The last two.
I'm fucking.

3062
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:57,673
I'm saying the devil.
I'm thinking about getting a heart 

3063
02:34:59,321 --> 02:35:00,370
attack,
my whole thing.

3064
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,940
And then right from there I go to a pull
down machine.

3065
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:07,800
Right from there I go to a back twister.
It's really weird.

3066
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:11,080
My mother in 22 minutes,
that's a good workout.

3067
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:13,750
I mean two minutes.
Physical strain,

3068
02:35:13,900 --> 02:35:17,410
lifting some weights,
getting that a bone density,

3069
02:35:17,650 --> 02:35:21,670
tightening up all your.
All the muscle grabs the stick works.

3070
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:22,533
That's the most important thing.
I don't end up on NBC doing commercials 

3071
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:27,400
for Ed Commercials.

3072
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:30,190
You don't want any eat.
You got to get the stick.

3073
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:33,220
And that's from lifting weights let bro.
She was day one.

3074
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:34,990
Yeah.
I don't care what anybody tells you.

3075
02:35:35,020 --> 02:35:35,853
Give me an old guy that's doing lifting 
a little lightweight three days a week 

3076
02:35:40,430 --> 02:35:42,610
and he's doing it for his Maloof.
Stick all that shit.

3077
02:35:42,611 --> 02:35:43,444
They saw a what is the GNC with Frank 
Thomas and it's good for your lady to 

3078
02:35:49,270 --> 02:35:50,770
that Shit.
Don't work those frank.

3079
02:35:50,771 --> 02:35:51,604
Thomas,
a bunch of thirsty white people hanging 

3080
02:35:52,811 --> 02:35:53,261
out.
Oh,

3081
02:35:53,261 --> 02:35:56,380
those commercials are the worst.
We played those commercials 30 times.

3082
02:35:56,550 --> 02:35:59,050
Shit,
how are you ladies going?

3083
02:35:59,051 --> 02:36:01,800
I wish you would do that.
In my meanwhile,

3084
02:36:02,340 --> 02:36:04,300
frank's a fat fuck.
You know what?

3085
02:36:04,301 --> 02:36:06,400
I'm.
He's overweight and shit.

3086
02:36:06,401 --> 02:36:09,100
I'm doing this.
That GNC shit don't work.

3087
02:36:09,101 --> 02:36:11,110
You want to keep them a loop.
Stickup oatmeal.

3088
02:36:11,740 --> 02:36:14,740
They did a study on this.
I did a study.

3089
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:17,440
I did an independent study to see what 
works the most.

3090
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,260
OATMEAL,
coconut milk in that motherfucker.

3091
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:21,740
Had some debt.
Listen,

3092
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:22,583
some squats,
you'll be stabbing people to use those 

3093
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:27,100
things.
Elevate testosterone.

3094
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:29,410
Increase your hormone levels.
That's for sure.

3095
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:31,990
Dead Lifts and squats are the Kings of 
exercise.

3096
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:34,960
Those are so important because they work
your whole chain.

3097
02:36:34,961 --> 02:36:37,320
They work everything.
Dolce love is the fuck them.

3098
02:36:37,330 --> 02:36:39,390
Deadlift a dolce.
Me and him,

3099
02:36:39,391 --> 02:36:41,740
but everybody does some.
I read his book.

3100
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:42,603
That's when I really.
I went to the y one day and I started 

3101
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:46,180
like.
I started like,

3102
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:47,373
I got to coach the first time to go over
the basics with me and then like three 

3103
02:36:50,231 --> 02:36:54,490
weeks later I thought that was my.
I went to the center of five.

3104
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,540
That list,
Bro.

3105
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:57,950
I could feel it in my central nervous 
system.

3106
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:03,610
It really does hit essentially like you 
just feel like this fucking realizes,

3107
02:37:03,611 --> 02:37:05,420
oh Jesus,
this crazy fuck is.

3108
02:37:05,470 --> 02:37:06,303
It needs us to lift weights.
It needs us to carry heavy things all 

3109
02:37:09,641 --> 02:37:10,474
the time.
So your body just get stronger and 

3110
02:37:12,071 --> 02:37:12,904
there's only one way to get stronger.
Your body's got to increase 

3111
02:37:14,420 --> 02:37:16,220
testosterones to rebuild

3112
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,750
all that tissue that you're breaking 
down.

3113
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:19,570
You in right now,
brother.

3114
02:37:19,930 --> 02:37:23,150
Your first place in this context,
if I wasn't in first place,

3115
02:37:23,151 --> 02:37:27,280
I jump off a fucking building.
How's The [inaudible] number two?

3116
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:30,650
I'm disturbed that they thought they 
were going to win.

3117
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,753
I'm ahead by like 2000 points.
This is what I'll tell you why right 

3118
02:37:34,671 --> 02:37:35,710
now.
Right?

3119
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:36,913
I mean obviously out of all these guys,
I'm the one who's been working out all 

3120
02:37:39,621 --> 02:37:41,060
the time.
I'm obviously,

3121
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:45,840
I've been working on my whole life,
so I have a 10,000,

3122
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:50,870
39 res and second place with 8,299.
Yeah,

3123
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:54,540
Tommy Buns in third place.
Tommy has just uh,

3124
02:37:54,890 --> 02:37:57,740
recently banged down another hundred.
So he's eight,

3125
02:37:57,741 --> 02:37:58,401
two,
five,

3126
02:37:58,401 --> 02:37:59,234
nine and Bert is strong in last place.
Strong talking to all kinds of mad shit 

3127
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:07,153
and he's more than 2000 points behind me
that slob and I haven't even worked out 

3128
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:12,710
today.

3129
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:14,720
And when I'm working out today,
they're all going to quit.

3130
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:16,093
I'm going to,
I'm going today even though I'm 2000 

3131
02:38:17,541 --> 02:38:19,730
points at hand,
I'm going to go for six hours.

3132
02:38:20,060 --> 02:38:20,893
Today is a day of death.
As many as I've gotten as many as a 

3133
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:27,140
thousand points in a day.
No one has even gotten close to that.

3134
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:29,690
You just got to fucking keep going.
The thing is,

3135
02:38:29,691 --> 02:38:31,100
when you're exhausted,
you can't go,

3136
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:33,020
I can't do this anymore.
Yes,

3137
02:38:33,021 --> 02:38:35,150
you can go broke.
What do you do it for 20 minutes?

3138
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:39,860
I do a variety of different things.
Break it down for a,

3139
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:42,320
run the hills with the dog for good.
Our,

3140
02:38:42,620 --> 02:38:43,453
you know,
do about two miles in the hills with a 

3141
02:38:44,691 --> 02:38:46,550
dog.
So he's exhausted.

3142
02:38:46,551 --> 02:38:47,840
Otherwise he's a puppy,
you know,

3143
02:38:47,841 --> 02:38:48,950
he's,
he's two years old.

3144
02:38:48,951 --> 02:38:51,050
He's a pain in the ass if he's not worn 
out.

3145
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,670
So I wear his little ass out.

3146
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:54,550
So we run for two,
you know,

3147
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:56,990
two miles,
which is in the hills.

3148
02:38:57,050 --> 02:39:00,640
These are pretty fucking steep hills.
It turns out to be about 40 minutes ish.

3149
02:39:01,070 --> 02:39:03,350
Forty five minutes closer now.
Get back,

3150
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:04,933
stretch out a little.
And then I decided what else I want to 

3151
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:07,410
do.
Um,

3152
02:39:07,470 --> 02:39:08,303
yesterday it was a kickboxing,
so I hit the bag for another hour and a 

3153
02:39:12,711 --> 02:39:13,544
half.
I turned on some old fights in the gym 

3154
02:39:15,771 --> 02:39:18,860
and just fucking went to town,
put on the ringside timer.

3155
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:19,783
So it's given me rounds and uh,
the ringside timer gives me 30 seconds 

3156
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:25,970
to.
So I go 30 seconds,

3157
02:39:26,330 --> 02:39:27,810
30 seconds,
not so hard.

3158
02:39:27,830 --> 02:39:30,890
Thirty seconds on 30 seconds.
And that's a hard one minute break.

3159
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:32,180
She'd gotten water.
No,

3160
02:39:32,181 --> 02:39:32,520
no,
no,

3161
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:32,990
no.
Sure.

3162
02:39:32,990 --> 02:39:34,270
No Shin Guards.
No.

3163
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:37,350
Really kicked the shit out of that 
fucking backyard.

3164
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:39,383
Oh God.
I'm fucking my shins up with the 

3165
02:39:42,390 --> 02:39:44,000
kickboxing class,
like fucked up.

3166
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,380
One of my phone guy toes just blew up.
It just blew up and blood started coming

3167
02:39:48,381 --> 02:39:49,850
out of there.
I went home later on and said,

3168
02:39:49,851 --> 02:39:51,050
what the fuck?
I did nothing.

3169
02:39:51,051 --> 02:39:52,670
My tail,
my toenails cut.

3170
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,260
If you slam your Shin into a bag for an 
hour and a half of full blast,

3171
02:39:57,261 --> 02:39:58,094
some tissues going to break down.
Something's going to like right now 

3172
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:02,750
everything's sore.
My ankles are sore,

3173
02:40:02,751 --> 02:40:05,720
my knees are sore,
my lower back is sore.

3174
02:40:05,770 --> 02:40:08,360
I went,
I went whole ham yesterday,

3175
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:11,270
but you know,
that wasn't a big day for me.

3176
02:40:11,271 --> 02:40:13,620
Yesterday was like for 430 something 
points.

3177
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,680
That's a big day.
For some.

3178
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:16,643
It's the most I've ever worked out is I 
did six and a half hours and I got a 

3179
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:24,240
thousand points.
I did five and a half hours.

3180
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:25,463
I got 900 points and then I did another 
hour just to sort of like at the end of 

3181
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,250
the day,
just to loosen everything up,

3182
02:40:32,251 --> 02:40:34,890
which just hit the bag for an hour.
Just I just.

3183
02:40:35,460 --> 02:40:38,510
Because Bert was talking so much shit,
I was like,

3184
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:42,480
where am I going to put the bill?
Who doesn't want to double

3185
02:40:42,980 --> 02:40:44,380
like,
okay,

3186
02:40:44,690 --> 02:40:46,190
okay.
We'll see.

3187
02:40:46,850 --> 02:40:51,850
We'll say he went hiking with Ari and 
was quitting while he was hiking.

3188
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:56,040
Hiking is walking.
It's walking.

3189
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:57,233
These guys are walking and they're 
getting tired and he's talking about 

3190
02:40:59,251 --> 02:41:02,100
beating me in a fitness contest.
It's outrageous.

3191
02:41:02,500 --> 02:41:06,960
Plus he's enormously overweight.
The one who is the real issue is Ari.

3192
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:10,020
Ari is a sneaky fuck are.
I might try to pull it out.

3193
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:11,003
Even though it's 2000 points behind,
he might try to murder himself over the 

3194
02:41:13,411 --> 02:41:14,244
next two days,
get to 2000 points and then put another 

3195
02:41:16,801 --> 02:41:19,020
$1,000
to beat me on the third day.

3196
02:41:19,021 --> 02:41:20,970
He.
He literally might try to do that,

3197
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:26,280
but I'm not going to let them know we're
here.

3198
02:41:26,281 --> 02:41:27,230
We're queer.
They're there,

3199
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:30,180
so they're fighting for second place.
Good luck boys.

3200
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:34,140
I let them get close up until a while 
ago,

3201
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:38,130
up until about a week and a half ago,
and then I just turned it on.

3202
02:41:38,130 --> 02:41:39,030
I'm like,
okay,

3203
02:41:39,031 --> 02:41:40,680
here we go.
I had a plan.

3204
02:41:40,830 --> 02:41:43,900
My plan was to to get,
you know,

3205
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:47,460
first of all,
I was not doing this much cardio before,

3206
02:41:47,550 --> 02:41:50,710
so we're at 29 days instead of 30,
what is today?

3207
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:52,200
The 29th,
29,

3208
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:56,040
29 days in.
I've taken four days off.

3209
02:41:56,070 --> 02:41:56,903
I took three days off because I went to 
Vegas with my family when I went with 

3210
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:01,890
the UFC and said,
we're going to go on Thursday,

3211
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:02,910
Wednesday till Sunday.
I'm not going to work out.

3212
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:04,470
Just go have a good time,
relax,

3213
02:42:04,620 --> 02:42:07,230
see if these guys catch up.
So they caught up to me and that's

3214
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:09,510
posted opens and last please.

3215
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:13,210
I really hadn't even worked out and so I
said,

3216
02:42:13,211 --> 02:42:14,860
okay,
I'm done with that.

3217
02:42:15,070 --> 02:42:18,550
Now it's time to kick it into full gear.
And then when I kicked into full gear,

3218
02:42:18,551 --> 02:42:21,430
I'm steady every day,
three hours a day,

3219
02:42:21,460 --> 02:42:24,430
three and a half hours a day,
four hours a day.

3220
02:42:24,431 --> 02:42:25,264
Sometimes,
sometimes two and a half hours in the 

3221
02:42:26,831 --> 02:42:28,390
morning,
two and a half hours at night.

3222
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:32,170
Just 600 points a day.
700 points a day,

3223
02:42:32,230 --> 02:42:33,063
800 points a day.
Whatever I got to do just to stay way 

3224
02:42:35,861 --> 02:42:36,694
ahead and then my.
My goal was so the last few days to be 

3225
02:42:40,811 --> 02:42:41,644
so far ahead that they're fucked and 
they're all just scratching and clawing 

3226
02:42:45,371 --> 02:42:46,910
for second place.
What's the,

3227
02:42:46,930 --> 02:42:49,700
what's the,
what's the stuff this year with you?

3228
02:42:49,710 --> 02:42:51,650
Don't get anything that I wanted to lose
it.

3229
02:42:51,651 --> 02:42:54,010
I have to drink a goblet of everybody 
else's pissed.

3230
02:42:54,370 --> 02:42:55,203
That's what I wanted.
I want it because I wanted to drink 

3231
02:42:57,041 --> 02:43:00,010
piss.
I felt like bird has to lose this.

3232
02:43:00,011 --> 02:43:02,650
I don't see how Tom's getting.
Tom was sick.

3233
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:06,040
He was sick as a dog on antibiotics for 
like five days.

3234
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:11,110
Came back in one day and he ran 13 
motherfucking miles for 600 points.

3235
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:12,543
Yeah.

3236
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:13,383
Yeah.
Ran around the neighborhood 13 fucking 

3237
02:43:16,001 --> 02:43:19,030
miles to dude ran for three and a half 
hours.

3238
02:43:19,031 --> 02:43:22,690
Just ran.
Doesn't want to lose and doesn't want to

3239
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:26,170
lose the bird.
Even if you only comes in third place,

3240
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:30,000
as long as he's not.
As long as he beats Bert.

3241
02:43:30,130 --> 02:43:32,860
That's where everybody's at.
Because burt talked so much shit.

3242
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:34,820
Everybody just wants to make sure that 
burt loses.

3243
02:43:34,850 --> 02:43:35,683
He's got the Dimaggio,
he thinks he can just half ass his way 

3244
02:43:40,901 --> 02:43:44,230
through something that's an actual 
competition because he's just,

3245
02:43:44,530 --> 02:43:46,120
look,
he can push himself,

3246
02:43:46,121 --> 02:43:46,954
but there's a big difference between 
pushing yourself and pushing yourself 

3247
02:43:49,751 --> 02:43:53,500
for a whole month.
That's where he's falling apart and he's

3248
02:43:53,501 --> 02:43:56,470
been talking so much shit that were all 
laughing at him.

3249
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:59,080
So yesterday were all,
everybody was going out.

3250
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:01,190
Is it today?
A couple of hours yesterday.

3251
02:44:01,580 --> 02:44:05,380
Joe Rogan back and look at his tits.
Bouncing.

3252
02:44:06,130 --> 02:44:07,320
What he say?
Sandbags.

3253
02:44:07,330 --> 02:44:11,590
That Ren Thomas Sandbag headsets in.
Sorry if I sound super aggressive.

3254
02:44:11,591 --> 02:44:16,591
I still love them.
But man sandbaggers Bro.

3255
02:44:17,710 --> 02:44:22,450
Sandbaggers.
What's he like held on to this stats for

3256
02:44:22,451 --> 02:44:23,284
like a week before he turned him in.
He did Thomas Line about being no 

3257
02:44:26,860 --> 02:44:30,460
already held onto his stats and he's 
allowed to do that.

3258
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:32,050
Look,
we're not supposed to do that.

3259
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:32,913
You're supposed to look.
The manly thing to do is to put it all 

3260
02:44:35,481 --> 02:44:38,500
on the table and make everybody tried to
fucking keep up.

3261
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:42,970
That's the manly thing to do because it 
already is obviously a sneaky fuck.

3262
02:44:43,210 --> 02:44:44,043
Right.
And he obviously is also the one who 

3263
02:44:45,551 --> 02:44:46,384
worked out the least out of all of us,
so he at one point in time stored up a 

3264
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:51,873
thousand points and had them on his 
device and then released him and Bert 

3265
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:58,270
had went fucking crazy.
You Fuck Woo Woo.

3266
02:44:58,510 --> 02:44:59,890
Because birth thought he was a head Ra.

3267
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:01,570
Then all of a sudden already shot ahead 
of him.

3268
02:45:02,050 --> 02:45:04,300
That's how it works.
This is a competition.

3269
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:07,060
It's the fight for last right now,
right between this.

3270
02:45:07,061 --> 02:45:07,894
Between them.
It's a fight for less at burt's gonna 

3271
02:45:09,071 --> 02:45:10,510
get.
He's gonna lose that fight.

3272
02:45:10,690 --> 02:45:13,270
He's going to be last.
Tom's going to work out today.

3273
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:14,233
Tom is going to pay Tom.
I told you tom got 600 fucking points 

3274
02:45:18,221 --> 02:45:18,731
yesterday.
Oh,

3275
02:45:18,731 --> 02:45:20,950
they're fighting.
They're fighting in a group text.

3276
02:45:21,390 --> 02:45:22,960
Let me see what's going on here.
Oh my God.

3277
02:45:22,961 --> 02:45:24,730
It's long.
It's very long.

3278
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:26,320
Oh boy.
There's a lot.

3279
02:45:27,010 --> 02:45:29,770
There's a lot of fighting birds.
Very angry.

3280
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:31,110
Very,
very,

3281
02:45:31,230 --> 02:45:32,063
very angry.
He's very angry because he's realized 

3282
02:45:34,550 --> 02:45:36,640
he's going to come in last because he 
was saying.

3283
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:38,650
He was saying yesterday.
Here's what's hilarious.

3284
02:45:38,890 --> 02:45:40,420
He goes,
he goes in,

3285
02:45:40,421 --> 02:45:41,650
you're barely winning.
I go,

3286
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:42,760
Bert,
I'm ahead of you.

3287
02:45:42,790 --> 02:45:44,890
Yesterday it was 2,300
points.

3288
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:45,873
I go,
do you have any idea what the fuck you 

3289
02:45:46,631 --> 02:45:48,490
would be saying if you were ahead by 
2000,

3290
02:45:48,491 --> 02:45:49,324
300 points?
And he was hard to be respectful and 

3291
02:45:51,031 --> 02:45:54,800
it'd be.
It'd be like,

3292
02:45:54,810 --> 02:45:58,840
you fucking liar.
You fucking liar.

3293
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:02,560
Look this,
you know,

3294
02:46:03,250 --> 02:46:04,900
this is a.
it's a game.

3295
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:07,660
It's.
If I don't get hurt,

3296
02:46:07,870 --> 02:46:09,980
it's a rigged game.
That's just what it is.

3297
02:46:10,270 --> 02:46:11,103
It'd be drink.
I believe snuggling really got caught 

3298
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:14,740
drinking the snack and nothing.
Didn't you think that?

3299
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:17,840
Don't you think that birth dranken 
didn't you say you looked at you funny.

3300
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:20,690
Alright,
I'm talk the story.

3301
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:23,030
You telling me what you think.
Okay.

3302
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:26,540
Because this was the fucked up thing.
My feeling is raven hurt.

3303
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:31,100
Every Wednesday I go to pizza after 
karate with mercy.

3304
02:46:31,970 --> 02:46:35,890
We go eat pizza and we're sitting at the
neighborhood pizza drag.

3305
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:39,090
We're sitting there and I look at my 
wife like,

3306
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:40,070
oh,
isn't that bird?

3307
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:44,800
It's a dude walking through nature,
but look just like burt with a hat on.

3308
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:49,250
I put my pizza down and go,
I go a cock sucker.

3309
02:46:49,310 --> 02:46:50,143
I see you're drinking because it looked 
like he got a six pack or whatever 

3310
02:46:52,350 --> 02:46:53,183
holding it.
He turned around and waved at me and 

3311
02:46:55,971 --> 02:46:58,490
kept walking.
This is Bert Kreischer,

3312
02:46:59,780 --> 02:47:00,910
right Christ.

3313
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,950
This is a guy who,
you know,

3314
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:07,540
I figured he'd come back and talk to me.
So the next day Lee tells me,

3315
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:09,060
I tell Lee that like,
well,

3316
02:47:09,070 --> 02:47:09,990
yeah,
I swapped birthday,

3317
02:47:10,010 --> 02:47:11,630
yelled at,
but he didn't come and talk to me.

3318
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:13,213
Lee puts down.
Leads sells me that burt put down a 

3319
02:47:15,351 --> 02:47:18,200
tweet that one of his fans yelled at 
them.

3320
02:47:18,690 --> 02:47:21,680
They saw someone he didn't know who it 
was and he didn't know who it was.

3321
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:24,740
And he kept walking.
He knew who the fuck it dog.

3322
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:27,230
If I yell at you,
you'll know it's fucking me.

3323
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:29,390
If I say cock suck at the end of the 
speech,

3324
02:47:29,391 --> 02:47:29,990
you know,

3325
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:32,510
let me look what else burt does.
First of all,

3326
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:35,630
Burton knows he's behind.
It's staggering amount.

3327
02:47:35,930 --> 02:47:38,390
He put in the most bitch ass workout 
today.

3328
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:40,940
He got,
what is this?

3329
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:45,770
A 149 points that is.
That is not enough.

3330
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:48,260
He worked out for an hour and 50 
minutes.

3331
02:47:48,261 --> 02:47:50,960
You've got 149 points because look at 
the end,

3332
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:52,850
see the end.
All those grades,

3333
02:47:52,851 --> 02:47:55,300
maybe it stayed on or something.
He kept his.

3334
02:47:55,301 --> 02:47:57,590
He kept a strap on.
He worked out.

3335
02:47:57,591 --> 02:47:58,424
It says an hour for.
He worked there for 40 minutes and he 

3336
02:48:00,351 --> 02:48:02,840
kept a strap on for an hour.
Trying to get some extra.

3337
02:48:02,841 --> 02:48:03,674
Yeah,
because he's dying so it was hard to 

3338
02:48:04,771 --> 02:48:05,604
elevated.
So you get some points for having an 

3339
02:48:07,371 --> 02:48:09,080
elevated heart.
But look at this.

3340
02:48:09,081 --> 02:48:11,630
All this gray shit at the end.
See folks,

3341
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:14,480
see all of this?
I can barely see it.

3342
02:48:14,630 --> 02:48:17,750
You can't sit here.
Let me do something here.

3343
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:24,000
I'll show people here all this nonsense.
Wow.

3344
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:25,213
To work

3345
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:29,820
you get for 80 percent of your heart 
rate.

3346
02:48:30,090 --> 02:48:34,860
You get yellow for 90 percent of your 
Max heart rate.

3347
02:48:34,861 --> 02:48:38,070
You get read.
I tried to go all read the first day.

3348
02:48:38,071 --> 02:48:39,120
I'm like,
I'm just going to kill them.

3349
02:48:39,121 --> 02:48:44,121
I'm just going to sprint for half an 
hour and just make these guys catch up.

3350
02:48:44,191 --> 02:48:45,024
There's no way to catch up.
Then Ari and his fucking ingenious and 

3351
02:48:48,091 --> 02:48:48,924
devious ways found out that you get just
as many points for 80 percent is good 

3352
02:48:52,311 --> 02:48:55,650
for 90 percent.
We figured so that they avoid lawsuits.

3353
02:48:56,520 --> 02:48:57,353
So he said,
okay,

3354
02:48:57,570 --> 02:48:59,790
so it seems like the sweet spot is an 80
percent,

3355
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:03,420
so just stick to 80 percent so you can 
do that.

3356
02:49:03,421 --> 02:49:08,220
Or You could be like Bert and burt 
barely gets to 70 percent,

3357
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:12,510
mostly stays in the 60 percent range,
which is gray.

3358
02:49:12,690 --> 02:49:14,280
And then 80 percent,
which is.

3359
02:49:15,080 --> 02:49:18,720
Well,
60 percent is like there's 50,

3360
02:49:18,721 --> 02:49:21,870
60 and 70 and seventies green.

3361
02:49:22,620 --> 02:49:23,520
No,
yeah,

3362
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:24,780
seventies,
green.

3363
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:29,010
And then blue is 60.
So He's mostly blue.

3364
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:32,970
Sixty percent of his mass heart rate,
which by the way I might be at right now

3365
02:49:33,630 --> 02:49:36,300
because I'm getting angry.
So if you've got mad,

3366
02:49:36,450 --> 02:49:39,990
you'd be in the blue and you get two 
points in a minute for the blue,

3367
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:41,880
you get four points a minute for the 
yellow,

3368
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:45,660
what do you see?
Sixty percent to 70 percent you get?

3369
02:49:45,661 --> 02:49:50,661
Blue Bird is almost all gray and blue.
And if you look at this fucking slobbery

3370
02:49:51,541 --> 02:49:52,350
workout,
he's got,

3371
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:53,183
look at all that shit.
It's 60 percent and lower most of his 

3372
02:49:57,871 --> 02:49:58,704
workout.
So that means most of the workout that 

3373
02:50:00,991 --> 02:50:01,824
he did for an hour and 49 minutes,
it's him with a fucking thing on just 

3374
02:50:05,581 --> 02:50:07,560
sitting around.
It's an hour and 30 minutes.

3375
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:10,380
So it's.
Most of it is him with the thing on just

3376
02:50:10,381 --> 02:50:12,330
sitting there being fat.

3377
02:50:12,750 --> 02:50:14,310
It's all it is.
So let me ask you this.

3378
02:50:14,311 --> 02:50:15,780
What is this?
What is this called?

3379
02:50:15,810 --> 02:50:16,800
[inaudible].
I like to go on.

3380
02:50:16,840 --> 02:50:19,830
It's called.
This is my zone fitness tracker.

3381
02:50:19,831 --> 02:50:21,600
This is the thing.
You put it on your chest,

3382
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,910
you.
It's a.

3383
02:50:23,070 --> 02:50:23,903
Once I snap this in,
it'll start measuring my heart rate and 

3384
02:50:26,131 --> 02:50:27,570
I'm going to put it on when I get out of
here.

3385
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:31,620
I'm going to start working out and today
these are the three days of death.

3386
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:37,080
Today's Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday we'd go crazy.

3387
02:50:37,081 --> 02:50:38,730
Joe.
He was Wednesday.

3388
02:50:38,731 --> 02:50:39,564
I work out to 1159 and then at 1159 I 
pop that off and walk away at 1159 and 

3389
02:50:49,050 --> 02:50:51,510
then I go have a glass of wine because 
it hits midnight.

3390
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:53,790
No wait.
Qualifications on this?

3391
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:54,610
Nothing.
Nobody?

3392
02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:55,390
No,
no.

3393
02:50:55,390 --> 02:50:57,690
There's no losing weight.
I probably fucking gained weight.

3394
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:02,130
I haven't lost any weight.
I've eaten everything that moves.

3395
02:51:02,430 --> 02:51:03,263
I've put in zero dietary restrictions.
I ate a whole carrot cake the other day 

3396
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:09,900
because the amount of calories that I'm 
burning is fucking insane.

3397
02:51:10,110 --> 02:51:10,940
Like,
I mean,

3398
02:51:10,940 --> 02:51:12,870
I'll give you a,
for instance,

3399
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:16,770
on a day,
like a good calorie day in terms of like

3400
02:51:16,771 --> 02:51:19,590
how much like yesterday,
one workout,

3401
02:51:19,650 --> 02:51:20,810
2000,
200,

3402
02:51:20,850 --> 02:51:22,950
14 calories,
one workout,

3403
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:24,570
three hours,
25 minutes.

3404
02:51:25,290 --> 02:51:29,310
And then the day before that 1,930
calories.

3405
02:51:30,210 --> 02:51:32,670
The day before that there was two 
workouts.

3406
02:51:32,910 --> 02:51:37,110
One was 1,876
calories,

3407
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:39,720
one was 2000,
210 calories.

3408
02:51:39,970 --> 02:51:43,380
These are,
I mean this insane amount of calories.

3409
02:51:43,381 --> 02:51:44,214
One workout I had was 4,900.
What's that entail when you get your 

3410
02:51:48,290 --> 02:51:50,550
heart up to add is at the running?
Yeah.

3411
02:51:50,580 --> 02:51:51,180
Well,
the lifting.

3412
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:52,920
I can't.
I can't just do one thing.

3413
02:51:52,921 --> 02:51:56,580
I go crazy.
I'll get bored so I lift,

3414
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:59,790
but the lift doesn't give me much lift 
is like blue and green.

3415
02:51:59,910 --> 02:52:04,590
That's all you ever get from lifting his
wings or chin ups.

3416
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:08,530
Presses,
cleans and presses windmills.

3417
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:09,573
A clean press squats,
a renegade rows or Kettle Bell Hell 

3418
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:17,560
kettlebells and obviously doesn't give 
you much.

3419
02:52:17,561 --> 02:52:22,090
It doesn't give me my Jujitsu.
Jujitsu would probably be pretty good,

3420
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:25,570
but this thing we get in the way.
If anybody mounted you at crack,

3421
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:27,130
this thing would crack.
You don't.

3422
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:29,320
If you lost this.
Oh my God,

3423
02:52:29,321 --> 02:52:31,870
it'd be death.
Like I could break this with my finger.

3424
02:52:32,350 --> 02:52:35,190
I'm pretty sure I could break this.
It feels like time a lot.

3425
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:36,940
Yes.
That's the number one.

3426
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:39,680
Did an hour and a half bag yesterday.
You know,

3427
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:43,420
because I have the gym at home so I went
fucking hog on the.

3428
02:52:43,421 --> 02:52:45,880
On the pitch.
I put fights on once I put fights on and

3429
02:52:45,881 --> 02:52:46,714
get fired up,
man,

3430
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:50,410
just start fucking wailing on that bag 
and keeping the party going.

3431
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:53,800
Um,
but see if I,

3432
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:56,860
if I got cocky right now,
these fucks could catch me,

3433
02:52:56,980 --> 02:53:00,210
especially Ari because he's probably 
gonna sand back some more and,

3434
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:01,113
and hide his numbers because he just 
wants to beat Bert because he got super 

3435
02:53:04,661 --> 02:53:05,620
pissed at Tom.

3436
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:06,613
Like the fuck Tom,
because tom put up all those points 

3437
02:53:08,621 --> 02:53:09,454
yesterday.
Six hundred points in a day is a lot of 

3438
02:53:10,901 --> 02:53:12,430
points.
But like I said,

3439
02:53:12,490 --> 02:53:13,870
dude ran,
like,

3440
02:53:13,871 --> 02:53:14,704
I'll tell you what he did.
He ran 13 fucking miles in his 

3441
02:53:18,131 --> 02:53:20,260
neighborhood and this is after being 
sick.

3442
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:22,680
But he's feeling it today.
Yeah.

3443
02:53:23,130 --> 02:53:25,870
Today it gets 145 points.
That's not good.

3444
02:53:26,660 --> 02:53:29,310
You're not going to win with that.
See,

3445
02:53:29,320 --> 02:53:32,850
they're not trying to win.
They're trying to beat people.

3446
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:34,773
I know that one day he was a US crowd 
therapy because I want to purchase left 

3447
02:53:38,790 --> 02:53:41,080
ticket.
So I knew he was doing something,

3448
02:53:41,140 --> 02:53:43,300
but I know he hasn't been going 
consistently.

3449
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:45,820
He,
it doesn't do anything consistently,

3450
02:53:46,030 --> 02:53:48,640
but he doesn't watch his diet either.
That's the problem with burke.

3451
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:50,830
He's not watching his diet.
He's not eating,

3452
02:53:51,090 --> 02:53:52,850
not an eater.
It's the boos.

3453
02:53:53,390 --> 02:53:55,330
That is a motherfucker.
It is.

3454
02:53:55,540 --> 02:53:59,020
That shit turns into sugar at night 
because I'll kill you.

3455
02:53:59,350 --> 02:54:00,560
You know what else kills you?
I said,

3456
02:54:00,561 --> 02:54:03,040
how you both people think that that 
fucking hell.

3457
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:05,370
There's a ton of shit that fucking kills
you.

3458
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:09,020
Just stick to what happened on a banana.
I try,

3459
02:54:09,070 --> 02:54:09,990
you know,
I love us.

3460
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:10,833
I eat bowls,
dog.

3461
02:54:11,170 --> 02:54:13,710
They make them my,
my house or Chia seeds and Juju.

3462
02:54:13,990 --> 02:54:17,200
But I'll tell you what I read when I'm 
in the middle of these brutal workouts.

3463
02:54:17,201 --> 02:54:18,034
I'll drink the whole soda and the work.
I drank a cream soda yesterday in the 

3464
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:23,440
middle of a workout.
I needed sugar.

3465
02:54:23,470 --> 02:54:25,750
I needed it.
I didn't know you need it because I felt

3466
02:54:25,751 --> 02:54:28,030
like I needed it.
I was fucking.

3467
02:54:28,450 --> 02:54:31,780
I'm burning so many calories and um,
um,

3468
02:54:31,781 --> 02:54:34,600
my,
my blood sugar is crashing so hard.

3469
02:54:34,601 --> 02:54:36,160
I mean fruit.
I mean,

3470
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:37,253
when I,
the one day that I worked out where I 

3471
02:54:38,921 --> 02:54:41,740
did five and a half hours,
I was eating boxes,

3472
02:54:41,741 --> 02:54:42,970
animal crackers.

3473
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:47,230
I was eating everything I could.
What I do is what you told me to do when

3474
02:54:47,231 --> 02:54:51,220
I get home from Thai or lifting and I 
make a protein shake,

3475
02:54:51,790 --> 02:54:53,380
I put,
I swear to God,

3476
02:54:53,381 --> 02:54:54,214
I take a Hershey's syrup.
He told me just a little bit and I just 

3477
02:54:58,661 --> 02:55:03,500
go tick,
not even a second of it.

3478
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,970
And with the Mexican chocolate works 
perfect.

3479
02:55:05,971 --> 02:55:07,430
That tastes like fucking,
you know.

3480
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:11,240
So I do that with the protein drinks,
but I try to avoid sugar.

3481
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:14,720
Nothing,
no more sugar,

3482
02:55:14,721 --> 02:55:16,760
but see what's happening with these 
workouts.

3483
02:55:17,450 --> 02:55:18,283
You're dealing with an extreme loss of 
electrolytes and extreme loss of 

3484
02:55:22,790 --> 02:55:24,200
glucose.
I mean,

3485
02:55:24,201 --> 02:55:27,740
I'm putting salt in all my water.
I'm drinking.

3486
02:55:28,350 --> 02:55:29,183
Bought a bunch of these nalgene.
You know what a nalgene bottle is like 

3487
02:55:31,761 --> 02:55:33,830
with a twist top.
It's a thick,

3488
02:55:33,980 --> 02:55:34,970
heavy,
plastic,

3489
02:55:34,971 --> 02:55:35,804
32 ounce bottle of water.
I'm drinking three and four of those in 

3490
02:55:39,141 --> 02:55:39,974
a workout in those I'm putting the 
electrolytes and then I'm putting 

3491
02:55:43,250 --> 02:55:46,700
sprinkles of Himalayan salt.
So I'm putting like a little,

3492
02:55:46,730 --> 02:55:47,563
like a half a teaspoon of Himalayan salt
in each one of them shaking it up 

3493
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:53,660
because I'm,
I am losing insane amounts of water.

3494
02:55:53,810 --> 02:55:56,450
I sweat so hard.
I set off the fucking alarm.

3495
02:55:56,750 --> 02:56:00,110
I set off my fire alarm in my gym from 
sweat,

3496
02:56:00,650 --> 02:56:05,300
from my steam room.
The whole room was like a shower for me.

3497
02:56:05,301 --> 02:56:10,020
Steven and I put it up on instagram.
This is the kind of workout I'm doing.

3498
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:14,840
I mean I'm pushing hard because they're 
not making it easy.

3499
02:56:14,841 --> 02:56:16,160
These guys are actually doing it.

3500
02:56:25,790 --> 02:56:26,720
Fire alarm,

3501
02:56:28,590 --> 02:56:30,690
that's legit.
Those puddles on the ground.

3502
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:33,660
That's not for me pissing my pants.
That's all sweat.

3503
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:35,400
So I'm,
I'm,

3504
02:56:35,450 --> 02:56:40,450
I'm sweating so much because I'm staying
in the 80,

3505
02:56:40,990 --> 02:56:44,850
80 percent of your Max heart rate range 
for hours.

3506
02:56:45,420 --> 02:56:46,253
I'm staying there for hours.
So my thought was there's no way they 

3507
02:56:50,281 --> 02:56:52,200
can do that.
They're not going to do that.

3508
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:56,220
There's no way they're not going to do 
that for five hours.

3509
02:56:56,560 --> 02:57:00,090
That's just not.
So like if I did one day like that,

3510
02:57:00,091 --> 02:57:05,091
I felt like one day where I did,
I got 935 points in one workout and then

3511
02:57:05,731 --> 02:57:07,740
another 100 points afterwards.
I'm like,

3512
02:57:07,741 --> 02:57:11,040
one day like that will separate me from 
the pack.

3513
02:57:11,100 --> 02:57:14,280
Just one day.
Just put feed fear in there.

3514
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:17,400
Let me just ask you something,
just to be fair with everybody here.

3515
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:22,390
What about stuff with some of the stuff?
Doesn't that kind of,

3516
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:25,170
you mean like testosterone?
One hundred percent helps.

3517
02:57:25,410 --> 02:57:27,260
I told them,
uh,

3518
02:57:27,430 --> 02:57:30,650
I told them this is a fucking shit.
All those.

3519
02:57:31,550 --> 02:57:35,160
I gave them my doctor's information.
I told them what they should do,

3520
02:57:35,540 --> 02:57:39,180
but I'm also at least eight years older 
than all of them.

3521
02:57:39,430 --> 02:57:40,650
Right.
How old are you?

3522
02:57:40,980 --> 02:57:42,410
Forty one.
Forty one.

3523
02:57:42,411 --> 02:57:47,411
I'm 51 now.
I'm older than all the testosterone.

3524
02:57:50,690 --> 02:57:51,650
Yeah.
You should.

3525
02:57:52,490 --> 02:57:54,830
I'm failing all those tests.
Yeah.

3526
02:57:54,850 --> 02:57:57,600
Testosterone replacement therapy,
hormone replacement therapy.

3527
02:57:57,601 --> 02:58:02,601
I started doing all that when I was 40.
So that's their age.

3528
02:58:03,770 --> 02:58:05,280
Yeah,
it makes a big difference.

3529
02:58:05,310 --> 02:58:07,080
Makes a big difference.
Fuck yeah.

3530
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:08,320
Is,
look,

3531
02:58:08,320 --> 02:58:09,390
listen,
everybody,

3532
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:10,583
everybody listen to this.
There's a stigma attached to that in a 

3533
02:58:13,471 --> 02:58:14,304
lot of people like you know,
where do you your testosterone from or 

3534
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:17,313
get it from my balls.
All that matters is that you have in 

3535
02:58:21,811 --> 02:58:24,210
your system.
If you don't have it in your system,

3536
02:58:24,360 --> 02:58:26,490
you're not going to feel as good.
It's real simple.

3537
02:58:26,520 --> 02:58:29,700
If you're fine with not feeling as good,
good,

3538
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:31,710
go ahead,
stick with that,

3539
02:58:32,370 --> 02:58:35,640
but if you're not fine with it.
This is 2018.

3540
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:38,760
Hormone replacement therapy exists for a
reason,

3541
02:58:39,060 --> 02:58:39,893
and that reason is it makes you feel way
better and makes your body work way 

3542
02:58:42,691 --> 02:58:43,290
better.

3543
02:58:43,290 --> 02:58:48,290
You can avoid a host of ailments and 
conditions that are related to your body

3544
02:58:48,751 --> 02:58:53,340
breaking down due to age with hormone 
replacement therapy.

3545
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:55,980
The key to doing it,
those that do it correctly,

3546
02:58:56,310 --> 02:58:59,100
he's supposed to go to a doctor that's 
going to test your blood levels,

3547
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:02,370
test your nutrient levels,
and adjust your diet first.

3548
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:03,353
The first thing that happens is they 
want to find out how much you're 

3549
02:59:04,981 --> 02:59:06,670
sleeping,
house to house,

3550
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:09,030
how stressed out you are,
what are you eating,

3551
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,013
how much water you're drinking?
Are you getting the proper amount of 

3552
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,240
protein and vegetables you eating 
correctly?

3553
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:18,810
Let's get you off of the sugar.
Let's get you off the booze.

3554
02:59:18,930 --> 02:59:22,080
Let's get you off cigarettes or whatever
the else is before they do anything,

3555
02:59:22,110 --> 02:59:22,943
so they put you that this is a many,
many months process that I went through 

3556
02:59:26,670 --> 02:59:27,503
with a.
They get you off all these different 

3557
02:59:28,801 --> 02:59:29,634
things and you make these adjustments 
and then they start adding a little 

3558
02:59:31,681 --> 02:59:32,514
stuff,
add a little bit of growth hormone at a 

3559
02:59:33,811 --> 02:59:34,890
little bit of testosterone.

3560
02:59:35,100 --> 02:59:37,740
First it was cream and then it became 
injections.

3561
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:38,633
Takes a little bit of time to figure out
what works best and then you get to a 

3562
02:59:41,851 --> 02:59:45,060
point where you're.
You have the hormone levels of a healthy

3563
02:59:45,061 --> 02:59:46,770
young man.
He don't want to elevate.

3564
02:59:46,980 --> 02:59:49,650
You don't want to be higher than that.
That's when you run into problems.

3565
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:54,090
You don't want to be in like some crazy.
Vito Belfort,

3566
02:59:54,091 --> 02:59:58,170
when he got popped from Nevada and he 
was like super human levels.

3567
02:59:58,390 --> 03:00:01,470
That was 80 percent over my mother 
Sunday night against.

3568
03:00:02,460 --> 03:00:03,293
He was supposed to fight rumble Johnson.
What's the guy from Doug with the 

3569
03:00:05,550 --> 03:00:06,720
Christian?
Nice guy.

3570
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:10,200
Nate Marquardt.
Nate Marquardt levels are really high in

3571
03:00:10,201 --> 03:00:12,080
Pittsburgh that night.
That's right.

3572
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:15,060
Yeah.
He was in danger.

3573
03:00:15,810 --> 03:00:16,730
He was.
It was.

3574
03:00:16,840 --> 03:00:19,560
There is dangerous to his health,
the levels,

3575
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:21,480
but he says that was his doctor.
Is Dr.

3576
03:00:21,580 --> 03:00:22,760
Fuck them.
The.

3577
03:00:22,770 --> 03:00:24,780
The,
the whole idea.

3578
03:00:24,900 --> 03:00:25,950
Well,
there's a difference between.

3579
03:00:25,951 --> 03:00:26,784
First of all,
there's a big difference in someone 

3580
03:00:27,320 --> 03:00:28,153
who's competing in mixed martial arts.
Obviously you have to worry about your 

3581
03:00:31,441 --> 03:00:35,310
opponent getting hurt because of the 
fact that your enhanced,

3582
03:00:35,370 --> 03:00:37,110
and these are young guys that are doing 
this.

3583
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:39,540
When nate was doing this,
he was like 30 years old,

3584
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:40,433
right?
When you are talking about just general 

3585
03:00:42,901 --> 03:00:46,680
health and wellness,
testosterone replacement therapy,

3586
03:00:46,681 --> 03:00:47,514
hormone replacement therapy,
there's a reason why a lot of older 

3587
03:00:49,531 --> 03:00:51,480
guys,
especially guys who can afford it,

3588
03:00:51,481 --> 03:00:52,740
they have money.
They're doing it.

3589
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:54,900
It makes you feel better.
It just does,

3590
03:00:55,170 --> 03:00:56,610
and if you don't want to do it,
that's fine.

3591
03:00:56,850 --> 03:00:59,320
There's ways of elevating your 
testosterone natural.

3592
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:00,633
They just don't work as well with 
whether it's dead lifts are running 

3593
03:01:03,131 --> 03:01:04,240
hills,
doing sprints.

3594
03:01:04,420 --> 03:01:05,253
They work a little bit better.
It works a little bit better than 

3595
03:01:07,241 --> 03:01:09,640
nothing,
but if there's lots of very good.

3596
03:01:09,690 --> 03:01:11,860
Yeah,
they released it but not enough for what

3597
03:01:11,861 --> 03:01:12,790
you're saying.
No,

3598
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:17,050
there's gonna be a difference as they 
could raise them through acupuncture.

3599
03:01:17,170 --> 03:01:21,100
I know that she's discussed raising 
Melissa Testosterone.

3600
03:01:21,250 --> 03:01:23,470
Acupuncture.
I would like to see studies on that.

3601
03:01:23,500 --> 03:01:26,000
The problem is it's really painful.
Axondria,

3602
03:01:26,070 --> 03:01:28,930
same phone for that real.
That sits in your feet.

3603
03:01:29,350 --> 03:01:31,360
Yeah,
I like to see studies on that.

3604
03:01:31,361 --> 03:01:32,680
I don't know if that's really been 
proven.

3605
03:01:32,681 --> 03:01:34,290
If that was really proven.
Look,

3606
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:36,580
there's.
There's ways to raise it.

3607
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:37,733
You know.
The chick I was with for years told me 

3608
03:01:40,270 --> 03:01:42,760
different case studies that she had been
involved in.

3609
03:01:43,390 --> 03:01:44,470
Yeah.
She called me.

3610
03:01:44,471 --> 03:01:47,500
A guy came in once that found the 
younger girlfriend.

3611
03:01:47,560 --> 03:01:48,393
His wife passed and they found the 
younger girlfriend and he couldn't keep 

3612
03:01:50,531 --> 03:01:51,364
up and he couldn't keep up,
so he came into the car and she did a 

3613
03:01:54,251 --> 03:01:55,930
bunch of stuff and put them on a t.

3614
03:01:56,690 --> 03:01:59,290
He came back a week later and said,
turn that shit off.

3615
03:02:00,260 --> 03:02:04,060
Dick will not shut down like.
But she told me,

3616
03:02:04,061 --> 03:02:06,400
she goes,
I could raise your testosterone levels,

3617
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:09,430
but it has to be needling for your feet.
Yeah,

3618
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:11,380
you're going to find that a little bit 
uncomfortable.

3619
03:02:11,410 --> 03:02:12,243
And I was like leaving.
I don't want to fucking walk around all 

3620
03:02:15,611 --> 03:02:19,330
this stuff that we're talking about,
whether it's hormone replacement therapy

3621
03:02:19,331 --> 03:02:21,080
or squats or deadlifts,
are all these.

3622
03:02:21,160 --> 03:02:24,730
All these things will help hormone 
replacement therapy helps them.

3623
03:02:25,850 --> 03:02:28,330
The thing about this kind of a 
competition that we're doing now,

3624
03:02:28,510 --> 03:02:32,740
we're not doing anything that you need 
massive amounts of testosterone.

3625
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:36,180
What this is about is willpower 
willpower for a month,

3626
03:02:36,220 --> 03:02:37,320
30 days.
So totally.

3627
03:02:37,350 --> 03:02:42,130
But a lot of it is discipline and 
willpower and if that has any advantage,

3628
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:43,093
it's that I have a gym in my house and I
have a gym in my studio and I run with 

3629
03:02:47,531 --> 03:02:51,250
my dog almost everyday in the hills and 
I've been doing that for years.

3630
03:02:51,610 --> 03:02:53,860
I've been taking that dog running since 
he was six months old.

3631
03:02:54,430 --> 03:02:56,140
He runs in the hills with me all the 
time.

3632
03:02:56,141 --> 03:02:58,240
You Fall in love with running.
I love it.

3633
03:02:58,720 --> 03:02:59,860
You know why I love it,
Joey,

3634
03:02:59,890 --> 03:03:04,890
here's a big thing because it makes me 
feel better in terms of my mental state.

3635
03:03:06,220 --> 03:03:09,280
Like I'm happier when I run all the time
this whole month.

3636
03:03:10,180 --> 03:03:13,480
I'm fucking,
I feel great and I don't just feel great

3637
03:03:13,481 --> 03:03:18,150
because I'm not smoking pot like I made.
Maybe that's helped.

3638
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:19,053
Maybe that's good in some way.
Maybe it's good to not smoke pot even 

3639
03:03:22,320 --> 03:03:23,153
though I enjoy it.
Maybe it's not good to smoke as much as 

3640
03:03:24,431 --> 03:03:25,430
I do.
You're going to smoke now?

3641
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,580
Thursday morning?
Uh,

3642
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:29,440
I don't know.
No.

3643
03:03:29,441 --> 03:03:31,600
Thursday I'm flying to New York.
I probably won't smoke.

3644
03:03:31,660 --> 03:03:33,250
I mean I might smoke a little over the 
weekend.

3645
03:03:33,251 --> 03:03:37,180
I'm going to play some pool.
My boy Tommy junior down in New York.

3646
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:39,910
Um,
but the,

3647
03:03:39,911 --> 03:03:42,140
um,
what the thing that really helps because

3648
03:03:42,150 --> 03:03:42,983
I'm,
I'm doing insane amounts of exercise 

3649
03:03:45,070 --> 03:03:45,903
hours and hours of exercise a day.
You don't give a fuck about normal 

3650
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:52,780
bullshit.
Like all the chatter,

3651
03:03:52,810 --> 03:03:55,630
all the negative chatter in your head.
That shit goes away.

3652
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:57,890
It doesn't exist.
I don't care.

3653
03:03:58,250 --> 03:04:00,920
I'm super calm.
No anxiety.

3654
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:05,300
Anxiety goes away.
I think I'm not a depressed person.

3655
03:04:05,330 --> 03:04:06,163
I don't suffer from depression,
but we had Tyson fury on the podcast 

3656
03:04:11,150 --> 03:04:11,870
listening.
Yeah.

3657
03:04:11,870 --> 03:04:13,790
Amazing.
Amazing.

3658
03:04:13,820 --> 03:04:16,070
He's a fucking.
He's a brave man.

3659
03:04:16,071 --> 03:04:20,640
The way he opened up about her,
I read the comments and what not held up

3660
03:04:20,660 --> 03:04:22,870
about his suicidal thoughts and 
depression.

3661
03:04:22,990 --> 03:04:24,030
That goal,
that helps.

3662
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:26,840
It doesn't just help.
It helps fucking tremendous.

3663
03:04:26,841 --> 03:04:28,700
If I.
If I found a drug,

3664
03:04:28,701 --> 03:04:30,950
if a doctor put me on medication,
I was like,

3665
03:04:31,220 --> 03:04:32,150
doc,
I'm fine.

3666
03:04:32,151 --> 03:04:33,410
I'm happy.
Everything's good.

3667
03:04:33,411 --> 03:04:34,244
The doctors like,
I would just like you to just try this 

3668
03:04:35,661 --> 03:04:37,880
for a while and tell me,
tell me how it makes you feel.

3669
03:04:38,180 --> 03:04:39,013
Just put me on something and I had to 
take a pill a day and I felt as good as 

3670
03:04:42,021 --> 03:04:43,670
I feel right now,
sitting in front of you.

3671
03:04:43,840 --> 03:04:44,960
I would be like,
wow,

3672
03:04:44,961 --> 03:04:48,860
you were right.
I feel better with this exists,

3673
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:51,980
but it only gets you through discipline 
and nobody.

3674
03:04:51,981 --> 03:04:52,814
You can't give someone something that 
forces them to work out almost every 

3675
03:04:57,351 --> 03:04:59,510
fucking day.
I worked out this month.

3676
03:04:59,511 --> 03:05:03,920
I didn't want to do it almost every day.
The only thing that kept me doing it is

3677
03:05:04,350 --> 03:05:06,490
going a double with Joel does

3678
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:09,850
all that.
That got me angry,

3679
03:05:09,940 --> 03:05:12,450
that got my competitive juices stirred 
and just the.

3680
03:05:12,520 --> 03:05:16,780
The idea that these guys I've been 
working out my whole life,

3681
03:05:17,230 --> 03:05:18,063
these guys barely work out like they're 
going to beat me in some sort of a 

3682
03:05:19,820 --> 03:05:21,580
fitness competition that involves 
willpower.

3683
03:05:21,581 --> 03:05:23,440
I'm like,
that's not going to happen.

3684
03:05:23,710 --> 03:05:26,470
I'm going to put in more time than you.
I'm just going to.

3685
03:05:27,430 --> 03:05:31,000
But all that aside,
when I did do it,

3686
03:05:31,150 --> 03:05:34,390
just doing it,
I feel fucking fantastic.

3687
03:05:34,460 --> 03:05:35,390
Well,
member of the tapes,

3688
03:05:35,391 --> 03:05:38,730
you made a man in the house of Blues.
You were concerned.

3689
03:05:38,870 --> 03:05:40,360
I was like,
I don't want to live no more.

3690
03:05:41,330 --> 03:05:43,490
I wasn't working out.
Yeah,

3691
03:05:43,880 --> 03:05:44,713
no.
I do something four days a week minimum 

3692
03:05:46,971 --> 03:05:47,804
since I've been on weight watchers.
I didn't hit the plateau one week 

3693
03:05:50,330 --> 03:05:51,163
because I was on antibiotics.
I got a rash on my leg and so when I 

3694
03:05:54,021 --> 03:05:56,630
left there I felt a little weird,
but I still did everything else.

3695
03:05:56,690 --> 03:06:00,930
It's hard to exercise on antibiotics.
I felt that lifting squats,

3696
03:06:01,130 --> 03:06:02,730
I had to stop.
We stopped,

3697
03:06:03,380 --> 03:06:04,570
so I,
I in fact,

3698
03:06:04,580 --> 03:06:05,840
that went off the air.
I was like,

3699
03:06:05,841 --> 03:06:06,674
I can't live this.
Very few things that will kill your 

3700
03:06:08,121 --> 03:06:08,954
system.
I can't.

3701
03:06:09,450 --> 03:06:10,283
I couldn't do it,
and that that's a real wake up call for 

3702
03:06:12,711 --> 03:06:15,080
people that don't understand the 
benefits of probiotics

3703
03:06:15,750 --> 03:06:19,930
was probiotics,
like taking acidophilus or eating Kimchi

3704
03:06:19,940 --> 03:06:21,670
or in eating,
anything that's going to help your,

3705
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:25,190
your microbiome.
It's so beneficial to your,

3706
03:06:25,290 --> 03:06:27,590
your wellbeing,
to the way you feel,

3707
03:06:27,620 --> 03:06:28,453
the way your health is,
your vitality and all that stuff is 

3708
03:06:31,041 --> 03:06:31,874
connected.

3709
03:06:32,290 --> 03:06:34,450
I like yogurt.
Yogurt's fucking grateful.

3710
03:06:34,451 --> 03:06:36,550
I Love Yogurt.
Yogurt a lot.

3711
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:38,440
I don't like the Greek as much as the 
other one.

3712
03:06:38,441 --> 03:06:41,440
I get the low point one.
I'm a cheap guy.

3713
03:06:41,500 --> 03:06:45,040
I eat that shit every day.
I love that shit juice,

3714
03:06:45,580 --> 03:06:47,860
but you got to watch the sugar in that 
one.

3715
03:06:48,580 --> 03:06:49,320
Oh,
Kombucha.

3716
03:06:49,320 --> 03:06:50,153
You got to watch the sugar in that.
I guess I got a two point can put you 

3717
03:06:53,470 --> 03:06:55,210
for eight ounces.
That's not bad.

3718
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,230
It's not bad.

3719
03:06:56,230 --> 03:06:58,740
It's not bad at all.
Beneficial though.

3720
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:01,410
Very beneficial.
Can Be [inaudible] fucking amazing.

3721
03:07:01,411 --> 03:07:05,460
It's really good at avoiding sicknesses,
but with this exercise,

3722
03:07:05,461 --> 03:07:08,220
the amount of exercise that I'm doing,
I'll drink bottles of that shit.

3723
03:07:08,221 --> 03:07:09,054
I don't worry about nothing that there's
a lot of benefit in that to me just to 

3724
03:07:12,061 --> 03:07:14,910
be able to eat whatever the fuck I want.
I mean,

3725
03:07:15,410 --> 03:07:17,700
I had been eating everything in front of
me,

3726
03:07:17,701 --> 03:07:18,534
man this whole month.
I mean I've doubled how much food I eat 

3727
03:07:22,470 --> 03:07:25,230
because eating fucking.
It's crazy.

3728
03:07:25,231 --> 03:07:27,270
How much longer you got to watch 
everything.

3729
03:07:27,900 --> 03:07:29,220
I get it.
I get,

3730
03:07:29,221 --> 03:07:30,054
I don't touch me.
What I'm doing is not sustainable that 

3731
03:07:32,281 --> 03:07:33,750
night.
Salmon's good.

3732
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:38,840
I do a lot of chicken breast and my meat
intake is cut just to a third.

3733
03:07:39,540 --> 03:07:41,940
I don't agree with you.
I didn't take any more,

3734
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:43,433
especially at night.
I don't fuck with that shit at night no 

3735
03:07:45,571 --> 03:07:45,900
more.

3736
03:07:45,900 --> 03:07:48,240
If I eat meat,
it's maybe three times a week.

3737
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:51,630
Don't get me wrong.
I still crave a fucking stake,

3738
03:07:51,631 --> 03:07:54,000
but if I take my wife out on the day 
through the state,

3739
03:07:54,001 --> 03:07:54,834
the first thing I'd do with color and I 
save it for the next day for breakfast 

3740
03:07:58,291 --> 03:08:00,100
or some.
Nothing wrong with that kid.

3741
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:04,800
Meet early in my day,
let it digest by the time the end of the

3742
03:08:04,820 --> 03:08:05,491
night,
no more,

3743
03:08:05,491 --> 03:08:07,550
no mas,
no money funded.

3744
03:08:07,570 --> 03:08:09,300
They will talk.
When your mother was visiting,

3745
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:10,813
you and I were talking about the talents
that they can be passed after that they 

3746
03:08:14,761 --> 03:08:16,770
lose their mind.
You know,

3747
03:08:16,771 --> 03:08:19,560
as you get older you lose things,
you just can't eat them.

3748
03:08:20,010 --> 03:08:20,843
And I've had,
I think Sebastian told me the gravy 

3749
03:08:22,540 --> 03:08:25,920
bothersome and my Buddy Jersey was 
hysterical.

3750
03:08:25,930 --> 03:08:26,763
He's like,
I can't even walk past a pizza place 

3751
03:08:28,230 --> 03:08:29,400
Domo.
Well,

3752
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:32,580
it's don't lap the feet.

3753
03:08:32,590 --> 03:08:34,050
Gout,
gout,

3754
03:08:35,430 --> 03:08:38,430
gout from sauce,
from the acidity and the source.

3755
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:39,900
People get it from wine.
You know?

3756
03:08:39,901 --> 03:08:40,734
It used to be called like emperors 
disease because people would just sit 

3757
03:08:43,921 --> 03:08:47,700
around and drink wine when they were 
rich was a rich person's disease.

3758
03:08:47,701 --> 03:08:51,170
Way Back in the day is one bad.
No one's good for you.

3759
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:54,000
Why is that balance good for you?
Everything's bad and access.

3760
03:08:54,001 --> 03:08:55,140
Access,
you know what I mean?

3761
03:08:55,141 --> 03:08:57,930
Sugar is terrible and access you have,
you know,

3762
03:08:58,320 --> 03:09:02,790
like the rock eats like a fucking plate 
of cookies one day a week.

3763
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:04,073
Nothing wrong with that.
Nothing wrong with a day where you fuck 

3764
03:09:06,901 --> 03:09:08,070
off.
Have a cheat meal.

3765
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:09,473
Something wrong with that.
As long as the majority of your diet is 

3766
03:09:11,491 --> 03:09:13,680
healthy,
the majority of your diet should consist

3767
03:09:13,681 --> 03:09:17,760
of leafy green vegetables,
healthy fats,

3768
03:09:17,970 --> 03:09:19,650
healthy meat,
you know,

3769
03:09:19,651 --> 03:09:24,190
grass fed,
white fuck you pussies egg whites.

3770
03:09:24,810 --> 03:09:27,770
I Yo,
motherfucker.

3771
03:09:28,050 --> 03:09:29,580
One of our sponsors.
What was it?

3772
03:09:29,581 --> 03:09:31,800
The egg sponsor?
They,

3773
03:09:31,810 --> 03:09:33,840
uh,
forget the sponsor,

3774
03:09:33,870 --> 03:09:35,100
but they,
they,

3775
03:09:35,170 --> 03:09:39,720
they give you,
they sell actual cage free eggs.

3776
03:09:39,780 --> 03:09:40,613
People say cage free,
but they're all fucking jammed in 

3777
03:09:42,481 --> 03:09:44,010
together.
They might as well be in a cage.

3778
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:45,630
What is it?
Farms.

3779
03:09:45,780 --> 03:09:47,530
Spell it.
Vital farms bit.

3780
03:09:47,540 --> 03:09:51,300
All right.
Vital farms and they'll the eggs,

3781
03:09:51,330 --> 03:09:56,290
they have our fucking dark orange yolk.
That robust yoke,

3782
03:09:56,291 --> 03:09:57,124
they taste better than tastes better.
That's because those chickens see that 

3783
03:09:59,470 --> 03:10:00,303
shit.
That's what a fucking eggs that the 

3784
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:03,153
chickens are.
They still giving you great eggs also 

3785
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:06,840
and they haven't been given me 
excellently.

3786
03:10:06,940 --> 03:10:09,300
I began like a couple of eggs a day.
At the moment.

3787
03:10:09,310 --> 03:10:11,320
This is a company that sponsors you?
Yeah,

3788
03:10:12,430 --> 03:10:13,340
my chickens.
Again,

3789
03:10:13,341 --> 03:10:16,690
the old man just no send jc house.
Well,

3790
03:10:16,710 --> 03:10:21,490
I don't know the store.
I recognize that.

3791
03:10:22,210 --> 03:10:23,043
I think they're just selling a store,
but you know they have services that 

3792
03:10:25,991 --> 03:10:27,670
will deliver stuff from stores to your 
house.

3793
03:10:27,670 --> 03:10:29,200
Now,
how crazy is that?

3794
03:10:29,201 --> 03:10:31,330
Cubans eat eggs.
Fried eggs.

3795
03:10:31,331 --> 03:10:33,340
I'm white rice.
That's good.

3796
03:10:33,360 --> 03:10:35,370
She's Christ.
Eggs are fantastic.

3797
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:38,410
They break the Yolk on the fried rice,
white rice,

3798
03:10:38,530 --> 03:10:39,730
white rice.
I love it.

3799
03:10:39,760 --> 03:10:43,120
And then the other Cuban thing is white 
rice with a steak on top.

3800
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:45,650
I love it.
With two eggs on top of that.

3801
03:10:45,810 --> 03:10:48,220
And you're supposed to bring what they 
call it.

3802
03:10:48,221 --> 03:10:50,340
Whole eggs on horseback.
We're welcome.

3803
03:10:50,350 --> 03:10:51,310
How are you?
Oh,

3804
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:55,120
where are your eggs on horseback.
That's gusting.

3805
03:10:55,430 --> 03:10:56,950
You're talking about.
Sounds amazing.

3806
03:10:56,980 --> 03:10:59,720
Oh my God.
When that yolk breaks over the stakes,

3807
03:11:00,410 --> 03:11:03,370
what are you saying that especially over
white rice?

3808
03:11:04,070 --> 03:11:06,160
Christ.
I eat steak and eggs all the time.

3809
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:07,720
I love staking legs,
but I got.

3810
03:11:07,721 --> 03:11:10,300
I got to watch the fuck did a once a 
week.

3811
03:11:10,930 --> 03:11:14,560
Once every 10 days I can't eat,
I can't eat fucking pancakes,

3812
03:11:15,730 --> 03:11:16,563
pancakes.
I can have one from cases and just a 

3813
03:11:19,031 --> 03:11:19,864
bunch of bread.

3814
03:11:20,140 --> 03:11:20,973
It's just bread,
but they had the heart hardy oats ones 

3815
03:11:23,470 --> 03:11:26,650
with a little bit of a one,
two zero calorie maple syrup.

3816
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:28,170
Well,
you know when you can get.

3817
03:11:28,180 --> 03:11:31,450
There's a company called no foods,
k n o w foods,

3818
03:11:31,451 --> 03:11:35,290
and they make a fucking.
They make waffles that are like,

3819
03:11:35,950 --> 03:11:38,140
I don't know what they use.
Almond flour or something like that.

3820
03:11:38,141 --> 03:11:40,420
They taste good.
Low carb,

3821
03:11:40,540 --> 03:11:41,373
very low sugar.
They fucking tastes fantastic and they 

3822
03:11:44,051 --> 03:11:47,950
have a zero sugar syrup that tastes 
great.

3823
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:49,173
I'll put melted butter on those 
motherfuckers in that zero sugar syrup 

3824
03:11:53,021 --> 03:11:56,000
and eat that shit.
Fucking shake tastes good.

3825
03:11:56,210 --> 03:12:01,030
Zero Sugar Syrup from match and you eat 
it.

3826
03:12:01,031 --> 03:12:02,980
You don't feel bad.
It tastes good.

3827
03:12:03,010 --> 03:12:05,440
It tastes really fucking and when it's 
over,

3828
03:12:05,441 --> 03:12:08,620
you don't feel like a fucking like you 
got hit with an insulin dark.

3829
03:12:09,070 --> 03:12:12,040
You don't feel like that feeling that 
you get when you eat.

3830
03:12:12,041 --> 03:12:17,041
Like real waffles with real sugar.
I never got never got shit as a kid.

3831
03:12:19,570 --> 03:12:22,600
An hour later you barely can walk.
Not with these,

3832
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:24,040
these,
these fucking things.

3833
03:12:24,041 --> 03:12:27,930
You feel fantastic.
Joey Diaz,

3834
03:12:27,950 --> 03:12:29,680
your Netflix special.
It's out tomorrow.

3835
03:12:29,681 --> 03:12:31,810
Right tomorrow.
Jesus Christ.

3836
03:12:32,170 --> 03:12:33,610
I put up a thing that,
uh,

3837
03:12:33,611 --> 03:12:37,120
our boy Michael Klein,
made from one by one podcast.

3838
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:42,780
Can't play a man's standing in front of 
him.

3839
03:12:42,850 --> 03:12:45,910
Traveling medical problems looking at 
myself.

3840
03:12:45,970 --> 03:12:47,920
But I like the clip.
The clip looks good.

3841
03:12:48,040 --> 03:12:48,970
Yeah,
it's funny.

3842
03:12:49,390 --> 03:12:52,250
It's funny.
I'm very thankful

3843
03:12:52,250 --> 03:12:54,710
of Netflix or given me the half hour,
you know,

3844
03:12:55,370 --> 03:12:59,150
I just feel at times like I didn't do 
really well on the show.

3845
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:01,790
Like I felt like I found it hard on 
yourself.

3846
03:13:01,791 --> 03:13:03,200
You're an artist.
No,

3847
03:13:03,230 --> 03:13:04,970
but you know,
I felt like and not to be,

3848
03:13:04,971 --> 03:13:06,080
try to be cute.
It's funny,

3849
03:13:06,081 --> 03:13:06,914
like when you see Ron,
they get kicked and she was sitting 

3850
03:13:09,270 --> 03:13:12,830
there for the first three minutes.
She was upset about the cake.

3851
03:13:12,831 --> 03:13:13,664
But you also said about the training.
You see all the holes in your training 

3852
03:13:17,151 --> 03:13:17,984
where you made mistakes,
little mistakes you made even two weeks 

3853
03:13:20,421 --> 03:13:22,910
ago in Canada went down for a couple 
minutes.

3854
03:13:22,911 --> 03:13:23,744
He was just sitting there.
He's not thinking about the $30 million 

3855
03:13:26,021 --> 03:13:27,200
he made.
There's nobody.

3856
03:13:27,530 --> 03:13:29,690
You're telling them about the mistakes 
that got you there,

3857
03:13:29,750 --> 03:13:30,583
you know,
and it was weird that I didn't think I 

3858
03:13:33,471 --> 03:13:36,530
did that well.
And then Netflix special,

3859
03:13:36,531 --> 03:13:39,270
I guess personally I want to do better,
you know,

3860
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:41,113
but it.

3861
03:13:41,150 --> 03:13:45,770
But ever since that you can't ever.
Since you're a July to June 30th,

3862
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:49,290
I have been a different level.
Was a standup comic.

3863
03:13:49,340 --> 03:13:51,650
I went back to the Mitzi shore 
technique.

3864
03:13:52,850 --> 03:13:56,120
I don't give a fuck and 55,
we don't like me.

3865
03:13:56,121 --> 03:13:59,990
I don't give a fuck if I offend you.
I really don't give a fuck.

3866
03:14:00,020 --> 03:14:04,580
This is who I am and that's it.
I've been having some tremendous sets in

3867
03:14:04,581 --> 03:14:07,070
the original benefit of doing these 
things.

3868
03:14:07,071 --> 03:14:09,320
I don't give a fuck the benefit of doing
these specials.

3869
03:14:09,321 --> 03:14:10,154
As you grow it,
abandoned all the material and then you 

3870
03:14:12,441 --> 03:14:15,880
forced to regroup and you forced to look
at the material and look at your set,

3871
03:14:16,190 --> 03:14:18,380
see what you don't like.
Some people never do that,

3872
03:14:18,381 --> 03:14:20,030
Joe,
and they never grow because of that.

3873
03:14:20,060 --> 03:14:23,060
It's just.
But the growth I've had since June four,

3874
03:14:24,230 --> 03:14:27,750
I feel like Dustin Puri and Max Holloway
together,

3875
03:14:27,800 --> 03:14:30,520
like I see it like in the original room.

3876
03:14:30,520 --> 03:14:33,290
Now I'm back to rear for him.
Like I finally,

3877
03:14:33,530 --> 03:14:37,850
I had a watch.
I just just got in my head.

3878
03:14:37,940 --> 03:14:41,250
I had a watch couple,
I had some Red Fox specials.

3879
03:14:42,010 --> 03:14:46,520
I cop a couple of they bruce bachelor's.
I went back to my favorite.

3880
03:14:46,521 --> 03:14:47,354
I got all the vinyl from Richard Pryor 
and I went back and listened to what I 

3881
03:14:49,941 --> 03:14:53,060
came to the conclusion that what was I 
giving a fuck about?

3882
03:14:53,780 --> 03:14:56,840
I can't give a fuck about audiences.
This is who the fuck I am.

3883
03:14:57,440 --> 03:14:58,273
I'm going to unleash the wrath of 
fucking God on you and we come out of 

3884
03:15:02,481 --> 03:15:04,370
here.
We'll see what the fuck it is.

3885
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:05,453
You know,
the worst thing I did was a week before 

3886
03:15:08,210 --> 03:15:10,670
Jim Norton says something that kind of 
bothered me.

3887
03:15:10,671 --> 03:15:11,504
Once I understood after he said it,
he said he didn't watch people specials 

3888
03:15:16,790 --> 03:15:18,950
me.
I like watching comedy specials.

3889
03:15:19,460 --> 03:15:20,293
I love watching it.
But the week before my special that the 

3890
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:25,520
worst thing in the world.
I watched John Malaney special,

3891
03:15:26,450 --> 03:15:29,780
who's a great writer,
who's a great writer.

3892
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:33,110
I'm not a great ride.
Everything was me and my energy,

3893
03:15:33,111 --> 03:15:36,770
so I wanted to be John Malaney and 
that's what I felt.

3894
03:15:37,400 --> 03:15:40,820
Looking back now,
now I got it all out of a way.

3895
03:15:40,840 --> 03:15:43,700
I know exactly what the fuck I am and 
you're in trouble.

3896
03:15:43,701 --> 03:15:46,640
I'm taking into murky waters now.
Every show,

3897
03:15:47,240 --> 03:15:50,160
and I'm going to say something to offend
because that's

3898
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:52,320
who I am.
I got to talk this dirty shit.

3899
03:15:52,770 --> 03:15:53,603
You know,
I don't give a fuck what anybody thinks 

3900
03:15:54,721 --> 03:15:55,554
anymore,
but every once in a while my wife calls 

3901
03:15:57,361 --> 03:15:59,190
it joey.
You having a white moment?

3902
03:15:59,640 --> 03:16:00,870
You're not white.
You're Cuban.

3903
03:16:00,871 --> 03:16:03,290
Knock the fuck off.
Like I get headshots.

3904
03:16:03,330 --> 03:16:04,680
My wife's like,
here he goes again.

3905
03:16:05,390 --> 03:16:09,130
Get Snow White moment.
I don't even know.

3906
03:16:09,170 --> 03:16:10,003
No,
I don't have a headshot headshots in 

3907
03:16:11,521 --> 03:16:12,870
decades.
No,

3908
03:16:12,871 --> 03:16:15,100
you don't need them no more.
What do we give a fuck about a headshot.

3909
03:16:15,120 --> 03:16:18,030
She knows.
Will you just share with me offline?

3910
03:16:18,510 --> 03:16:19,800
I don't give a fuck.
Boy,

3911
03:16:19,950 --> 03:16:22,500
you look so you're older now.
I don't give a fuck.

3912
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:23,413
She use it.
Thank you very much for having me break 

3913
03:16:25,340 --> 03:16:27,150
and it's always a pleasure.
Will I see you this week?

3914
03:16:27,770 --> 03:16:31,150
I'll be around this week because I'm.
I'm,

3915
03:16:31,280 --> 03:16:33,420
I've got shit to do before I leave for 
New York.

3916
03:16:33,570 --> 03:16:36,060
I'm not going to be around,
but I'll be around after that.

3917
03:16:36,170 --> 03:16:38,100
Okay.
November first to Tara.

3918
03:16:38,130 --> 03:16:38,820
I love you too,
man.

3919
03:16:38,820 --> 03:16:39,960
Thank you very much.
Pleasure,

3920
03:16:40,120 --> 03:16:41,310
brother.
Always great to see you.

3921
03:16:41,460 --> 03:16:44,880
Always.
So tonight it airs at midnight.

3922
03:16:44,950 --> 03:16:47,130
30 la time.
Yours is the 30th,

3923
03:16:47,250 --> 03:16:50,580
right?
So tonight you can check it out.

3924
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:54,510
I'm live on Netflix.
