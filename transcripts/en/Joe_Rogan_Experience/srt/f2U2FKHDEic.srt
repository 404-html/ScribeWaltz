1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,380
As soon as we go.
Lot five seconds now.

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,650
Josh was just telling me about how he's 
going to start his own cult.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,450
Yeah,
for sure.

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:10,470
Absolutely.
You know,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,670
uh,
everything else,

6
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,340
it seems like fucking work to me.
So yeah,

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,380
starting your own cult,
if you could pull it off.

8
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,110
The key is to not take it too far.
Don't get too crazy,

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,210
you know,
I dunno if I have that ability though,

10
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,440
man.
I'm sitting here wearing,

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
you know,
black metal tee shirts and you know,

12
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,850
listen to the crazy ass music.
I think taking it too far is,

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,360
it's kind of in my nature.
You still driving the muscle car?

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,550
Oh yeah.
Every day,

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,580
man.
All about muscle cars.

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,630
All Muscle car plus in this traffic 
still drives a manual.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,460
Yeah.
That's Gangsta six speed.

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,030
It sets your method number one method of
transportation.

19
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,450
If you're driving a man respect drive,
a manual transmission,

20
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,410
fucking Orange County.

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,410
You're still in Orange County?
No,

22
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:47,620
no,
no,

23
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:47,751
no,
no,

24
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:47,911
no,
no.

25
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:49,390
I've been out of Orange County for a 
while.

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,550
I was in downtown for a while and then,
uh,

27
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,384
and I live in Hollywood,
like a vampire kind of also getting a 

28
00:00:56,551 --> 00:01:00,420
lot of extra sparring and Hobos and 
knives and stuff like that.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,433
Oh,
were you in like the bad area of 

30
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:03,540
downtown is there?
Well,

31
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,374
you know what,
here's the thing about the bad area of 

32
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,294
downtown.
It doesn't stay in the bad area of 

33
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,640
downtown.
You know it,

34
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,330
it's like,
oh well this is a really nice,

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,193
oh,
we got a quaint little lofts and loud 

36
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,061
died.
It's like,

37
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,120
by the way,
you see that schizophrenia crack head,

38
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,700
he's going to fuck your shit up.
You know,

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,240
it's like Hancock Park,
you know where Hancock Park is?

40
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,133
Hancock quark is fucking amazing.
It's like one of the most beautiful 

41
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,834
sexual urges.

42
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,350
But you can go two blocks down and you 
got gang graffiti,

43
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,690
like,
like two blocks down.

44
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
You're in some sketchy area.
Like as soon as you get out and you 

45
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,014
start going east further,
like you get some fucking sketchy 

46
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,604
neighborhoods within a mile of these,
like 1920s mentions of old Hollywood 

47
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,910
money mean those things are incredible.
Right.

48
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,100
And to me it's just like,
wow,

49
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,920
it's the most fantastic tourist guide 
ever.

50
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:53,461
Like,
Hey,

51
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,294
come to la,
you might get fucked or you might not 

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,650
sleep.
Roll the dice.

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,210
Let's see how this works out.
Yeah.

54
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:03,480
If you want to walk through downtown La,
you could,

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,720
you could take a wrong turn and a 
walking dead episode.

56
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,700
You could be just strolling down 
seventh,

57
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,743
everything's looking great.
You're passing uh oh seven grand and 

58
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,810
Malo and all this stuff and then all of 
a sudden,

59
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,300
Oh shit,
where the hell am I?

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,030
That guy's got a tent,
but I don't really think he's camping.

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,210
He people who think that their downtown 
is fucked up,

62
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,073
you don't even know what fucked up is.
You need to see skid row like people 

63
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,120
don't see,
I've shown people skid row and they go,

64
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,970
that's not real.
It looks fake as fuck.

65
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,380
It looks like an episode of the walking 
dead.

66
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,350
And the first time I drove through it 
and there was like some,

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,260
and I'm seeing all these just people 
just,

68
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:42,990
just milling about and it must have been
later in the night,

69
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:47,910
like not super late but getting to 
probably six or seven or it's because at

70
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:48,744
some point there there's this mission or
something down there and it's got this 

71
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,304
gated courtyard and at some point they 
close that gate and there was just 

72
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,304
people inside the courtyard and there 
were people outside of the courtyard 

73
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,620
that was his like clamoring to get into 
this thing and it was just insanity.

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,610
I go,
fuck man,

75
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,620
this is straight out of like some sort 
of dawn of the dead.

76
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,590
If you get in by a certain amount of 
time,

77
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,790
you're locking,
you can stay in there.

78
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,090
Yeah,
I guess whatever.

79
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,943
Shit.
So like some people like they've got to 

80
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,400
get away from the crazy people on the 
street,

81
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
I guess,
or probably get some place to sleep and 

82
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,100
eat and what have you.
You know,

83
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,910
and you know,
it's tell each other psalms.

84
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,950
Isn't it weird that we look at people 
like Dan will go,

85
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,140
yeah,
you're,

86
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,980
you're a loser.
Like all you people,

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,780
we're not going to help you change any 
of the,

88
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,614
it's,
it's easy to do that because to look at 

89
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,160
the situation on a,
on a far more complex level,

90
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,460
you know,
looking for what all the issues that can

91
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,294
write into this.
I mean a majority of these people are 

92
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,600
probably mental health issues.

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,080
So there are crazy to simplify it and 
then they get into these,

94
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,850
let's say drugs come into play or other 
things.

95
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:52,510
I mean,
they just,

96
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,590
they need help,
right?

97
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,020
And there are some people there that 
may,

98
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,854
maybe they are just total fucking down 
and outers that they just gave up on 

99
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:03,490
life in one way or another got hooked on
something or hooked on something else.

100
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,800
But I mean,
at the end of the day,

101
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,390
it's,
it's too easy.

102
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,610
It's much easier for people to just look
at it as like,

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,833
these guys are losers.
There's loses of the system and where 

104
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,790
I'm some sort of a winner.
But I mean they,

105
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,250
in a way,
some of these people were born losers.

106
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,084
Then I guess because they didn't get to 
choose to be born with schizophrenia or 

107
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,910
any of these other sorts of things and 
have childhoods.

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,600
There's a host of factors that plays in 
to someone being like that,

109
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,120
but it's weird how we get to,
someone gets to a certain age,

110
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,340
like you're 35 you were homeless for a,
sorry dude.

111
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,173
Can't help you.
I feel like a 10 if you're 10 on the 

112
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:37,180
street,
homeless will a call.

113
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,220
Come on buddy.
He's a little guy.

114
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,010
Scammed.
Yeah.

115
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,820
Who's just,
who's his parents left him and he didn't

116
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,220
have any food and he's got a really cute
newsboy cap.

117
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,960
It just seems so scrappy,
you know?

118
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,794
I think I'd like to make him my sidekick
and we're going to travel around the 

119
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,740
world with him everywhere.
He's got a bag on the end of a stick.

120
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,311
Yeah.
Yeah.

121
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:56,200
Look at that bindle man.
He's been places.

122
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,830
That was the move that they had.
Here's this is re we're looking at video

123
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,664
right now and what's the name of this 
video pulled up like skid row says 

124
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,110
homeless on skid row in Los Angeles,
all in caps.

125
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,210
And it's fucking crazy.
It's a,

126
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,170
a whole series of homemade tents at 
these people put together.

127
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,030
They've created these like little 
apartments,

128
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,330
a little structures and they're on the 
street and there's,

129
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,220
I mean this is a pretty good video of,
it just shows you how weird it is,

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,233
but it's way crazier at night.
Well it's even this just shows you were 

131
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,750
just looking at one street.
Yeah.

132
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,460
And we're only looking at like a few 
structure.

133
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:36,461
It's like a little square radius of 
streets that encapsulate this,

134
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,750
this,
this area.

135
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,540
And you know,
I mean some people are like,

136
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,171
well,
oh yeah,

137
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,430
it's not really that dangerous.
And I'm like,

138
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,170
well,
I guess it really depends on the person.

139
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,720
I personally,
I wouldn't stroll around down there.

140
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,080
I feel like I'll be all right,
but why increase my likelihood,

141
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,520
you know,
having some sort of issue,

142
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,400
especially if somebody is literally 
crazy,

143
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,423
it's,
it's really not a matter of whether 

144
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,190
they're jerk or

145
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,570
whatever.
It's just they're operating in unstable,

146
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,400
irrational way.
So there's no way to,

147
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,250
uh,
to negotiate that very negotiated,

148
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,960
no way to even know if it's going to 
happen.

149
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,760
Right.
And when someone's completely bonkers,

150
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,070
this some guy doing it on his bike 
through it,

151
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,960
whoa,
that dude's got skills.

152
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,110
Let's get some bike skills.
[inaudible] on the front of his bike,

153
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,650
die death.
See each egg.

154
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,970
Oh,
the bunny pegs in the front.

155
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:24,710
So maybe he could have,
he could pick up a guy.

156
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,593
I grabbed one homeless dude.
He put them on the front and then they 

157
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,110
can go like,
well,

158
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,310
the steering wheel.
That's,

159
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,840
is that an impressive,
that handlebar thing he just did?

160
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,090
That shit's incredible bark.
Yeah.

161
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,980
It's just,
it's not incredible.

162
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,213
I can't do it,
but,

163
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,730
but does that like a standard move,
Josh Barnett?

164
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,170
Uh,
you know,

165
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,640
I do know how to ride a bicycle.

166
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,910
Probably not to the level of this guy 
doing that.

167
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,560
Flipping the bar around.
That's fucking,

168
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,430
that's pretty wild.
It's a,

169
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,410
it's like having a fidget spinner.
This is,

170
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,770
except if you fuck it up,
you're falling down.

171
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,570
You're just eating shit and losing 
teeth.

172
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,270
Yeah.
I don't ride bikes much like that.

173
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,400
Bam.
That shit's incredible.

174
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,330
Camera edit too sure is.
Wow.

175
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,300
We,
oh,

176
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,160
that's pretty slick.
Yeah.

177
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,994
It's a,
it's an interesting dynamic and then 

178
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,470
it's not a simple situation to solve 
either.

179
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,011
Right.
You know,

180
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,260
it's like some people would would easily
just look at it like,

181
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,041
oh,
I'll just get rid of them.

182
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,401
It's like,
well,

183
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,020
you can't just do that with somebody.
I mean,

184
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,020
that's not the way you do it.
Is there a way to reprogram someone?

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,073
I think who,
I forget who the quote was by some 

186
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:31,100
famous dude,
Frederick Douglass,

187
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,323
but he said it's a,
it's much easier to raise good children 

188
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,960
and the repair broken men.

189
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,520
I can believe that.
Yeah.

190
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,420
You know,
we have,

191
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,254
it's,
it's always harder to take a fighter 

192
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,264
with a bunch of bad habits and try to 
cure them of that or reestablish new 

193
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,944
good habits than it is to just start off
teaching them something correct from 

194
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,240
the,
from the fucking get go.

195
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,103
Yeah.
You always see that for whatever reason 

196
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:54,260
with kicking technique if kicking 
technique,

197
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:56,840
like a lot of guys that come from bad 
backgrounds,

198
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,960
they have a really hard time like maybe 
karate to Moy,

199
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:00,794
Tai real hard time transitioning over.
And like I would see it even in 

200
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,784
taekwondo guys that came from a karate 
background didn't understand the 

201
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,920
importance of raising the knee up above 
the hip.

202
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,813
It's like when things got weird,
they couldn't pick their knee up for 

203
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,610
certain kids and it,
it also did,

204
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,670
I guess it would depend a lot on that 
style of cutoff day.

205
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,520
So like one of my guys show her Yamamoto
is a,

206
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,680
he's a junior world champion and kilkee 
when he was the youngest ever to compete

207
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:27,830
in the world open weight tournament at 
18 years old.

208
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,090
And,
uh,

209
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,610
and he was like 190 pounds when he did 
it.

210
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,060
180 and 18 years old.
There's fighting holy shit.

211
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,923
You know,
like your glover test Sherra's and with 

212
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,150
guys like that.
Yeah.

213
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,013
To kilkee shit is crazy too.
When you watch those guys punch full 

214
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,690
blast the body but kick to the head like
not punching to the face.

215
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,660
I don't know where that really came 
about necessarily,

216
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,351
but yeah.
Yeah.

217
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,630
You can kick them full on in the face.
Kneed him in the face.

218
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,010
Crazy things like that.
But don't,

219
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:52,844
don't throw a punch to the face,
but it's like his kicks are pretty 

220
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,070
awesome.
The next level

221
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,690
of taekwondo,
it's like taekwondo.

222
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:58,524
They said you couldn't punch to the face
but you could kick above the waist and 

223
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,370
calc.
Shannon's like,

224
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,950
how about we kick the legs too and elbow
and elbow.

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,160
And I'm like,
okay.

226
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah,
it's better.

227
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,273
It plus it doesn't get stopped as much 
even though taekwondo is supposed to be 

228
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,294
continuous.
Uh,

229
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,840
like Olympic style.
Yeah.

230
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,120
They clench or appoint get scored and 
the raffle kind of,

231
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,851
well,
you know,

232
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,830
there's always these little breaks.
It seemed to happen,

233
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,390
you know?
Yeah.

234
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:22,224
It's,
it's interesting because I always feel 

235
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,114
like for little kids,
especially what's really good about 

236
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:26,964
taekwondo is a same thing that's really 
good about gymnastics and even like 

237
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,280
cheerleading control and flexibility and
yeah,

238
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,050
there's all kinds of readers,
right?

239
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,690
I think taekwondo can be really great 
for that as well.

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,980
Yeah.
I think a lot of,

241
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,020
if you're going to do taekwondo or 
really any,

242
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,883
a lot of these traditional martial arts,
it really depends on that teacher that 

243
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,110
makes,
that makes it or breaks it.

244
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
I mean,
you could have like some old,

245
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,273
uh,
take you on like gnarly old Korean dude 

246
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,674
who was going to teach you how to punch 
to the face and throw people and all 

247
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,570
kinds of stuff,
but maybe gear your competition training

248
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,000
towards the rule set that's allowable,
but,

249
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,210
or you could just have some dude that 
just wants you to flip around and scream

250
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,323
at your points,
which is the most ridiculous almost up 

251
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,494
there with like flopping and soccer,
like flopping and soccer's hit some new 

252
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,360
levels lately.
People think they know that.

253
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,020
I think it's hilarious as some good sent
me one and the guy doesn't even get hit.

254
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,973
The other guy like throws his hand back 
and it doesn't even come near him and 

255
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,100
the guy launches himself through the 
hair rising on the ground.

256
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,090
I've never seen anything like it.
What is it that,

257
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,980
how,
how does one graduate to that position?

258
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,620
You know,
here I'm,

259
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,453
I'm out here,
I'm playing a sport at let's say the 

260
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,384
highest level and I'm competing against 
other incredible athletes and we train 

261
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,814
our asses off and we develop all these 
skill sets and we get so good at 

262
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:48,000
handling a ball with our feet.
And not even for foot fetish stuff,

263
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,950
but,
but just to play this game,

264
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,143
and I'm going to now concede in such,
like completely destroy all the 

265
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,390
toughness,
all the grid,

266
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,380
all the work,
all the,

267
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,570
all the things that I've developed 
mentally to,

268
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,533
to be able to run and kick and do all 
this stuff and build up all these wind 

269
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,114
sprints.
And then I'm just going to see a guy 

270
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:11,880
swat his hand at me and then I'm a fling
myself on the ground and screamed bloody

271
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:14,550
murder.
They w they flap like fish.

272
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,610
I don't they flop around the ground and 
twist and writhing in agony there has,

273
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,514
there's like a mental disconnect that 
has to happen like you must just like 

274
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,990
I'm going to bitch myself out right now.

275
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,790
I'm going to completely just destroyed 
every element of toughness within me.

276
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,893
I think they're just willing to do 
anything to get some sort of an 

277
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:34,980
advantage and I don't know what,
I don't understand soccer.

278
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:35,814
I don't know the rules so I don't know 
what kind of an advantage you would get 

279
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:38,424
if you handle the shots penalty shot,
so you would get like pretty close to 

280
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:41,401
the goal.
Yeah,

281
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,234
they get to,
they get to take a shot on goal or 

282
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,430
something like that.
Pretty sweet.

283
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,040
It is.
That's just too much persuade.

284
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,490
I just couldn't do it.
I think it's worth too much.

285
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,920
I think what you got to do is if 
somebody does you,

286
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,963
if somebody like actually fouls you,
that guy just gets removed and they 

287
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
bring in a new player.
Like it seems pretty simple like this 

288
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,540
panel,
they have reduced the uh,

289
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,720
the element there and in terms of what,
what the reward is,

290
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,613
the risk or an hour,
you see people flopping like penalize 

291
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,120
them 100%.
Yeah.

292
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,950
That guys for a year.
Yeah.

293
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:15,160
You're slowing the game down and you're 
making us look like shit.

294
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,650
So stop.
People are talking about you on podcast,

295
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:19,000
Bro.
That's not good.

296
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,390
You have no idea what happened to that 
game without Mike.

297
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,313
They came.
I've been for the championship of the 

298
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,980
world between the two greatest teams of 
all time.

299
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,300
I don't know about that.
No,

300
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,970
I just know that dude flopping around 
and we saw the Jamie flopped on this.

301
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,590
Preflop get the fuck out of here.
Did they call it flopping?

302
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:38,860
Are we making that up?
They call it flopping and soccer day.

303
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,780
She called it taking a dive.
Oh,

304
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,660
interesting.
Alright.

305
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,573
Alright.
Oh,

306
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,740
oh no way.
Oh my God.

307
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,783
A little bit.

308
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,810
That is hilarious.

309
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,650
Are you kidding?
The Oh my God.

310
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,900
Watch this one.
That is hilarious.

311
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm so hurt.
Oh God.

312
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,680
And the guy standing right there.
That's the thing.

313
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:09,550
You know the ref has to adjust,
which needed to grab.

314
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,830
Did he grab you grabbed his right.
Oh,

315
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,660
now,
now they flop out on his right.

316
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,240
Did he land on his right knee?
Okay.

317
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,860
That guy might have blown his knee out.
Hold on.

318
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,694
Go back to the ref because the ref might
have blown his knee out because I'm 

319
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,080
looking at the way he falls.
Like washed.

320
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,870
Not this guy.
The next guy.

321
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,280
That guy here washes.
Oh no,

322
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,780
he's standing around.
Then he'd just,

323
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,930
he leaps onto the ground one more time.
Oh,

324
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,030
and he starts grabbing his shin.
No,

325
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,923
I think he's grabbing his knee now.
He might have his Shin Guard is fucking 

326
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,280
bullshit.
I mean they have these guys just kind of

327
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,320
flops out of the huddle.
That's ridiculous.

328
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,223
It's almost as if these guys are so 
tuned to any touch that once they feel 

329
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,020
it,
they immediately just,

330
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,630
they die.
They fall down,

331
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:57,210
they cry.
If they're screaming

332
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,103
box,
that's where you get the penalty shot 

333
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,290
and that can literally change the whole 
game.

334
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,920
Oh,
oh.

335
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,590
So people just fall down when they just 
fell on his own right next to him.

336
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,513
Oh,
so they just try to fall down and get 

337
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,460
hurt.
Oh that's hilarious.

338
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,100
So was that the guy just stopped and the
other guy,

339
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,170
we used him as like a tripping mechanism

340
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,393
because if you can get the right card,
you can get a guy taken out of the game 

341
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,050
and then you're at a huge advantage for 
the rest of game.

342
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,860
Like if you could manipulate it ref and 
the MMA fight,

343
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:24,694
which you kind of can I suppose,
but like you can't get the other guy's 

344
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:29,500
Dick cute all the time.
There's definitely rules for that.

345
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,030
And here you just got to trick a guy.

346
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,860
Did you see that?
There's like a I understood of like,

347
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,660
yeah,
we're fucking with the game right now.

348
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,340
We're pretending to be hurt all the 
time.

349
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,410
This is Larry is,
what is the name of this video?

350
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,330
It's like best flops or funny dives of 
2017

351
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,610
2017 funny dives and simulations just 
this year.

352
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,960
Oh,
that's hilarious.

353
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,740
We'll see.
Some of them,

354
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,574
they're exaggerating.
This is not the best edit because some 

355
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,750
of these guys are just getting tripped.
I mean,

356
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,130
they're just falling like that guy's 
just falling like this is stupid.

357
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:01,430
Edit.
Yeah.

358
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,440
Is there also the best athletes of all 
time?

359
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,920
Like the shit.
I be just falling.

360
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,691
Oh,
okay.

361
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:07,010
I see what you're saying there.
Yeah,

362
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,660
but people fall,
you know?

363
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,673
I mean the other ones,
there's so many of these that are like 

364
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,880
that.
That shit is so ridiculous.

365
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,440
Look,
oh my God,

366
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,730
I can't make it.
I mean,

367
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,653
that shit is so funny.
It's like there's a culture of falling 

368
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,270
and pretending you're hurt.

369
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,540
There's a little,
they could be,

370
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,374
I mean,
I don't know if they really are because 

371
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:27,890
it probably takes away from their 
stature as an athlete,

372
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:31,340
but getting in these videos where you're
just getting shown all over the Internet

373
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:31,830
again.

374
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,663
Honestly,
a couple of these were guys doing goofy 

375
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,230
stuff and then laughing about it as like
ha,

376
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,920
I guess it's just what we do.
We pretend to be heard all the time.

377
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,770
And so it's some sort of an accepted 
culture with,

378
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,990
oh my God,
I just falls down.

379
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,070
It's accepted within the culture of 
playing the game.

380
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,933
As much as I can understand now that guy
taking a dive made sense cause he saw 

381
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,280
the other detail and all that.
It's great.

382
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,370
These guys just touched faces and then 
fell to the ground.

383
00:15:58,371 --> 00:15:59,204
Like they get hit with meteors.
There's snipers out there just in the 

384
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,000
audience just picking them off left and 
right.

385
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,340
They just fall down like in agony.
Oh look at this guys.

386
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,980
Like look at this guy just falling down.
What do you do?

387
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:17,030
What you're doing that thing.
Stop doing that.

388
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,710
God,
it's a,

389
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,620
they have to revamp the rules.
Yeah.

390
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,240
Clip.
They've uh,

391
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,470
they started finding people that were 
doing it,

392
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:27,300
but I think they sort of cut back on the
fines.

393
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:30,600
They tried to make it monetarily not a 
good thing to do.

394
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,390
I know Ian Edwards love soccer and I 
love Ian and he's trying to get me to do

395
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,224
a soccer companion,
but I feel like about soccer would I do 

396
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,224
about like speaking Latin?
Like it's just some shit that's just 

397
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:45,490
leftover from a long ass time ago.
It's currently code if we still remember

398
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:46,720
how to do it.
So he,

399
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:47,554
we don't,
we don't want to not know what Latin is 

400
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,810
and like how,
what the word,

401
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:50,644
we don't want to get so confused that we
think this is like some forgotten 

402
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,010
languages,
but uh,

403
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,010
especially since it's within all of our 
scientific,

404
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,300
uh,
tax and all that.

405
00:16:58,301 --> 00:16:59,880
But it's nonsense,
right?

406
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,090
Yeah.
That's nonsense.

407
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:05,050
I would rather than Latin then learn how
to flop out of fake injuries.

408
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,330
I just,
I don't know about that.

409
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,720
But you respect a,
an actual skillful soccer player.

410
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,880
Those guys are awesome athletes.

411
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,861
Actually.
What,

412
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:14,371
what,
what,

413
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:18,880
what makes it so a disappointing is that
I know how good those dudes are.

414
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,100
I know that they must be super talented 
and great,

415
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,203
very skillful and in great shape to then
take to get yourself to that level to 

416
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,410
let's say,
elite level at your sport,

417
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,860
at your skillset.
Jimmy Aldo.

418
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,443
Who?
Josie.

419
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,293
Josie.
Aldo.

420
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,460
Play soccer.
Oh,

421
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm not surprised.
Amazing.

422
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,070
Yeah,
I bet.

423
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,140
Like professional level.
Do you think he would flop?

424
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,100
Nope.
I cannot see that happening.

425
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,170
I don't think so.
That's probably what held him back.

426
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,130
It's too busy throwing low kicks

427
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,761
at the,
instead of,

428
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,594
instead of kicking the ball,
he's just chopping people's legs out 

429
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:53,350
from under him.

430
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,183
Yeah.
There's some video of him playing and 

431
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,730
moving around and he's fucking really 
good.

432
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,070
Which,
where's Aldo?

433
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,310
That ball?
That was him doing the ball flip.

434
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,170
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

435
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,390
Watch this.
Look at that.

436
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,253
We're really,
that's one of the best players in the 

437
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,260
world.
He did it against Neymar.

438
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,043
Now do you think they're just playing 
and having a good time as a charity 

439
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:14,030
match?
Right.

440
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:15,790
Just sticking around but still look at 
this.

441
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,580
I don't think he's just like,
okay guys,

442
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:18,920
like,
look,

443
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,260
ain't running for real,
dude.

444
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:24,430
I have actual games to play.
I'm not blowing out my acl,

445
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,520
like trying not to get pumped by an MMA 
fighter.

446
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,320
Right,
exactly.

447
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:29,921
It's like,
okay,

448
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:30,754
you can have this moment,
but I've seen videos of him practicing 

449
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,544
and playing.
He's like,

450
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,790
like a real professional soccer player 
you're looking at and be like,

451
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,410
wow.
Yeah.

452
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,480
It didn't surprise me in the least I was
that Jose.

453
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah.
He,

454
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,831
he goes,
hey,

455
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:44,560
just he's kicking three pointers in 
where he's trying at least,

456
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,030
hey,
uh,

457
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,150
I would never happen for me.
Never.

458
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,650
I played like little intermural soccer 
and college for a second,

459
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,910
which just like these pickup games with 
all the international kids.

460
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
I just thought it'd be a good way to get
in shape.

461
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,430
I didn't know really much about playing 
soccer,

462
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,240
so he too big a,
I don't know if there's really a too big

463
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,570
around that much.
Well there's also that not good enough.

464
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,650
There's that,
that part too,

465
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,753
when these,
when these dudes from like Scotland and 

466
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:16,800
Argentina and all over who would play 
like all their like triple a leagues and

467
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,800
stuff and I mean I'm out there playing 
defense and I could hustle.

468
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,710
I had quick feet and I wasn't movable so
that was kinda good.

469
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,850
But uh,
you know,

470
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,340
at one point,
uh,

471
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,243
they see my team kept trying to get it.
I get an opportunity for me to score on 

472
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,020
goal and I'm like,
no,

473
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,980
no,
quit.

474
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,080
You know,
I got good enough to dribble and pass it

475
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:34,914
away a little bit.
Don't fucking ask me to kick this thing 

476
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,230
is never going to go where I want it to 
and it's just careening off everywhere.

477
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:43,140
It plus this dude from Argentina was 
just all over me every single time.

478
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm like,
everyone else is like,

479
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:46,110
oh,
it'd be funny if he could be great if he

480
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,420
could get a shot and this guy like fuck 
fat,

481
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,950
I'm going to fucking,
I'm on.

482
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:52,020
I'm like stink on shit.
Am I wrong?

483
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,830
Taking it,
there's like a build that would excel at

484
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:56,560
football,
which you think so?

485
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,610
I could think so.
And then I would think that soccer would

486
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,650
require,
because you run so much.

487
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,543
I would think tall and lanky would be 
good for soccer or even maybe just a 

488
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,850
long leg.
Short torso.

489
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,863
Yeah.
But that messy guys are like really 

490
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,180
small.
Right.

491
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,730
That's just like super fast.
Just being very quick.

492
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,623
Yeah.
It's been very quick and very agile and 

493
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:17,054
being able,
but I was just thinking tall cause then 

494
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:20,320
you could more headers,
more body up,

495
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,220
up top.
Let me ask you this.

496
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,830
As a proponent of violence,
why?

497
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,430
How come rugby never took off here?
That seems to me to be the real sport.

498
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,890
Ah.
You know,

499
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:30,724
I don't really know why.
I think because American football is 

500
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:35,200
American football.
Maybe.

501
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,400
Maybe that's why

502
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,353
seems kind of stupid in a way.
Because you have a helmet on pads and 

503
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:43,364
you're running into each other and we 
already know that that's not a good 

504
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,130
idea.
It isn't.

505
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,100
It actually makes it way worse.

506
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,210
Right.
You can let harder.

507
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,313
They've figured out some new technology,
which I know they're working on some 

508
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,430
packed resist in helmets and things that
which that kind of changes everything.

509
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:58,264
If they do that and they get it to the 
point where guys can collide heads and 

510
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,840
actually be okay.
I don't know.

511
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,630
I don't really think that I just there 
they can get these,

512
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,120
these helmets that are going to take the
impact,

513
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,860
uh,
and reduce it and all that.

514
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,694
But I just,
once you're a 300 pound dude running a 

515
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,740
four,
seven smashing into,

516
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,570
uh,
another 300 pound,

517
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:17,590
dude,
I just don't,

518
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,663
you know,
it's just like I would get in the 

519
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,050
arguments with the,
uh,

520
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,270
with like these kids that,
uh,

521
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,880
at the University of Montana rugby team,
like,

522
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,360
he should come and play rugby.
You should play rugby.

523
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,260
I'm like,
no,

524
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,760
I want to fight.

525
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,040
And you know,
rugby that seems fun and all that,

526
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,760
but,
and well,

527
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,170
it's,
did you play football?

528
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,700
Yeah,
I played football all these way tougher.

529
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:34,570
I go,
AH,

530
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,730
hold on.
Uh,

531
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,080
you,
the pool you're drawing from,

532
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,183
I'm sure there's some good athletes.
The pool we were drawing from when I'm 

533
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:42,904
going to University of Washington 
football camp and when I'm playing 

534
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:45,040
against,
you know,

535
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,420
nationally ranked teams like,
Oh,

536
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,940
day you,
this is different.

537
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,090
Yeah.
We're,

538
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,720
who they're drawn from is a much,
much bigger pool.

539
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,853
The stakes for them are much,
much bigger than you and your college 

540
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,170
team floating around and then drinking 
beers after your games.

541
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,360
This is not like that.
This is a different story.

542
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,733
You especially someone that has a 
potential nfl career and they'll like 

543
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:07,330
super focused.
You know,

544
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,164
if you look at the some of the super 
athletes that you get that entered the 

545
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:16,201
nfl to that just the sheer size and 
speed that these guys have and it's only

546
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,940
so much that can be genetics.

547
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,020
You've got like some serious training 
involvement and dedication.

548
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,940
Like they know how much money's 
involved.

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,833
Exactly.
And there are people that are grooming 

550
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:27,724
these athletes from a super young age to
to meet these requirements and so I was 

551
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:31,630
like,
look,

552
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,210
rugby is super awesome.
It's tough.

553
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,253
It's a great sport.
I like Rugby League way better than 

554
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:41,260
rugby union cause unions got all the 
scrumming and all that.

555
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,960
It slows it down.
It's League is seven tackles.

556
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,220
I believe.
That's all you get.

557
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,630
You got to tell you get,
but you,

558
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,680
you,
it's constant.

559
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,920
You're constantly moving up the field.
What if you go more than seven?

560
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,600
Like what did you don't?
Once you hit seven,

561
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,640
you have to drop the ball and then they 
change is over.

562
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,380
But it moves super fast and it's very 
aggressive and it's just,

563
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,214
you know,
con it's like watching people play 

564
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:03,100
wishbone the whole time.

565
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,410
They just constantly taking each other 
down.

566
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,550
Yeah.
And so,

567
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,540
you know,
they're hitting,

568
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,250
boom,
this tackle happens.

569
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,084
Then they're going to try and shuttle 
the ball back to their other teammate 

570
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,430
and then shovel shoved the ball down the
line again and keep it moving until they

571
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:18,190
can finally break through watching the 
other one.

572
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:22,480
To me it slows down way too much.
So I don't really enjoy it.

573
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,231
Which,
you know,

574
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:25,750
that's Kinda how the argument with 
American football is that it slows down.

575
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,010
And to me,
I'm like American football,

576
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:31,180
I was like watching two armies go at it.
You set,

577
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,500
you have your,
your,

578
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,480
your skirmish,
you regroup,

579
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,980
you skirmish again,
you regroup,

580
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,380
you skirmish again.
And by the end of the,

581
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,930
all these skirmishes,
the war is either is won or lost by this

582
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:41,670
team.
Yeah.

583
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,120
That's the way I look at it.
But,

584
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:43,661
uh,
well,

585
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:44,111
you know,
that was,

586
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,980
it was designed to sort of placate 
people.

587
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,863
What,
that's all games are designed to be a 

588
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,034
diminishing aspect of war.
But American football in particular was 

589
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,960
actually literally like systematically 
designed,

590
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:57,110
like we know the time that it happened.
There's a whole radio lab podcast.

591
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,550
Okay.
It's pretty fascinating,

592
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,384
man.
And about how they ran into problems 

593
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,630
when they let American Indians play with
white kids.

594
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,643
Oh yeah.
The natives are just fucking all the 

595
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:06,704
white kids up.
That's a brutal last games and natives 

596
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,380
did some gnarly shit.
Did they eat their hearts?

597
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,080
That kind of part of the problem.
I don't know what the problem was,

598
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:16,340
but uh,
it was an issue.

599
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,850
That was it.
Again,

600
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,610
it was an issue.
I would,

601
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,870
I would have loved,
you know,

602
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,080
Steve Rinella on recently and he was 
talking about the guys who killed custer

603
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:29,660
and little big horn and one of these 
guys were just this massive guy.

604
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,493
What does the name mall is that they 
called them gall gall and he went on to 

605
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,070
a wild wheels.
He was the Conan book.

606
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:37,391
Right.
Is there,

607
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:40,410
that'd be how cold a conquer.
Yeah.

608
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,253
Take it out.
Right.

609
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,780
But this guy was apparently just massive
and I mean,

610
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,470
I would've loved to have seen that with 
my own eyes.

611
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:52,940
Like would it looks like to be like a 
direct lineage of warrior culture?

612
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,850
Like if that guy was living in the 18 
hundreds,

613
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,893
like he is directly from the original 
native Americans that came here from 

614
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:02,960
Siberia,
you know,

615
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,180
whatever.
Thousands and thousands of years ago,

616
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,920
that would be something,
fuck yeah.

617
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,450
Uh,
chief Seattle,

618
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,280
which my fucking phone don't work.
Fuck it.

619
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,383
Uh,
he had some quote about being at a 

620
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,600
football game at the University of 
Washington.

621
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,434
He was,
and I can't for the life of me remember 

622
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,650
exactly how it goes,
but it was just like,

623
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,513
oh,
it's not a lot of white men fight each 

624
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,374
other today.

625
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,120
I don't know why the hell you guys are 
into this,

626
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,690
but whatever.
Yeah,

627
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,510
they didn't really have like,
like that kind of a game.

628
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,050
There's something uniquely brutal about 
American football.

629
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,740
There is.
Oh,

630
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,970
and I look at rugby,
I'm like,

631
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,610
okay,
that to me seems more realistic.

632
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,130
It is more realistic.
I think in some ways,

633
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,410
um,
I,

634
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:42,160
it's,
it's even,

635
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,110
it's more brutal in some and less than 
others.

636
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,510
Like I came in May versus maybe 
kickboxing.

637
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,171
Yeah.
Well,

638
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,690
and the thing is at one of my arguments 
with the rugby kids is like,

639
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:51,524
dude,
you,

640
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,363
you don't get hit as hard as you do in 
American football as you're doing here 

641
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:55,730
in rugby.
You just,

642
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,863
you're,
you're not,

643
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,173
um,
plus the athletes are smaller and you 

644
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,110
know,
go do a kickoff.

645
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:05,330
Guys,
they talk about fucking insane.

646
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,800
But what would you think would happen if
like what if by some crazy reason people

647
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,970
decided,
hey look,

648
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,060
we're going to no longer do American 
football.

649
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,730
We're going to do rugby,
rugby league,

650
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,233
which is open to regulate.
I don't totally understand the 

651
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,410
difference between the two of them.
I'd have to watch a few games I guess.

652
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:24,290
But those guys who dominate and 
football,

653
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,360
wouldn't you think they would be the 
guys who dominate in rugby?

654
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,223
Yeah,
I do.

655
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,850
Everybody would just get bigger and 
faster and stronger.

656
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,713
Yup.
We'd be just like American level 

657
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:34,940
football players pretty much because 
the,

658
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,881
the,
if,

659
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:37,880
if we're talking that everybody would 
switch over to rugby,

660
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:38,714
that means all these rugby teams in the 
league and all that would then be the 

661
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,160
ones with all the big deals in the TV

662
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
deals and all the,
all the money would funnel into it and 

663
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,394
therefore the potential prosperity of it
would drive the interest for people to 

664
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,230
try and apply there.
Where's it being not only a part of that

665
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,260
hero myth that would come with being a 
champion football team player,

666
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,000
you know,
our rugby team player,

667
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,660
but also with the hero myth of just 
being a part of that within,

668
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,743
you know,
your normal society or of this elite 

669
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
exemption,
exceptional status,

670
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:14,934
this thing that stands alone that it 
seems a bit foreign to your normal 

671
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:18,984
person,
but also the money and the success that 

672
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:26,250
comes from that kind of notoriety and 
the doors that it opens in terms of,

673
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,710
um,
you know,

674
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,580
to use a overused word,
the privilege of being at that level,

675
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:33,414
at,
within that inner circle of exceptional 

676
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,820
or seen as exceptional people.
Anyways.

677
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,480
Do you think?

678
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,620
What's the short drive?
It you've had a long career in mma,

679
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,290
long successful career,
but it's very rare.

680
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,393
It's very rare for someone to be 
operating the same level that you're at 

681
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,920
seven years is the cutoff.
Like once you get to about seven,

682
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,290
everything starts to just rapidly 
decline.

683
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,710
Like he'd just fall to shit.
Do you think it's an injury thing?

684
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,990
Is it a training thing?
Is it just a life thing?

685
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,090
They didn't,
they didn't,

686
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,013
uh,
or at least they weren't able to single 

687
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:08,310
out any particular factor in,
in general.

688
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,173
But you know,
there was a lot of theories as to why 

689
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:15,720
that might be,
but they were able to track professional

690
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,650
fighters,
careers,

691
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,270
uh,
over length of time.

692
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,120
I think they had some metro having,
I don't remember,

693
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:23,130
but it's on the,
it's on the Internet.

694
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,690
Uh,
it,

695
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,030
uh,
I do believe that they have counted,

696
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,923
they were able to account for a number 
of fights too and weigh that against 

697
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,970
that metric and see how that may 
influence things.

698
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,820
But seven years was this magic number,
like six,

699
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
seven years.
And once you start going over seven 

700
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:39,534
years,
your,

701
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,853
your,
your percentage of success started just 

702
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:43,344
crumbling.
Like it was dramatic about how a guy 

703
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,214
would be like 13 and three and he'd get 
to seven years and all of a sudden it's 

704
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,491
like 13,
six,

705
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,031
13,
seven,

706
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:51,864
13.
He just starts losing just about 

707
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,230
everything.
Yeah.

708
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,330
Bj Penn's good example of that.
Right.

709
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,560
You know,
like there's certain,

710
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:02,880
there's a certain drop off where the 
person just looks totally different and,

711
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:05,160
and you know,
we could honestly look,

712
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,433
it would be,
we would have to isolate a lot of 

713
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,660
different factors to figure out any one 
particular thing.

714
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,853
But there's so many elements that go 
into being a professional fighter and 

715
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,070
being successful at that.
And so for let's say we'll take Bj,

716
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,691
you know,
maybe,

717
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:20,910
maybe it is physicality,
maybe he's lost a little bit of a step.

718
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,380
His reactions are a little slower,
uh,

719
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,670
through any number of reasons why maybe 
his,

720
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,910
his strength has diminished maybe 
slightly or it's flexibility,

721
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,923
maybe certain physical elements 
regardless of injury or not have 

722
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,950
diminished enough that at where they 
used to be.

723
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:38,784
It was an edge where it is now is evened
out or is or is below what is necessary 

724
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,540
for him and how he fights to be 
successful.

725
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,643
Uh,
maybe could be beyond physical 

726
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,420
deterioration.
Maybe it's just mental,

727
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,680
uh,
elevation.

728
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,431
Yeah,
exactly.

729
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,264
So maybe he's just not as motivated to 
push in the same ways that he was or 

730
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,670
maybe he's not able to,
uh,

731
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,140
I don't know,
recognize,

732
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,710
uh,
things that he was five years ago,

733
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:08,680
six years ago,
and seeing those opportunities and being

734
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,880
able to react on them quicker.
Uh,

735
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,950
there's a number of things and 
especially when it comes to mental now,

736
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,670
now you're getting into such a 
subjective area that,

737
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:19,921
you know,
go,

738
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:20,890
go,
pull that apart.

739
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,600
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

740
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,690
The mental aspect is a really good point
because who knows,

741
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,570
you know,
the only,

742
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,100
only the person that's competing knows,
we really never have any idea how,

743
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,730
what's going on inside a person's head.
I mean,

744
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,583
for me,
I decided to take a break after my 

745
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,870
Arlovski fight and that was somewhat 
physically based,

746
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,940
but most of it was mental.
I,

747
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,560
uh,
I just didn't,

748
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,813
I had no interest to go into any kind of
training camp to put myself through all 

749
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:49,840
that again to then to fight again.
You know,

750
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,490
it's just for one when you start off 
fighting and what those goals are too,

751
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,940
as you get further in and further in and
further in and,

752
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:58,774
you know,
getting it 20 years of being a 

753
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:00,814
professional fighter and being a top 10 
heavyweight and arguably and top five 

754
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,330
most of the time for Shit,
16 of them,

755
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,980
something like that and high level 
competition and uh,

756
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,843
it's just,
and youngest ever UFC heavyweight 

757
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,220
champion.

758
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,470
That's right.
That was until that,

759
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,373
that son of a bitch,
Jon Jones came and beat me out by a few 

760
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,570
months.
That talented bastard.

761
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,360
Now you're the youngest ever.
Yeah,

762
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,490
just heavyweight champion instead of the
youngest ever UFC champion.

763
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:31,720
But,
um,

764
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,350
it's,
it got to a point where it's just like,

765
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,220
well,
you know,

766
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:39,220
my reasons for fighting are essentially 
still the same,

767
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,083
but all,
I don't have the same motivation to go 

768
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:42,970
out there and be like,
oh,

769
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:44,670
I'm going to conquer the whole world.
I'm fight.

770
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,720
I can beat that guy.
Could be,

771
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,860
I know I could beat guys.
Like it doesn't,

772
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,293
I don't,
I'm not trying to prove it to myself 

773
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,030
anymore,
you know,

774
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,840
but that fire that wants to fight still 
exist.

775
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,621
Just like,
well,

776
00:31:56,621 --> 00:31:57,454
you know what,
I'm going to take some time to work on 

777
00:31:58,691 --> 00:31:59,524
some of the other stuff that is going to
be more of my life after this because 

778
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,970
fighting is going to end sooner than 
this stuff is.

779
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,710
How old are you now?
39.

780
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,770
Now when you think about,
do you have like a number in your head?

781
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:13,330
Like when I hit 42 or,
no,

782
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,751
no,
no,

783
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,181
no.
I don't,

784
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,014
I don't have anything set like that.
I just figured that if I'm being honest 

785
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:19,630
with myself and self aware,
the,

786
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:23,110
I'll know when that time has come,
when that,

787
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,110
that moment is,
is getting to that,

788
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,023
that edge where if you keep going,
it's gonna fucking it's going to go 

789
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,020
downhill versus okay,
you've got right to that point.

790
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,720
Call it fucking good.
Move on.

791
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,853
And there's still athletic windows open 
to me with grappling and maybe a few 

792
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,270
other in professional wrestling.
Uh,

793
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,770
but,
uh,

794
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,873
fighting is going to be a much shorter 
window and the fact that I've got 20 

795
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:50,924
years out of it or however long that I 
take this to is going to be pretty 

796
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:55,964
phenomenal.

797
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah,
it's pretty incredible.

798
00:32:57,201 --> 00:32:58,940
Are you thinking about doing some more 
grappling?

799
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

800
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,080
I mean I've been approached by a few 
things but uh,

801
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,943
either dollar wise just to really hasn't
made sense or mainly that's just it and 

802
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:09,134
uh,
I feel like it's just one thing that 

803
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,260
people have to figure out as super 
popular and get it until,

804
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,340
or super exciting rather than give it on
television.

805
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,380
So many watches like your match with 
Dean lister,

806
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,693
you know,
you're the first guy to tap out dean 

807
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:22,790
lister and how many years?
Like 17 years or 15 years.

808
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,250
Something crazy.
And you caught them a scarf hold.

809
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,930
Oh yeah,
it had an arm boom.

810
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,800
Judo style.
Yeah,

811
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,190
it's fucking bad ass.
Here's the thing,

812
00:33:31,191 --> 00:33:33,020
I had seen that the last time you'd been
subbed.

813
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,240
Was that really?
Yeah.

814
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,680
So I already knew that and I'm like,
well,

815
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,860
I'm going to put this in my back pocket 
if I need it later on in the match.

816
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,040
And after I've been riding him and 
grinding on him and beating on him.

817
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,680
Once he's huffing and puffing,
I can get it.

818
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,140
I know it's going to be real hard for 
him to stop this.

819
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,270
And so sure enough,
I look up and it's like,

820
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,590
oh shit,
I don't have a lot of time left.

821
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,730
Boom,
hit it.

822
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,410
Go.
And it worked.

823
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah.
And then he run,

824
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,740
gracie was a big feather in your cap to 
because he,

825
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,583
ron is what,
one of the most respected young 

826
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,450
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt guys out 
there.

827
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:06,284
Like he's super respected.
His and defensively like re very tough 

828
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,680
defensively,
didn't,

829
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,200
couldn't tap him.
Uh,

830
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,780
he all those guys like here on Hallock,
uh,

831
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,683
Henner they were all very successful 
when they were competitors and I know 

832
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:21,930
people want it.
Yeah,

833
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,930
they were,
they were kicking butt a fact.

834
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,053
What was it?
Henner tapped Jeff Munson back in the 

835
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,050
day.

836
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,790
I think it was a quick triangle.
So,

837
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,624
uh,
when here on was the only guy that how 

838
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:34,490
it could get to step up and wrestle me.
That was,

839
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,190
that was the option.
There was all these heavyweights and all

840
00:34:37,191 --> 00:34:39,850
these dudes and I'm like,
I found a bunch of guys that had,

841
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,310
I had recently competed and won belts 
and stuff or one tournament like,

842
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:43,701
Hey,
pick,

843
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,780
what about that guy?
Now he's like,

844
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,600
he won't do it back.
I won't do it.

845
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,460
That guy won't do it the whole bunch 
from,

846
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:50,810
I'd be like,
well they won't do it without the G.

847
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,250
And I'm like,
okay,

848
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:53,270
well that's,
you know,

849
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,790
that's not an option.
So why even bring it up?

850
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,813
See that black dude,
really high level Brazilian Jujitsu 

851
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,380
world champion guy who wanted to get in 
there with you.

852
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,890
There have been,
but well no.

853
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,980
Well there are a few like cyborg wanted 
to do it,

854
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:05,540
you know,
but then that's an interesting one guy.

855
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,120
He got interested,
he got injured and so then it was like,

856
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:10,520
well how do we fill that gap?
What kind of injury do you have?

857
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,450
Do you know?
Rib,

858
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,433
I think.
I didn't really look into it too much 

859
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:18,950
for me.
It was just a matter of that matches and

860
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:19,790
happening.
Right.

861
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,960
Move on,
you know,

862
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:21,794
try to salvage this thing.
And so I like to see that match though 

863
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:24,251
in the future.
That would,

864
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:26,000
I think there'll be really interesting.
I could happen.

865
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,620
It could happen.
I trained for it.

866
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:30,470
I felt real confident going into it.
I really wanted it to,

867
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:34,010
because everybody was like,
as soon as I beat Dean,

868
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,210
well the first thing was,
oh,

869
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,770
what an idiot.
He's wearing shoes.

870
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,663
Oh,
that's a dumb is saying he's going to 

871
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:38,990
get his leg tore off.
What?

872
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,770
How he's so dumb.
And then I went,

873
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:41,940
it's like,
what a cheater.

874
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,160
He wore his shoes,
gave him such an advantage.

875
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:45,480
He had so much grip.
Oh,

876
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,640
that's bullshit.
It's like,

877
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,210
which is it?
Oh,

878
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:51,650
he was to 70 and dean was 185 pounds.
Like,

879
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,503
what are you talking about?
I was like two 50 and dean was like two 

880
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:59,500
30 the guy was a big massive,
and people forget he,

881
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,440
he's pretty thick dude.
I remember giving him a hug at the quote

882
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,251
unquote way.
I mean,

883
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,740
we didn't weigh in and I'm like,
Ooh,

884
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,580
this dude is silverbacks status right 
now.

885
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,780
He's huge.
Yeah.

886
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,950
He's a fucking massive guy.
He's strong and talented too.

887
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,630
And so I'm like extremely technical,
very.

888
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,030
And you know to,
to me,

889
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:23,760
I'm seeing all the blue belts going nuts
out there and I'm like,

890
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,890
well,
he's a,

891
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,724
he was a heavyweight too,
so I didn't just go out there and 

892
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,300
outsize him.
You know,

893
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,730
I used my game on him and yeah,
I wrote him heavy.

894
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,260
You know,
butch is a skill to develop,

895
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,580
but um,
you know,

896
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,493
you don't see dean making excuses.
I mean we just went out there and gave 

897
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:40,950
it our best and I was able to beat him 
that day.

898
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,830
Well deems one of the best leg lockers 
in the country.

899
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,723
Yeah,
I mean really it's like super 

900
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:48,070
knowledgeable and when it comes to any 
aspect of Jujitsu,

901
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,983
but in particular leg locks.
And he spent a bunch of Tom on the east 

902
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:52,644
coast at Henzel his place.
And Eddie Bravo said that's sort of 

903
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:56,244
where hens,
those place became like this leg lock 

904
00:36:58,141 --> 00:36:59,700
Mecca.
You think of like Gary,

905
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:02,360
Tony,
planet teens and John Donahoe like,

906
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,150
yeah,
his,

907
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,040
his like what teachings that he lent in 
over there sort of spread.

908
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,013
And now they've,
since Donna her was a real wizard since 

909
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,970
spread it into his own sort of ideas and
philosophies on a task.

910
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,630
That's the thing.
You just never know what can come of,

911
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,523
of any,
even the smallest to largest influence 

912
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,170
allowing that that seed can take place 
anywhere,

913
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,980
but someone may tend to that garden and 
all of a sudden boom,

914
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,720
you know,
a big export,

915
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,930
a big expansion from that idea can come 
from it.

916
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:34,650
And that's,
you know,

917
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,483
one of the great things it was,
that's one of the things that people 

918
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,790
like about you is that you're,
you,

919
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,950
most of the time you're going old 
school.

920
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,200
I mean,
you're doing catch wrestling stuff.

921
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,183
I mean,
you're doing like the shit that Karl 

922
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:46,674
gotch and all those dudes from those uh,
old school wrestling catch wrestling 

923
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,840
books.
Like a lot of those submissions,

924
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,690
you're proven those things to be 100% 
legit.

925
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,370
Yes.
And I,

926
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,960
you know,
I understood,

927
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,003
I understand completely the,
some of the incredulousness about 

928
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,643
looking at that and being like,
that doesn't fucking work because you 

929
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:06,691
think,
well,

930
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:08,220
if it did it would be everywhere.

931
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,420
But for one it's just there's just not 
enough people teaching it.

932
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,800
So that's really diminishes the ability 
to expand it.

933
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:19,360
Although like myself and,
uh,

934
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,333
all the people from the Japanese shoot 
wrestling side that that has come from 

935
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:28,461
like Sakharova and my Fujiwara.
I mean there's nothing that people,

936
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,523
we explained that connection cause it's 
really kind of fascinating that who 

937
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,150
will,
who went over there was it,

938
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,013
it's called [inaudible] Antonio Gnocchi 
to create the new Japan pro wrestling 

939
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,820
Dojo and teach all of his student all,
all of the wrestlers,

940
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,683
how to be catch wrestlers and to give 
them a foundation and basically 

941
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,910
shooting,
which is real fighting.

942
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,040
So then they could go out there and work
these matches,

943
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,680
but keep the intensity,
the realism,

944
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,420
uh,
the,

945
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,510
it's like the difference between,
and I know you're not the biggest fan of

946
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,050
professional wrestling.
How dare,

947
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,770
how dare you,
I dare,

948
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,410
I dare if I had a gauntlet,
I would throw it.

949
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,330
I'm sure there's a gauntlet in here 
somewhere.

950
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:08,850
Look at this fucking place.
Yeah.

951
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,780
Uh,
but,

952
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,920
uh,
you know,

953
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,813
I also understand some of the gripe with
looking at like where the way wrestling 

954
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,770
has been for quite a while now.
It's like,

955
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:18,690
oh,
so it got outed,

956
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,080
right?
So everybody knows it's worked.

957
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,400
So people operate on this premise that 
it's fake.

958
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:26,140
So whatever,
like why bother?

959
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,170
Make it real anymore.
Let's just fake it up all the way.

960
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:31,710
And then people would open up skills and
it would be like if,

961
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,440
if,
uh,

962
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,880
if all magicians were just like,
hey,

963
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,590
look,
all of our tricks,

964
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,870
they're not real.
They're not real magic.

965
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:38,704
Here's how you do them all.
And then I'm going to open up schools 

966
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,320
and just teach everyone,
you know,

967
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:44,800
just pay me 500 bucks for three months.
And now you too can be a magician.

968
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,290
And it's just like,
well,

969
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,530
uh Oh man,
that would ruin going to magic shows.

970
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:54,550
It would just make it so shitty.
But you know,

971
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:57,520
that's how a lot of these,
these guys get into wrestling now.

972
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,354
That would never be restless.
Like to be a wrestler back even in say 

973
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,320
the 70s,
early eighties,

974
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,440
you had to be a fucking tough guy.
Like dusty roads.

975
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,880
You look at him and you're like,
that guy is not tough.

976
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:07,421
You're like,
no,

977
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:12,421
actually he was recruited by the fucking
Miami Dolphins and he was like,

978
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:13,763
ah,
I think I can make more money being 

979
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,150
arrested then I can be in a football 
player back then.

980
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,283
You know,
or ric flair was like a all American or 

981
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,860
college,
Big Time College football player.

982
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,220
And he went and trained under a vern 
Ganja and uh,

983
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,590
Billy Robinson at the,
at this barn out in Minnesota somewhere.

984
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,973
And they would have to run miles and 
lift weights and do squats and wrestle 

985
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:36,760
each other for real.

986
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,250
And it's just like all these dudes,
you think it's like,

987
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:39,921
oh yeah,
Woo.

988
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:40,754
And all that.
These motherfuckers had to go through 

989
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:43,414
some real shit and they had to prove 
themselves to be legitimately tough 

990
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:47,254
enough to be even a professional 
wrestler to work matches and they used 

991
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,040
to hold do things like hold tryouts and 
people would come down,

992
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,820
they paying their money.
Then these wrestlers would just run them

993
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,040
into the ground and then all right,
whoever's left,

994
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,770
whoever could get through the endurance 
part of this,

995
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,604
okay now you're going to get in the ring
with some dude and then they would just 

996
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,650
get the shit tortured out of them.
The APP,

997
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,670
you know,
just totally ripped apart and then like,

998
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:10,600
all right,
cool bye.

999
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,390
He didn't make it because that's just 
the way it was.

1000
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:16,150
You couldn't become worked right cause 
it used to be,

1001
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:16,984
it was one point in time.
It was like they would do like pro 

1002
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:19,444
matches in 30 intervals,
maybe their thirties like a farmer 

1003
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:22,324
Burns' date.
Right,

1004
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,223
exactly.
So originally professional wrestling 

1005
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,060
catch catch as catch can was 100% real 
like these guys,

1006
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,740
this is how people would travel the 
world.

1007
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:33,980
This is how midsole my Ada that you Doka
Jiujitsu guy ended up in Brazil

1008
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
doing catch wrestling pro wrestling 
matches and then ended up staying in 

1009
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,020
teaching judo and Jujitsu and catch 
wrestling through the gracies,

1010
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:43,120
the,
the actual birth of Brazilian Jujitsu,

1011
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,690
which is amazing because you could trace
it.

1012
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,940
Yes.
It started as catch,

1013
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,013
catch the started judo and catch 
wrestling and can we pull up because of 

1014
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,590
it burns hanging himself.
Oh yeah.

1015
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,570
The hang mantric.
Yeah.

1016
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,473
He used to,
his neck was so strong that he would do 

1017
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,174
this trick where he would put a noose 
around his neck and drop and hang from 

1018
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:02,950
his men and support his,
and he was probably about 170 pounds.

1019
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,370
I'm like,
oh,

1020
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,160
something like that.
Yeah.

1021
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,800
And it would hang from his neck and not 
die.

1022
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,840
Yes.
Which most of us.

1023
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,030
How do you even get to that point?
How do you test that theory?

1024
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:11,864
Do you like ease into it?
To think that just an off ever while I 

1025
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:14,600
was doing it.

1026
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,730
I hope so.
What a wasted opportunity.

1027
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:20,360
Maybe David Carradine.
Chill guys to fucking hang himself.

1028
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,194
Go.
Go to the one where you see his full 

1029
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,330
body,
the far left there.

1030
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,410
Yeah,
look at that.

1031
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,010
I mean the guy had a neck that was so 
fucking strong.

1032
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:31,550
He literally could hang himself.
I mean he had his hands free so it could

1033
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,670
reach up and grab the rope I guess.
But uh,

1034
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,340
I mean I wonder how long you would 
survive doing that.

1035
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,640
I Dunno.
I could make it hard to,

1036
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,740
uh,
to give him a blowjob afterwards.

1037
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:43,520
Yeah,
for sure.

1038
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,353
There's certain dudes that like,
you look at them today and you don't 

1039
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,840
think of them as being like 20 inch neck
on 165 pounds.

1040
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:53,090
It's amazing.
I mean,

1041
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:54,350
any whistles?
Yankee doodle.

1042
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,950
Oh Jesus Christ muscles.
Yankee doodle.

1043
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,940
While we can be dropped from six feet,
what,

1044
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,370
what,
what?

1045
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,283
Drop from six feet.
So it probably wasn't even six feet 

1046
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:09,464
tall.
So he's dropping it from his own height 

1047
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,200
and catching with his fucking neck and 
then he whistles.

1048
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,333
Yeah.
Is a gay for pay pro body builders as 

1049
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:21,950
well as maybe mel prostitute.
Hey,

1050
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,970
gay for pay.
Hey,

1051
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:25,930
what are those little things that they 
put on CNN?

1052
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,950
Stuff like that,
like miracle weight loss cure,

1053
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:29,440
and then you go pay dad.
Like what does,

1054
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,630
what do you have these paid ads?
That's ridiculous.

1055
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:33,350
Yeah.
I leave what she looks like today.

1056
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,800
And you're like,
what the fuck is this?

1057
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,240
So you're running that through a CNN 
through like an accredited news website.

1058
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,120
Yeah,
yeah,

1059
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,953
yeah.
This is the kind of stuff that people 

1060
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:46,220
did in the late 1900 for fun because 
there wasn't anything like TV.

1061
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,640
No Internet.
So what do you do?

1062
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:52,790
You end up hanging yourself from seeing 
if he could drop from six feet.

1063
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:53,683
I wonder how many people tried to 
emulate that and it just didn't work 

1064
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:57,020
out.
Talk about Darwinism.

1065
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,070
Oh,
there had to be a lot,

1066
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:58,904
right?
Yeah,

1067
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,030
for sure.
Is there's gotta be some dummies like,

1068
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,913
argh.
Fuck up.

1069
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,560
Snap.
Yeah.

1070
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,460
Oh,
for sure.

1071
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,303
Oh Man.
There was a lot that died because there 

1072
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:10,270
wasn't a whole lot of entertainment back
then.

1073
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:12,590
It was either that or get dysentery.
There's a crazy story going around.

1074
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,300
Some youtube couple did,
some stunt where the other girl shot the

1075
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:16,711
guy,
right?

1076
00:44:16,711 --> 00:44:16,991
Yeah.
Yeah.

1077
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,900
And killed him.
Oh,

1078
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,163
pt.
It was thick enough to stop a bullet 

1079
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,130
style.
And what kind of a round was it?

1080
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,030
Cause uh,
a nine millimeter.

1081
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,700
Even a low,
not,

1082
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,520
not,
not like a,

1083
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,890
not a hot load.
One

1084
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,940
hot mode.
Uh,

1085
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,820
not even a real,
like a site,

1086
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,440
like a personal defense round or 
whatever it will pierce phone books.

1087
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,070
No,
no problem.

1088
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,903
Yeah.
I don't know what the fuck they were 

1089
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,284
thinking.
Can you imagine just having trust and 

1090
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:46,440
encyclopedias?
Well,

1091
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,270
up a bullet.
They even test that out.

1092
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:49,104
They put an encyclopedia on the ground 
and shoot at first at this crazy bitch 

1093
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:52,284
probably.
She probably put some Kevlar and a book 

1094
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,774
and said,
look of even in the littlest buck will 

1095
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:56,724
stop a bullet.
And then she gave him the book with no 

1096
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:00,630
Kev warm plan.
Well,

1097
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,700
I don't really believe that folks.
This is just a joke.

1098
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,840
Don't sue me.
Women,

1099
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,280
women and men,
man,

1100
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:07,050
they can,
they figure out how to ways to be tricky

1101
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,910
all the time or stupid.
It's fuck.

1102
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,880
They figured you're dumb as fuck.
There's a lot of dumb as fuck out there.

1103
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,920
It's just a matter of whether or not you
can survive it.

1104
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,023
Dude,
I've been trolling the past a day on 

1105
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,740
instagram putting up these barriers.
Thoughts about bears?

1106
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,680
Yeah.
So many people think I'm serious,

1107
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,313
dude.
I wrote about forest rangers 

1108
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,170
infiltrating bear.
I saw it.

1109
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,500
I read that.
And he'll try to find there too.

1110
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:31,403
People are so fucking stupid.
It's like what we were talking about 

1111
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:37,960
before the podcast started about apple,
the forum cults and Right Tology Oh,

1112
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,210
Ron Hubbard and all that shit.
Oh,

1113
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:42,510
it's this the diminishing element of 
have of critical thinking.

1114
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:46,200
It's not just about the reduction of 
critical thinking in today's society.

1115
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,740
It is the effort that it takes to be a 
critical thinker.

1116
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:53,340
And four,
I would classify it under this,

1117
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:54,300
under the,
this,

1118
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:57,660
this concept I have that I've been 
working with called the human entropy.

1119
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,300
So entropy is the,
the in physics,

1120
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,010
it's um,
things returning,

1121
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,320
simply put,
it's things going to their load,

1122
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,154
a state of energy and human beings,
human entropy will go to their lowest 

1123
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:10,470
date of energy,
given an opportunity.

1124
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,690
And to the point where you see wally,
if you've seen that movie and all that,

1125
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:15,524
the big fat out,
just gnarly people just floating around 

1126
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:19,854
on hover beds being fed and taken care 
of and having zero strife in their life 

1127
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,440
that we will do that if given the 
opportunity.

1128
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:32,880
And so not having to think critically,
finding a group identity of some sort,

1129
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:33,714
even as crazy as a cult or which I would
argue that there's a lot of ideologies 

1130
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:42,951
around nowadays that are just as 
cult-like is as scientology or you know,

1131
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,910
heaven's gates,
stuff like that helps a lot of people so

1132
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,550
out of line,
uh,

1133
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:50,850
but,
uh,

1134
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,880
um,
to,

1135
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,040
to be,
to belong in one of these groups,

1136
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:56,874
to be a part of that identity means that
you no longer have to take as much 

1137
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:04,050
responsibility for your own actions 
because this group has decided your,

1138
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,070
your value system,
how you're going to operate your ethics.

1139
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,900
It also,
I mean there's,

1140
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,793
um,
some philosophical arguments that part 

1141
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,820
of that also ultimately stems from,
I think it was from Ernest Becker.

1142
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,713
It stems from fear of death and having 
to mitigate the anxiety and nihilism 

1143
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:25,824
that could come with confronting and 
accepting the fact that you're going to 

1144
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:31,630
die and everything that you did is going
to die with you,

1145
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,590
essentially.
Like your,

1146
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,840
your lack of existence is coming around 
the corner.

1147
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,050
Not If you put on the purple Nike's and 
cut your balls off.

1148
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,610
Wait for the comment.
That's right.

1149
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,140
You drink the Koolaid.
Did you hear how the,

1150
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,410
the guy,
uh,

1151
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,360
he saw everybody dying horribly and he's
like,

1152
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,131
Jonestown,
yeah,

1153
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:48,580
we'll fuck.
I'm not going to drink that.

1154
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:49,660
Please.
You know,

1155
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,160
do something else.
Instead it's like,

1156
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:52,930
shoot me,
I don't want to,

1157
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:53,764
I don't want to take the drink.
I'm sure it didn't they kill like 900 

1158
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:56,600
people or something like that.

1159
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,563
Yeah.
Town something saying all of those 

1160
00:47:58,991 --> 00:47:59,590
lines.
Yeah.

1161
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,550
Yeah.
It's just,

1162
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:05,850
it's very interesting watching people 
just given to the influence of the hive.

1163
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,800
Of course,
whatever hive that is,

1164
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,634
whether it's a religious hive or I'm 
fast and operates on the same 

1165
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:12,881
principles,
you know,

1166
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:16,000
whether it be religion and you can tell 
people,

1167
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,933
of course,
to me religion is kind of one of the 

1168
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:23,011
ultimate ones because the,
everything we do has,

1169
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:25,390
is,
is measured against a wager.

1170
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,100
You know,
if we talk from,

1171
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:28,660
from games.
So what,

1172
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:33,040
what's at stake and cruises,
the importance or the of,

1173
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,420
of the game itself.
So,

1174
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,040
you know,
fighting increases that,

1175
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,173
that threshold and so much higher 
because the more greater potential for 

1176
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,690
death or hurt pain,
whatever,

1177
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:44,524
right?
You're fighting somebody and as you go 

1178
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:47,380
down the lines,
but you know,

1179
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,070
poker is,
is popular because the raised stakes,

1180
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,203
the money as at play and the reward that
could come with it and the potential 

1181
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,380
that you could lose from it.

1182
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,860
So everything has this,
this and value.

1183
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:01,570
There's this measure against what 
you're,

1184
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,920
what you're potentially giving up.
And what's it,

1185
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,460
what's it hazard.
So with religion,

1186
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,070
what's it hazard,
your eternal soul,

1187
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:14,910
something that is so high value that you
can't,

1188
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,290
oh fuck,
I can't risk that.

1189
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,680
So fuck,
I guess I better,

1190
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,461
you know,
I mean it's,

1191
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,610
that's why it's so powerful,
but also it is,

1192
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,473
it is a panacea for death because like 
Nicha we'll talk about the concept of 

1193
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:35,290
true world values.
This is not the true world.

1194
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,243
This other thing is the true world.
So all of this suffering and strife and 

1195
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:42,330
difficulty and any like bullshit that 
happens to me,

1196
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,930
all of this,
in the end,

1197
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:44,764
it really isn't gonna matter because 
eventually I'm going to go to this true 

1198
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,330
world and this is the real world.
And this is the,

1199
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:50,164
my payoff for all of the,
all the Shit I had to go through down 

1200
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:54,244
here.

1201
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,293
And so for a lot of people,
the concept of having meaning for their 

1202
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:01,924
difficulty,
for their struggle is absolutely 

1203
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:08,020
important because otherwise,
why am I doing this?

1204
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,270
You know,
to take your own existence,

1205
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,163
your own being in the world and take it 
on to yourself and have all your own 

1206
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,974
accountability and look at it as I'm 
here living the best life I can because 

1207
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:19,564
I need to live the best life I can 
because it's the only life I will ever 

1208
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,220
live.
Yeah.

1209
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,440
That is a lot of weight.
And you know,

1210
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,550
um,
the anxiety of people dealing with that,

1211
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,150
trying to really take that on face on 
with death and their,

1212
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,240
their,
their lack of permanence in this world.

1213
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,450
Uh,
that's the,

1214
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:42,650
the argument is that was where nihilism 
can come from.

1215
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,180
And then with nihilism,
it's like,

1216
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,050
well,
nothing matters.

1217
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,620
So if nothing matters and you're not,
you're not able to,

1218
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,060
to operate anymore,
you're just like,

1219
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,523
what's the point?

1220
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,810
The moment matters though.
Of course,

1221
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:55,160
it does all of it.
Everything matters.

1222
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,821
Well,
it see,

1223
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:56,654
it's up to,
you do assign your values as to what 

1224
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:59,780
you're doing anyways and why you're 
doing it.

1225
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,850
Um,
but again,

1226
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:06,350
that involves taking responsibility for 
those values and caring those,

1227
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,533
that burden of what that may be on your 
own shoulders and not somebody who was 

1228
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,090
one of the reasons why learning some 
kind of a discipline at an early age.

1229
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,800
It's probably like really important for 
people.

1230
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:16,671
I think.
So.

1231
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:17,504
I mean,
I think for me a lot of it came from 

1232
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:19,994
being ostracized as a kid and being 
someone that was not of hive mentality 

1233
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,870
and out of herd mentality and that you 
get ostracized.

1234
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,704
For what?
Because of what?

1235
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,543
Just,
uh,

1236
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,473
for,
for one it was being bigger and for all 

1237
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,133
the things that I was interested in,
all the dorky stuff or weird stuff or 

1238
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,570
played dungeons and dragons,
I would,

1239
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:40,940
if I had the time I play dungeons and 
dragons,

1240
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:41,774
I would play warhammer 40 k I would,
I still play magic the gathering from 

1241
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:46,100
time to time.
Oh yeah.

1242
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,780
Fuck yeah.
Are you kidding me?

1243
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:53,570
I tap that man a motherfucker.
Ooh,

1244
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,770
I love it.
Yeah.

1245
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:55,663
But,
uh,

1246
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,980
you know,
for being into that kind of stuff,

1247
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,810
but also just for being,
just for,

1248
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,673
just being different.
And some of it was like big brother 

1249
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,760
syndrome stuff.
So it's like,

1250
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:09,560
oh well you fuck with big brother 
because it's fun.

1251
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,394
And eventually he gets mad and he finds 
you and he beat you up and you cry and 

1252
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,310
you know,
but you do it again the next day.

1253
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:15,560
Anyways.
So for me it's like,

1254
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,543
oh,
here's this big kid and he's going to 

1255
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:19,070
get upset if you start fucking with 
them.

1256
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,480
Uh,
and it's funny,

1257
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,610
Haha until I get ahold of you.
And then it's like,

1258
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,750
oh,
you just beat me up.

1259
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,760
That's fucked up.
And I said,

1260
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,603
well I didn't,
I didn't want to beat anybody up until 

1261
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,300
you started fucking ridiculing me in the
first place.

1262
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,580
So,
but when you're a little child,

1263
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,760
you don't understand regulation of 
emotions as well.

1264
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:35,594
You also don't understand the social 
parameters in which all this stuff is 

1265
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:39,284
functioning anyways.
You just don't have that kind of 

1266
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,720
insight.
And so,

1267
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,280
you know,
it'd be like nowadays someone could walk

1268
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:44,810
in here and be like,
fuck you,

1269
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:45,644
you suck.
And I look at him and I would laugh 

1270
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,160
about it because we were talking about 
this yesterday.

1271
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:50,900
I was saying that I saw it happen.
Chocolate,

1272
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,734
Dell.
I have saw people try to pick fights 

1273
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,430
with chocolate dell and it's hilarious.
It's like,

1274
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:56,870
yeah,
why are you fucking suicidal?

1275
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:57,910
No,
no,

1276
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:58,310
no,
no,

1277
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,770
I have not.
I've never had anyone really try to pick

1278
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:01,890
a fight with me.
I had a guy at a,

1279
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:03,470
at a concert once,
I get all,

1280
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,400
get all butthurt about me not letting 
him pass in between me and this,

1281
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:08,234
this girl that was standing with me,
cause people kept trying to cut through 

1282
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:13,460
to get it was at anthrax and he wanted 
to get,

1283
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,930
and I'm just like,
fuck this.

1284
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,760
Why do people keep trying to walk 
between us?

1285
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,460
Like Jesus just go around,
right?

1286
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,790
So eventually I'm like,
no,

1287
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:20,624
I'm not letting anybody by.
So I got my elbows out and people would 

1288
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:23,900
bump into it and then go,
go around.

1289
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,220
Well this guy,
he just kept going,

1290
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,700
kept tap in.
It's just like,

1291
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,440
man,
fuck you dude.

1292
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:29,850
I'm standing here with a girl.
Go Away.

1293
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,470
He was trying to give a treat and you 
and your girl.

1294
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,700
And so eventually you can get like a 
Dick Rub.

1295
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,410
Like,
uh,

1296
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,490
maybe,
I mean,

1297
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,320
if he'd asked nicely,
maybe he would've got one.

1298
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:37,801
Well,
I don't know,

1299
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,410
that's a bold ask.
But you know what though?

1300
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:43,020
Fortune favors the bold and I'm a kind 
human being.

1301
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,780
Maybe he didn't want me to rub his dick,
but that's what he have got.

1302
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,530
You would've got that to give and you 
take sir.

1303
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,873
So,
uh,

1304
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,060
the guy comes around and he finally goes
around us and then he's just,

1305
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,901
he looks at me,
he's like,

1306
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:56,040
hey man,
I was trying to get through.

1307
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,521
And I go,
look,

1308
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:57,960
I'm standing here with this girl.
Like,

1309
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,960
yeah,
go somewhat.

1310
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,833
You just go around and he's getting all,
he's getting pissed about it cause I'm 

1311
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:04,760
dismissing him,
you know?

1312
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,640
So eventually I was like,
just,

1313
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,474
you know,
let's go,

1314
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,693
let's walk away now that gets his 
fucking hackles up and he's all mad and 

1315
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:11,870
he's,
he's looking at me,

1316
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:12,660
he's like,
you,

1317
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,100
this and that.
And I started laughing at him.

1318
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:14,611
I go like,
Oh,

1319
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:15,444
you want to,
you want to scrap because you can't get 

1320
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:17,581
through here.
Is that,

1321
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,290
is that it is,
this is what you want to do.

1322
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,540
And he's just like,
Wah,

1323
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,451
Wah.
And I go,

1324
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:21,961
okay,
okay,

1325
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:23,730
we'll just move on.
Oh,

1326
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
fucking chest up even bigger.
And it's just like,

1327
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:29,190
he looks like he's going to walk away,
whatever I'm saying,

1328
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,850
all right,
you know?

1329
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,200
Okay,
do your own thing.

1330
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:31,950
He's like,
Ooh,

1331
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,783
he's just getting even more looked up.
And he points his finger out and I'm 

1332
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,290
laughing at him.
And the girl who,

1333
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,340
uh,
who was,

1334
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,200
uh,
does Jujitsu and was a fighter,

1335
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,410
she reaches out and grabs the whole 
disguise risks and pulls his hand out.

1336
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:44,910
And she's like,
don't you don't want to do that?

1337
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:50,100
And then he looks at her and he looks at
me and I'm just smiling and he pulls his

1338
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:50,934
hand back and I go,
I know what must have gone through his 

1339
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:56,160
head is just like,
this girl's grip is serious.

1340
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,100
And she's telling me,
don't fucking do it.

1341
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,680
It's probably a good idea not to fucking
do it,

1342
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,840
probably.
Exactly what,

1343
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,740
but other times there have been like,
uh,

1344
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,920
you know,
I'm not impervious to getting in a mood.

1345
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,730
And so sometimes I've been out and about
and someone was being a dickhead.

1346
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,770
And I see it and it's like,
okay,

1347
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,060
this guy is,
he's,

1348
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,550
he's clearly trying to egg something on 
somehow.

1349
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,790
And so maybe I,
you know,

1350
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,060
add a little something to that scene to 
feel if he'll,

1351
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,330
uh,
he'll bite and just happen,

1352
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,190
you know,
or I've had some people go,

1353
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:30,120
oh yeah,
of course.

1354
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,350
No one's going to fight you then know 
who you are.

1355
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:32,580
I'm like,
are you fucking kidding me?

1356
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:35,430
I'm some sort of deal celebrity.
Nobody knows who the fuck I am.

1357
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,610
So get away with a lot.
And the thing is,

1358
00:55:38,611 --> 00:55:41,070
if a guy who had a fight,
who would know who you are,

1359
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,620
if a was a fan of fighting,
he would know who you are.

1360
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,140
And those guys would be way less likely 
to pick a fight in the first,

1361
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:48,390
there was one dude who was at this bar 
and Fullerton,

1362
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,980
and he's being just belligerent.

1363
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,610
He's being an asshole and this place 
and,

1364
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,583
and my buddy hammer,
he was the door guy at the time and the 

1365
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,460
southern and they're like,
come on.

1366
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:58,200
And he's,
this guy's fucking getting all riled up.

1367
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,080
And I'm standing there with hammer and 
just looking at this dude.

1368
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,590
And eventually the other tour guy comes 
over and he's like,

1369
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,360
hey,
you fucking dumb ass.

1370
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,690
You're wearing the fucking tee shirt of 
that guy right there.

1371
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,610
So maybe you might want to shut the fuck
up.

1372
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,410
It's this guy's wearing one of my 
affliction shirts.

1373
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,140
And the guy looks at the shirt and he 
looks at me and he was like,

1374
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,730
Oh shit,
this is stupid.

1375
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,033
Getting your ass kicked.
Because you picked a fight with a guy 

1376
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,120
whose shirt you have on like you,
you are,

1377
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:32,250
you're wearing a Josh Barnett shirt and 
you don't know who Josh Barnett is.

1378
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,071
Well,
and some,

1379
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:33,904
a lot,
a lot of this shit comes from people 

1380
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,873
putting themselves into situations where
they have upped the ante to wear for 

1381
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:42,430
them not to follow through.

1382
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,630
Is,
is going to bring about like a,

1383
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,650
a huge internal conflict with them.
You know,

1384
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:48,484
they're going to know that they raised 
the stakes and then they had to back 

1385
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:52,084
down,
which I think is really hard for just 

1386
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:57,244
about anybody to deal with,
to get yourself to a point where you're 

1387
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:58,871
like,
yeah,

1388
00:56:58,871 --> 00:56:59,980
you know,
I'm in the right.

1389
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,540
And then to,
to dial that back.

1390
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:02,374
I mean,
people don't even want to really 

1391
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,544
apologize for anything,
let alone have to admit that they took 

1392
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,324
something too far.
It got to a point where they weren't 

1393
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:10,294
willing to go any further and they 
realize they fucked up and then to fuck 

1394
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:15,400
and Tuck,
Tuck tail and leave again and back down.

1395
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,520
And there's a lot of insecurity involved
in that.

1396
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:19,354
There was a lot of insecurity probably 
to get it at that point in the first 

1397
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:22,870
place,
which is why people that really know how

1398
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:27,871
to fight don't have to go out there and 
try to prove to somebody else that,

1399
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,690
that they are capable or that look at,
hey everybody,

1400
00:57:31,691 --> 00:57:33,640
look at how,
how bad ass I am.

1401
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,940
So you know,
when it was like for me,

1402
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,350
I just,
I don't start fights,

1403
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,184
you know?
I mean,

1404
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,023
barring that,
maybe that the occasional moment where 

1405
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:42,784
someone I thought was being an asshole 
or I thought they were being a shitty 

1406
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,170
person,
the reason they're being a shitty person

1407
00:57:47,171 --> 00:57:48,730
is because they thought that no one 
would call them on it.

1408
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,470
You know,
and for me to call them on,

1409
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:55,030
it is more about there doesn't need to 
be any conflict here tonight,

1410
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:58,300
but you want to create it because you're
an insecure little prick.

1411
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,700
So I'll,
I'll,

1412
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:01,534
I'll,
I'll,

1413
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,580
I'll be your huckleberry.
All right.

1414
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,470
Now that you see that somebody was 
willing,

1415
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,760
now how much is it worth to you?
And of course it's,

1416
00:58:07,761 --> 00:58:09,040
it's almost,
it's never worth it to them.

1417
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:12,640
And even people that have been all 
fucking fired up and you know,

1418
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:15,420
of course they're operating off of anger
and emotion and,

1419
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,283
and of,
of upping something to a point where 

1420
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,180
they don't feel that they can back down.

1421
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,090
Cause if you give someone an out,
especially in these kinds of things,

1422
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,343
90% of the time they take it but a this,
that always that last word thing that 

1423
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:27,874
everybody wants,
they want to feel like it was winning 

1424
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:33,490
the fight to a lot of dickheads.
But you know when you,

1425
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,050
sometimes you turn to somebody,
you go,

1426
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:35,884
you don't know anybody that knows 
anybody that knows anybody that knows 

1427
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:38,224
anybody that can kicked my ass.
So I don't know what you're going to do 

1428
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:41,130
right now or who you're going to call 
it,

1429
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:44,500
but it ain't going to fucking work.
Or it's just,

1430
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,970
you know,
turn to somebody and you're like,

1431
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,790
how many friends you got with you?
That ain't enough.

1432
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,643
You know,
go get more because I don't know which 

1433
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:53,674
one you guys want to get involved.
But the first one that I can get my 

1434
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,000
hands on too,
I'm a fucking cripple you.

1435
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,040
I'm a fuck you up.
I'm a fuck you up.

1436
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:00,874
I don't know if you guys can take me,
but I want to know how many of you I'm 

1437
00:59:03,341 --> 00:59:04,174
going to take with me first.
Or my favorite is people nowadays don't 

1438
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:09,034
really,
so everything is the reduction to 

1439
00:59:11,921 --> 00:59:13,300
violence.
Essentially.

1440
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,900
Everything is a reduction to violence at
the base level.

1441
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,930
Finally,
the final element is violence.

1442
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:25,710
So what I'm saying is that,
so we create all the,

1443
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,760
we create laws,
we create social norms,

1444
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:31,640
we create all the customs and things to 
honestly,

1445
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:32,474
to avoid things getting to violence.
But even your simplest law is 

1446
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:38,870
essentially rooted in the element of 
violence.

1447
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,280
So,
okay.

1448
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,680
Uh,
you,

1449
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,620
you will use some,
some,

1450
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,480
some law,
right?

1451
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,310
Like a ticket of some sort and it's 
like,

1452
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:47,900
Whoa,
I'm going to find you for the thing.

1453
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,080
I'm not going to pay it.
Oh,

1454
00:59:50,081 --> 00:59:50,480
okay.

1455
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,830
Well then we're going to find you some 
more.

1456
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,440
I'm not going to pay that.
We're going to do this.

1457
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,240
I'm not going to do that.
Well,

1458
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:57,980
okay then if you're not going to pay the
thing,

1459
00:59:57,981 --> 00:59:58,814
you're not going to,
you're not going to do this and you're 

1460
00:59:59,801 --> 01:00:01,450
not going to let your not going to,
oh,

1461
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,230
well then what we're going to do is 
we're going to arrest you.

1462
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,363
No,
you're not.

1463
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,700
At some point it reduces down to 
violence.

1464
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:10,430
So we're using violence all the time 
too.

1465
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,293
Or at least the con,
the for a lot of things for pretty much 

1466
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,530
everything.
You know,

1467
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,393
in terms of social controls.
Eventually if someone doesn't want to 

1468
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:24,971
adhere to those controls in some way,
violence is the final solution.

1469
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,080
It's what it's,
what it boils down to.

1470
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:27,914
It is the basis for,
for all of our police and military and 

1471
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:36,101
even honestly it still exists within all
of us on a social level.

1472
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:37,903
It's just that we have managed to take 
that concept and put it on to something 

1473
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,800
else.
The law,

1474
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,491
right?
Police,

1475
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:44,324
something like that.
But the reality is is that if some guy 

1476
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,960
just at some point says,
you know,

1477
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:48,794
I don't really give a fuck and you were 
an asshole and I'm just going to wreck 

1478
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:54,080
you.
Okay,

1479
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,840
you can sue them,
you can do this.

1480
01:00:56,841 --> 01:00:59,030
You can call the cops on him,
you can whatever.

1481
01:00:59,031 --> 01:00:59,864
But violence is going to happen whether 
you want it to or not and whether this 

1482
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:07,460
person was in the right cause.
That's another thing is like violence in

1483
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:09,440
and of itself.
Even if you're the winner.

1484
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,300
Like I had to remember what philosopher 
once said,

1485
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:13,134
you know,
winning the dual doesn't mean that you 

1486
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:16,460
are correct.
It just means that you one,

1487
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,230
you know,
that's a good point.

1488
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,120
So tools.
Yeah,

1489
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,400
but um,
uh,

1490
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:24,500
so all these things are,
are,

1491
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,360
you know,
customs norms,

1492
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,553
all a lot of this stuff is to avoid 
anything breaking down to violence 

1493
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:32,270
because you know,
you bump into someone,

1494
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,800
you spill their drink and they turn in 
and go,

1495
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,300
hey man,
well that was fucked up.

1496
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,610
And you turn them and you go,
you know what it was,

1497
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:39,320
I'm sorry.
Or You could turn on me like,

1498
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,490
you know what?
Fuck you.

1499
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,080
Fuck me.
You spilled my drink.

1500
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,110
I have,
I'm taking offense to this.

1501
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,890
I now don't have my drink.
Who's going to make this right.

1502
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,270
I don't really give a shit,
Huh.

1503
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,000
That everything starts to escalate.
And as soon as,

1504
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,730
as,
as one person takes a stand,

1505
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:59,530
and if that other person rising to that,
to that next level to then,

1506
01:01:59,531 --> 01:02:02,780
and they raised it again,
eventually you get to a certain point,

1507
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:03,770
it's like,
okay,

1508
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,900
what,
where are we going with this?

1509
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,490
Where is the solution?
Where does any of this lie ad it's,

1510
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,543
you've,
you've stripped down all other options 

1511
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:12,614
until he got to a point where all you 
got allowed yourselves was violence or 

1512
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:20,880
to completely re pull yourself entirely 
out of that situation,

1513
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,580
which a lot of people aren't 
necessarily.

1514
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,570
If it really,
really,

1515
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:25,404
really got to that point,
they're not willing to do because that 

1516
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,673
was too much of the emotional maturity 
to realize they've made a mistake or to 

1517
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:33,900
just not engage and not want to be a 
part of it.

1518
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,933
Yeah.
But then there's that psychological 

1519
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:39,330
thing of wanting to win.
What a weird battle of words.

1520
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:39,931
Right?
Well,

1521
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:40,860
and there's,
there's uh,

1522
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:44,100
other complex things,
like if it was a males,

1523
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,960
you know,
there's social hierarchy stuff.

1524
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,210
Um,
if it was females,

1525
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:49,660
their social eric,
our stuff between that.

1526
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,230
If it's male on female,
it could be,

1527
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:53,890
you know,
well there's always this side up.

1528
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,813
If you're really super concerned about 
what other people think or how you're 

1529
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:01,050
going to be perceived by others in a 
group setting,

1530
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,050
you know that that could also plan to a 
factor which happens,

1531
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:06,270
you know,
out and about on the town or whatever.

1532
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,990
Your buddies always see you in this 
situation or other people.

1533
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:10,860
Everyone,
okay,

1534
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,290
you got their attention now what are you
going to do?

1535
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,910
And so if they see you completely 
retreat,

1536
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,670
everyone's like,
uh Huh.

1537
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,900
All right.
Well that guy really wasn't what he said

1538
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:22,734
he was

1539
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,930
right,
right,

1540
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:24,764
right.
Yeah.

1541
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,390
You're not down,
man.

1542
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:28,640
Did you ever see that thing where Sean 
Connery,

1543
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:30,230
uh,
I was talking to Barbara Walters and she

1544
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:32,450
asked him about hitting chicks.
Yeah,

1545
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:33,530
I've seen it.
And he's like,

1546
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:36,470
sometimes she gives them to lash word 
[inaudible] from rough.

1547
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,833
They have to shape more when you're 
trying to get from one retro for Mark 

1548
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,283
Level Schmuck.
Yeah.

1549
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,720
That's just sad.

1550
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,200
Was just like,
uh,

1551
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,200
she didn't know what the fuck she 
thought she had them.

1552
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,383
Yeah.
She thought it was over and he dug his 

1553
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,180
heels in.
He's impervious,

1554
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,270
I guess,
you know.

1555
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,133
But,
uh,

1556
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,233
I

1557
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,040
no common his body because he probably 
fucked 15 different women that day.

1558
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,760
And it was just like Carne from non 
trench conversational.

1559
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:07,220
We're having Kira do I need just from 
Acura?

1560
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,560
I'm Barbara.
I'm fucking Sean Connery.

1561
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:11,853
James.
Look at the smile on his face and look 

1562
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:15,200
at my mustache bald.
I don't care.

1563
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,730
I'm on them.
I'm a man's man.

1564
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:20,613
Let's play.
Can we play it without getting pulled 

1565
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:22,334
off of Youtube?

1566
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,953
A woman now.
And then as I remember you said you 

1567
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:27,720
don't do it with a clenched fist.
It's better to do it with an open hand.

1568
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,520
Yeah,
I remember that.

1569
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1570
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,370
Remember that?
I really love that.

1571
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,140
I haven't changed my opinion.
It's to slap a woman.

1572
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,450
No,
I don't think it's good.

1573
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:41,840
I don't think it's bad.
I don't think it's that bad.

1574
01:04:41,841 --> 01:04:45,290
I think that it depends entirely on the 
circumstances and if it merits it,

1575
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:46,020
oh,
oh.

1576
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,690
What would merit it?
Well,

1577
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:52,190
if you have tried everything else and 
women are pretty good at it,

1578
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:53,683
they can't leave it alone.
They know what they want to have the 

1579
01:04:57,111 --> 01:04:58,860
last word.
Then you'd give them the last,

1580
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,250
last one,
but they're not happy with the last one.

1581
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,670
They want to share it again and get into
a really provocative situation.

1582
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:13,360
Then I think you're absolutely right.

1583
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,633
Wow.

1584
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,180
Oh boy.
Oh,

1585
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,030
that's so people get sean connery being 
rude and aggressive.

1586
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:23,410
Play that up.
Next.

1587
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,333
What is,
what is he getting rude and aggressive 

1588
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:25,924
about it?

1589
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,130
Do you work for the tabloid,
the National Enquirer or your wedding?

1590
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:38,790
A jock strap on what?
I've knocked.

1591
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,890
Not Tonight.
Okay.

1592
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,540
That's why you're smiling.
I haven't dated too tight.

1593
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,820
You probably knew you were going to be 
here.

1594
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,930
What?
You make another film director again?

1595
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,530
Would you do another interview with me?
I wouldn't do a film.

1596
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:57,870
Go.
Wow.

1597
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,660
I don't know.
I'm trunk on the rear.

1598
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,430
How are you?
Funny.

1599
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:09,010
If that was right next to him,
it's ready to take some deck.

1600
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,460
Honestly,
it didn't seem that rude or aggressive.

1601
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,730
They just didn't like the question and 
he fucked with them about it.

1602
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,573
Yeah.
Well,

1603
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:19,660
clickbait in any ways.
I personally do not put hands on women.

1604
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,530
I'm not in the mind into that.
I also give her a chick tried to hit you

1605
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:23,940
though.
Oh fuck yeah.

1606
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:24,870
Are you kidding me?
No,

1607
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:25,704
I've been to,
I've been chin checked while driving 

1608
01:06:27,061 --> 01:06:27,894
once I have a like snack.
Oh that was cool that we had each other 

1609
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,000
and that's,
is that what it is?

1610
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,893
Wants to get fucked hall.
You're not fucking her hard enough 

1611
01:06:36,631 --> 01:06:38,730
judge.
Apparently not shit.

1612
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:39,564
Put your boots on those wrestling shoes 
he wore when you tap dance to a lace up 

1613
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,270
motherfucker put some uh,
some uh,

1614
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,930
some tack them on my arms.
Make sure to get a good grip.

1615
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,060
You might want to throw the mattress on 
the ground.

1616
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,320
Right.
You know,

1617
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,230
so you could really like dig in.
I can tell sort of thing.

1618
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,183
Really.
You can really trust bottom that thing 

1619
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:58,620
out.
Yeah man.

1620
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,910
Like you will push up against a wall and
a,

1621
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,470
your feet just on hardwood for,
that's what I'm thinking.

1622
01:07:04,471 --> 01:07:06,810
Right.
You just planking and just,

1623
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:09,570
you know,
driving actually offers carpeting.

1624
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,750
You had your bedroom like the stuff that
stain resistant.

1625
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,550
Yeah.
It's got that grip on it per gripping.

1626
01:07:14,551 --> 01:07:15,990
Girls are like,
what the fuck is this?

1627
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:18,330
Like why is your carpet show part fuck 
up?

1628
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,870
This is going to get real real in a 
second,

1629
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,500
but you're going to love me for it.
I,

1630
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,150
no,
I've been,

1631
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,800
I've been hit.
Uh,

1632
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:26,910
I,
uh,

1633
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,560
I'm not gonna,
I'm not like,

1634
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,440
Oh,
you've been in abusive relationships and

1635
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:31,830
not like that.
I mean it's just people,

1636
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:35,280
it's frustrations and people not being 
able to manage those.

1637
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,600
I remember one,
uh,

1638
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:37,530
this Gal,
uh,

1639
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,830
she trains,
she fought and at one point and she used

1640
01:07:40,831 --> 01:07:42,030
to do all kinds of shit,
right to go.

1641
01:07:42,031 --> 01:07:43,710
You know what?
That is the most fucked up shit.

1642
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:46,050
You really abusing the fact you know 
your,

1643
01:07:46,051 --> 01:07:48,420
your gender and that you know that 
you're a woman.

1644
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:49,254
So I'm not going to do anything,
but you're going to do shit to me that 

1645
01:07:51,391 --> 01:07:54,000
if you were a man,
I would just knock all your teeth out.

1646
01:07:54,001 --> 01:07:54,834
Like you,
you crossed so many lines and been so 

1647
01:07:56,971 --> 01:08:00,090
disrespectful and,
and done things that are,

1648
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:00,943
you know,
an invasion of personal space and 

1649
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:04,740
respect.
It's just like,

1650
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,790
man,
that's just too much.

1651
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:08,640
Like you went way to you while you're 
driving?

1652
01:08:08,641 --> 01:08:09,474
Yeah.
Yeah.

1653
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,700
What if you went out bad?
Have been hilarious.

1654
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,010
A girl knows how to fight and you know 
what?

1655
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,000
The person,
well this one,

1656
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,220
but the one that punched

1657
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,750
me while I was driving didn't know how 
to fight,

1658
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,400
but uh,
yeah,

1659
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,941
well,
you know,

1660
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,830
it's like they say to what the what the 
drunk guy,

1661
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,690
he passes out and he's always the one 
that doesn't get hurt.

1662
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:24,890
Right.
So I would have been like,

1663
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,263
and then the car was cheap anyway,
so I wouldn't have cared and she 

1664
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:31,100
probably would have got tossed to the 
window.

1665
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,263
But,
uh,

1666
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,673
uh,
but I just remember her saying to me 

1667
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:38,060
this one time,
this the one that did train,

1668
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,740
she's like,
you know what?

1669
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,510
You don't fucking kills me.
I could,

1670
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,380
I could just hit you as hard as I wanted
to.

1671
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,350
I could do whatever and it wouldn't 
fucking matter.

1672
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,850
Cause you know,
cause you're,

1673
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:47,684
you and I bought and I,
you're just so much to say we were 

1674
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,420
installed and I'm just like,
Jesus,

1675
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:52,040
fuck,
why is that my fucking fault?

1676
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,460
Right.
You know we're having a,

1677
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,313
we have an argument about something and 
you escalate it and then you're mad at 

1678
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:01,970
me because you couldn't beat me up.
At the end of it.

1679
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,360
You got so mad that you can't kick my 
ass and now that makes you matter.

1680
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,530
Let me play armchair psychologist cause 
I'm good at this.

1681
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,990
What I would think is that a gal like 
that,

1682
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,273
first of all,
she probably enjoys having a certain 

1683
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,150
amount of physical power over people and
went,

1684
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:19,300
Shit escalates.
She wants that violence to be real.

1685
01:09:19,301 --> 01:09:21,190
She wants it to be a real threat coming 
from her,

1686
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:23,200
which is why she probably started 
fighting in the first place.

1687
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,260
Now when she's fighting,
when she's arguing with you,

1688
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:27,423
all the sudden she's in this fucked up 
situation where what she's worked for 

1689
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:33,340
her whole life is to become the scary 
girl.

1690
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,323
Or the girl could fuck people up.
A girl who's like literally a threat 

1691
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:37,924
physically,
she could probably knock a lot of dudes 

1692
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:40,354
out,
right?

1693
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:45,010
But she's confronted with a giant former
UFC heavyweight champion and she's like,

1694
01:09:45,011 --> 01:09:46,090
God dammit,

1695
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,110
I doesn't work that,
that psychology can absolutely hold true

1696
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:52,480
for this one particular girl.
Um,

1697
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,733
for her,
I think it was a matter of not being 

1698
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:57,970
able to,
you know,

1699
01:09:57,971 --> 01:09:58,804
having this frustration about not being 
able to get the outcome that they 

1700
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:03,120
wanted,
um,

1701
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:08,670
and having what they would feel is no 
recourse to get me to,

1702
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:13,750
to come to term tom come to their terms 
and their way.

1703
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:17,560
And so she uses physical violence,
never used physical violence,

1704
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,980
never worried about that then,
uh,

1705
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,890
Nah,
you know what it was,

1706
01:10:21,891 --> 01:10:24,790
it just insecurity,
it's insecurity and it was just like,

1707
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,040
how is that even,
why,

1708
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:28,120
why?
For one,

1709
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:29,171
you know,
this,

1710
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:30,004
this,
this girl,

1711
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,390
uh,
I was with her for a long time.

1712
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,320
You know,
I haven't,

1713
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,560
this one was a long time ago.
My most recent one on the other hand,

1714
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:39,910
that one,
I've actually seen use violence before.

1715
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,040
Um,
and it's just like,

1716
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,440
how to me,
it's just like,

1717
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,810
even with,
with arguing,

1718
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,020
we would get into these arguments and 
someone would make you know,

1719
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,120
statement a and I'd say,
okay,

1720
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,470
well,
uh,

1721
01:10:53,471 --> 01:10:56,260
I don't think St Manet holds true 
because of these reasons.

1722
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,070
And then we'd start going and then all 
of a sudden statement a is get straw man

1723
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:01,330
into something else.
And then,

1724
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,841
no,
no,

1725
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:02,674
no.
You can't leave statement a because 

1726
01:11:03,581 --> 01:11:07,060
you're basing your arguments on that.
We're not talking about statement b.

1727
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,373
That's,
that's a whole different scenario 

1728
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:11,500
altogether.
This argument isn't,

1729
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:12,334
is going nowhere now.
Now it's getting circular and you keep 

1730
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,024
taking me away from the original 
argument to begin with to start hitting 

1731
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:21,300
you with six years ago you said this to 
me and stuff like that.

1732
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:23,010
It would be,
it'd be something on,

1733
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,150
I dunno,
she turned into a gigantic Marxists.

1734
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:30,360
SJW So yeah.
While you were dating her,

1735
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,980
yes.
She turned sjws Social Justice Warrior,

1736
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,010
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you're an online loan,

1737
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,170
it would just be like,
well that,

1738
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,150
okay,
hold on.

1739
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,760
That doesn't make sense.
I don't,

1740
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,680
I don't know your,
your logic here.

1741
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:45,930
I don't think falls,
you know,

1742
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,080
being correct turned into this,
like she didn't start out doing this.

1743
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,580
Uh,
I think it existed,

1744
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,660
you know,
she's from,

1745
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,060
she went to Berkeley.
So,

1746
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:57,210
but nonetheless,
it wasn't something that I ever saw,

1747
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:58,463
especially to begin with.
It didn't seem like that was what I was 

1748
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:03,440
in store for until one day.
You know,

1749
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,860
I look over and I'm like,
Huh,

1750
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,050
bass copy tall.
Well,

1751
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:07,913
yeah,
I think reading Marx is interesting and 

1752
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:11,240
I think it's worthwhile to understand 
some of his,

1753
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,143
his arguments.
And I think he's got some interesting 

1754
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:18,860
critiques of capitalism,
especially back in its day with it,

1755
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:20,640
with this industrialism,
uh,

1756
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:23,010
industrial society at that time.

1757
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,233
But he doesn't understand people at all.
His solutions are fucking hackneyed and 

1758
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:29,364
you know,
he's coming from a very interesting 

1759
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:35,721
position because he doesn't even,
he as a person doesn't even stick to his

1760
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:38,130
own,
his own shit,

1761
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,360
you know,
but in any ways.

1762
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,333
So we're having these arguments and then
it would turn to a pejorative and I'm 

1763
01:12:43,051 --> 01:12:43,471
like,
well,

1764
01:12:43,471 --> 01:12:45,210
okay,
why are you attacking me?

1765
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,073
I'm not attacking you.
I'm not even being angry about your 

1766
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,330
statement.
I just you,

1767
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,070
you made statement a so I don't believe 
in it.

1768
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:54,750
I don't,
I don't think that that's correct.

1769
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:59,751
So we're having a discussion,
but now it became a personal attack once

1770
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,430
even gets to that,
let alone someone,

1771
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:04,380
even back in the day talking about,
oh,

1772
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:07,260
it really upsets me that uh,
no matter how angry you know,

1773
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:08,094
my,
whatever,

1774
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,250
if I hit you or did this,
it wouldn't matter because you're you.

1775
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:12,413
It's like,
well,

1776
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,920
both of these statements come from the 
same,

1777
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,553
same.
Both of those scenarios come from the 

1778
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:19,231
same place.
It's like,

1779
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:21,120
well now you're trying,
you're attacking me,

1780
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,730
the individual.
Because if you're going to do that,

1781
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,330
you aren't thinking about me as the 
person that's,

1782
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:27,511
no,
no,

1783
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,280
no.
I got your back through heaven and hell,

1784
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:32,310
I will kick the gates of hell down and 
kill everyone there.

1785
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:35,730
If I got to the four year,
they're there.

1786
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,970
They want to devalue a,
they want to devalue me,

1787
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:40,830
the person,
because they,

1788
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,460
they feel attacked in some way.
They feel like they're,

1789
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:45,870
they're so attached to their,
to their statement,

1790
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:46,704
to whatever that may be,
which has some attachment to maybe what 

1791
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:54,741
they feel is their existence.
That to re to change that is dangerous.

1792
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,310
To haul it outright wrong would be an 
even bigger problem.

1793
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:00,144
And I mean,
you know,

1794
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,373
I,
it's just like this stuff would start 

1795
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:02,940
showing up at the house.

1796
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:03,870
And so I'm like,
all right,

1797
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:04,704
I'm going to start doing research on 
marks and angles and all this different 

1798
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:07,464
stuff.
And then as I would go further and 

1799
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:10,230
further and further down the rabbit 
hole,

1800
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:11,320
I come back and I go,
oh,

1801
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,183
okay.
So this argument stems from this and 

1802
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:15,070
this and this and this and this.
And they're like,

1803
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:16,030
no,
it doesn't like,

1804
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:16,870
wow.
Okay.

1805
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,560
Uh,
why,

1806
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,470
why do you think people operate?
Like what,

1807
01:14:20,471 --> 01:14:22,090
what do you think their whole reasoning 
is?

1808
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:22,924
You know,
we get into these arguments about 

1809
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:25,150
capitalism and capitalism is a neutral 
system.

1810
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,730
Ask you this.
What is it about social justice warriors

1811
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:31,210
are left wing people that were Marxism 
is so attractive to them.

1812
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,150
Uh,
well for one it's,

1813
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,340
it's this idea of equity.
Like this sameness,

1814
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,193
like everybody,
nobody is being left behind and no one 

1815
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:42,610
is,
is becoming greater than anybody else.

1816
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,470
Uh,
it's also the idea,

1817
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:47,980
I like to think of it in,
I think a lot of these young people look

1818
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:52,090
at it as grow mom's house,
mom and dad's house.

1819
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,240
So when your mom and dad's house,
someone does your laundry,

1820
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,950
someone cooks your food,
you know,

1821
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,170
you always just show up.
You got a place to live,

1822
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,280
uh,
you know,

1823
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:01,114
the TV turns on and then they stable 
government should become mom and dad 

1824
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:04,361
wants you.
Exactly.

1825
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:07,420
So they want mom and dad's house to 
exist forever.

1826
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:10,690
So it's just like they can run off and 
do whatever they want to do for food.

1827
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:13,330
There's plenty of money for shelter.
We just need to spend it.

1828
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,640
Right.
Redistribution of wealth.

1829
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,331
Right,
exactly.

1830
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:21,331
Because if you exceed that system more 
than they deem that you should have,

1831
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:23,650
then you should give it to somebody 
else.

1832
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:24,220
And it's like,
well,

1833
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,840
how do you think I got this?

1834
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,230
Oh my God,
how many?

1835
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,420
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Go ahead.

1836
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,520
Let's just like,
how do you think I got this?

1837
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,870
Uh,
people can say,

1838
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:32,704
well,
it was you got it through you and 

1839
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:34,780
inherited it.
Okay,

1840
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:35,614
that does happen.
I could also have got it through hard 

1841
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:38,554
work and dedication and some,
some guile and some smarts and made it 

1842
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:44,074
happen for myself.
Does that somehow mean that I had to do 

1843
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,960
it at the expense of someone else?
Not necessarily shitty argument.

1844
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:50,640
Right.
That's the,

1845
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,210
but that's the argument that they keep 
bringing us.

1846
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,350
But if you're successful,
you did it on the bits all grant.

1847
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:55,650
It's all grift.
Yeah.

1848
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:57,210
What do you think?
Why would,

1849
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,213
this is what I wanted to ask back from 
someone else is an interesting thing 

1850
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,280
too.
It's like if someone agrees to do a job,

1851
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:07,660
if their skill set is limited in such a 
way that they were owned,

1852
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:09,850
that they were capable of doing this job
at this moment.

1853
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:13,120
Now of course,
if you're asking me,

1854
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:14,163
they probably,
they have a potential to do more than 

1855
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:16,204
that.
As long as they're willing to invest 

1856
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:20,710
back in themselves and find another 
skill or expand that skill.

1857
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:25,300
You know there's always possibility for 
growth within a human being,

1858
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,163
within their lot in life,
whatever that is and that that could be 

1859
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:32,350
transferred into work could be 
transferred into a personal goals.

1860
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,930
I mean it's all about how you value 
things also.

1861
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:38,920
So this person gets into this job 
working,

1862
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,530
making widgets for this guy who invented
this widget.

1863
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,070
This guy invented the widget,
the argument that okay,

1864
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:47,560
the worker deserves just as much as the 
guy that invented it.

1865
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,394
It's like well hold on.
Without the guy that invented the 

1866
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:51,820
widget,
you have no job.

1867
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,830
Like all of these people that are 
working out,

1868
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,110
working underneath them get would have 
nothing.

1869
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,180
They would have zero,
there would be no widget to build.

1870
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,523
And the guy that made the widget also 
has the most responsibility because he 

1871
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:06,850
had to come up with the money to produce
the widget to be able to hire the people

1872
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,684
to make the widget,
to then market the widget to do all 

1873
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:10,100
these

1874
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,933
things to the widget to get it out there
to make it successful enough to then 

1875
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,054
support more people.
And that doesn't necessarily mean it's 

1876
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:20,660
on the back of that other person.
Because you could also say,

1877
01:17:20,661 --> 01:17:21,494
well,
is everything on the back of the guy 

1878
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:24,310
that made the widget?
I mean,

1879
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,690
do you just,
his idea is not worth it.

1880
01:17:26,691 --> 01:17:27,524
Is,
is not,

1881
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,260
can't be belonged to him because he 
created it.

1882
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:31,760
We,
we should take it for us,

1883
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,560
even though we never,
we did not come up with it.

1884
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:34,394
We never created it.
We didn't even have the facilities to 

1885
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:36,824
make to created and didn't invent it are
the ones who want to define how much 

1886
01:17:39,741 --> 01:17:42,350
this guy should get for inventing it 
versus how much they share.

1887
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:44,720
And I would get into arguments with my 
ex about,

1888
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:45,141
she's like,
oh,

1889
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:47,140
I think all businesses should be ops and
my thing.

1890
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,020
You're like,
what does that mean?

1891
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:48,883
Well cooperative where everybody is 
getting an equal share and into the 

1892
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:53,540
business itself.
Yeah,

1893
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:54,543
I would say it is hilarious and also 
because I would say all businesses can 

1894
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,950
be co ops.
There is no one stopping a business from

1895
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:03,440
being a co op.
We know it stops businesses from being a

1896
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:04,274
co op.
If somebody doesn't want it to be a co 

1897
01:18:04,991 --> 01:18:07,490
op or a,
someone decides,

1898
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:08,324
well that doesn't,
I can't do it that way so it won't make 

1899
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:12,254
as much sense for me to create a co op 
situation as it would to not or a colab 

1900
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,660
sounds nice and enforced.
Co op does not sound nice.

1901
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,650
Of course club sounds nice if like say 
if you and I live on a block and we say,

1902
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:24,140
Hey,
we got this fucking patch of land.

1903
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:26,900
Let's start a garden started a little 
small farm.

1904
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,590
Correct.
We'll just have a little co op here.

1905
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:29,001
Right.
All right,

1906
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:29,834
cool.
Great.

1907
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,680
Yeah.
Beautiful.

1908
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:33,020
But that's everybody doing volunteer and
says,

1909
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:34,940
Josh Barnett,
is this the Josh Barnett Farm?

1910
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:35,803
Yeah.
Well you're going to have to turn this 

1911
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:37,910
into a co op and you're like,
what the fuck I am.

1912
01:18:37,911 --> 01:18:39,080
Well,
we're going to put you in jail.

1913
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,260
Exactly.
And then it's,

1914
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,500
then it comes back down to violence.
Here's the question.

1915
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:44,960
This is what I kept meaning to ask 
before I forget.

1916
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,280
Do you think that the,
what do you think the numbers are of the

1917
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:53,030
people that are involved in these ideas 
that have never competed in anything?

1918
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:53,893
Now that's,
my ex girlfriend is a professional 

1919
01:18:57,351 --> 01:19:00,560
fighter and she fights in tour.
However,

1920
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:04,940
the idea of the meritocracy,
of being a fighter,

1921
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
it seems it's not,
I don't think it's lost on her.

1922
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:10,880
I just think that she,
she doesn't like the way it's worked out

1923
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:13,970
for her and that makes her an upset.

1924
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,193
Whereas for me,
I found success as being a fighter and 

1925
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:21,260
it sometimes it would appear that she 
would be,

1926
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:22,453
she would be upset at me for what I was 
able to do and somehow think that maybe 

1927
01:19:26,781 --> 01:19:29,240
I was less deserving or somehow,
um,

1928
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,800
it's an exception that who knows what,
but the reality is,

1929
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,040
is like I can sit back and go,
oh,

1930
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:39,041
Mark Hunt just made $800,000.
Her thought might,

1931
01:19:39,111 --> 01:19:40,590
it might be more,
let's say if we're,

1932
01:19:40,591 --> 01:19:42,050
we're just,
I'm making this up.

1933
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:44,180
I'm not saying that she said this,
you know,

1934
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:44,601
he's like,
well,

1935
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:45,434
why does he deserve $800,000?
Why I make a $4,000 or $5,000 or 

1936
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:51,260
whatever.
I've seen people say that,

1937
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:51,921
right?
It's just like,

1938
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:55,050
okay,
well I could think of plenty of reasons.

1939
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:58,310
And then he draws more tickets.
He's got a better record.

1940
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,540
He's,
he's one,

1941
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:02,000
he's a k one she champ or whatever,
you know,

1942
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,900
at the end of the day,
if any in New Zealand.

1943
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,620
Right,
right.

1944
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:07,560
And if he's selling more tickets than 
you are,

1945
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,830
then he gives it,
he deserves a greater percentage of that

1946
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:11,820
money.
Now,

1947
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:13,730
now you come to me and I'd be like,
well,

1948
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:14,970
I beat Mark Hunt.
Right?

1949
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:16,590
But what's her argument for that when 
you say that?

1950
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,920
Uh,
her argument for that would be that,

1951
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,083
you know,
this other person isn't any more 

1952
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:23,920
deserving than,

1953
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,430
so everybody should get paid the same.
So Jon Jones,

1954
01:20:26,431 --> 01:20:27,390
Fides,
Daniel Cormier,

1955
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:28,470
Yay.
Huge fight.

1956
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,630
Everybody on the undercard gets a fair 
share.

1957
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,380
Well either that or just like,
well,

1958
01:20:32,381 --> 01:20:33,910
I deserve more than this.
And it's,

1959
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,980
and my argument would always be when,
when,

1960
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:36,814
when she was upset about what she may be
getting paid here or there and some of 

1961
01:20:39,611 --> 01:20:39,941
this,
I'd go,

1962
01:20:39,941 --> 01:20:40,301
well,
look,

1963
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:40,771
you know,
for,

1964
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:41,604
for this,
for what we're trying to accomplish and 

1965
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:47,080
for what,
what is available in these markets,

1966
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,480
that's not a bad payday.
Well,

1967
01:20:49,481 --> 01:20:50,290
that sucks.
No,

1968
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:52,120
I agree with you.
You should make more money,

1969
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:54,730
but we can't,
it's not available.

1970
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,970
So we have to deal with what we have for
me.

1971
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:00,340
And then I would look at something like 
Mark Hunt and be like,

1972
01:21:00,341 --> 01:21:01,250
well,
I beat mark comp.

1973
01:21:01,251 --> 01:21:04,600
It's so what?
I'm more glad that Mark Hunt was able to

1974
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:09,630
create an opportunity to make $800,000 
so therefore if he can make $800,000 now

1975
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:11,500
the potential for me do that exists as 
well.

1976
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,633
And it's just similar to like the old 
Gina Carano thing where everyone got on 

1977
01:21:14,891 --> 01:21:17,060
a train about wanting to be Gina Carano 
fucked junior crunch,

1978
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:17,920
not even that good,
and blah,

1979
01:21:17,921 --> 01:21:18,191
blah,
blah,

1980
01:21:18,191 --> 01:21:18,441
blah,
blah.

1981
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:21,460
All this hate at Gina Carano.
When the reality is like,

1982
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:23,230
okay,
well even if you beat Gina Carano,

1983
01:21:23,231 --> 01:21:25,150
you're not going to get what Gina Carano
gets.

1984
01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:27,700
You're not going to get that and people 
aren't going to like you just as much or

1985
01:21:27,701 --> 01:21:29,830
more.
It's really not about any of that.

1986
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:31,570
The only thing you can control is 
yourself.

1987
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:34,600
At the end of the day,
you can only control yourself.

1988
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:35,434
You can,
you only you can can work to try and 

1989
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,103
increase or you're in determine your 
value in terms of what you're trying to 

1990
01:21:40,691 --> 01:21:44,110
sell,
but isn't part of selling today at least

1991
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,760
talk shit.
Some of it

1992
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:49,750
seems to be like because of honor his 
proficiency at it.

1993
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:50,613
Yeah.
And his massive financial success 

1994
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:53,390
because of it

1995
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,270
wins.
He wins all the time.

1996
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:56,104
He won belts,
he made very bold statements and then 

1997
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,540
went out in one.
Um,

1998
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,920
another person could then go and talk 
shit.

1999
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:07,000
Maybe they win and people still don't 
care as much.

2000
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,391
Right.
You know,

2001
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:08,224
you can't force people to care.
And what makes them care is a metric 

2002
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:13,660
that you just can't define.
You know,

2003
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:15,700
there's one way of doing it is to make 
them all hate you.

2004
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,430
But when you lose your,
your,

2005
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,800
what's going to happen is you're going 
to drop off.

2006
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,890
Often everything that you gained will be
lost.

2007
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,980
But as they hate you,
as you continue to win,

2008
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,880
they're going to be more in incited to 
watch you fight.

2009
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:32,920
They're going to be more interested to 
watch you fight.

2010
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,330
Big Guy like randy coture,
everybody loves.

2011
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:37,090
And even when he loses,
everybody loves in the same.

2012
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:37,440
Sure.

2013
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,273
And,
and you know how that combination comes 

2014
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:40,440
about is

2015
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:41,731
magic.
Well,

2016
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,680
I think with randy,
it's sincerity,

2017
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,461
but I think,
look,

2018
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:47,640
look at Kevin Lee and Michael 
[inaudible] from this past weekend.

2019
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,713
Perfect example of like a few of these 
guys put together talking shit to each 

2020
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:52,404
other at a press conference.
They get in a scuffle at a press 

2021
01:22:54,091 --> 01:22:57,390
conference and all of a sudden everybody
cares about the result of this fight.

2022
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:02,490
And then the fight has a controversial 
ending and now it's even more crazy.

2023
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,160
And now there's a lot of eyes on Kevin 
Lee and Michael Essa

2024
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,570
that three,
four months ago,

2025
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:10,120
just saying both guys are super 
talented,

2026
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:12,490
chef guys have some really good wins.
And um,

2027
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,860
I think Kevin Lee's get some real 
fucking potential.

2028
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,200
But people weren't really talking about 
on the way they are now.

2029
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,660
So a lot of other fighters are going to 
look at that and go,

2030
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,580
yeah,
that's what I gotta do.

2031
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:23,260
I've gotta Talk Shit on Gina Carano or 
I've got to talk shit on.

2032
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:26,440
A lot of that is,
is what,

2033
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:29,740
what the Gina Carano thing,
that was insecurity and that was also,

2034
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,780
she was a superstar and the only thing 
was,

2035
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:32,703
and people want it,
they thought that they could have what 

2036
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:37,210
she had by taking it from her.
And it's like,

2037
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:38,740
well,
that's not actually how it works.

2038
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:39,903
You can,
you can beat her and that'll definitely 

2039
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:42,304
do something for you and by fighting her
it's going to elevate your status but 

2040
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,380
not the same status.

2041
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,930
I know Holly Holm,
you're your own knocks out Rhonda.

2042
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,180
Sure.
I mean she devastated Rhonda,

2043
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:53,200
right?
She was the first one.

2044
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:54,060
Right.
Is undefeated.

2045
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:54,894
It looks like a tank that's coming at 
her and holly wines of head kicking her 

2046
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:58,840
and knocking her out.
I mean,

2047
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:02,350
holly is still a really highly respected
professional fighter,

2048
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,890
but you mean it's not the same?
It doesn't have the same.

2049
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:07,720
Well,
it also did something for her.

2050
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,583
Her accolades coming in,
so she's just heavily touted boxing 

2051
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:11,884
champion.
That boxing championship looks more 

2052
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:17,140
interesting now after she goes and she 
wins the MMA belt too.

2053
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,980
Let me ask you this,
why don't they set up Cyborg versus her?

2054
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,770
Isn't that the fight Cyborg versus Holly
Holm?

2055
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,080
Is Holly Holm drawn to me?
I don't know.

2056
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,180
A lot of people thought Holly Holm 
should have won that fight.

2057
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:29,913
It was a very close fight and Duran to 
me definitely hit her twice after the 

2058
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,423
bell.

2059
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:37,840
Really significant and should have been 
a penalization.

2060
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,153
So why the fuck is holly fighting?
I know she just fought [inaudible] but 

2061
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:46,000
as soon as Megan Anderson dropped off,
if holly could take it,

2062
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:47,340
I mean she didn't have,
I love,

2063
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,940
she was not injured.
It maybe she is.

2064
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,030
Who knows?
She might be managers.

2065
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,140
Yeah.
Who knows lookers.

2066
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,620
Who knows?
Who knows what,

2067
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:55,720
but that's the fight.
That's an interesting fight.

2068
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:58,090
Holly versus Cyborg is the fucking 
fight.

2069
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,953
It would be a great fight.
I think people would be interested to 

2070
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:01,324
watch it,
but for sure not the fight it's being 

2071
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:03,124
made and say we don't Tonya average 
juror stepping up and fighting a Cyborg 

2072
01:25:06,491 --> 01:25:07,110
and Stan.
Yeah,

2073
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,300
and short notice,
you know,

2074
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,420
but Tanya's a Gamer,
she's very tough.

2075
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:11,613
She will fight anybody.
He would fight the fight because of 

2076
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:15,280
that,
because she's so tough.

2077
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:16,450
That's what makes it exciting.

2078
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,950
But you know,
cyborgs.

2079
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:20,230
That giant person is,
she was massive.

2080
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:22,330
She bought for explosive,
which to me,

2081
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,613
explosiveness in women's MMA is a 
massive difference between success and 

2082
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:31,000
not like if you're,
if you're super explosive,

2083
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,880
like that usually makes a massive,
a big difference.

2084
01:25:33,881 --> 01:25:34,714
In terms of your success rate,
did you see cyborgs barn with Claressa 

2085
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:40,570
shields two time Olympic gold medal in 
boxing and hanging in there?

2086
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:41,081
Man.
I mean,

2087
01:25:41,081 --> 01:25:43,990
she's an outbox for sure,
but not by much.

2088
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:47,860
She landed some good shots.
She's still game and moving forward,

2089
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,083
fighting and throwing stuff.
Dangerous and dangerous against a super 

2090
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:53,224
high level boxer.
A girl that's even arguably bigger than 

2091
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:57,520
her too.
Yeah,

2092
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:58,740
and lightening fast.
Yeah,

2093
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:00,123
but watching shields,
like we've set things up and use that 

2094
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:03,070
jab like,
dude,

2095
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,913
I just want to

2096
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,480
learn some fucking sprawl 
specialization.

2097
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,493
You know?
That's the thing about boxing and the 

2098
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,210
connor and mayweather fight is it's the 
specialization of,

2099
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:18,140
of a boxer versus the MMA person.
I would say the MMA fighters,

2100
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:20,060
the superior fighter,
right.

2101
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:20,963
When you,
when you start to me the most open and 

2102
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:23,901
he,
the most,

2103
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:25,850
even playing field is the one that has 
at least rules.

2104
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:31,370
But by funneling that down to those 
specific skill sets with boxing,

2105
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:32,563
you create a specialized athlete.
While there are skills with boxing that 

2106
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:40,010
will transfer to mma,
even just in terms of boxing,

2107
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,660
uh,
the,

2108
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,853
the,
the timing and the footwork that you 

2109
01:26:44,481 --> 01:26:49,040
might use in boxing isn't necessarily 
what you would use in mma and uh,

2110
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:51,450
and vice versa.
Distance.

2111
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:53,210
Right.
But so I see that,

2112
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,073
you know,
it would be great if conor goes out 

2113
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:57,590
there and wins.
It would make mma look that much bigger,

2114
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,700
you know,
but uh,

2115
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,590
and he's got the power and he,
he's a,

2116
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:02,840
he's a great athlete and he's got good 
timing and accuracy.

2117
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:04,463
I just don't see him being able to get 
flush on mayweather the way that it's 

2118
01:27:07,521 --> 01:27:08,354
going to be needed.
It seems highly unlikely unless he old 

2119
01:27:10,621 --> 01:27:12,710
school Bernard Hopkins Hymns,
you know,

2120
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:16,000
remember Bernard used to fight,
he's to clinch guys and just sear.

2121
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,810
Sure.
Off muffin clinch outside.

2122
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:18,644
He was just straight defensive.
But do you really think that boxing 

2123
01:27:20,421 --> 01:27:22,490
referee's are going to let that happen?
I don't know.

2124
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:23,324
And there's going to be even more 
eyeballs on conner to diminish that 

2125
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,023
aspect because they're going to be 
expecting him to do stuff like that 

2126
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:32,780
anyways there or you know there's,
I'm sure there's already,

2127
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:38,110
I've heard that there are elements in 
the contract about kicks and things like

2128
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:40,010
that.
They have to put that in there.

2129
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:40,844
That would have to put that in there,
some sort of side dish to haul off and 

2130
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:43,490
kick him and that's it.

2131
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,600
You lose all your money.
Yeah,

2132
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,880
that makes sense.
But I feel like if you,

2133
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:50,480
if you looked at conner and like his 
skill set,

2134
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:51,314
like what's what he's capable of doing.
Like overall I could see how he would 

2135
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:58,220
think like man,
it's just striking.

2136
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,500
I feel like I could probably get close 
enough.

2137
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,390
Yeah,
I can get off on anybody.

2138
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:03,224
Sure.
But that level that floyd mayweather is 

2139
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:09,860
at like to have zero professional boxing
fights and to spar with him and you know

2140
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:10,843
also from Congress perspective he's 
thinking I this is a chance to be a 

2141
01:28:13,881 --> 01:28:14,714
hero.
This is another opportunity to be a 

2142
01:28:16,011 --> 01:28:19,400
hero.
I have hardly anything to lose,

2143
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,263
if at all.
And all to gain the potential of 

2144
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:25,250
winning.
I also have a big payday winter lose,

2145
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:30,200
so everything works out towards a win 
win situation for him.

2146
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:31,413
You know,
it would've been great if connor could 

2147
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:35,120
get,
get this stipulation will only box,

2148
01:28:35,121 --> 01:28:38,160
but we were mma gloves.
Yeah.

2149
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:41,420
Well a floyd has had issues with his 
hands in the past,

2150
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:44,420
which is why he almost exclusively 
where's winning gloves in the there.

2151
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:47,350
So that would never happen.
Thick fat glass.

2152
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:49,490
And I think they're fighting with 10 
ounce gloves too.

2153
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,170
It's a big glove.
Tends not eight.

2154
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:52,280
No,
I don't think so.

2155
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:53,114
I think the,
the agreed upon weight was 10 see if 

2156
01:28:54,861 --> 01:28:56,240
that's the case.
Is that the case?

2157
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,133
Yeah.
Ah,

2158
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:57,920
ah,
I'm surprised.

2159
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,753
Interesting.
I would've thought eights something a 

2160
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:01,920
little bit like what?
147 pounds

2161
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,780
or 150

2162
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,090
fight.
55 okay.

2163
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,003
And I think I thought 60 was the cutoff,
but [inaudible] 68 or one 74 where they 

2164
01:29:10,851 --> 01:29:12,240
go to 10.
Huh.

2165
01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:15,410
But uh,
either way much bigger than four.

2166
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,030
Which is what gs accustomed to.
Yeah.

2167
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:19,730
And I feel like if,
but look man,

2168
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,920
it's still,
you know,

2169
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:22,754
I had a conversation with a buddy of 
mine who's a really good jujitsu black 

2170
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:25,634
belt and he was gonna fight in mma and 
he had very little sparring in terms of 

2171
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:31,640
like mma sparring or very little,
uh,

2172
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,650
kickboxing sparring,
almost no strike king.

2173
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,121
And uh,
I said,

2174
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:35,954
you know how you can do things to be 
bull on the ground where you get some 

2175
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:38,924
guy who does know what he's doing,
you can just do whatever the fuck you 

2176
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:40,880
want to him.
I go,

2177
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:41,930
this guy's,
they can do that too.

2178
01:29:41,931 --> 01:29:42,764
Standing up like you gotta be careful.
Like you can't get this in your head 

2179
01:29:46,221 --> 01:29:48,740
that you're awesome at something.
So you're awesome at everything,

2180
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,401
right.
Cause the,

2181
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:52,730
the type of mentality that a person has 
to become,

2182
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:57,290
whether it's a championship level mma 
fighter or a boxers that that focus,

2183
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,500
that intense focus.
Like sometimes guys get twisted and they

2184
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:02,720
think that because of my Brazilian 
Jujitsu champion,

2185
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:06,620
I can be a kickboxing champion.
I could be an MMA champion,

2186
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,280
do whatever the fuck I want to do,
but the road is long,

2187
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:11,810
man,
the road is long.

2188
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:12,693
People forget all that they went through
to acquire such a set of skills to get 

2189
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:20,410
there in the first place.
And I understand that,

2190
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,280
you know,
a highly,

2191
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:22,143
highly specialized Jujitsu or wrestler 
can go out there and experience success 

2192
01:30:26,111 --> 01:30:28,480
in mma right away.
However,

2193
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,553
like you said,
they might come across that guy who is 

2194
01:30:31,661 --> 01:30:32,494
so good on their feet that they can do 
the whatever they want to to that guy 

2195
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,513
and just leave them clueless and when,
or does he take them down or there's 

2196
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:43,240
that where that there's that person that
you're just not able,

2197
01:30:43,241 --> 01:30:44,680
you take them down once,
twice,

2198
01:30:44,681 --> 01:30:47,830
but they could keep your Mac their feet.
Now all of a sudden you're tired.

2199
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:51,520
You've been pushing so much harder 
because you can't fight Eh,

2200
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,120
a,
a plan B or,

2201
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:53,954
or in this other plane you have to fight
within the plane that you're an expert 

2202
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:59,620
because you put all your marbles in one 
basket,

2203
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,613
not a mighty mouse.
So you can kind of do it all in any 

2204
01:31:02,361 --> 01:31:03,194
forum.
Your a Damien Maia who's learned how to 

2205
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:08,330
kickbox got really good at it,
but when you fight Damien Maia,

2206
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,340
you know,
real clear what his plan is

2207
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,930
for sure.
And even still at Damien Maia has,

2208
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:13,823
has learned to create striking that that
helps mitigate other people's striking 

2209
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:21,380
so that he can get his best game off.
Yeah.

2210
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:22,283
So that's still a type of standup work 
that he's working on within that has 

2211
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:30,120
been specialized for mma as he fights in
the UFC.

2212
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:31,223
Do you agree though

2213
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:35,840
that a guy like conor mcgregor would 
have way more like,

2214
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,753
I feel like the odds of floyd beating 
conor are extremely high in a boxing 

2215
01:31:42,461 --> 01:31:45,590
match and the nine high 90% sure.
Right.

2216
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:51,030
But the odds of connor beating floyd an 
MMA match or 100 pretty much.

2217
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Pretty much 199.9999999 Connie would 
have to like really fuck up.

2218
01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:00,030
He'd have to get chin checked.
Yeah.

2219
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,460
Doing something stupid now he would just
not kicking,

2220
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:04,121
right?
Yeah.

2221
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:05,890
He would kick the shit out of his leg.
This isn't,

2222
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:07,540
this isn't a fight about who's a better 
fighter.

2223
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,374
Right.
This is a fight about who's a better 

2224
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:09,760
boxer.
Yeah.

2225
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,013
And the idea that Congress is going to 
step in and just clang floyd with a 

2226
01:32:15,401 --> 01:32:19,990
straight left is almost as ridiculous as
the idea that flow is going to step into

2227
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:22,900
an mma fight and catch connor with a big
punch and knock them out.

2228
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:24,490
Ray Mercer,
Tim,

2229
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,620
Tim Silvia,
Silvia style.

2230
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,800
I say it's more like floyd mayweather 
jumping in that cage and armbarring car.

2231
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:34,300
You know,
it's like that.

2232
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:36,870
Yeah.
Catching him in a fucking rolling teen.

2233
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:39,160
Yeah.
Fucking victor role and do a knee bar.

2234
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,213
Get hit him with an MNR.
He's been catch him with one of them 

2235
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,000
crazy heel hooks,
like you know floyd and his heel hooks.

2236
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,280
Ah,
well when,

2237
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:49,930
that was one of the crazy things with 
James.

2238
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:50,764
Tony fought randy coture like there's 
all these people speculating like how 

2239
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:58,180
much James Tony had been training mma 
and then he got to see him do some stuff

2240
01:32:58,181 --> 01:32:59,950
with like an MMA trainer and you're 
like,

2241
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,581
oh,
okay.

2242
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:03,340
He's not barely doing this.
He's barely doing this.

2243
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:04,500
He does that.
He stopped.

2244
01:33:04,501 --> 01:33:05,710
He doesn't know anything.
Well,

2245
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:08,050
this is crazy.
And then randy just goes out there.

2246
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,570
The angle,
the single and the ankle just falls over

2247
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:12,280
in that end of that night.
Yeah.

2248
01:33:12,281 --> 01:33:14,470
Low single randy on top.
That's a wrap.

2249
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,333
Randy was merciful though.
I mean you punched him a few times and 

2250
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:18,400
then just choked him.
Yeah.

2251
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:19,720
Yeah.
Randy isn't really,

2252
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:23,110
he wasn't known for being a particularly
vicious competitor.

2253
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:24,183
You have a feeling you probably would 
have treated that situation slightly 

2254
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:27,700
differently.
Yeah.

2255
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:29,620
I would've tried to term absolutely limb
from limb.

2256
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,161
Not,
not,

2257
01:33:30,161 --> 01:33:33,760
not because of any particular personal 
animosity,

2258
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:34,594
just because I go out there to wreck 
people because I want to make sure that 

2259
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:39,670
if I'm winning,
I'm winning.

2260
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:42,580
But if you had a guy like,
like a James Tony on the ground who came

2261
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:43,910
in from pr,
professional boxing,

2262
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:44,773
no one may fights,
would you have it in your mind that you 

2263
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:48,700
need to prove a point?
Did you have in your mind just finishing

2264
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,980
when you can smash them any way 
possible?

2265
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:53,050
You know,
I chop his leg,

2266
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:55,300
whatever,
shoot a double blow through them,

2267
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:56,223
get on top and then just start doing 
whatever is available for such a nice 

2268
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:00,844
guy and such a well spoken guy.
You enjoy hurting people in a very 

2269
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:05,750
disturbing way.
I,

2270
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:07,480
it's what I'm good at.
It's what I was,

2271
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:08,653
that's what I,
I learned at an early age that it was 

2272
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:11,740
something that I excelled at.

2273
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,633
I asked you just in partly to see your 
response because I knew that you're 

2274
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,223
going to get worked up about it and he 
were to think about smashing him and 

2275
01:34:19,271 --> 01:34:20,104
like what you would do.
Like it's seen in your eyes thinking 

2276
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,190
about taking them down.
I love,

2277
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,050
I love,
that's part of the reason why by leaving

2278
01:34:26,051 --> 01:34:26,884
fighting I know was going to be tough 
not competing because I love going out 

2279
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:35,800
there and in some way it is.
I was explaining this,

2280
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:39,220
I was actually out of philosophical 
lecture the other night and uh,

2281
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,690
cause I'm a big fan of philosophy.
What was the philosophical,

2282
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:43,211
well,
this,

2283
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:48,211
this lecture was on 16 part series on a 
America and it was this last one.

2284
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,980
This friend of mine hit me up.
She goes,

2285
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:52,660
hey,
this thing's going down,

2286
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,760
uh,
at this,

2287
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,820
this,
this school.

2288
01:34:54,821 --> 01:34:55,654
So,
hey,

2289
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,920
why don't,
why don't we go check it out?

2290
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:57,861
All right,
cool.

2291
01:34:57,861 --> 01:34:58,250
And so

2292
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:03,250
it had something to do with the futurism
and I forget what else,

2293
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:07,010
but as the lecture was going on,
people would chime in and say stuff.

2294
01:35:07,011 --> 01:35:09,410
And so at one point,
I'm listening to some of these,

2295
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,270
these arguments that I'm just going,
man,

2296
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,300
you just don't really,
you don't understand people that well.

2297
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,271
I mean,
every,

2298
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:21,320
a lot of these arguments always come 
from some idea of a base motivation from

2299
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:22,154
somebody.
Like the idea that all capitalism is 

2300
01:35:23,811 --> 01:35:24,531
theft.
It's like,

2301
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:25,131
well,
you know,

2302
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:25,964
you don't have to be a horrible person 
to operate successfully within a 

2303
01:35:29,661 --> 01:35:30,494
capitalist system.
Just as much as just because you create 

2304
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:35,780
a communist system doesn't necessarily 
make you benevolent.

2305
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:39,500
Because as you will look in the Soviet 
Union and as you've had,

2306
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,380
um,
uh,

2307
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,010
um,
Robert,

2308
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,461
uh,
our,

2309
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:44,660
uh,
Jordan Peterson on here,

2310
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:46,550
and he'll tell you all of the elements 
of,

2311
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:50,240
of the brutality of communist systems.

2312
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,073
And then of course,
I remember being in the 80s and even 

2313
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:56,090
seeing a slides from,
uh,

2314
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:56,924
one of my teachers who was over in the 
Soviet Union and sneaking photos out of 

2315
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,690
the USSR because they didn't want any 
photos of,

2316
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:08,000
of living conditions and all these sorts
of things,

2317
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:09,253
bread lines,
all that stuff brought back to the 

2318
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:13,670
western world because they felt it would
make them look bad.

2319
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,421
Well,
of course,

2320
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:16,250
because it did,
you know,

2321
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,084
and people were entrenched in these 
systems and abusing these systems to 

2322
01:36:20,001 --> 01:36:22,760
their benefit,
just like Paul or politicians abused our

2323
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:23,594
system to their benefit,
just like all human beings will abuse 

2324
01:36:26,241 --> 01:36:29,090
the system to its benefit when given the
chance to do so,

2325
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,193
either out of selfishness to the point 
of maliciousness or even just direct 

2326
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:36,290
maliciousness.
So the human element is the,

2327
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,343
the key process in all systems there.
They're pretty much the cause of all 

2328
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:41,774
systems failing.

2329
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,613
And they always will be.
But when you try to create some other 

2330
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:49,760
roundabout idea,
you try to assign,

2331
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,830
uh,
you know,

2332
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,280
these other crazy concepts as to why or 
you know,

2333
01:36:55,281 --> 01:36:56,114
you create these micro group I 
ideologies and you distill and distill 

2334
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:02,300
and distill and you constantly create 
like with,

2335
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:03,920
with Marxism,
it's a conflict theory.

2336
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:06,010
So there's always has to be some sort of
a presser.

2337
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,520
There always has to be a conflict.
And you know,

2338
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:10,220
a lot of human beings aren't out there 
trying to oppress people.

2339
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,830
They're just trying to get theirs and or
you know,

2340
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:15,220
creating their little tribes and 
creating what they,

2341
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,480
you know,
to use a overused word,

2342
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:22,070
safe space for themself that which they 
understand this area.

2343
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:22,904
They understand these demarcations about
this group and these people and this 

2344
01:37:26,481 --> 01:37:30,200
thing and even this area of land in 
which you live in,

2345
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,660
you know,
the idea of going,

2346
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:35,270
I know I'm going off on a tangent here 
from our original discussion,

2347
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:38,870
but the idea of like personal property 
and you know,

2348
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:41,000
you have your fence line around let's 
say a piece of property.

2349
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:41,833
I was walking through Joshua Tree and 
looking at all this stuff and pondering 

2350
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:46,470
some things and,
and you know that,

2351
01:37:46,471 --> 01:37:47,304
that that property line isn't just about
me owning this and keeping other people 

2352
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:52,910
out and being and looking at it and 
someone wants to say,

2353
01:37:52,911 --> 01:37:53,744
Oh,
you just want to be selfish and own and 

2354
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:57,000
be greedy and dominate something.
And it's like,

2355
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:57,834
well actually think about it this way.
That line is the same as an extension 

2356
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:04,170
from my own personal space.
You know,

2357
01:38:04,171 --> 01:38:06,840
I know you so fuck,
you know,

2358
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:07,674
you can get right in my personal space 
and I don't care because we've already 

2359
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:12,420
vetted each other.
We've already had a relationship.

2360
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,330
W I,
I,

2361
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,500
I have a good understanding of who you 
are as Joe Rogan and,

2362
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:17,383
and your being in the world and you 
understand me to a degree as well as 

2363
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:23,640
Josh Barnett versus some guy just shows 
up at your house versus some guys,

2364
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:24,331
some things,
some,

2365
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,210
anything that you don't know you don't 
know is,

2366
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,620
so you have this fence line is,
is what you're doing is you're,

2367
01:38:29,621 --> 01:38:31,890
you're creating this space that is just 
in a person.

2368
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:32,783
It's just an extension of your own 
personal bubble of your own personal 

2369
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,083
safe space.
And so within that you feel like you've 

2370
01:38:38,011 --> 01:38:39,360
vetted it,
you know these rocks,

2371
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:41,240
you know these planets,
you understand the,

2372
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:43,950
the pluses and minuses of this area that
exists.

2373
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,933
And so within this place of existence,
you can be your most authentic self 

2374
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,720
without any concern of the rest of the 
world.

2375
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:56,310
Now if somebody's something was to come 
and want to cross that line,

2376
01:38:56,311 --> 01:38:57,240
you'd want to say,
well,

2377
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:58,343
I don't know what it is yet.
So I want to vet that source and then 

2378
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:02,911
say,
okay,

2379
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:03,691
yeah,
it's okay.

2380
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:05,760
I'll allow you into my,
into my space,

2381
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:06,594
into my area.
And so now you too can also be open to 

2382
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:13,110
the vulnerability that I'm giving you 
because that's what it is.

2383
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:13,944
You know,
our personal space is about our 

2384
01:39:14,521 --> 01:39:18,180
vulnerability,
about the ability for someone else to,

2385
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:19,683
you know,
interact with us physically as well as 

2386
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:22,134
emotionally.

2387
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:26,550
And so even just having your little 
cabin with your little fence,

2388
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:28,920
that little thing isn't just again,
have that right.

2389
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:33,150
It is a Marxist ideas of no private 
property and acre.

2390
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,043
Yeah.
There's not like a lot of full on old 

2391
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:37,704
school marxists anymore.
They're all pretty much neo marxists 

2392
01:39:39,241 --> 01:39:40,074
from the,
as as Peterson and other people have 

2393
01:39:42,181 --> 01:39:45,330
described from the Frankford schools,
uh,

2394
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,620
you know,
uh,

2395
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:50,130
uh,
permeating into the academia and,

2396
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:53,670
and going after the,
the superstructure instead of the base.

2397
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:54,653
I think this is an undeniable aspect 
that you talked about before were with 

2398
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:59,610
your ex girlfriend at least,
or with some people like that.

2399
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:00,444
We don't even have to single out her 
that people that are not successful in 

2400
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:04,053
this,
in the competition of life seek to 

2401
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,790
diminish the success of those around 
them.

2402
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:09,980
And yes.
Yeah.

2403
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,120
Which is,
so it's,

2404
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:16,140
it's the other thing about that is the 
value that you create where,

2405
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,790
where,
what is your values were,

2406
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:21,090
what is your value system and,
and how is that going to influence you?

2407
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:22,163
So if you,
if your value system is based on 

2408
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:26,310
external elements,
like,

2409
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,870
you know,
Nisha talks about the,

2410
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:32,820
the danger of unchecked envy,
envy being a life affirming element.

2411
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:35,130
You know,
if I envy Joe Rogan and his podcast,

2412
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:37,680
which I do,
I can see that,

2413
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:39,630
well joe was able to create this 
podcast.

2414
01:40:39,631 --> 01:40:41,880
So the possibility exists.
So for,

2415
01:40:41,881 --> 01:40:42,714
for a person to create a podcast and 
they'd be successful with and expand 

2416
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:45,624
from there on out so that mv can drive 
me to then work towards it because I 

2417
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:49,374
know it's a possibility.
Having unchecked envy would be to be 

2418
01:40:52,051 --> 01:40:54,460
angry at you for having that podcast

2419
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,720
and thinking that,
well,

2420
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:56,613
you know,
he's got this thing and I want that 

2421
01:40:58,151 --> 01:41:00,040
thing.
How do I deserve it too?

2422
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:02,350
And I don't have dessert.
It burn it to the ground.

2423
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,690
Why?
Because you're so upset about it.

2424
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,510
But that's the lowest of self esteems 
right?

2425
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,830
The people that not only do they not 
think they can't compete,

2426
01:41:08,831 --> 01:41:09,664
they don't want anyone to be successful 
because they don't think they're ever 

2427
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,800
going to be every day without social,
with,

2428
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:15,010
through,
throughout social media.

2429
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:15,844
People are seeing Mandy manufactured 
manicured interpretations of life and 

2430
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,600
thinking and weighing themselves against
that.

2431
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:23,613
So that's just one example of how you 
are using these external forces to 

2432
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,813
determine your value systems are putting
value on things that are beyond your 

2433
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:34,864
control or,
or putting value in areas that are 

2434
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:38,290
unnecessary,
that are actually harmful to you.

2435
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:39,124
And so people,
if I had to just walk away from 

2436
01:41:42,821 --> 01:41:45,100
everything,
like my muscle cars and all that stuff,

2437
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:47,440
and I know,
I know it's a horrible thought.

2438
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:50,010
I have a,
I have some projects that are,

2439
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,980
that are going to be to completion here 
soon that are,

2440
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:52,814
I'm just so looking forward to,
are you still driving the challenge of 

2441
01:41:54,301 --> 01:41:56,190
though that your main mode of 
transportation is?

2442
01:41:56,191 --> 01:41:57,024
My daily driver,
but I'm replacing it with a 75 formula 

2443
01:41:58,931 --> 01:41:59,764
firebird with four 55 that I punched out
the four 70 automatic overdrive trans 

2444
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:08,410
and hotchkiss suspension,
wilwood brakes all the way around on it.

2445
01:42:08,411 --> 01:42:10,480
It's going to be fucking great.
Nine inch board in the back.

2446
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:14,500
Speaking of which Gabriel Iglesias was 
just on Jay Leno's garage.

2447
01:42:14,501 --> 01:42:15,334
Yeah.
And he's got a dope Burt Reynolds 

2448
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:19,250
fucking smoking the bandit Trans Am.
Yeah,

2449
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:20,830
they do build them up for the new 
Camaro's.

2450
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,760
Yeah,
he was loving it.

2451
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,200
But is that what his,
his,

2452
01:42:23,201 --> 01:42:25,020
his,
his from the delta,

2453
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:25,883
the new Camaro.
I just saw the picture of him with 

2454
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:29,020
standing with Jay next to the car.

2455
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,500
That car looks,
it is a,

2456
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:31,343
it's a sweet car.
I've seen him at Sema car that doesn't 

2457
01:42:33,341 --> 01:42:37,020
impress girls at all.
That's only for Liga,

2458
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,030
that fucking thing.
So that's based on the one on the left.

2459
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:45,100
The one on the left is a real old one.
27 78 has a brand new one.

2460
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:47,210
Holy Shit.
So there's,

2461
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:48,123
Oh my God.
They put a front new new nose piece on 

2462
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,310
it and they put the Shaker scoop.
They put it and this one he put it,

2463
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,950
they put an ls three and because they do
all this stuff for folks,

2464
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:58,840
folks who don't know it doesn't even 
exist anymore.

2465
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:01,620
I wonder if they could do that with the 
Zl one.

2466
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,413
I'll do it with anyone.
Zl One of the fastest cars to ever lap 

2467
01:43:05,961 --> 01:43:06,794
the nurburgring yes.
Faster than the corporate zero six 

2468
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:09,484
fascinating.
It's incredible what we're doing with 

2469
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:11,440
cars.

2470
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,690
But if I had to give all the shit out 
now,

2471
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:16,030
if I have to give all this shit up,
I would hate it.

2472
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,710
That's amazing.
I would hate it.

2473
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,421
Love it.
Yeah.

2474
01:43:19,421 --> 01:43:21,790
It's a burt burt reynolds addition.
Holy Shit.

2475
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:22,980
He signed it.
Yeah.

2476
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:26,650
So,
but if I did truth be told,

2477
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:30,460
I look at the hearse shifter as hard as 
a rock truth.

2478
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:32,290
Truth be told,
I can,

2479
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:33,243
I can get rid of all these things.
I can be free of all of that stuff and 

2480
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:39,750
still have a life that makes me highly,
uh,

2481
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:42,220
happy craves Nancy.
I know.

2482
01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:45,030
I don't want to,
I just want to get crazy extreme.

2483
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:45,873
Those Marxists.
They're fucking with your head man to 

2484
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:48,730
change in your value.
You know,

2485
01:43:48,731 --> 01:43:51,160
they want to take my firebird and my gt 
500,

2486
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:53,360
all that stuff,
but uh,

2487
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:55,730
and I can't help it that my car has more
boosts in yours.

2488
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:56,570
Yeah,
you can't.

2489
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:57,403
But,
uh,

2490
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:58,790
uh,
the thing is,

2491
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:01,340
is that it's where I put my values were 
what,

2492
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:02,174
what,
what is valuable to me and what's 

2493
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:07,340
valuable and living and being so for 
someone else,

2494
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:09,700
they put these things on other stuff and
they,

2495
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:10,534
they give responsibility.
What they end up doing is transferring 

2496
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:13,574
that power to external sources.
And when you start working off of 

2497
01:44:15,471 --> 01:44:20,471
external sources as your,
your value is your value system,

2498
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:23,360
then you've taken away that power from 
yourself.

2499
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:24,830
Right.
And so,

2500
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,050
well,
there's also the rejection.

2501
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:30,770
I have a rejection of the idea that you 
can enjoy people's creations.

2502
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:32,690
I think of a car is a creation.
Yeah.

2503
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:36,020
I'm going to think of it a lot of ways 
is like a mass produced piece of art.

2504
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,780
Sure.
You know what someone's done in creating

2505
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:39,531
like that?
Uh,

2506
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:40,790
that new a,
what is it?

2507
01:44:40,791 --> 01:44:41,730
The Demon?
Yeah.

2508
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:42,770
Dodge demon.
Right.

2509
01:44:42,771 --> 01:44:44,960
That challenge or that we'll go nine 
sixties.

2510
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:47,960
It goes zero to 60 in less than three 
seconds.

2511
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,360
And it's a production car.
You can't drive it.

2512
01:44:50,361 --> 01:44:54,230
If it's colder than 15 degrees out,
he can't drive it.

2513
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:55,640
It's like,
it's such a,

2514
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:56,743
it's such a fucked up car.
But like that to me is I'm fascinated 

2515
01:45:00,451 --> 01:45:02,240
that someone chose to make it.
I liked,

2516
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:05,720
if I look at that the same way I look at
them doing space exploration,

2517
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:06,320
like,
oh,

2518
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,330
that's all going to trickle down to 
regular cars.

2519
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:09,021
Sure.
You know,

2520
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:10,880
they're going to figure out how to make 
tank out of this.

2521
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:11,714
Sure.
And that's the thing is that these 

2522
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:15,260
things wouldn't exist if people weren't 
driven to,

2523
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:17,450
uh,
to express their will,

2524
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:18,284
to power and grow,
to want to be their greatest version of 

2525
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:21,194
themselves,
to create a greater thing than the last 

2526
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,960
thing to,
to push that envelope.

2527
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:24,794
Right.
And while it's not always going to be 

2528
01:45:25,551 --> 01:45:26,384
successful,
it's the idea of creating something 

2529
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:28,491
greater and greater,
greater.

2530
01:45:28,491 --> 01:45:29,001
Now,
I mean,

2531
01:45:29,001 --> 01:45:30,980
there's the argument with,
with science that there's always a,

2532
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:32,173
you know,
is it,

2533
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:33,283
uh,
should,

2534
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:34,610
uh,
or could,

2535
01:45:34,611 --> 01:45:35,444
uh,
you know,

2536
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:36,313
of course there is an element of ethics.
It has to play into that I think that 

2537
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:40,303
you need to be aware of and is also with
objects you don't want to get obsessed 

2538
01:45:44,241 --> 01:45:45,500
and fixated on that.
Rejects,

2539
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:48,980
but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy a 
new laptop.

2540
01:45:49,130 --> 01:45:50,150
Right.
Well,

2541
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:50,984
and I think that a lot of these,
these new like champagne socialist type 

2542
01:45:54,351 --> 01:45:55,640
folks,
they,

2543
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:58,220
they enjoy,
they enjoy these,

2544
01:45:58,221 --> 01:45:59,030
the new lab laptops

2545
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:01,000
in the new iphones and all that stuff 
and it's,

2546
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:05,000
they love all the modern conveniences of
the capitalist country that we live in.

2547
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:06,163
And you know,
if someone wanted to sit down and talk 

2548
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:08,384
to me about the,
the danger they out the elements of our 

2549
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:15,790
society,
of our capitalist economy and how it,

2550
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:17,300
it is an,
is an issue,

2551
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,520
the issues within it now.
Totally.

2552
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:20,301
I get it.
No,

2553
01:46:20,301 --> 01:46:22,190
our system is fucked up and a lot of 
ways,

2554
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,500
don't get me wrong,
but by replacing it with,

2555
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:26,120
with,
uh,

2556
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:29,480
you know,
some sort of a Marxist system now you're

2557
01:46:29,481 --> 01:46:30,680
just asking for,
I mean,

2558
01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:31,514
we already have enough trouble with 
people in power being unsuitable and in 

2559
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:36,614
a sense like us being hiving of very 
ineffective way of really effecting our 

2560
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:42,644
political system and creating change 
within it and having things taken away 

2561
01:46:48,430 --> 01:46:50,760
or new laws created,
altered,

2562
01:46:50,761 --> 01:46:52,080
like it's so impossible.

2563
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,670
Right.
But it's like,

2564
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:54,533
it's a system that works outside of us,
even though we're supposedly the ones 

2565
01:46:58,441 --> 01:47:00,360
that can quick can control it.
But,

2566
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:01,430
uh,
it,

2567
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:02,610
you create a,
uh,

2568
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:04,470
a communist system,
right?

2569
01:47:04,471 --> 01:47:07,050
You create a full states,
a secured system,

2570
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,570
you really have no ability to affect 
that,

2571
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:10,623
right.
Without some sort of a violent 

2572
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:13,530
revolution,
which,

2573
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,790
uh,
doesn't,

2574
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:17,030
not probably in your best interest,
uh,

2575
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,040
with the way technology and military and
all that stuff.

2576
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:20,874
I mean,
it's just,

2577
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:21,773
I mean,
no one wants to things to get to that 

2578
01:47:23,191 --> 01:47:24,130
point.
And so,

2579
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:26,820
so they always preach a ramp down 
version of it though,

2580
01:47:26,821 --> 01:47:27,960
because like the,
well,

2581
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:29,250
there's never any true,
by the way,

2582
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:32,280
there's never been a true,
a true communist system or they're never

2583
01:47:32,281 --> 01:47:34,860
been true Marxism.
It's always the fucking no true scotsman

2584
01:47:34,861 --> 01:47:35,581
fallacy.
It's like,

2585
01:47:35,581 --> 01:47:37,260
it never happened.
This never happened yet.

2586
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,700
It's like,
what the fuck do you think the,

2587
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:40,830
the,
the Soviets were doing?

2588
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:43,680
What do you think that the malice,
they all thought they were doing it.

2589
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:44,101
Right.
Right.

2590
01:47:44,101 --> 01:47:45,060
You know,
but it,

2591
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,850
and even then when you go to look at 
China nowadays,

2592
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:48,703
like,
well,

2593
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:49,643
they got all these capitalists elements 
within it that are making their economy 

2594
01:47:51,901 --> 01:47:55,610
just fucking flush with money,
so flushed with money that they're,

2595
01:47:55,611 --> 01:47:56,040
they're like,
oh,

2596
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,150
I don't want to give it to the 
government.

2597
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,313
So they send it all over to Vancouver 
and buy up all these houses and stuff 

2598
01:48:00,691 --> 01:48:05,430
like this and then have their teenage 
kid lived there all over Hollywood,

2599
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:06,390
even Bel Air.
Right.

2600
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,010
A lot of,
a lot of Asian money,

2601
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:09,660
a lot of money from Saudi Arabia as 
well.

2602
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:11,540
Right.
And you know,

2603
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:12,590
Saudi Arabia,
you know,

2604
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,340
you're talking theocracy.
Yeah.

2605
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:16,260
And they're worried about their money 
getting taken away over there.

2606
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:18,330
So they drive by real estate over here.
Yeah.

2607
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:21,210
And also it's very valuable,
like keeps going up.

2608
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:22,044
It's a good investment and when you're 
making trillions of dollars by sucking 

2609
01:48:24,391 --> 01:48:25,280
oil out of the ground.
Sure,

2610
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:25,860
sure,
sure.

2611
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,700
And,
you know,

2612
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:28,140
at the end of the day,
um,

2613
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,660
uh,
the thing about all this stuff is that,

2614
01:48:31,661 --> 01:48:33,380
that the,
when the,

2615
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,330
if you give people the most opportunity 
to be free,

2616
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:38,760
you're also giving the most opportunity 
to be shitty.

2617
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:42,660
And you have to accept that.
You just have to accept that some people

2618
01:48:42,661 --> 01:48:45,120
are just going to be fucking assholes.
Some people are going to be Shitty,

2619
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:47,960
some people are going to try and create 
a system that,

2620
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:52,230
that you're not gonna like it's gonna 
reward others for things you don't think

2621
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:53,064
it should,
but you're always going to get those 

2622
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,283
hedge fund dudes.
You're always going to get those guys 

2623
01:48:56,431 --> 01:49:00,150
who have those gigantic estates in the 
Hamptons and fuck people,

2624
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,790
you know,
and my girlfriend,

2625
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,550
uh,
graduated with a,

2626
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,970
with a physics degree,
didn't use it.

2627
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:07,043
Okay,
fine,

2628
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:10,380
but you spent all this money to go to 
that school and should it have cost that

2629
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:11,310
much money?
Should,

2630
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,350
should the rates on loans be with you?
I don't think so.

2631
01:49:13,351 --> 01:49:14,540
I think that's,
that's a real scam.

2632
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:14,971
You,
you know,

2633
01:49:14,971 --> 01:49:15,804
you didn't probably understand or we're 
ill equipped to understand like all of 

2634
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:20,840
us were when it came to school.
Yeah.

2635
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,440
When you're 18,
you don't know what the fuck do.

2636
01:49:22,450 --> 01:49:25,620
I mean we didn't really understand how,
what a racket it was at the time.

2637
01:49:25,621 --> 01:49:26,320
So I,
you know,

2638
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,530
I totally feel for her there.
And then,

2639
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:31,680
so then she goes,
she gets a different job doing something

2640
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:33,270
else but made her great money but she 
hated it.

2641
01:49:33,271 --> 01:49:34,770
Didn't like it.
What didn't want to be in that.

2642
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:37,350
All right.
So then chose to fight and do like,

2643
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,213
you know,
personal trainers stuff and then would 

2644
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:42,870
always gripe about how she didn't make 
enough money and it's like,

2645
01:49:42,871 --> 01:49:44,910
well,
you could do,

2646
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,170
okay,
well then how about this,

2647
01:49:46,171 --> 01:49:49,480
you,
you charge x amount per hour normally.

2648
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,313
Well,
how about you set a limit to where you 

2649
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:53,650
get to x amount of people and then once 
you go over that,

2650
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:57,190
now you double the,
the fee because it's not really worth it

2651
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:58,150
to you anymore,
is it?

2652
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:00,810
So you create,
uh,

2653
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,980
an increase in you,
you see what your,

2654
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:03,814
what your minimum is.
And then over that and if people are 

2655
01:50:06,221 --> 01:50:07,930
wanting to pay it,
then they pay it.

2656
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,700
Why couldn't do that?
That would be,

2657
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,563
that would be unethical to charge these 
people double what I'm charging these 

2658
01:50:12,971 --> 01:50:13,751
people or whatever.
It's was like,

2659
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:14,584
well,
okay then how about you create a class 

2660
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:19,930
schedule set up and you iron out some 
time here and it's very specific here.

2661
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:22,120
Instead of teaching one person,
you teach five people,

2662
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:23,650
but then you charge them,
you know,

2663
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:24,790
two thirds what you charge it.
No,

2664
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:25,970
it's just like,
well I could,

2665
01:50:25,971 --> 01:50:26,381
it's like,
well,

2666
01:50:26,381 --> 01:50:27,220
okay,
if you,

2667
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:28,443
at the end of the day we have to do what
we need to do to pay our bills and do 

2668
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:33,604
these things and do whatever,
but we also have to determine how we 

2669
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:39,520
acquire those bills to what our expenses
are going to be.

2670
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,350
And if we can't create a system that 
supports that,

2671
01:50:44,351 --> 01:50:47,800
then we have to reevaluate that and then
change appropriately.

2672
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:50,350
The one thing we can't do is just be 
upset,

2673
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,300
you know?
And that's what people like to do,

2674
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:54,340
of course,
because they would like it to be,

2675
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,440
oh,
I can do this or I can do,

2676
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,300
I should be able to do this.
I should be able to do that.

2677
01:50:58,301 --> 01:50:58,660
It's like,
well,

2678
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:01,480
nobody can.
You can't do these things.

2679
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,930
You can and just chase their tail,
go around in circles.

2680
01:51:04,931 --> 01:51:06,730
Freedom,
uh,

2681
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,223
being truly free,
and let's just say an existential sense 

2682
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:13,720
means that you have to take 
responsibility for all these actions,

2683
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:15,940
but it's also all on you to find your 
own success.

2684
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,840
And that means you're going to fail.
That means you're going to struggle.

2685
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:22,120
That means all these difficult,
you're going to happen.

2686
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,570
But I personally believe that through 
struggle and these difficulties,

2687
01:51:25,571 --> 01:51:26,800
that's where growth comes as well.

2688
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:28,410
Well,
the question is what's the alternative?

2689
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:29,340
The alternatives.
What?

2690
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:30,174
You sit around and complain whenever 
someone else's more successful than you 

2691
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,530
sit around and complain that you're not 
making enough money.

2692
01:51:34,531 --> 01:51:37,460
You sit around and complain that the 
deck deck is stacked against you.

2693
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,360
Sit around and complain that you didn't 
use your education.

2694
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:41,850
Sit around and complain that in your 
field of choice.

2695
01:51:41,851 --> 01:51:42,684
And it didn't succeed.

2696
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,683
Here's the other thing.
A lot of people then want to find 

2697
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:47,200
somebody who is the reason for their 
downfall.

2698
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:51,850
This thing is what's keeping me from,
uh,

2699
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:55,330
being successful as the boyfriend.
I wasn't,

2700
01:51:55,331 --> 01:51:55,811
you know,
I,

2701
01:51:55,811 --> 01:51:58,960
everything I did was to help as much as 
I grow.

2702
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,330
Too Big,
too much shit,

2703
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,610
too opinionated,
too smart and tired.

2704
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,590
Um,
yeah,

2705
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:05,830
I,
I put it,

2706
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:06,440
I,
you know,

2707
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:07,690
at the end of the day,
you know,

2708
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,583
fuck,
I got,

2709
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:11,410
you know,
I got completely betrayed and cheated on

2710
01:52:11,411 --> 01:52:14,380
for months in the end of it.
So it's just like,

2711
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:14,801
oh,
well,

2712
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:17,590
you know,
I put all this investment into trying to

2713
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:20,680
help this other person and create a life
with them only to get completely screwed

2714
01:52:20,681 --> 01:52:22,970
over in the end.
But I'm sorry day about that.

2715
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:25,060
But we're getting super personal here.
It's true.

2716
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,894
But,
but what it comes down to also is that 

2717
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,990
when you look at these kinds of things,
you have to say,

2718
01:52:31,991 --> 01:52:32,830
well,
okay,

2719
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,330
well what would I have done differently?

2720
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:36,580
And you should be like,
for the most part,

2721
01:52:36,581 --> 01:52:38,050
you shouldn't have done anything 
differently.

2722
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:40,540
You know,
when you invest in somebody else,

2723
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:41,374
when you do for somebody else,
you don't do it for the return or for 

2724
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:45,890
what you think you're to get out of 
them.

2725
01:52:45,891 --> 01:52:47,590
You do it because you're doing it 
because it,

2726
01:52:47,591 --> 01:52:49,610
it is what you believe is the right 
thing to do.

2727
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:52,400
And then to be,
you know,

2728
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:55,460
you can be upset about other,
the way things have turned out.

2729
01:52:55,461 --> 01:52:56,750
You can be upset about like,
well,

2730
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:57,584
you know,
ethically I think you did this or you 

2731
01:52:58,221 --> 01:53:00,530
did that and you can be upset about 
those things.

2732
01:53:00,950 --> 01:53:01,783
But then two,
it's just like whenever you come across 

2733
01:53:03,321 --> 01:53:06,050
that person that just has nothing but 
shitty things to say about their,

2734
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:07,910
like,
it's probably you.

2735
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:09,020
Oh Dude,
you know,

2736
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,070
for me,
I could be like,

2737
01:53:10,071 --> 01:53:10,904
Nah,
I thought my ex was the greatest woman 

2738
01:53:11,841 --> 01:53:12,470
I'd ever met.

2739
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:15,260
And she absolutely possessed the 
qualities that,

2740
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:16,430
uh,
aligned with that.

2741
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:19,430
But she also had some really terrible 
ones that ended up being,

2742
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:20,870
you know,
horrible.

2743
01:53:20,910 --> 01:53:23,440
Whenever you meet someone and all they 
do is complain about their axes,

2744
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:26,420
it's usually there's a little of them 
and what they're saying.

2745
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,860
But see that that's just,
you know,

2746
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:28,694
this is just human beings in their own 
existence and so be it their 

2747
01:53:32,061 --> 01:53:33,770
relationship,
be it their business,

2748
01:53:33,771 --> 01:53:34,610
be it,
you know,

2749
01:53:34,611 --> 01:53:35,444
all these things are,
are all stemming from the same elements 

2750
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:42,170
within themselves.
Now they are subject to others,

2751
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:43,303
very specific elements too.
Like things that relationship like what 

2752
01:53:46,311 --> 01:53:47,420
kind of elements?
Well,

2753
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,283
okay.
When it comes to a point to like what's 

2754
01:53:49,431 --> 01:53:50,990
the,
for most people,

2755
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:54,020
like what's the,
the big factor in not getting their shit

2756
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:55,160
together.
Uh,

2757
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,053
the big factor,
not getting their shit together is not 

2758
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:02,170
coming to terms with their own 
inefficiency,

2759
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:03,183
uh,
failures or inability to accomplish a 

2760
01:54:05,331 --> 01:54:06,164
certain task and looking outside of that
for a reason versus looking internally 

2761
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:16,060
to see like,
I didn't have enough a skill to do x,

2762
01:54:16,561 --> 01:54:17,394
y to do this thing or I didn't put in 
enough time to acquire the skill to do 

2763
01:54:21,981 --> 01:54:22,340
that.

2764
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:26,890
Or I made a mistake here that costs this
when it comes to our relationships,

2765
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:27,920
you know,
it's there.

2766
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:29,540
What,
where it lives,

2767
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:31,043
where the difficulty lies.
There can be specific to different 

2768
01:54:32,871 --> 01:54:34,300
emotional elements,
Dubai,

2769
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:38,180
you know,
versus your work versus,

2770
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:39,403
uh,
how you even find time to make the most 

2771
01:54:42,261 --> 01:54:44,000
out of your,
your leisure time.

2772
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:46,740
You know,
these are the,

2773
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,400
every,
every situation has its own subjectivity

2774
01:54:49,401 --> 01:54:54,401
to it based on these other external 
factors that change from each situation.

2775
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:58,760
But ultimately everything stemming from 
you anyways.

2776
01:54:59,090 --> 01:54:59,923
So your way of approaching these things 
and dealing with these problems and how 

2777
01:55:04,641 --> 01:55:05,474
you let them affect you.
And I'm not just talking about being a 

2778
01:55:07,011 --> 01:55:10,700
complete stoic and being just cold and 
unfeeling,

2779
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,593
unaffected and I'm feeling,
it's just about having these things 

2780
01:55:15,021 --> 01:55:16,910
happen.
And then what do you do about it?

2781
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:17,960
You know,
how do you also,

2782
01:55:17,961 --> 01:55:19,490
how do you measure that metric?

2783
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:21,680
If you have the greatest year of life 
and then you have,

2784
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:25,460
you know,
an hour that's super shitty in traffic,

2785
01:55:25,461 --> 01:55:26,294
did that become,
and that really stuck with you and 

2786
01:55:27,441 --> 01:55:29,960
someone hit your car and your,
you know,

2787
01:55:29,961 --> 01:55:32,120
my challenge has got a dent in it and 
it's like,

2788
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,013
ah,
did I really have the worst day ever or 

2789
01:55:34,551 --> 01:55:38,180
did I just have an hour of an 
aggravation that sucked.

2790
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,014
But ultimately how can that,
if I allow that to take away from 

2791
01:55:42,711 --> 01:55:44,970
everything that happened up to that 
point,

2792
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:46,650
then,
you know,

2793
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:47,484
I just assigned all this value into this
one moment that really it was 

2794
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,550
unnecessary trained.
A lot of fighters you work.

2795
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:54,563
Do you,
do you sit down and talk to them about 

2796
01:55:56,461 --> 01:55:57,294
this kind of shit as well?
100% is this a big part of like how you 

2797
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:02,670
like think about it as a program for 
sure.

2798
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:06,690
Because whoever I take under my wing,
I don't just train people to train them.

2799
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:09,960
Um,
I don't eat them.

2800
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:12,420
Being fighters is one piece of their 
life.

2801
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:14,730
One element once,
honestly,

2802
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:17,670
eventually it'll be,
it'll be a small element,

2803
01:56:17,671 --> 01:56:21,090
but it,
but it has a lot of impact and meaning I

2804
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:21,924
mentor people when I work with them.
I'm trying to help them visualize and 

2805
01:56:26,761 --> 01:56:31,410
achieve their greatest state of being 
from what they can get.

2806
01:56:31,530 --> 01:56:33,930
Now,
fighting may be a vehicle to help try to

2807
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:38,160
achieve that,
but ultimately they're living their life

2808
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:38,994
and they have a,
they have something that they're trying 

2809
01:56:39,931 --> 01:56:42,540
to accomplish with that.
And so for me,

2810
01:56:42,570 --> 01:56:46,680
I'm trying to help them realize what 
that is and that's going to be different

2811
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:47,880
from other,
for other people.

2812
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:50,640
Just as much as you can't coach everyone
the same way.

2813
01:56:50,641 --> 01:56:51,474
Everybody needs something a little 
different in terms of what they're 

2814
01:56:52,801 --> 01:56:53,634
trying to achieve.
And people want to achieve different 

2815
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:55,110
things.

2816
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:56,430
Of course,
they've got this,

2817
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:58,493
they have this element of fighting and 
success within fighting that that is a 

2818
01:57:01,441 --> 01:57:05,400
bond that is a similarity amongst the 
rest of them and even amongst me.

2819
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,210
But beyond that,
that changes from there on out.

2820
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:10,950
So,
um,

2821
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,223
you know,
just recently I've been working with 

2822
01:57:13,711 --> 01:57:15,450
Travis Browne,
Eh,

2823
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:16,530
you know,
people are like,

2824
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,393
Holy Fuck,
you guys are your homeys what the hell 

2825
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:19,890
happened?
And it's just,

2826
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,821
there's,
the thing was,

2827
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:22,800
is that Travis,
uh,

2828
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:23,634
was,
had tried to get in touch with me 

2829
01:57:24,691 --> 01:57:27,240
through a marina before,
like,

2830
01:57:27,241 --> 01:57:28,140
hey,
he really liked,

2831
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,190
he really,
really wants to talk to you.

2832
01:57:29,191 --> 01:57:29,910
And I'm just like,
ah,

2833
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:31,470
okay.
I want what he wants to talk about.

2834
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:35,110
And this is like,
uh,

2835
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,440
over a year ago I think.
And then,

2836
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:38,730
but for one reason,
the other,

2837
01:57:38,731 --> 01:57:39,564
we weren't able to ever cross paths,
but through that time it would keep 

2838
01:57:44,161 --> 01:57:44,910
coming back.

2839
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:46,020
He really wants to,
he really liked,

2840
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:47,380
he really liked to really liked to see 
you,

2841
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:48,983
not just text you,
not just chat with you on the phone but 

2842
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,090
actually see you.
Okay.

2843
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:55,253
You know,
that already says something to me that 

2844
01:57:56,401 --> 01:57:59,430
that already has a lot more meaning.
And so sure enough,

2845
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:00,264
I meet up with them this,
this one time with a coffee shop and he 

2846
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:03,684
just wanted to sit down,
man to man I and just go over like any 

2847
01:58:10,171 --> 01:58:11,004
of the beef that we had had and,
and make his statements any apologies 

2848
01:58:13,681 --> 01:58:15,330
and,
and anything that I might have to say in

2849
01:58:15,331 --> 01:58:17,160
any apologies.
And I was like,

2850
01:58:17,161 --> 01:58:18,090
Holy Fuck,
you know,

2851
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:18,950
a man,
uh,

2852
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,420
I use man,
I'm not trying to be specific,

2853
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:22,254
but any person that is willing to sit 
down and be accountable and hear 

2854
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,740
somebody else's side and just show up 
and be like,

2855
01:58:28,741 --> 01:58:31,110
look man,
I'm not looking for something from you,

2856
01:58:31,111 --> 01:58:35,100
but I'm trying to be open and deal with 
whatever this,

2857
01:58:35,101 --> 01:58:36,030
this is out here.

2858
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:36,990
Put it to bed.
Yeah,

2859
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,170
that's very admirable.
Exactly.

2860
01:58:40,171 --> 01:58:43,240
It is such a rare commodity.
And how long ago did this happen?

2861
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:45,700
Uh,
maybe about six months ago.

2862
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:47,440
And he's got a fight schedule runs,
right?

2863
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:49,270
Well maybe he's even a little more than 
six months ago.

2864
01:58:49,271 --> 01:58:51,700
He's fighting a Alex Olynyk.
And so he hits me up,

2865
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:52,181
he goes,
Hey,

2866
01:58:52,181 --> 01:58:53,890
I would love it if you could help me 
out.

2867
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:56,980
So for me it was a no brainer.
Like fuck yeah,

2868
01:58:56,981 --> 01:58:58,030
I'll be there.
All right.

2869
01:58:58,031 --> 01:59:00,680
So I drove out to vegas with one of my 
guys show,

2870
01:59:00,681 --> 01:59:02,500
Hey Yamamoto who was getting ready for 
his,

2871
01:59:02,501 --> 01:59:05,680
uh,
the kill chain kid is fighting a locally

2872
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:06,970
here in cxf.
So I'm like,

2873
01:59:06,971 --> 01:59:09,310
I'm going to finish his kid's camp out 
here,

2874
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:13,600
away from everybody else and I'm going 
to help you out at the same time.

2875
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:14,434
Cool.
Cool.

2876
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:16,270
So he put us up in his place.

2877
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,610
Uh,
we would go and we train twice a day.

2878
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:22,060
I would work with him on grappling.
I would spar with him and,

2879
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:22,894
you know,
just take on that role of coach 

2880
01:59:23,831 --> 01:59:28,831
alongside Ricky Lundell and Ray sefo and
he's a fantastic student.

2881
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:30,520
When did you start working with ray?
Uh,

2882
01:59:30,521 --> 01:59:32,710
I think he's been working for,
with ray for about a year now.

2883
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,140
About a year.
I think that's a good mood.

2884
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,730
He's kicking again.
Thank you.

2885
01:59:36,731 --> 01:59:37,870
On knees,
which is great.

2886
01:59:37,871 --> 01:59:39,070
Yeah.
Guy Six foot seven.

2887
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:40,840
He's six [inaudible] seven and moves 
like,

2888
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,850
yeah.
How many crews and when he was not,

2889
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:44,740
sorry dominic.
But I mean,

2890
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:46,990
when he was at his best for a 
heavyweight,

2891
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:49,120
there's no one who moves like him.
He was,

2892
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:51,250
he's very agile on his feet.
He's got great,

2893
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:53,770
great quickness,
good a and he's got great reach,

2894
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,030
good power.
Uh,

2895
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:56,350
hell I should know.
And,

2896
01:59:56,351 --> 01:59:58,180
uh,
the thing is,

2897
01:59:58,270 --> 01:59:59,620
uh,
he,

2898
01:59:59,770 --> 02:00:00,603
he was having,
he just didn't feel that he was getting 

2899
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,780
what he best needed.

2900
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:08,860
So he made a change.
And even still for fighting someone like

2901
02:00:08,861 --> 02:00:09,820
Alexi,
he felt that,

2902
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:10,683
oh,
we'll having a guy that was a good 

2903
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:14,350
grappler and also good at that head and 
arm position,

2904
02:00:14,351 --> 02:00:16,300
which Alexi likes,
um,

2905
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:19,930
to have someone come in here and work 
with him in these very specific areas.

2906
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:20,770
But,
you know,

2907
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:21,440
for me it's like,
well,

2908
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,273
if you want me to be here,
I'll be here and I'll help you in any 

2909
02:00:24,431 --> 02:00:25,420
way I can.
And so,

2910
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,513
uh,
I would work with them while we're spar 

2911
02:00:27,581 --> 02:00:29,410
and we would do situational stuff.
And,

2912
02:00:29,411 --> 02:00:30,310
uh,
you know,

2913
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:34,990
he was just like a sponge and watching 
him get better every day and having some

2914
02:00:34,991 --> 02:00:35,740
other,
uh,

2915
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:39,130
guys around to help and be bodies too,
and ended up being great.

2916
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:40,180
It also is great for show,
hey,

2917
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:41,470
because I was able to,
uh,

2918
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:46,360
put him in a very isolated environment 
and keep his focus,

2919
02:00:46,361 --> 02:00:47,200
so razor sharp.

2920
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,110
And he went and knocked this guy out in 
22 seconds who was undefeated.

2921
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:51,010
That's awesome.
So,

2922
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:52,300
uh,
so now it's,

2923
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:54,700
you know,
travis is in town doing some press stuff

2924
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:55,534
and I'm going to try and link up with 
him as much as possible and just keep 

2925
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,070
working with them.
And the thing is,

2926
02:01:00,071 --> 02:01:01,510
he's the guys like that.
I mean,

2927
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:02,344
they're already physical.
They already have fights under their 

2928
02:01:03,581 --> 02:01:07,360
belt.
They already accomplished it with them.

2929
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:09,300
It's about nuance.
So you're going to be like,

2930
02:01:09,301 --> 02:01:11,140
as head coach,
uh,

2931
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:12,520
there's discussion of that.
Yeah,

2932
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,510
maybe just,
I mean,

2933
02:01:13,511 --> 02:01:15,440
but the reality is,
is that I,

2934
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:16,683
I just need to do whatever it is I can 
do to help him and his team and be a 

2935
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:22,230
part of all that.
And you know,

2936
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,910
whether I'm a head coach or assistant 
coach or I don't,

2937
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:26,470
I don't really care.
It doesn't matter what the title is,

2938
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,563
just you need to be in there in the 
trenches with these guys putting our 

2939
02:01:30,821 --> 02:01:31,654
heads together and helping travis be the
best he can be as as a fighter and end 

2940
02:01:36,871 --> 02:01:37,120
even.

2941
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,800
Then while through these training 
sessions,

2942
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:40,250
you know,
teaching somebody about getting out of a

2943
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:42,020
move or teaching somebody about doing a 
move,

2944
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:45,440
but wrapped in that whole bubble is,
okay,

2945
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:48,140
you're having a hard time right now.
Yeah,

2946
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:49,130
yeah.
Okay.

2947
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:51,830
That's okay because you're still moving 
forward.

2948
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:53,443
Don't worry about how difficult it is.
Sometimes this is going to be hard as 

2949
02:01:55,981 --> 02:01:56,814
shit.
Other times things will work just like 

2950
02:01:58,281 --> 02:02:00,290
that.
It doesn't matter.

2951
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:03,410
The matter is you got to keep going.
You've got to keep moving forward.

2952
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:07,250
You got to keep fighting and you got to 
keep working and you then went,

2953
02:02:07,251 --> 02:02:07,820
you know,
from,

2954
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,870
from one position it's like,
well,

2955
02:02:08,871 --> 02:02:11,120
you can't afford to be here at all.
So no matter how hard it is,

2956
02:02:11,121 --> 02:02:14,300
you got to get out,
but you can rest over here.

2957
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:17,240
Or it's like a,
you know,

2958
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:17,841
this,
this,

2959
02:02:17,841 --> 02:02:19,670
this training session was super fucking 
hard.

2960
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:23,270
That's great.
If you're not pushing yourself into your

2961
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:26,690
absolute exhaustion now,
how do you think you're going to perform

2962
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:29,270
when it's at its utmost?
So it wasn't getting that?

2963
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:29,590
No,
no,

2964
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:30,860
no.
I think it's just,

2965
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:31,963
I'm just throwing out examples,
but I still about working with him on a 

2966
02:02:33,891 --> 02:02:37,520
mental level too,
and getting his mind and that best state

2967
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:41,870
to then best use those physical 
capabilities because ultimately,

2968
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:45,320
in my opinion,
mental is the most important aspect when

2969
02:02:45,321 --> 02:02:47,550
it comes to fighting.
How you approach this things,

2970
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:52,550
your mentality towards each individual 
skirmish within that,

2971
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,503
that fight that eventually leads to 
either your success or your failure and 

2972
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:00,500
um,
that is always,

2973
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:02,740
that's always the thing.
It's like whether I could teach somebody

2974
02:03:02,741 --> 02:03:05,150
to throw a kick this way or kicked that 
way or you know,

2975
02:03:05,151 --> 02:03:07,490
there's always a way to make something 
work.

2976
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,770
You know?
Maybe there are some techniques that are

2977
02:03:09,771 --> 02:03:12,110
more low percentage than others 
especially,

2978
02:03:12,650 --> 02:03:14,510
but there'll always be a guy that can 
make it work.

2979
02:03:14,511 --> 02:03:16,400
You know?
However,

2980
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:21,980
your mental,
the way you approach a fight mentally is

2981
02:03:21,981 --> 02:03:22,150
the thing

2982
02:03:22,150 --> 02:03:24,820
fucking thing.
That is the hardest thing to hone.

2983
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:26,163
The hardest thing just to change over 
the hardest realizations to create is 

2984
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:32,650
all in terms of how you mentally 
approach a fight,

2985
02:03:32,651 --> 02:03:37,651
how to control your nerves or how to 
over fighting this out like as a book.

2986
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,240
Yeah,
I do.

2987
02:03:40,241 --> 02:03:42,280
I think about writing.
I think about writing.

2988
02:03:42,281 --> 02:03:43,114
I think in terms of fighting,
I think about writing in terms of 

2989
02:03:44,651 --> 02:03:45,484
philosophy.
I think about maybe doing speaking 

2990
02:03:47,531 --> 02:03:48,690
engagements,
stuff like that.

2991
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:50,800
You know,
talk to me about a few sat down and came

2992
02:03:50,801 --> 02:03:53,300
up with like sort of a comprehensive 
step by step for,

2993
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,780
for young fighters they'll be like super
valuable maybe,

2994
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:57,520
I don't know.
I guess if you,

2995
02:03:57,521 --> 02:04:01,630
if you come up,
sure you could do that and uh,

2996
02:04:01,631 --> 02:04:04,660
which of course is going to be just like
you said,

2997
02:04:04,661 --> 02:04:05,390
framework.
Yeah.

2998
02:04:05,390 --> 02:04:08,650
Give them tools to fall back on.
If they're in a certain situation,

2999
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:12,160
this is something you can call on.
This is something you can think about if

3000
02:04:12,161 --> 02:04:12,994
you find yourself stuck.
This is the mindset instead of just 

3001
02:04:14,651 --> 02:04:15,484
swimming out there freaking out and 
treading water and trying to figure out 

3002
02:04:17,831 --> 02:04:18,664
how long you do it for,
have a very specific mindset that you 

3003
02:04:21,311 --> 02:04:24,400
adopt or that you take on when you're in
a bad spot.

3004
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:25,060
Sure.
And,

3005
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:27,130
and a lot of,
uh,

3006
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:27,993
drills and things that I'll create for,
for fighters are based on creating 

3007
02:04:31,601 --> 02:04:33,400
comfort and,
and

3008
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:34,603
charity to where things get to a point 
where you're not thinking about it 

3009
02:04:39,121 --> 02:04:40,050
anymore,
but you're,

3010
02:04:40,051 --> 02:04:41,880
you're so comfortable and in that 
moment,

3011
02:04:41,881 --> 02:04:46,881
in that space that you can react and act
easily the most easily as possible.

3012
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:51,830
And also once you end up in a position 
that is even,

3013
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:52,703
that is a negative to you,
that is a detrimental how to then work 

3014
02:04:56,641 --> 02:04:57,900
your way through it.
And still do.

3015
02:04:57,901 --> 02:04:58,734
So with comfort,
like I loved watching Liz Carmouche and 

3016
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:02,634
Ronda is back because Rhonda states so,
so calm that that's how she was able to 

3017
02:05:08,431 --> 02:05:11,460
work her way through it.
Fight that arm off her head,

3018
02:05:11,620 --> 02:05:12,453
keep in good position,
and eventually work our way out of it 

3019
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:19,770
instead of seizing up and possibly,
you know,

3020
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:20,633
locking in place.
And then Liz being able to finish that 

3021
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:23,730
face locker,
that show,

3022
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:25,190
what did you think about that?
Kevin leak.

3023
02:05:25,191 --> 02:05:26,850
He has a fight.
I didn't watch it.

3024
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:27,040
Watch.

3025
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,080
He didn't watch it.
No.

3026
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:29,090
How dare you?
I,

3027
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:31,440
I,
I know I'm a fighter that doesn't really

3028
02:05:31,441 --> 02:05:34,260
watch fights is a crazy ending.
So I heard,

3029
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,930
yeah,
Kevin Lee took ts as back,

3030
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:38,190
which is CASS's thing,
right?

3031
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:39,960
Yeah.
And he took his back,

3032
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:44,760
sunk the choke in guess afar off.
He went palm to palm key asks,

3033
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:47,040
uh,
like it was trying to gut it out.

3034
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:50,100
He says,
and Mario Yamasaki steps in,

3035
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:53,640
it stops it before he taps.
I wouldn't have done that.

3036
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:56,700
No one does that.
Especially do it choke.

3037
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:57,563
It's one thing if a guy's arm is snapped
and you see it broken and then you call 

3038
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:02,004
the fight.
Right.

3039
02:06:02,190 --> 02:06:03,780
But this is not that.
This is,

3040
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,430
and he's saying that he thought he went 
out.

3041
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:08,190
It's just a hundred percent poor 
officiating.

3042
02:06:08,191 --> 02:06:10,950
I mean,
I haven't seen any argument from anybody

3043
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:12,240
on the right side.
I mean,

3044
02:06:12,241 --> 02:06:13,170
on,
in terms of,

3045
02:06:13,171 --> 02:06:15,570
um,
people that are either work for the UFC,

3046
02:06:15,571 --> 02:06:16,890
trainers,
fighters,

3047
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:18,150
even Jujitsu athletes.

3048
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:19,110
Yeah.
Everybody says,

3049
02:06:19,111 --> 02:06:20,730
but I don't go out.
You gotta let them go out.

3050
02:06:20,731 --> 02:06:22,080
It's not great.
It's not a bad thing.

3051
02:06:22,081 --> 02:06:23,000
But,
uh,

3052
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:25,860
you know,
people don't know.

3053
02:06:25,861 --> 02:06:26,850
It's not,
you don't get,

3054
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:28,230
it's not like getting knocked out.
Yeah.

3055
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:30,630
He could have been shut off being with 
two chicks.

3056
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:31,523
Yeah.
It doesn't,

3057
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,393
it doesn't hurt you as my point for 
people who don't understand what we're 

3058
02:06:34,231 --> 02:06:35,064
advocating.
It's not like let a guy get knocked out 

3059
02:06:36,931 --> 02:06:37,764
what we'd get knocked out.
It's not good the way you get choked 

3060
02:06:39,571 --> 02:06:40,650
out.
It's almost nothing.

3061
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:42,720
It literally is almost nothing.
Pretty much.

3062
02:06:42,721 --> 02:06:43,554
It's,
it's,

3063
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:45,330
you're,
you're next going to be sore.

3064
02:06:45,331 --> 02:06:46,164
Yeah,
for sure.

3065
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:47,520
I don't think,
uh,

3066
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:50,490
yeah,
I know Mario.

3067
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,160
I've known him for a long time and uh,
he's made a mistake.

3068
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:55,620
And that's the thing,
you referees are human.

3069
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,920
They all looked,
it's a fucking very hard job.

3070
02:06:59,070 --> 02:07:02,630
He probably thought castle went out.
He thought he saw here we can get,

3071
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:05,310
take a look at it here.
Let's let play the whole thing back from

3072
02:07:05,311 --> 02:07:05,941
the beginning,
Jamie.

3073
02:07:05,941 --> 02:07:07,170
So you could see that.
I can only get it.

3074
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:07,711
Okay.
Just,

3075
02:07:07,711 --> 02:07:08,580
okay.
Go from there.

3076
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:11,370
So He's get it.
He locks it on the next year.

3077
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:13,590
He's got the plastic trying to kiss his 
fighting.

3078
02:07:13,591 --> 02:07:14,424
He peels it off.
And then Kevin Luxy Body Tried d trial 

3079
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:19,080
triangle down tighter.
I see it.

3080
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:19,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

3081
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:22,230
Gets that palm to palm and look at this.
See,

3082
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:25,050
he's fighting it off and look,
he's not out at all.

3083
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,100
He's like,
I didn't tap.

3084
02:07:26,101 --> 02:07:29,640
What the fuck I didn't tap.
I think that's a bullshit stoppage.

3085
02:07:29,641 --> 02:07:30,780
And it's not,
you know,

3086
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:31,890
look,
Mario made a mistake,

3087
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:33,900
but it's a bullshit stoppage.
100%.

3088
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,420
I can't even imagine anybody defending 
that stoppage.

3089
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,000
No reason.
Well sound like,

3090
02:07:41,830 --> 02:07:44,920
because if you don't defend your that 
making that stoppage,

3091
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:46,090
he's crazy.

3092
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:47,710
Well,
I understand that but,

3093
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:49,230
but people don't want to,
uh,

3094
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:51,820
they didn't want it to end.
They don't want to accept any blame.

3095
02:07:52,630 --> 02:07:53,920
Blame May,
he's in,

3096
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:55,300
he's gutting it out.
Yeah.

3097
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:56,500
He's,
he's gutting it out,

3098
02:07:56,501 --> 02:07:57,130
man.
They look,

3099
02:07:57,130 --> 02:07:57,963
people don't realize it takes a lot of 
effort to squeeze that palm to palm in 

3100
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:03,510
particular using a lot of muscle.
There's not a whole lot.

3101
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:06,700
It's not the same kind of leverage that 
you get when you do the,

3102
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:09,250
she,
I see his hands Kinda,

3103
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:10,410
you know,
around the area.

3104
02:08:10,450 --> 02:08:13,060
But I mean you can still grab,
you could touch the guy's arm.

3105
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:14,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

3106
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:15,070
And they're,
they're stiff.

3107
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:15,933
Yeah.
He's still resisting and you don't have 

3108
02:08:17,831 --> 02:08:18,664
to,
it's not like strikes where you have to 

3109
02:08:19,811 --> 02:08:22,780
have your hands up covering yourself,
like to resist it.

3110
02:08:22,781 --> 02:08:25,270
He can resist by just really flexing his
neck.

3111
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:26,200
It's not smart.

3112
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:28,810
And tyron Woodley had the best 
commentary on this,

3113
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:32,740
honestly.
He was on that a UFC panel show and he's

3114
02:08:32,741 --> 02:08:33,250
like,
look,

3115
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:34,480
you shouldn't,
he goes,

3116
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:36,580
you shouldn't be in that position in the
first place.

3117
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:39,430
You shouldn't be defending it like that 
with your hands like that.

3118
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:43,180
And you shouldn't have let that guy get 
his arm under your Chin like that.

3119
02:08:43,181 --> 02:08:45,430
All of those things are bad technique 
and he's dead.

3120
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:46,264
Right?
Yeah,

3121
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:48,610
he's dead right.
The whole thing is kind of crazy.

3122
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:49,781
I mean,
yeah,

3123
02:08:49,781 --> 02:08:52,960
but he took him,
he took a beating before that.

3124
02:08:52,961 --> 02:08:55,180
This is one of the things you don't get 
in the context of this.

3125
02:08:55,210 --> 02:08:56,043
I think he was getting shellacked yes,
cause Kevin Lee had his back and while 

3126
02:08:58,631 --> 02:09:00,310
he had his back,
see if you can find that.

3127
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:01,840
Well,
I mean I can see that he's cut.

3128
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:02,853
Oh he's been bleeding.
He had his back and he was beating the 

3129
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:07,330
fuck out of him from behind with his 
back.

3130
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:08,920
Just Bang,
Bang,

3131
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:10,510
Bang.
While he's back riding them.

3132
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,820
He'd beat the shit out of him before 
that.

3133
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,610
So He's probably stunned.
Right.

3134
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:15,703
I'm also of the of the sort that sees 
guys that are getting hit and the four 

3135
02:09:19,311 --> 02:09:20,144
point position turtle position,
you know guys are swinging on him and 

3136
02:09:22,941 --> 02:09:25,550
they've got their arms up in their 
covered like often.

3137
02:09:25,551 --> 02:09:27,110
A lot of times they're like,
just keep letting it go.

3138
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:28,490
I you're not,
you're not getting through.

3139
02:09:28,491 --> 02:09:29,570
But reps will see like,
oh,

3140
02:09:29,571 --> 02:09:30,740
it looks bad when we're stopping.
It's like,

3141
02:09:30,741 --> 02:09:32,090
but he's not really getting hit.

3142
02:09:32,290 --> 02:09:34,900
I agree with you 100% I think there's 
been many fights.

3143
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:37,630
Were fights were stopped quick when a 
guy was covered up,

3144
02:09:37,631 --> 02:09:39,820
but there's nothing else he could do 
cover up.

3145
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:41,170
What else is he going to do?

3146
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:42,330
Yeah,
the guy swinging on him,

3147
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:44,250
but he can't,
can't land a successful,

3148
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:47,100
the only reason that guys flooring so 
hard really.

3149
02:09:47,101 --> 02:09:48,090
I mean,
well not the only,

3150
02:09:48,091 --> 02:09:48,924
but the main reason is probably because 
he thinks the ref's gonna stop it 

3151
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:53,100
exactly on that.
He wouldn't put that kind of effort into

3152
02:09:53,101 --> 02:09:55,100
it unless he's just completely losing 
his shit.

3153
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:55,963
Me and like,
Oh fuck it change and he's not thinking 

3154
02:09:57,571 --> 02:09:59,610
about it.
Which could come back to haunt him.

3155
02:09:59,611 --> 02:10:01,260
Like I've seen a lot of times.
Yeah.

3156
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:01,900
Old,
old,

3157
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:02,440
old

3158
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:03,273
cool fights guys even in mount,
just try on load on a guy and the guy 

3159
02:10:06,561 --> 02:10:07,394
survives.
It reverses it and eventually he gets 

3160
02:10:09,381 --> 02:10:10,030
his

3161
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:11,220
and it and it's done.
You know,

3162
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,940
we got a car when Brock Lesnar.
Yeah.

3163
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:13,953
Perfect example.
Shane Carwyn beat the fucking shit out 

3164
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:19,360
of Brock Lesnar for a full round.
Got on top of them.

3165
02:10:19,361 --> 02:10:22,960
Full mouth dropping bombs on them.
Somehow or another,

3166
02:10:22,961 --> 02:10:25,210
brock lesnar's survives.
Take Shane down the sac around,

3167
02:10:25,211 --> 02:10:26,140
submit some quick.
Yup.

3168
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:28,840
It happens.
You got to let fights play out.

3169
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:32,010
But I think in that situation it's,
he,

3170
02:10:32,011 --> 02:10:34,220
there's no for stopping

3171
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:35,053
the fight because it's not like strikes 
like w there could be an argument where 

3172
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,193
brock lesner is on the bottom and he's 
not moving enough and maybe some people 

3173
02:10:42,231 --> 02:10:44,030
are a little bit more cautious,
might have stopped that fight.

3174
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:47,630
But there's no argument to stop that.
I don't think that the fight should have

3175
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:48,740
been stopped.
Uh,

3176
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:52,130
yes and easy to do a better job of not 
letting guys get under his chin.

3177
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,080
Yeah.
What do you,

3178
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:54,980
what do you do about that?
You're the commissioner.

3179
02:10:54,981 --> 02:10:55,814
If you're the king of the world,
do you do a contact contact 

3180
02:10:58,790 --> 02:10:59,930
commissioner?
You,

3181
02:10:59,931 --> 02:11:01,580
uh,
I dunno.

3182
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:04,390
I kind of feel like you have to keep 
him,

3183
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:07,340
give him the win.
It's hard to reverse it like that.

3184
02:11:07,341 --> 02:11:09,620
It's a mistake that the referee fucked 
up for sure.

3185
02:11:09,621 --> 02:11:12,470
He stopped the fight,
but he stopped the fight based on a,

3186
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:14,090
and this is where I want to go against 
myself.

3187
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:19,450
A very advantageous position that was as
close to finalizing and finishing as you

3188
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:23,750
can discern where a guy's no longer 
defending with his hands.

3189
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:24,890
He's hanging in there.
I mean,

3190
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:27,380
I think Mario fucked up cause he didn't 
let it get to 10,

3191
02:11:27,530 --> 02:11:30,000
but he let it get to nine.
It got denied.

3192
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:31,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

3193
02:11:31,911 --> 02:11:34,850
That's the thing too.
He was so locked into that show.

3194
02:11:34,851 --> 02:11:35,684
Can't take his victory away.
I feel like you can't take Kevin these 

3195
02:11:38,271 --> 02:11:39,400
victory away.
Me Too.

3196
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:41,960
Uh,
it's just no good.

3197
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:44,090
They're no good that comes up that it's 
not good,

3198
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:47,270
but you give them an immediate rematch.
I think that's the move.

3199
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:48,640
That's exciting.
That's a good,

3200
02:11:48,641 --> 02:11:49,720
yeah,
I could see that.

3201
02:11:50,030 --> 02:11:50,960
But here's the thing,
you know,

3202
02:11:50,961 --> 02:11:52,400
this is price fighting,
right?

3203
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:55,430
Is there the interest all right there.
Make it happen.

3204
02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:56,323
I think through it and make it happen.
Because you're going to mention the 

3205
02:11:57,981 --> 02:12:00,320
promoter's got to make money on it.
Yeah.

3206
02:12:00,321 --> 02:12:03,710
I think that's a good fight to have in 
Detroit because I think they're going to

3207
02:12:03,711 --> 02:12:07,250
do a UFC in Detroit.
I heard I'm scheduled to do as a UFC.

3208
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:10,220
Isn't Detroit having a UFC basically 
every night?

3209
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:12,350
Oh No.
I think it's different.

3210
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:13,543
It's like a,
it's more like a battle cade old school 

3211
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:21,370
chunk already just hanging around with 
me.

3212
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:21,681
Like,
oh,

3213
02:12:21,681 --> 02:12:23,720
that's so sexy.
Sexy to,

3214
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,280
he's riding him like a pony.

3215
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:29,420
Most people have no idea.
Oh,

3216
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:31,550
I,
I have party with John Perretti.

3217
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:33,620
That is,
I love John Proteins commentary.

3218
02:12:33,710 --> 02:12:34,270
Oh,
it's hell.

3219
02:12:34,270 --> 02:12:35,360
It's,
I just enjoy him.

3220
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:36,710
He's fantastic.
I mean,

3221
02:12:36,711 --> 02:12:37,544
and you know him,
he brought a lot of a really good 

3222
02:12:40,581 --> 02:12:41,414
fighters to the world of him.
And then he had a great eye for picking 

3223
02:12:44,301 --> 02:12:45,870
talent.
He was the guy that find,

3224
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,170
found Andre Arlovski.
He,

3225
02:12:48,171 --> 02:12:50,020
uh,
yours in Novia,

3226
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:52,250
Mario Sperry.
Mari Smith.

3227
02:12:52,251 --> 02:12:54,170
Mari Smith.
Matt Hume.

3228
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,011
Yeah.
Well,

3229
02:12:55,011 --> 02:12:55,844
I was going to bring it up.
Sakuraba like when soccer rob a fought 

3230
02:12:58,191 --> 02:13:00,710
Conan and the UFC,
that was the first time we saw Brazilian

3231
02:13:00,711 --> 02:13:02,790
Jiu Jitsu black belt gets submitted.
Right.

3232
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:03,381
We were like,
whoa.

3233
02:13:03,381 --> 02:13:04,760
We thought they were in vulnerable.
Well,

3234
02:13:04,761 --> 02:13:06,980
and up to that and the fight before 
that,

3235
02:13:07,220 --> 02:13:09,500
uh,
he clips soccer up with a good shot.

3236
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:13,700
Sakharova drops in on a single and then 
big John Accidentally stop the fight,

3237
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:14,863
but then they let him fight again,
which is the craziest fucking thing 

3238
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:18,440
ever.
Like they would never do that.

3239
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:20,300
Never.
That's crazy.

3240
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,200
I forgot about that.
That is a very,

3241
02:13:23,201 --> 02:13:26,330
very,
very nice randy couture beat Marie Smith

3242
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,553
for the UFC heavyweight title and his,
his tights got torn so you could see 

3243
02:13:31,411 --> 02:13:32,244
his,
his speedos underneath that that randy 

3244
02:13:34,981 --> 02:13:35,814
was wearing.
And so when frank shamrock also beat 

3245
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:38,760
Kevin Jackson.
Yup.

3246
02:13:38,830 --> 02:13:40,710
Armbar oh,
it's been like 20 seconds.

3247
02:13:40,711 --> 02:13:41,790
Which shoes on?
Yup.

3248
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:42,940
Yeah.

3249
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,880
Old School,
man.

3250
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,500
I loved it.
That was the first year.

3251
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:51,360
That's when I quit.
I quit that UFC.

3252
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:52,440
I'm like,
I'm not going to Japan.

3253
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,633
That's when I quit the back in the old 
days when I was doing the post fight 

3254
02:13:55,861 --> 02:13:56,694
interviews.
Did we do on a back in the day on the 

3255
02:13:58,561 --> 02:14:01,020
uh,
on like the graffiti brick wall?

3256
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:02,520
Yeah,
we did something man.

3257
02:14:02,540 --> 02:14:03,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

3258
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:04,560
That was,
um,

3259
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,840
you know what,
when you won the title,

3260
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:09,030
I was there but I wasn't working for the
UFC.

3261
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:10,103
I was just watching and uh,
that was back when I was just a friends 

3262
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:15,204
with Dana and I was uh,
I was just going to the events and 

3263
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,273
enjoying them.
I remember watched you fight randy from 

3264
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:21,930
like,
I think I was like six feet away.

3265
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:24,780
I think it was like front row back in 
the day.

3266
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:25,614
Josh Barnett back in the fucking baby 
face assassin with less stars and a lot 

3267
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:31,434
less gray hair.

3268
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:33,690
Dude.
I remember you fighting in Hawaii.

3269
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:35,093
Yup.
Super Brawl.

3270
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:38,160
Yeah.
Dan Severn and that eight man tournament

3271
02:14:38,161 --> 02:14:38,994
that I won that had all those dudes in 
Abu Dhabi champion Rigo Rodriguez and 

3272
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,710
uh,
John Marsh.

3273
02:14:43,711 --> 02:14:45,510
Uh,
Travis Fulton.

3274
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:48,210
I think you only had like 115 fights at 
that point.

3275
02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:51,260
How much does travis have now?
It doesn't have like 305 snowing now.

3276
02:14:51,290 --> 02:14:53,190
Something insane.
Jeremy Horn.

3277
02:14:53,191 --> 02:14:56,610
I always thought it was insane because 
he had like one 50 and then you find out

3278
02:14:56,611 --> 02:14:58,860
about travis and everyone's got like a 
hundred does he?

3279
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,390
Yeah,
I got a hundred victories,

3280
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:02,201
I don't think.
Sorry.

3281
02:15:02,201 --> 02:15:04,380
You said you've been doing a little bit 
of pro wrestling but no fighting.

3282
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,453
He had a very gray blurry line between 
fighting pro wrestling to put it 

3283
02:15:09,271 --> 02:15:11,070
charitably.
There was like some,

3284
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:11,923
some,
there was a couple that people had 

3285
02:15:13,981 --> 02:15:16,120
called it into question.
A couple of the Katas in there.

3286
02:15:17,380 --> 02:15:19,110
Mm.
Yeah.

3287
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:21,420
Well it's amazing that he kept it up as 
long as he did,

3288
02:15:21,421 --> 02:15:22,920
but that was because of a solid 
wrestling,

3289
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:23,300
you know?

3290
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:25,800
Well that just like real serious 
competitor,

3291
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:26,723
you know,
he had that competition streak that 

3292
02:15:27,721 --> 02:15:29,650
would allow him to continue to drive 
and,

3293
02:15:29,651 --> 02:15:31,740
and perform like that.
But as he got older,

3294
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:32,843
you know the wrong match ups.
It could be a guy who never even heard 

3295
02:15:34,591 --> 02:15:35,490
of and it's like,
oh shit.

3296
02:15:35,491 --> 02:15:37,170
Dance ever just got shellacked.
Yeah.

3297
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:38,004
Well,
when you look back at your initial 

3298
02:15:39,661 --> 02:15:40,494
fights in mma,
like in super broad and then entering 

3299
02:15:43,241 --> 02:15:44,310
into the UFC,
which is like,

3300
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:45,690
when was your first fight in the UFC?
What year?

3301
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:50,700
Uh,
2001 yeah.

3302
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:51,593
See,
that was when I was 2000 not working 

3303
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:57,360
with them yet.
That was when I was UFC 28 yeah.

3304
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:02,420
Gam Mcgee and then UFC [inaudible] was 
Pedro Hazel 32 Assam Schilt 34 was Bobby

3305
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:05,910
Hoffman 30 slot.
Pedro his or when Pedro his,

3306
02:16:05,911 --> 02:16:06,661
it was Pedro.
His,

3307
02:16:06,661 --> 02:16:09,300
oh yeah dude.
We showed a clip yesterday of Pedro,

3308
02:16:09,301 --> 02:16:12,000
his own leg kicking some guy and making 
them fly through the air.

3309
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:16,380
Some journalists holds the pad on his 
leg and Pedro leg kicks him in.

3310
02:16:16,381 --> 02:16:20,040
The guy's legs literally go upside down 
where his legs are above his head.

3311
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:22,440
He goes flying.
He's such a cool dude,

3312
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:23,303
man.
It's just like seeing him over over all 

3313
02:16:25,650 --> 02:16:26,980
the years.
Training at his gym in,

3314
02:16:26,981 --> 02:16:28,290
in Brazil.
When I was down there,

3315
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:30,100
he can't pick me up.
Uh,

3316
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,830
picked up me and my accident.
We,

3317
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:33,640
we went out there and train with this 
guy,

3318
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:35,650
a master late dial.
Who is one of the,

3319
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,600
was this before or after your second 
fight?

3320
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,970
Uh,
after our second flight.

3321
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,691
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

3322
02:16:40,691 --> 02:16:42,700
we were down there,
me and my ex and uh,

3323
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:43,863
eh,
we're down there to help corner Shana 

3324
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:49,360
and her last fight in the UFC,
it was in Brazil against a Nunez.

3325
02:16:49,810 --> 02:16:51,190
And while we're down there,
it's like,

3326
02:16:51,191 --> 02:16:51,481
Hey,
I,

3327
02:16:51,481 --> 02:16:52,314
I still want to get in training.
I don't want to train with all the that 

3328
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:56,260
Luke delievery like catch derived guys 
that I can.

3329
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:57,393
And so yeah,
what we trained with a master lay towel 

3330
02:16:59,891 --> 02:17:00,724
for a while and Pedro is let us use his 
gym and we would sit there and talk and 

3331
02:17:03,951 --> 02:17:04,571
I go,
you know,

3332
02:17:04,571 --> 02:17:05,820
one of the things about Pedro,
I go,

3333
02:17:06,470 --> 02:17:07,303
he,
he taught me how to throw the counter 

3334
02:17:08,501 --> 02:17:11,380
right hand even better than than I had 
ever known.

3335
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:12,213
And that pivot step and they hit it from
the other angle because he knocked me 

3336
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:17,710
the fuck out with it and it was so 
beautiful and the replay,

3337
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:18,910
like,
I need to learn that.

3338
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:20,553
I got to learn that that's two.
And Pedro would just laugh about it and 

3339
02:17:23,831 --> 02:17:24,251
he goes,
oh,

3340
02:17:24,251 --> 02:17:24,611
well,
you know,

3341
02:17:24,611 --> 02:17:25,480
you got me.
I go,

3342
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:26,861
who gives a shit,
man?

3343
02:17:26,861 --> 02:17:29,110
We were too busy having fun.
Would you caught him with a left hook?

3344
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:30,280
Right?
Uh,

3345
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:31,503
I caught him with a counter right hand,
did you over his Jab and I saw him 

3346
02:17:35,021 --> 02:17:36,780
stumble a little bit and I charged for 
it.

3347
02:17:36,781 --> 02:17:38,290
And then with a running left hook.
Yeah.

3348
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:40,060
Um,
because I saw,

3349
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:40,894
uh,
the window of opportunity to get to get 

3350
02:17:42,551 --> 02:17:43,570
in there,
I'd already stunned them.

3351
02:17:43,870 --> 02:17:45,910
Uh,
and so to a degree I'm like,

3352
02:17:46,930 --> 02:17:48,630
thanks Pedro.
Thanks.

3353
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:51,640
[inaudible] the hardest leg kicks you've
ever felt a cro cop,

3354
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:52,713
Cro,
cop.

3355
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:53,643
Really?
Yeah.

3356
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:55,660
Wow.
That's crazy.

3357
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:56,560
Well,
I would,

3358
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:57,670
I would imagine,
I mean,

3359
02:17:57,700 --> 02:18:00,280
if anybody here,
here's just a cro cop story.

3360
02:18:00,281 --> 02:18:04,720
So it's me and Marco and Eric Paulson 
and we're training in Vegas.

3361
02:18:04,810 --> 02:18:06,310
Uh,
I think,

3362
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:08,170
I don't know if I was doing commentary 
on that show.

3363
02:18:08,190 --> 02:18:10,660
If I was fighting pebble,
not too low.

3364
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:11,553
Either way.
We're training at this gym in Vegas and 

3365
02:18:13,631 --> 02:18:14,464
miracle came out.
So we're rolling around and training 

3366
02:18:15,671 --> 02:18:17,870
together and have a good time.
And,

3367
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,920
and I think I was fighting and so on,
uh,

3368
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,440
Paulson's holding pads for me and 
miracles like,

3369
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:25,300
ah,
do this with your leftover and said,

3370
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,190
all right,
how about Nah,

3371
02:18:27,191 --> 02:18:28,660
that's not it.
No,

3372
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:29,290
no,
no.

3373
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:30,880
Here,
let me show you here.

3374
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:31,714
You hold the pads.
So Paulson's got this full on typepad 

3375
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:37,180
leather typepad and he's holding it for 
miracles,

3376
02:18:37,210 --> 02:18:38,290
right hook.
Since you know,

3377
02:18:38,340 --> 02:18:40,570
we're talking lead Hook essentially,
right?

3378
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:41,621
So miracle was like,
no,

3379
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:43,210
I want you to do this.
You know,

3380
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:46,510
you're doing it like x is,
I need you to do it like this.

3381
02:18:46,930 --> 02:18:48,480
So Watch,
oh,

3382
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:50,680
and he hits this heat,
right?

3383
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:51,650
Hooks,
this pad,

3384
02:18:51,651 --> 02:18:56,620
this typepad it goes,
it tears the straps off of Paulson's arm

3385
02:18:56,740 --> 02:18:57,573
and it goes flying across the room and 
hits the wall and bounces off the wall 

3386
02:19:01,001 --> 02:19:03,370
and falls on the fucking ground.
And everyone was just like,

3387
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:05,530
uhhh.
And Paulson is just,

3388
02:19:06,030 --> 02:19:06,863
his hand is still like this and he looks
at me and he looks at a miracle and 

3389
02:19:10,451 --> 02:19:12,580
miracles and,
and I just,

3390
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:14,500
everybody's just,
it's just silence.

3391
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:17,530
Wham flat.
But I am,

3392
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:19,900
I just went,
see,

3393
02:19:19,901 --> 02:19:20,734
I took that,
that that's what I was getting hit with 

3394
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:26,650
and I still managed to stay on my feet 
because I'm an idiot.

3395
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:28,010
Yeah.

3396
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,270
Geez.
I remember thinking,

3397
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:30,283
how the fuck is this guy?
He's just at his best is just absolute 

3398
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:40,670
pure like explosive power.
Just just destruction.

3399
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:41,201
Yeah.
Well,

3400
02:19:41,201 --> 02:19:44,390
you know Bob Saps eyeball and he did one
fight.

3401
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:45,250
Remember that?
Yeah.

3402
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,520
Dude,
he crushed people with,

3403
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:47,700
with those high kicks.
He,

3404
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:48,553
his middle kick was so dangerous to me 
is middle and is locate where the most 

3405
02:19:51,021 --> 02:19:53,870
dangerous because I felt like you could,
you could,

3406
02:19:53,871 --> 02:19:56,450
you could see,
you could more read the high kick,

3407
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:57,493
but if you read the high kick or if you 
were to two d to set up to defend the 

3408
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:03,890
high kick,
if he ripped you in your body,

3409
02:20:03,891 --> 02:20:04,724
that's your ribs.
Can we chop that shag heath herring 

3410
02:20:08,090 --> 02:20:08,923
versus cro?
Cop were cro cop's kicking them in the 

3411
02:20:10,251 --> 02:20:14,330
body and cro,
cop's Shin is like halfway to his spine.

3412
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:18,710
I think he was only one kick to one kick
and it was like boom.

3413
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:21,020
But it's when you see the penetration of
that kick,

3414
02:20:21,021 --> 02:20:21,854
you realize like that's insane.
And he had a taekwondo background that 

3415
02:20:25,011 --> 02:20:26,680
helped him to be,
but you know,

3416
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:28,360
a guy like that you could have gave him 
fucking,

3417
02:20:28,370 --> 02:20:30,470
you could have had him doing anything 
and he's just going to be a beast.

3418
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,300
You know,
he had just such ferocious,

3419
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:33,493
ferocious explosive power.
I remember his stare down with vandelay 

3420
02:20:36,201 --> 02:20:38,960
probably the best deer down of all time.
First Time vandelay got out,

3421
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:40,650
stared.
No,

3422
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:45,260
he's vandelays like doing the crazy eyes
and Mirko was just staring at him like a

3423
02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:47,780
fucking evil predator.
The two of them looking at each other.

3424
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:49,580
I'm like,
I got to give that one to cro cop.

3425
02:20:49,581 --> 02:20:50,960
I can't believe this.
Well,

3426
02:20:50,961 --> 02:20:51,800
think about cro,
cop,

3427
02:20:51,801 --> 02:20:53,590
Cro,
cop that got that motherfucker was,

3428
02:20:53,650 --> 02:20:54,900
yeah,
look at that kick.

3429
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:56,923
Oh Fuck Jesus Christ.
I mean that is deep into his body and 

3430
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,040
right,
right where his liver is.

3431
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:09,380
That's a insane power kick.
That's that left leg.

3432
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:10,483
Yup.
And he was the first one to flatline 

3433
02:21:11,361 --> 02:21:16,361
vandelay to remember that when the head 
kicked vandelay because uh,

3434
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:18,223
I was,
I was watching that fight because my 

3435
02:21:20,241 --> 02:21:21,074
next,
cause I was going to go fight Nogueira 

3436
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:22,873
after that.
So I'm sitting here hoping that these 

3437
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:24,974
guys beat the shit out of each other and
he goes out there and just fucking 

3438
02:21:27,831 --> 02:21:31,540
crushes them.
So now I'm just sitting here thinking,

3439
02:21:31,570 --> 02:21:32,403
God dammit,
that dude spent two minutes of beating 

3440
02:21:33,801 --> 02:21:36,890
the hell out of this guy and now I gotta
go out and fight.

3441
02:21:36,940 --> 02:21:39,110
Nogueira how crazy is the chin on Mark 
Hunt?

3442
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:39,973
He gets fucking head kicked.
Fullon he goes down and gets right back 

3443
02:21:43,131 --> 02:21:44,180
up.
Oh,

3444
02:21:44,660 --> 02:21:46,430
there's an Ovi but here's the vandelay 
one.

3445
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:51,600
Climbing a ridiculous speed and power.
And because of the fact that he had that

3446
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:54,374
traditional martial arts background,
he didn't step before he threw that 

3447
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:56,600
kick.

3448
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:59,420
A lot of times he just threw it and you 
didn't see it coming.

3449
02:21:59,460 --> 02:22:02,240
That one just goes over the top of the 
glove and that's right leg.

3450
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,111
Yeah,
that's right.

3451
02:22:03,111 --> 02:22:04,040
Leg Hospital.
Left leg.

3452
02:22:04,041 --> 02:22:05,960
Cemetery.
Body.

3453
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:07,550
Yeah.
Done Dude.

3454
02:22:08,510 --> 02:22:09,343
Now that fight,
I remember he hit Mark Hunt with that a 

3455
02:22:10,521 --> 02:22:11,350
couple times.
Yeah.

3456
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:14,090
He just,
well he dropped him with it.

3457
02:22:14,091 --> 02:22:16,760
And one of the fights and k one k one 
fight.

3458
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,370
Not In the,
and the MMA fight.

3459
02:22:19,371 --> 02:22:20,920
Mark Hunt actually one that one.
Yeah.

3460
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:24,530
Well that was my editorial to it on the 
chin.

3461
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:26,550
That doesn't a Guy Carwyn.
No,

3462
02:22:26,551 --> 02:22:28,590
wait,
that's a raw waterman.

3463
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:29,610
Ron Waterman.
There you go.

3464
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:34,680
Boink Minataro was one of those guys.
It was almost like too tough for his own

3465
02:22:34,681 --> 02:22:37,380
good when he was younger.
Well that's why who acts kick.

3466
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:40,020
That's why when he got towards the end 
of his career,

3467
02:22:40,021 --> 02:22:42,210
he was just getting knocked out left and
right because he'd taken,

3468
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:43,253
he had lived on his chin for so long 
that he could no longer take a shot 

3469
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,173
anymore.

3470
02:22:48,210 --> 02:22:52,050
And that's honestly,
it's not that uncommon.

3471
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,260
Uh,
Ooh.

3472
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,650
Fujita getting a need,
uh,

3473
02:22:57,820 --> 02:22:58,653
as he got a cooler,
easy highlight reel that you forget 

3474
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:04,410
sometimes how insane the highlight reel 
of Mirko Cro cop is.

3475
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:05,370
Well,
people in the,

3476
02:23:05,371 --> 02:23:09,360
oh Alexander in the UFC never really 
saw,

3477
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,490
they didn't see this guy,
you know what I mean?

3478
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:12,510
No,
he was in pride.

3479
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:13,883
Well,
I still maintain to this day that like 

3480
02:23:15,661 --> 02:23:16,494
pride was some of the most exciting and 
spectacular fights in the early days of 

3481
02:23:20,371 --> 02:23:22,770
MMA by far.
They agree I'm insane.

3482
02:23:22,771 --> 02:23:27,150
Matchups and especially because it was a
big percentage of it was the heavyweight

3483
02:23:27,151 --> 02:23:28,990
division was a huge percentage of what 
they,

3484
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:29,833
and,
and the stage that they set for us to 

3485
02:23:30,751 --> 02:23:34,010
compete on wasn't crabs and people's 
like talent super arena.

3486
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:38,060
It was fighting in front of,
I mean,

3487
02:23:38,061 --> 02:23:38,894
I was fighting in front of Pete like 
40,000 people every time I went out 

3488
02:23:41,071 --> 02:23:43,470
there swishing,
it could've maintained.

3489
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:45,560
I was a fan of it.
When,

3490
02:23:45,561 --> 02:23:48,530
when I was even working for the UFC,
I was always a big pride fan.

3491
02:23:48,531 --> 02:23:49,320
I'm like,
look,

3492
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,910
there's room for everybody.
Of course,

3493
02:23:51,210 --> 02:23:53,790
you know,
and the thing is the people that were by

3494
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:57,630
having pride,
it opened up eyes.

3495
02:23:57,631 --> 02:24:00,900
I would always say like having another 
company with a different flavor.

3496
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:04,410
Maybe it will draw in other,
other,

3497
02:24:04,411 --> 02:24:05,244
uh,
fans that wouldn't maybe necessarily be 

3498
02:24:07,561 --> 02:24:08,394
a fan of the UFC,
but they liked the way that pride did 

3499
02:24:10,981 --> 02:24:12,720
it.
And so that would get them interested in

3500
02:24:12,721 --> 02:24:16,830
mma and therefore then they might also,
okay,

3501
02:24:16,831 --> 02:24:18,990
well maybe I will give this ufc stuff 
with tribe.

3502
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:19,721
Maybe.
Well,

3503
02:24:19,721 --> 02:24:21,510
I like this one fighter.
Uh,

3504
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:23,220
so I'll watch when he's on,
you know,

3505
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:24,930
it just,
it expands the market.

3506
02:24:24,931 --> 02:24:25,764
It doesn't diminish it.
I think that's the same thing with bell 

3507
02:24:27,231 --> 02:24:28,064
tour.
Yeah,

3508
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:28,650
I really do.

3509
02:24:28,650 --> 02:24:29,770
I mean,
I think that what,

3510
02:24:29,850 --> 02:24:30,683
what's good about Bella tours that 
they're developing real world class 

3511
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:35,070
talent now,
Michael Chandler,

3512
02:24:35,071 --> 02:24:35,904
you know,
Michael Venom page now rory is over 

3513
02:24:37,651 --> 02:24:39,780
there.
I mean there's world class talent there.

3514
02:24:40,220 --> 02:24:41,310
It's true.
And uh,

3515
02:24:41,630 --> 02:24:43,410
you know,
he had mitre on fight fueled our,

3516
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:45,960
which you crazy man.
You know,

3517
02:24:45,970 --> 02:24:48,960
double knockdown gets up first and it's 
crazy.

3518
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:50,700
Crazy thing you can't,
can't plan for.

3519
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,593
So a guy like fate or when you see him 
at this stage of his life and you see 

3520
02:24:54,810 --> 02:24:56,700
him getting code again,
what,

3521
02:24:56,890 --> 02:24:58,680
what are your thoughts on that when you 
watch that?

3522
02:24:58,710 --> 02:25:01,170
It sucks to see that that's the case.
I mean,

3523
02:25:01,171 --> 02:25:02,730
I love Matt known to man.
He's a,

3524
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:03,710
he's a great dude.
I,

3525
02:25:03,711 --> 02:25:08,550
I trained him when I can and I'm glad to
see him get that victory.

3526
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:11,160
It's a massive victory fund as was I,
but I'm a,

3527
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:14,190
I'm a friend and I had been a friend of 
orders for such a long time.

3528
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,073
It's,
it's,

3529
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:18,150
it sucks to see him not doing well even 
saying his name right.

3530
02:25:19,050 --> 02:25:20,230
It's a big commitment.
Yeah.

3531
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:23,410
It's like everybody else's fader.
Yeah.

3532
02:25:23,490 --> 02:25:25,060
But y'all got to get,
you got your fancy Yannis,

3533
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:25,923
right?
Like Dostoyevsky Fyodor Dostoyevsky not 

3534
02:25:27,701 --> 02:25:28,331
fate or,
well,

3535
02:25:28,331 --> 02:25:29,880
what does everybody say instead of dose,
gift,

3536
02:25:29,881 --> 02:25:33,310
Ski?
I think they just don't say anything.

3537
02:25:33,311 --> 02:25:37,390
They're like the d a f d what's the 
correct pronunciation?

3538
02:25:37,391 --> 02:25:38,224
Dus Dose.
[inaudible] Dostoyevsky Dostoyevsky 

3539
02:25:43,570 --> 02:25:45,450
Dostoyevsky isn't a weird hub.
Languages like develop,

3540
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:48,220
like they're totally different kinds of 
sounds like,

3541
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:50,170
you know,
English has certain sounds.

3542
02:25:50,171 --> 02:25:51,004
Sure.
Russian has these like very specific 

3543
02:25:52,991 --> 02:25:55,840
noises that you have to,
and then you go to like tonal languages,

3544
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,780
Thai or Vietnamese.
Oh,

3545
02:25:58,781 --> 02:26:00,040
man.
Or Chinese.

3546
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:00,760
Oh,
yeah.

3547
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:02,680
Crazy.
So interesting.

3548
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:03,461
You know,
and,

3549
02:26:03,461 --> 02:26:04,294
um,
uh,

3550
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:05,403
Steve Rinella again was here and he had 
been in Guyana and they had these 

3551
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:10,653
interviews they did with these local 
people that were speaking in their 

3552
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:13,264
native tongue.
And it's like this really strange 

3553
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:18,460
ancient language.
It doesn't sound like anything else.

3554
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:20,380
It's a really cool to hear.
It's like,

3555
02:26:20,381 --> 02:26:21,070
wow,
you,

3556
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:23,500
this might be like what mayans sounded 
like.

3557
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:24,970
Ha.
Yeah.

3558
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:26,980
Really freaky.
Well,

3559
02:26:26,981 --> 02:26:27,420
when I was at

3560
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:28,510
Romania,
they were some,

3561
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:29,341
some of the,
I don't,

3562
02:26:29,341 --> 02:26:30,910
I don't know the truth on this stuff.
Uh,

3563
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:31,773
I haven't done the research,
so it up to your listeners to go follow 

3564
02:26:34,651 --> 02:26:35,484
up that they were saying,
the Romanians has said that they have 

3565
02:26:37,981 --> 02:26:40,590
found texts and,
and,

3566
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:41,453
and archeological findings that would 
show a language that was not a romance 

3567
02:26:46,741 --> 02:26:51,741
language that still possessed words that
existed in modern day Romanian.

3568
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:56,370
And that the idea that perhaps that the 
Romanian language was older than Latin.

3569
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:58,320
Oh.
So,

3570
02:26:58,470 --> 02:27:01,450
but they also had a,
the also went to the,

3571
02:27:01,451 --> 02:27:02,284
uh,
the palace of live the impaler and in 

3572
02:27:04,351 --> 02:27:06,030
the middle of Bucharest,
which was awesome.

3573
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:09,110
Oh Wow.
You got to see that guy's house.

3574
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,200
Yeah.
Yeah,

3575
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:12,400
that's all dug underground,
uncertain.

3576
02:27:12,630 --> 02:27:14,060
And so that,
you know,

3577
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:14,953
keep it cool

3578
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:18,880
for people who've lad the impaler was,
he was a guy who literally put,

3579
02:27:18,881 --> 02:27:21,850
put people on sticks and then eat in 
front of them.

3580
02:27:22,180 --> 02:27:23,013
He would stick sticks through their 
assholes and I put them on spikes out 

3581
02:27:26,711 --> 02:27:30,820
their mouth and then have them all lined
up around him while he sat down and ate.

3582
02:27:31,890 --> 02:27:33,660
He also took the,
uh,

3583
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,330
the merchants or the,
the,

3584
02:27:35,331 --> 02:27:36,920
these guys that he felt had been,

3585
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:38,913
uh,

3586
02:27:39,720 --> 02:27:43,670
he's cheating and scamming the we'll Aki
in the,

3587
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:46,060
in the area that he was in in Romania 
will lock you.

3588
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:50,550
They're the people and really getting 
super rich off their backs in a way that

3589
02:27:50,551 --> 02:27:54,630
they didn't have an option.
And so he went and grabbed them,

3590
02:27:54,660 --> 02:27:55,493
them in their kid,
their kids are and would have them 

3591
02:27:57,721 --> 02:27:59,280
build.
They were building the steps,

3592
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:00,960
uh,
up to this,

3593
02:28:00,990 --> 02:28:01,711
to the,
to his,

3594
02:28:01,711 --> 02:28:03,420
to his,
to this castle or whatever.

3595
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:04,830
And if,
if the,

3596
02:28:04,890 --> 02:28:05,723
if the dad died,
they would just take the kid and put 

3597
02:28:07,021 --> 02:28:07,950
them in its place.
And it's like,

3598
02:28:07,951 --> 02:28:10,890
this is going to get until this is 
completely done.

3599
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,410
You know your debt still exists.

3600
02:28:13,510 --> 02:28:16,030
Whoa.
Jesus Christ.

3601
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:17,410
Brutal Dude.
Brutal Times.

3602
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:19,540
That's the guy that Mary Shelley bitten 
all that.

3603
02:28:19,541 --> 02:28:21,800
Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
Mary Frankenstein,

3604
02:28:21,801 --> 02:28:21,980
but

3605
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,470
they fuck's his name.
He wrote Brahm Stoker.

3606
02:28:24,471 --> 02:28:25,180
Bram stoker.
Yeah.

3607
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:26,730
He kind of based it.
A lot of it.

3608
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:27,471
Yeah.
Yeah.

3609
02:28:27,471 --> 02:28:28,940
Well,
and also like the story go away,

3610
02:28:28,941 --> 02:28:32,120
which is a undead creature in,
in Romania,

3611
02:28:32,750 --> 02:28:35,820
which is actually a really pretty funny 
Romania movie called sort of toy,

3612
02:28:36,050 --> 02:28:38,840
which is like a,
it's a comedy horror thing.

3613
02:28:39,450 --> 02:28:40,260
Yeah,
yeah,

3614
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:42,860
yeah.
That's the name they use in that TV show

3615
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,990
to the strain.
Oh really?

3616
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:46,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

3617
02:28:46,341 --> 02:28:49,260
They use that term a lot.
Have you seen that movie,

3618
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,113
that show?
No,

3619
02:28:50,290 --> 02:28:51,123
I,
I don't have cable or anything like 

3620
02:28:51,981 --> 02:28:56,510
that.
I packed since I moved out.

3621
02:28:56,540 --> 02:29:01,040
I haven't into my own place.
I hadn't had time to really set up my tv

3622
02:29:01,041 --> 02:29:01,874
and all that kind of shit.
So you just live in like a wild person 

3623
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:04,951
kind of.
Yeah.

3624
02:29:04,951 --> 02:29:05,751
Yeah.
He got an email though,

3625
02:29:05,751 --> 02:29:06,800
right?
I have email,

3626
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:08,390
I have internet,
I have my laptop.

3627
02:29:08,390 --> 02:29:11,150
So I'm,
I'm do watch netflix like on the laptop,

3628
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:12,920
still watched like documentaries or 
something.

3629
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:15,830
I don't,
you don't,

3630
02:29:15,831 --> 02:29:16,371
cause I'm,
I'm,

3631
02:29:16,371 --> 02:29:18,830
I'm always out and about.
I just got back from Seattle.

3632
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:19,983
Uh,
I was in Vegas Helping Travis and with 

3633
02:29:22,221 --> 02:29:23,054
my fighter show.
Hey.

3634
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:24,143
Uh,
then I had to go to the fights for my 

3635
02:29:26,361 --> 02:29:26,901
guys show.
Hey,

3636
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:27,734
an aga,
they both fall on that night and corner 

3637
02:29:28,791 --> 02:29:30,450
them.
Um,

3638
02:29:30,980 --> 02:29:31,880
shit,
when I was,

3639
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:34,730
I went to Japan and pro wrestled in 
June,

3640
02:29:34,731 --> 02:29:37,890
but I was also there again in March.
Uh,

3641
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:39,110
she,
just a rambling man.

3642
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:40,423
Basically after the dissolution of all 
that I had been putting all my efforts 

3643
02:29:44,631 --> 02:29:46,760
into for four years,
we got past that.

3644
02:29:46,780 --> 02:29:47,600
Right.
We moved,

3645
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,520
but this was,
this was the very therapeutic,

3646
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:50,870
well,
here's the thing,

3647
02:29:50,871 --> 02:29:51,710
it's just like,
all right.

3648
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:54,680
Uh,
no matter what,

3649
02:29:54,681 --> 02:29:55,930
you know,
I still have a lot anymore,

3650
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:57,230
but we're not,
we're not,

3651
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:59,330
we're just saying that,
that,

3652
02:29:59,331 --> 02:30:02,450
you know,
it's just like a moving into,

3653
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:04,790
you know,
I had all these things that I was trying

3654
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:06,770
to accomplish and so it's just like,
all right,

3655
02:30:06,771 --> 02:30:08,750
well,
uh,

3656
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:10,730
since I'm not putting energies in these 
areas,

3657
02:30:10,731 --> 02:30:13,130
then I'm going to take that energy and 
put it somewhere else.

3658
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:14,810
I'm going to make,
make use of it.

3659
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:15,860
You know,
don't sell,

3660
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:17,780
pressed and sit around and get bummed 
out at life.

3661
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:18,640
No.
Well,

3662
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:19,473
and your own advice,
there's lots of shit to get bummed out 

3663
02:30:21,141 --> 02:30:21,974
about.
Not even be beyond even that thing that 

3664
02:30:23,511 --> 02:30:28,430
we're not talking about your podcast,
I wish would happen.

3665
02:30:28,660 --> 02:30:30,800
Uh,
I hate to say it,

3666
02:30:30,801 --> 02:30:31,634
but Fox really dropped the ball big time
on it and the people that were working 

3667
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:37,420
on the podcast,
uh,

3668
02:30:37,640 --> 02:30:41,570
just completely shit the bed to the 
point of like,

3669
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:42,490
I had,
uh,

3670
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:43,513
had Natto and Scotty Epstein on and 
we're sitting there 15 minutes before 

3671
02:30:47,751 --> 02:30:49,850
we're going to go on and just chatting,
whatever.

3672
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:51,860
And then it's like,
all right guys,

3673
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,150
we're going to go,
we're going to fill now.

3674
02:30:53,151 --> 02:30:54,020
All right,
three,

3675
02:30:54,021 --> 02:30:55,190
two,
all right.

3676
02:30:55,340 --> 02:30:56,450
Boom.
Do our thing.

3677
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:01,370
Nobody even pays attention to look at 
the front of the footage and cut it from

3678
02:31:01,371 --> 02:31:02,780
what's not supposed to be aired.

3679
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:03,853
And then they just throw it up there.
Raw Silver Song and I'd throw was being 

3680
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:09,890
[inaudible] and we're all doing our 
stuff.

3681
02:31:09,891 --> 02:31:11,460
And then I get this email and was like,
Yo,

3682
02:31:11,461 --> 02:31:12,560
what the fuck dude?
You know,

3683
02:31:12,570 --> 02:31:15,450
I'm,
I do a character and they go,

3684
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:19,030
what are you talking about?
I go look at it and edit it,

3685
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:21,420
edit it all.
And there were stuff like,

3686
02:31:21,421 --> 02:31:22,910
uh,
hey,

3687
02:31:23,010 --> 02:31:25,050
uh,
I know you're going to be on vacation,

3688
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:28,320
but I'm going to do a on location 
interview with this bank.

3689
02:31:28,350 --> 02:31:30,690
Odour I'm going to get it all.
I'll get all the NP,

3690
02:31:30,750 --> 02:31:32,550
I'll just send it to you.
You can cause someone edit it.

3691
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:34,950
Oh,
I'm off on vacation.

3692
02:31:34,951 --> 02:31:37,890
I can't help put their fucking nobody 
there.

3693
02:31:37,950 --> 02:31:39,270
There's zero,
there's no one.

3694
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:42,690
So then I had to go and reach out to 
another friend and be like,

3695
02:31:42,691 --> 02:31:43,524
hey man,
do you have some time to fucking chop 

3696
02:31:44,191 --> 02:31:44,880
this up for me?

3697
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:46,810
And just make a few edits.
Yay.

3698
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:49,080
I could do that.
And then put that up.

3699
02:31:49,081 --> 02:31:52,080
And then it was another thing like,
okay,

3700
02:31:52,081 --> 02:31:53,940
well hey guys,
if I'm going to do this podcast,

3701
02:31:53,941 --> 02:31:54,774
I want to have music in it.
I want to have bands that I know and 

3702
02:31:57,421 --> 02:32:00,750
love and whatever I want to play there 
who have rights for their music.

3703
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,010
That's a nightmare.
Right.

3704
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:02,873
Well,
so I said,

3705
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:06,330
do you have some legal forms that we can
put together,

3706
02:32:06,331 --> 02:32:08,610
some boiler plates that we can do and 
have this happen?

3707
02:32:08,850 --> 02:32:09,630
Oh,
we don't need it.

3708
02:32:09,630 --> 02:32:10,860
You don't need that,
it's just no big deal.

3709
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:11,933
Okay.
So I go and I get the management 

3710
02:32:15,210 --> 02:32:16,580
artists,
everybody's on

3711
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:19,140
or is this person that said that this is
okay.

3712
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:21,120
Is this guy a young guy that worked 
there,

3713
02:32:21,140 --> 02:32:22,650
there,
there was the not knowing anything.

3714
02:32:22,651 --> 02:32:23,640
Was it like a tech guy?

3715
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:27,990
I am not going to throw anybody's names.
There were these two dudes,

3716
02:32:27,991 --> 02:32:29,760
there was one guy that was like,
uh,

3717
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:33,430
he was a part of the head of the 
division or whatever.

3718
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:35,453
And then there was another dude,
it was a producer of sorts who I got 

3719
02:32:38,071 --> 02:32:38,791
along with.
Great.

3720
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:41,760
But when it came to getting it all done,
obviously fucking it did work.

3721
02:32:41,761 --> 02:32:42,594
But the guy that was above him was 
unable to take blame for anything and 

3722
02:32:47,671 --> 02:32:50,460
uh,
and own up to any like fuck ups.

3723
02:32:50,461 --> 02:32:53,610
And so it wasn't like I was asking for 
much from them.

3724
02:32:53,611 --> 02:32:54,271
I'm just like,
well,

3725
02:32:54,271 --> 02:32:58,200
tell me what we're dealing with here so 
I can know how to appropriately act.

3726
02:32:58,560 --> 02:32:59,370
And then,
you know,

3727
02:32:59,370 --> 02:33:01,530
getting this,
this whole okay about music's all right.

3728
02:33:01,531 --> 02:33:04,070
So I go and I do all the legwork,
get everybody to agree.

3729
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:07,800
Have my guest on,
we play some music to start it off.

3730
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:08,960
We played music,
you know,

3731
02:33:09,030 --> 02:33:09,863
while they're there while he's there and
I'm being an asshole Masha and around 

3732
02:33:12,301 --> 02:33:13,134
the room having fun and joking around.
And then I watched the video of it and 

3733
02:33:15,721 --> 02:33:16,554
it's like silence the fuck I look,
I'm just stomping around the room to 

3734
02:33:20,821 --> 02:33:22,140
silence.
What the Hell is going on?

3735
02:33:22,930 --> 02:33:23,763
Oh yeah.
Illegal wouldn't clear the music and 

3736
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:27,190
like well why the fuck are we dealing 
with this now?

3737
02:33:27,191 --> 02:33:28,024
When I asked you before we even did 
podcasts one before we ended the first 

3738
02:33:31,301 --> 02:33:33,760
episode,
why did we not get that out of the way?

3739
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:37,030
Cause you told me we didn't need it and 
it's just like shit like that.

3740
02:33:37,031 --> 02:33:37,741
And so we're,
we're,

3741
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:38,531
we're now like,
look,

3742
02:33:38,531 --> 02:33:40,060
we're not even doing it for money right 
now.

3743
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:41,520
We're just doing it to,
to,

3744
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,450
to,
to establish a relationship.

3745
02:33:43,930 --> 02:33:46,910
And this already gone sour.
Stop you.

3746
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:47,793
Why do you,
why are you doing it with a person like 

3747
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,830
a network?
Why do you doing with Fox?

3748
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:52,480
Because they came to me,
you can do it on your own.

3749
02:33:52,510 --> 02:33:53,410
They came to me.
Listen,

3750
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:54,363
all you need is that phone right there 
and a fucking a microphone that plugs 

3751
02:33:56,921 --> 02:33:57,754
into it.
It's like I use this one for a podcast 

3752
02:34:01,091 --> 02:34:03,400
that I did recently.
This is not an endorsement.

3753
02:34:03,401 --> 02:34:04,234
I'm just,
uh,

3754
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:08,320
anybody who's listening to this,
it's simple.

3755
02:34:09,070 --> 02:34:09,903
This microphone right here,
no endorsement and I have to say the 

3756
02:34:12,221 --> 02:34:13,510
name of it,
but okay.

3757
02:34:13,511 --> 02:34:15,090
It's a blue right.
Okay.

3758
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:18,040
This microphone works on a cord

3759
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:21,340
that plugs directly into your phone.
You set that bitch up like that.

3760
02:34:21,770 --> 02:34:23,110
He stick this in.
Bang.

3761
02:34:23,111 --> 02:34:25,060
Stick that in your phone.
Press record.

3762
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:26,343
It's that simple.
And I've done actual podcast that 

3763
02:34:28,511 --> 02:34:31,270
millions of people listened to with this
thing that sits in my hand.

3764
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:34,660
I closed that bitch up like that.
Put it back in this little bag,

3765
02:34:34,661 --> 02:34:36,730
stick it in my laptop,
could take it anywhere you go.

3766
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:39,130
It's,
it works on USB.

3767
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:43,390
It takes no energy.
Super easy to do.

3768
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:45,920
And then you just have to upload that 
somewhere and you could add,

3769
02:34:45,970 --> 02:34:48,460
you could figure out how to edit.
Simple stuff like that.

3770
02:34:48,461 --> 02:34:49,294
Audio.
Sure.

3771
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:50,740
You're not talking about like making 
records.

3772
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:52,870
You talked about anything,
a simple audio file,

3773
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:53,860
you can figure out how to do that.

3774
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:57,330
And I hear you there.
I also realized that,

3775
02:34:57,331 --> 02:34:57,931
uh,
you know,

3776
02:34:57,931 --> 02:34:58,764
for me doing a podcast mean it meant it 
had to be like the amount of effort I 

3777
02:35:01,801 --> 02:35:06,230
was going to put into it was going to be
equal to the kind of product I wanted.

3778
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:07,073
So I started,

3779
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:08,790
yeah,
but don't get confused about this,

3780
02:35:08,820 --> 02:35:09,271
right?
No,

3781
02:35:09,271 --> 02:35:10,600
I hear you there.
You're there.

3782
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:11,673
The effort is in your mind and your 
thoughts and what you're trying to put 

3783
02:35:14,581 --> 02:35:15,414
out there and that's your,
you're really good at that is what I'm 

3784
02:35:16,741 --> 02:35:19,170
saying,
that you don't need some network.

3785
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:22,440
You just need an account with like 
Libsyn or one of these podcasts hosts,

3786
02:35:22,441 --> 02:35:24,390
they upload it to itunes.
That's it.

3787
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:25,710
You're done.
You know,

3788
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,240
people find out about it.
They like it,

3789
02:35:27,241 --> 02:35:28,074
they get addicted to it.
They start download to get more and 

3790
02:35:29,371 --> 02:35:30,510
more.
You know what I mean?

3791
02:35:30,511 --> 02:35:31,344
You're really good at this.
To get connected to something like Fox 

3792
02:35:34,291 --> 02:35:38,370
and have someone who's non-motivated 
they came to me and it sounded like,

3793
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:39,204
all right,
well we could probably monetize this in 

3794
02:35:40,261 --> 02:35:42,510
some way and exist during the fighter 
and the kid days,

3795
02:35:42,660 --> 02:35:43,680
uh,
early,

3796
02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:45,000
early.
Yeah.

3797
02:35:45,480 --> 02:35:46,313
See they thought that they were doing 
something and then now they've 

3798
02:35:48,481 --> 02:35:51,300
completely changed their tune there.
They've decided to,

3799
02:35:51,330 --> 02:35:52,163
the only people that they're investing 
their time and now are people they have 

3800
02:35:54,811 --> 02:35:58,050
exclusive relationships with their eye,
their thoughts about the fighter.

3801
02:35:58,051 --> 02:35:58,884
And the kid were,
and Brendan shared with me some article 

3802
02:36:00,661 --> 02:36:03,300
that they were talking about him and 
where the fighter and the kid,

3803
02:36:03,301 --> 02:36:08,301
they feel like road on the Fox name and 
then became really popular and then made

3804
02:36:08,401 --> 02:36:11,100
it is a delusional perspective.
I mean,

3805
02:36:11,101 --> 02:36:11,934
they don't understand what happened.
What happened is there is an 

3806
02:36:13,411 --> 02:36:16,290
entertaining show and two guys are 
really good.

3807
02:36:16,291 --> 02:36:17,124
And then another entertaining show like 
mine has them on and then millions of 

3808
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:23,880
people find out about it and then they 
go on other entertaining shows.

3809
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,910
Like whether it is,
uh,

3810
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:27,390
uh,
fucking,

3811
02:36:27,420 --> 02:36:28,253
uh,
Jason Ellis or whether it's whatever 

3812
02:36:30,451 --> 02:36:31,170
they're doing.
Yeah.

3813
02:36:31,170 --> 02:36:32,003
And then this buildup,
the same thing that happened to Tom 

3814
02:36:34,890 --> 02:36:35,723
Sigora and Christina Palicki and Bert 
Kreischer and all these popular 

3815
02:36:37,921 --> 02:36:38,754
podcasts,
people find out about them and they're 

3816
02:36:39,811 --> 02:36:42,120
good.
It has nothing to do with Fox zero.

3817
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:44,340
Right.
So he did was host at the end of the day

3818
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:44,340
day.

3819
02:36:44,340 --> 02:36:46,620
I mean,
Fox isn't the one creating the content.

3820
02:36:46,621 --> 02:36:47,454
Fox is the one that has,
the idea is Fox isn't the one cracking 

3821
02:36:49,561 --> 02:36:51,090
the jokes,
telling the stories

3822
02:36:51,310 --> 02:36:52,750
or it doesn't hurt,
doesn't hurt.

3823
02:36:52,751 --> 02:36:55,060
Being connected to foster that,
it's definitely legitimate,

3824
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:57,010
not what they think it is.

3825
02:36:57,080 --> 02:36:58,790
And I even said stuff like,
Hey,

3826
02:36:58,791 --> 02:37:01,280
I want to have whatever I want on this 
podcast.

3827
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,480
I have no problem.
I go,

3828
02:37:02,481 --> 02:37:02,990
no,
no.

3829
02:37:02,990 --> 02:37:05,420
I want to have whatever I want on this 
pile.

3830
02:37:05,421 --> 02:37:08,210
I want to talk about anything.
No problem.

3831
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:10,900
There's no pussy farts with Josh 
Barnett,

3832
02:37:10,901 --> 02:37:13,100
Pussy farts with Josh Barnett,
if that's a,

3833
02:37:13,220 --> 02:37:15,980
you know where we wanted to go with it.
But of the things I said

3834
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:16,340
to him,
I go,

3835
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:19,730
Hey,
I want to talk about the the the fucking

3836
02:37:19,731 --> 02:37:22,010
insane Nazi,
a cult division.

3837
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:22,903
I want to talk about all that crazy shit
that they did and I found this guy who 

3838
02:37:25,401 --> 02:37:29,200
was an expert and we can talk about all 
the weird stuff and cult divisions.

3839
02:37:29,201 --> 02:37:30,850
Yeah,
they had an occult division,

3840
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:32,840
the Nazis.
Oh,

3841
02:37:32,870 --> 02:37:34,290
okay.
You said it extreme Nazi.

3842
02:37:34,570 --> 02:37:34,820
No,
no.

3843
02:37:34,820 --> 02:37:35,441
I said the,
the,

3844
02:37:35,441 --> 02:37:37,230
the,
the extreme crazy shit of the Nazi.

3845
02:37:37,231 --> 02:37:38,064
A cultivation.
How they would go around trying to find 

3846
02:37:39,441 --> 02:37:42,080
the spear of destiny or the Ark of the 
covenant and all these,

3847
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:44,001
right.
I mean,

3848
02:37:44,001 --> 02:37:46,490
that's why we have raiders of the lost 
Ark and all the really cool movies.

3849
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:49,550
Would you have on to talk about that?
Because I go,

3850
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:52,730
I'm going to bring this guy on to talk 
about this stuff and they're like,

3851
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:53,900
can't have Nazis on.

3852
02:37:53,930 --> 02:37:54,640
I go,
no,

3853
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:55,473
no,
I'm not.

3854
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,430
I'm not talking about Nazis.
I'm not,

3855
02:37:58,520 --> 02:38:01,310
this isn't,
he isn't Nazi Holocaust history.

3856
02:38:01,540 --> 02:38:04,040
You couldn't have a history professor 
maybe wrote a book on Hitler.

3857
02:38:04,041 --> 02:38:06,620
Come on and talk about Nazis.
Oh yeah.

3858
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:07,850
Yeah.
You don't need them.

3859
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:10,160
You don't know what this was.
This was years ago.

3860
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:14,200
And so after that was like all this 
stuff was,

3861
02:38:14,430 --> 02:38:16,220
was adding up and I'm like,
fuck man,

3862
02:38:16,221 --> 02:38:17,750
this sucks.
It's not even their fault,

3863
02:38:17,751 --> 02:38:18,584
man.
They're stuck in this old way and they 

3864
02:38:20,211 --> 02:38:22,680
think this old,
which works for television shows they're

3865
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:25,730
old way works great for television show.
They control the advertising.

3866
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:28,260
They secure the town.
I don't know how much the shows,

3867
02:38:28,261 --> 02:38:29,094
it was Fox itself.
I don't know if the machine Fox was 

3868
02:38:31,791 --> 02:38:35,900
really paying that much attention.
I think it was really just the main dude

3869
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:38,720
who was above who is in charge of this 
shit,

3870
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:41,990
who was fucking it up and didn't want to
put the effort in and didn't want to,

3871
02:38:41,991 --> 02:38:44,040
you know,
it got to the noise from the last,

3872
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:45,920
the last podcast I did.

3873
02:38:46,110 --> 02:38:46,943
Uh,
they didn't even put the video portion 

3874
02:38:48,261 --> 02:38:49,620
up.
It took them weeks to,

3875
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:50,421
it's just like,
wow.

3876
02:38:50,421 --> 02:38:52,010
Okay.
I guess you don't have any contract with

3877
02:38:52,011 --> 02:38:54,110
them.
Yeah,

3878
02:38:54,111 --> 02:38:55,220
I could.
I could still,

3879
02:38:55,250 --> 02:38:56,450
people still hit me up and go,
hey,

3880
02:38:56,451 --> 02:38:57,430
we like you.
You know,

3881
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:59,300
we'd love it if you do a podcast again.
I'm just like,

3882
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:00,360
ah,
just do it.

3883
02:39:00,650 --> 02:39:02,690
Just do it.
Dude,

3884
02:39:02,691 --> 02:39:03,940
you're really good at this.
It's easy,

3885
02:39:03,941 --> 02:39:05,510
easy for you.
People can get mad at me.

3886
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:06,830
They're like,
God Damn Joe Rogan,

3887
02:39:06,831 --> 02:39:08,240
you always trying to get people to do 
podcasts.

3888
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:11,180
I would listen to your podcast if you 
had a podcast.

3889
02:39:11,181 --> 02:39:12,740
I listened to it all.
I'm saying.

3890
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:13,860
Um,
I,

3891
02:39:13,861 --> 02:39:14,660
uh,
I have,

3892
02:39:14,660 --> 02:39:19,310
I have lots of things to talk about,
but I do like to talk to a broad variety

3893
02:39:19,311 --> 02:39:20,144
of people.
I love the fact that you're bringing on 

3894
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:25,610
guys like Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris 
or,

3895
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:27,680
uh,
uh,

3896
02:39:27,890 --> 02:39:28,723
God's sod.

3897
02:39:29,070 --> 02:39:31,010
Interesting guys to talk about 
interesting stuff.

3898
02:39:32,130 --> 02:39:32,963
Even much as possible,
getting the into scraps with crowder 

3899
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:35,840
over here,
which I'm like,

3900
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:36,670
oh,
that's hilarious.

3901
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:37,790
Yeah.
I like crowder.

3902
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:39,130
I mean nothing.
I don't know.

3903
02:39:39,230 --> 02:39:43,390
I do see him as like an aggregator or 
aggravator just kind of like,

3904
02:39:43,391 --> 02:39:44,224
like Milo,
like Milo might say something 

3905
02:39:45,441 --> 02:39:46,350
interesting,
but then he's,

3906
02:39:46,351 --> 02:39:47,184
he's couch all of this stuff and trying 
to like create shit with people because 

3907
02:39:50,150 --> 02:39:53,270
part of how they get a lot of attention 
and popularity,

3908
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:55,010
but I think he puts out funny stuff too,
man.

3909
02:39:55,011 --> 02:39:57,050
He,
he did some funny things where he,

3910
02:39:57,051 --> 02:39:59,480
uh,
he's done a bunch of like funny sketches

3911
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:02,370
where he goes undercover as different 
people is,

3912
02:40:02,371 --> 02:40:04,400
it's like a Communist,
um,

3913
02:40:04,540 --> 02:40:05,373
uh,
French character that he goes on the 

3914
02:40:06,501 --> 02:40:09,030
cover as and no,
no,

3915
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:10,360
no.
Crowder does crowded.

3916
02:40:10,361 --> 02:40:11,194
There's a lot of funny shit.
People that get mad at me for saying 

3917
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:14,010
he's funny.
I think he's funny.

3918
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,850
I think he does funny shit.
He's uh,

3919
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:18,930
he's done some really hilarious social 
justice warrior things where he,

3920
02:40:18,931 --> 02:40:21,060
uh,
showed up at like some,

3921
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:24,870
well he definitely dressed as a trans 
person for a while.

3922
02:40:24,871 --> 02:40:27,120
I was trying to like push the boundaries
of what,

3923
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:27,983
what,
like when can you decide that your 

3924
02:40:29,731 --> 02:40:30,564
transition,
how do you know whether or not someone 

3925
02:40:31,891 --> 02:40:32,724
has decided that they're transitioning 
or whether or not they're hoax and you 

3926
02:40:35,001 --> 02:40:35,221
know,
like,

3927
02:40:35,221 --> 02:40:37,950
who are you to say with that?
I'm not really trans.

3928
02:40:37,951 --> 02:40:38,784
Like,
so he went to like one of those a all 

3929
02:40:40,321 --> 02:40:41,154
women's gyms and said that he was trans 
and then they let him in at first and 

3930
02:40:43,501 --> 02:40:46,680
then after awhile they were like,
what the fuck I'm,

3931
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:49,440
they kicked him out.
I don't think it was an all woman's gym.

3932
02:40:49,441 --> 02:40:50,274
In fact,
I think he just went to a gym that said 

3933
02:40:52,211 --> 02:40:53,044
that they accept trans people and then 
when he went in and he wanted to shower 

3934
02:40:55,951 --> 02:40:57,780
in the women's room,
but he was like,

3935
02:40:57,781 --> 02:40:58,614
you know,
I had like a fucking five o'clock 

3936
02:40:59,281 --> 02:41:00,114
shadow.
Right.

3937
02:41:00,980 --> 02:41:03,670
So the idea is like,
it's the sincerity of it is,

3938
02:41:03,671 --> 02:41:05,000
is almost what that comes down to.
Like,

3939
02:41:05,001 --> 02:41:06,590
well you're not sincere about being 
trans.

3940
02:41:06,591 --> 02:41:07,450
So is that what it comes?

3941
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:10,880
But he's pointing out like how crazy 
these lines are.

3942
02:41:10,881 --> 02:41:11,970
Right.
And like where are they?

3943
02:41:12,090 --> 02:41:14,550
Whether or not you agree that people 
should be able to do whatever they want,

3944
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,900
they want to,
which I do.

3945
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:17,273
There is a real hysteria involved in 
this and there's something very odd 

3946
02:41:20,791 --> 02:41:22,650
about these arbitrary lines.
Well,

3947
02:41:22,651 --> 02:41:23,484
we decided,
we had a guy that we were watching a 

3948
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:27,660
video tape yesterday who identifies as a
six year old girl.

3949
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:28,583
Oh,
the German guy?

3950
02:41:28,650 --> 02:41:29,250
No,
he's,

3951
02:41:29,250 --> 02:41:31,050
is he German?
He's definitely foreign,

3952
02:41:31,051 --> 02:41:31,460
right?
They,

3953
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:32,293
it was all,

3954
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:34,360
yeah,
he had a wife and kids and all that.

3955
02:41:34,420 --> 02:41:35,770
And then he's like,
I'm a six year old.

3956
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:40,360
Like what the fuck?
But you have to include that.

3957
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:42,850
So then it's because then it gets to,
well,

3958
02:41:42,851 --> 02:41:45,340
can you be transracial can you be like 
Rachel Dolezal?

3959
02:41:45,490 --> 02:41:47,260
Is that okay?
Can you,

3960
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:48,460
I don't know why not.
Look,

3961
02:41:48,461 --> 02:41:49,294
everybody came from Africa originally.
If you identify more with African 

3962
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,441
Americans than you do,
as I say,

3963
02:41:53,441 --> 02:41:55,210
Polish Americans,
why not?

3964
02:41:56,080 --> 02:41:57,010
I don't,
well,

3965
02:41:57,011 --> 02:41:57,844
Ben Shapiro's argued that that's less 
preposterous than changing your gender 

3966
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:04,210
and that like why can't you do that?
If you can change your gender?

3967
02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:05,073
Like why wait?

3968
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:06,433
He's an interesting one because I like 
how hardcore and how like straight to 

3969
02:42:10,101 --> 02:42:12,350
the point he brings great arguments.
Very smart guy.

3970
02:42:12,351 --> 02:42:14,930
I can tell that he's that dude that just
fucking,

3971
02:42:15,050 --> 02:42:15,883
he's just,
he doesn't hardly get along with 

3972
02:42:16,841 --> 02:42:18,800
probably with anyone.
It just got me decided.

3973
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:19,610
Well,
one of those,

3974
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:22,880
one of those personalities,
it's just not good at socializing in any

3975
02:42:22,881 --> 02:42:24,000
way.
Like he,

3976
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:27,830
he's very rigid but very smart.
Yeah.

3977
02:42:27,860 --> 02:42:28,550
He's,
he,

3978
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:31,370
he seems like a total prick,
but an all right dude.

3979
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:32,630
In his own way,
I guess.

3980
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:34,200
And you know what's funny is it's,
I,

3981
02:42:34,670 --> 02:42:36,020
I always,
I'll talk to people about,

3982
02:42:36,050 --> 02:42:37,990
you know,
left leftism versus right as I'm,

3983
02:42:37,991 --> 02:42:38,451
and I'm like,
well,

3984
02:42:38,451 --> 02:42:40,040
you know,
it's pretty easy,

3985
02:42:40,041 --> 02:42:40,874
most of the time to look at the right 
when they're being idiotic because it's 

3986
02:42:43,311 --> 02:42:45,260
so preposterous.
Like,

3987
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:46,293
you know,
theologically based arguments or you 

3988
02:42:49,371 --> 02:42:51,020
know,
if you're going to,

3989
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:52,490
I mean,
that's really what it comes to.

3990
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:53,450
Stuff like that.
Or,

3991
02:42:53,451 --> 02:42:54,320
or like,
um,

3992
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:01,100
how they will take this whole stance of 
like,

3993
02:43:01,640 --> 02:43:02,301
no,
you just,

3994
02:43:02,301 --> 02:43:04,130
you get what you can get,
but if you fucking fuck up,

3995
02:43:04,131 --> 02:43:04,671
fuck you.
You know,

3996
02:43:04,671 --> 02:43:05,504
like the,
these really extreme conservative 

3997
02:43:06,411 --> 02:43:09,680
arguments usually just are like,
well that's not uncompassionate right?

3998
02:43:09,700 --> 02:43:10,441
Yeah,
I know what you know,

3999
02:43:10,441 --> 02:43:12,790
it's,
but you go to the left and it's like,

4000
02:43:12,791 --> 02:43:14,390
everything is couched in this like,
oh no,

4001
02:43:14,391 --> 02:43:14,581
no,
no,

4002
02:43:14,581 --> 02:43:15,130
no,
no,

4003
02:43:15,130 --> 02:43:16,000
we're,
we're good.

4004
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:17,650
This is all for the good look at how 
nice.

4005
02:43:17,651 --> 02:43:18,401
Where it being like,
well,

4006
02:43:18,401 --> 02:43:20,170
you're just as fascist as this other 
guy,

4007
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:21,273
but you,
you couch it into an under a different 

4008
02:43:22,811 --> 02:43:26,290
thing.
You do things like use postmodernist,

4009
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:28,900
uh,
philosophical arguments to then take the

4010
02:43:28,901 --> 02:43:32,290
word racism and redefine it so then it 
works for your benefit.

4011
02:43:32,291 --> 02:43:34,690
And that not only works against black 
people,

4012
02:43:34,691 --> 02:43:37,540
it doesn't work against why people like 
going against white people.

4013
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:38,523
Yeah.
People get weird with their arguments 

4014
02:43:39,401 --> 02:43:41,530
and it ultimately becomes a about 
control.

4015
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,371
Sure.
Of course.

4016
02:43:42,371 --> 02:43:45,730
And power is creating power for a 
person,

4017
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:47,410
uh,
to,

4018
02:43:47,480 --> 02:43:48,313
to affect that against someone else is 
in creating or it's also a creating 

4019
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:57,160
moral high ground so you can feel as if 
you're in the right to say this or that.

4020
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:00,250
And because you are supported by all 
these other people around you.

4021
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:01,403
Yeah.
I tried a bow,

4022
02:44:01,440 --> 02:44:03,060
I'm trying to balance it out,
I should say,

4023
02:44:03,061 --> 02:44:05,640
but people get mad at me when I have too
many right wing people on in a row.

4024
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,220
They start thinking like if I've been 
accused of being like Fox News,

4025
02:44:08,221 --> 02:44:08,791
I'm like,
come on man,

4026
02:44:08,791 --> 02:44:10,380
I have left.
He's on all the time.

4027
02:44:10,400 --> 02:44:14,010
She's not paying attention.
Whether it's Julie Kedsey or Abby Martin

4028
02:44:14,011 --> 02:44:15,780
or a w.
What does it,

4029
02:44:15,781 --> 02:44:18,740
Pete Holmes is a super,
super lefty judd apatow.

4030
02:44:18,741 --> 02:44:20,730
How's a soup and lefty he was on last 
week.

4031
02:44:20,731 --> 02:44:22,320
I tried to have as many lefties on as 
possible,

4032
02:44:22,321 --> 02:44:25,680
but they don't get mad at that.
They only get mad when I have like super

4033
02:44:25,681 --> 02:44:27,810
righties on when I have super righties 
on.

4034
02:44:27,811 --> 02:44:28,644
Then they were like,
oh yo,

4035
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:29,660
your shows like Fox News.

4036
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:30,650
Well,
culturally,

4037
02:44:30,651 --> 02:44:31,461
you know,
it's just like,

4038
02:44:31,461 --> 02:44:33,080
well we can this,
this,

4039
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:35,920
this argument will listen to you,
but not this one of course.

4040
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,033
But at the end of the day,
what really sucks is that when it came 

4041
02:44:39,801 --> 02:44:41,090
to,
uh,

4042
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:42,260
you know,
in such a,

4043
02:44:42,710 --> 02:44:46,000
I had gotten so into a politics because 
of my living situation.

4044
02:44:46,001 --> 02:44:47,780
I,
as I'm looking at all this stuff,

4045
02:44:48,050 --> 02:44:51,470
trying to understand the currents of 
what's going on,

4046
02:44:51,710 --> 02:44:52,543
I'd find I'd have to go read like the 
most crazy leftist stuff and then I'd 

4047
02:44:57,441 --> 02:44:58,274
have to go find some gnarly alt-right 
garbage and have to go there and read 

4048
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:05,570
all these preposterous arguments,
racist,

4049
02:45:05,571 --> 02:45:06,404
shitty arguments on both sides.
Just ridiculous stuff to them because 

4050
02:45:10,251 --> 02:45:14,030
even amongst some crazy racist or some,
some crazy,

4051
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:14,930
you know,
communist,

4052
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:15,793
either way,
there's got to be some truth there that 

4053
02:45:17,001 --> 02:45:21,650
they figure is useful to their argument 
that may be different from the other,

4054
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:23,570
but it still doesn't change it from 
being true.

4055
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:24,403
It's like,
uh,

4056
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:25,910
uh,
you can't,

4057
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:28,040
the truth doesn't change from place to 
place.

4058
02:45:28,041 --> 02:45:29,210
You,
you can't,

4059
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:31,400
you can't change it anymore and you can 
salt salt,

4060
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:35,750
uh,
said by Cormac Mccarthy and it's like,

4061
02:45:35,751 --> 02:45:36,584
well I have to now go outside of this 
because I can't find anyone new sources 

4062
02:45:40,460 --> 02:45:41,293
going to be completely honest with me.
So then I have to look and all these 

4063
02:45:44,301 --> 02:45:48,170
places and then try to piece this whole 
story together based on what truth I can

4064
02:45:48,171 --> 02:45:49,530
find.
And honestly it,

4065
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:54,560
it got to be so tiring and reading just 
crazy shit on each side and having to,

4066
02:45:57,460 --> 02:45:58,460
it's just like,
well,

4067
02:45:58,490 --> 02:45:59,323
some of this stuff,
it's just so fucking fucked up and it's 

4068
02:46:01,191 --> 02:46:03,560
not like I needed a trigger warning or 
something like that,

4069
02:46:03,561 --> 02:46:04,800
but it's just,
he's just gets tiring it.

4070
02:46:04,810 --> 02:46:07,820
They didn't also think like people 
coming up with like,

4071
02:46:08,150 --> 02:46:10,730
uh,
racial Iq things,

4072
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,190
trying to create some,
some idea there and I'm like,

4073
02:46:13,250 --> 02:46:14,180
ah,
fuck man,

4074
02:46:14,181 --> 02:46:15,350
this is,
people believe this.

4075
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:19,550
It's like trying to to navigate flat 
earth shit and stuff like that and go,

4076
02:46:19,551 --> 02:46:21,890
come on.
I hear it.

4077
02:46:21,891 --> 02:46:22,970
The first time I read it,
I'm like,

4078
02:46:22,971 --> 02:46:23,541
okay,
yeah,

4079
02:46:23,541 --> 02:46:24,740
whatever.
You just don't get it.

4080
02:46:24,741 --> 02:46:28,280
But then when I see that there's even 
some small amount of traction,

4081
02:46:28,281 --> 02:46:30,260
it's just fucking disappointing.
It's very disappointing.

4082
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:31,130
Yeah.
Well,

4083
02:46:31,130 --> 02:46:31,963
it's too easy to get by today and 
there's a lot of dummies that have 

4084
02:46:33,531 --> 02:46:34,340
gotten bots,
right.

4085
02:46:34,340 --> 02:46:36,380
That's one of my arguments is that this 
is the softest,

4086
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:39,080
easiest fucking way of living we've ever
had.

4087
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:41,600
Now I understand there are difficulties,
but are difficult.

4088
02:46:41,601 --> 02:46:42,434
Even our poor are still more wealthy 
than like the 90% of the world or 

4089
02:46:46,041 --> 02:46:47,020
something like that.
It's true.

4090
02:46:47,021 --> 02:46:47,960
Crazy.
Yeah.

4091
02:46:47,961 --> 02:46:52,160
If you make more than $34,000 a year,
you were in the top 1% of the world.

4092
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:54,590
Yeah.
And we don't,

4093
02:46:55,250 --> 02:46:56,510
we don't see it that way.

4094
02:46:56,570 --> 02:46:57,081
No.
You know,

4095
02:46:57,081 --> 02:46:57,914
we're too busy thinking about what we 
don't have or what we should have or 

4096
02:47:00,501 --> 02:47:02,810
what,
how are we deserve more than this person

4097
02:47:02,811 --> 02:47:05,500
or that person or how you know,
you know,

4098
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:09,860
if you want to argue about the 
difficulty it is to buy a home nowadays,

4099
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:13,240
I'm totally willing to listen.
If you want to argue about the,

4100
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:16,910
the shady aspects of banks,
I'm there with you.

4101
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:18,080
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

4102
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:23,110
But if you just want to start trying to 
cut me down into some specific class and

4103
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:28,880
minimal to minimize me and then devalue 
my opinion or who I am,

4104
02:47:28,881 --> 02:47:31,510
it's just like I'm not going to,
I understand the,

4105
02:47:31,511 --> 02:47:32,344
the biological potential for tribalism 
and the fear of the thing of it is the 

4106
02:47:36,231 --> 02:47:40,280
unknown being maybe too much of a risk.
So if you look at wild animals,

4107
02:47:40,281 --> 02:47:41,870
they don't really get into fights all 
that much.

4108
02:47:41,900 --> 02:47:45,440
If they can help it,
because the risk of being injured,

4109
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:47,270
maimed,
or dead,

4110
02:47:47,390 --> 02:47:49,280
potentially,
it's just too much.

4111
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:50,133
She had,
most of the time they get into their 

4112
02:47:50,361 --> 02:47:52,460
little scraps and they disperse,
right?

4113
02:47:52,461 --> 02:47:53,294
And if you're a full on Alpha,
you normally don't get into any fucking 

4114
02:47:55,521 --> 02:47:56,354
fights whatsoever.
It's the bait is always trying to like 

4115
02:47:57,801 --> 02:47:58,634
pick their way up and maybe eventually 
find an Alpha that's that they might 

4116
02:48:01,941 --> 02:48:02,774
perceive having a weakness.
But once they finally get to that point 

4117
02:48:05,121 --> 02:48:07,010
that they're going to really fucking 
full on fight,

4118
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:09,740
it means everything because everything 
is at risk.

4119
02:48:09,770 --> 02:48:10,461
Well,
you know,

4120
02:48:10,461 --> 02:48:11,294
you look at some cave people,
it was probably the same way the first 

4121
02:48:12,951 --> 02:48:14,540
time.
You know,

4122
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:15,553
uh,
one group sees someone that looks 

4123
02:48:16,761 --> 02:48:17,930
completely different from them.
They're like,

4124
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:18,830
oh,
what the fuck is that?

4125
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:22,520
Can I risk it?
Is it going to destroy my community?

4126
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:23,750
Is it going to be damaging to,
you know,

4127
02:48:23,751 --> 02:48:24,584
it's like cave man shit because they 
don't understand until somebody creates 

4128
02:48:27,531 --> 02:48:28,410
an understanding.
So,

4129
02:48:28,411 --> 02:48:29,244
uh,
but it's very hard for people to accept 

4130
02:48:29,961 --> 02:48:30,794
other people's ideas.
Of course your ideas are different and 

4131
02:48:32,851 --> 02:48:33,684
then their ideas,
you want their ideas to align with 

4132
02:48:35,511 --> 02:48:36,344
yours.
And in the case where we're talking 

4133
02:48:38,091 --> 02:48:38,924
about with a lot of these people,
they're trying to enforce or ideas on 

4134
02:48:41,151 --> 02:48:41,984
other people,
you will now obey and go along with my 

4135
02:48:44,961 --> 02:48:48,080
standards of behavior and thought it's 
insecurity and it's fear.

4136
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:50,240
And,
but to me I'm like,

4137
02:48:50,241 --> 02:48:51,074
okay,
I can understand that on that base 

4138
02:48:52,941 --> 02:48:53,774
element,
but we have the ability to overcome 

4139
02:48:55,311 --> 02:48:56,420
that,
to be greater than that,

4140
02:48:56,421 --> 02:48:59,420
to be better than that,
to not to not sit there and,

4141
02:48:59,421 --> 02:49:04,421
and value people on all these surface 
level shit.

4142
02:49:04,730 --> 02:49:05,750
You know?
I mean you can,

4143
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:08,010
you could stereotype things all you want
and be like,

4144
02:49:08,011 --> 02:49:08,844
oh well this looks like a duck and 
quacks like a duck and this looks like 

4145
02:49:10,351 --> 02:49:10,410
it.

4146
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:12,300
Goosing Hong,
like whatever.

4147
02:49:12,301 --> 02:49:13,134
Fine.
But if you try to continue to keep 

4148
02:49:17,581 --> 02:49:20,070
people in these places,
you're,

4149
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:22,800
you're diminishing who they are.
You're also,

4150
02:49:23,430 --> 02:49:26,460
you're creating this,
this element of prejudice.

4151
02:49:26,461 --> 02:49:28,710
You're creating those barriers for,
for that to,

4152
02:49:28,711 --> 02:49:31,990
not for that interaction to not happen.
You're the one that's,

4153
02:49:31,991 --> 02:49:34,920
that's helping create that,
that tribalistic element.

4154
02:49:34,921 --> 02:49:38,670
And so as you continue to widdle these 
people down in a more and more groups,

4155
02:49:38,671 --> 02:49:40,010
but you know,
with the,

4156
02:49:40,360 --> 02:49:43,560
that now when you couch that in with 
this neo Marxist elements,

4157
02:49:43,561 --> 02:49:44,041
it's like,
well,

4158
02:49:44,041 --> 02:49:46,470
now you need the more tiny or the group 
you get,

4159
02:49:46,471 --> 02:49:50,160
the more you get to be oppressed,
the more you're a victim of something.

4160
02:49:50,490 --> 02:49:51,810
And so,
yeah,

4161
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:53,013
them,
it's a good market share and being a 

4162
02:49:54,401 --> 02:49:56,010
victim,
we've got to get out of your mouth.

4163
02:49:56,020 --> 02:50:00,390
I gotta end this Josh Barnett.
So what's the future right now?

4164
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:01,110
No fights.

4165
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:02,490
Scheduled,
no fights.

4166
02:50:02,491 --> 02:50:03,324
I am,
you know,

4167
02:50:03,340 --> 02:50:06,030
uh,
actually I'm still dealing with my Usada

4168
02:50:06,031 --> 02:50:07,290
stuff.
Uh,

4169
02:50:07,291 --> 02:50:10,050
we have to,
my understanding,

4170
02:50:10,051 --> 02:50:10,884
but my management saying is that you 
sought out to a completely satisfied 

4171
02:50:14,641 --> 02:50:16,260
with understanding that,
uh,

4172
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:18,540
that this supplement that I took was 
tainted.

4173
02:50:18,630 --> 02:50:21,750
And then we even went out and after they
tested the one that I gave them,

4174
02:50:21,751 --> 02:50:24,330
they went out and bought a whole brand 
new bottle on,

4175
02:50:24,331 --> 02:50:25,164
opened,
tested that one again laced with the 

4176
02:50:27,511 --> 02:50:29,550
same shit.
And they had already,

4177
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:32,310
you know,
they had tested me not even that,

4178
02:50:32,340 --> 02:50:33,173
that much in between are they testing me
in between like or there was barely any 

4179
02:50:36,181 --> 02:50:37,014
time in between test anyways.
So my managers telling me that the guy 

4180
02:50:40,321 --> 02:50:41,154
at the lab is going,
well this is such a negligible amount 

4181
02:50:43,051 --> 02:50:46,980
that it looks like you've been whatever 
you took was tainted in the first place.

4182
02:50:47,310 --> 02:50:51,810
So because there's no reason why a guy 
your size would even bother to have such

4183
02:50:51,811 --> 02:50:54,750
a negligible amount of whatever this 
shit is and your system.

4184
02:50:54,751 --> 02:50:55,584
And I'm like especially since two to 
explain that between the last test and 

4185
02:50:59,461 --> 02:51:01,110
this test,
yes you would have,

4186
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,850
it would be such a small amount,
right,

4187
02:51:03,030 --> 02:51:06,150
that there's no way that you were on 
something and you cycled off.

4188
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:08,460
Exactly.
It didn't make any sense.

4189
02:51:08,630 --> 02:51:10,290
They have you suspended too.
I don't know.

4190
02:51:10,590 --> 02:51:12,180
The thing is,
is that we've gone through,

4191
02:51:12,181 --> 02:51:13,014
I've spent like two grand having 
supplements tested cause I would keep 

4192
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:19,560
bits of everything that I would take 
just in case and keep him around.

4193
02:51:19,950 --> 02:51:21,480
And uh,
Christ,

4194
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:23,280
you know,
and I,

4195
02:51:23,281 --> 02:51:27,250
this was a brand I'd taken before.
This was a,

4196
02:51:27,251 --> 02:51:28,084
a supplement that had been an ingredient
and other stuff that I've never had a 

4197
02:51:30,271 --> 02:51:31,104
problem with.

4198
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:31,973
You know,
I always would check everything against 

4199
02:51:33,061 --> 02:51:33,894
that global drove thing.
I would do all their steps about cross 

4200
02:51:36,650 --> 02:51:38,730
referenced this,
that and the other always.

4201
02:51:38,731 --> 02:51:39,720
Okay.
You know,

4202
02:51:39,721 --> 02:51:43,050
making sure that I'm always on a towing 
the,

4203
02:51:43,060 --> 02:51:44,630
are not toeing the line,
but uh,

4204
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:47,310
being up front on this and doing what 
they said too.

4205
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:49,260
And then,
you know,

4206
02:51:49,490 --> 02:51:50,850
all right,
so I got some,

4207
02:51:51,210 --> 02:51:53,700
some bullshit and something I didn't 
expect.

4208
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:54,653
So,
all right,

4209
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:55,710
we go,
we test it.

4210
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:57,630
They go in a,
they,

4211
02:51:58,200 --> 02:51:59,033
they back their findings up with a 
completely brand new bottle and batch 

4212
02:52:01,681 --> 02:52:02,514
that matches the one that,
I haven't acted on that and now I'm 

4213
02:52:04,531 --> 02:52:05,760
still waiting,
but I,

4214
02:52:05,800 --> 02:52:06,040
I'm

4215
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:07,330
still suspended,
but I don't,

4216
02:52:07,540 --> 02:52:09,160
I don't understand.
You know what,

4217
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:10,840
what,
what more could I do?

4218
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:11,680
Right.
You know what I mean?

4219
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:13,690
Right.
All right dude.

4220
02:52:14,020 --> 02:52:17,100
Um,
