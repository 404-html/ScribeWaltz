1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,430
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
two.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,363
Hello,
Dale.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,120
Hey,
how you doing?

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,530
Thanks for doing this man.
I appreciate it.

6
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:11,670
Yeah,
I'm glad to be here.

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,710
Nice to meet you,
man.

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,210
Nice to found out that not only you're a
car driver,

9
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,390
you also a bowhunter yeah,
yeah.

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,520
They'd be like,
I saw your,

11
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,840
your archery equipment and all that 
stuff,

12
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,310
but me and a buddy of mine owned some 
land and,

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,560
and I try to get out there and at least 
go twice a year.

14
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,050
I just love being in the stands,
sitting in the woods,

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,080
just thinking about what's going on and 
brain cleanse everything before the shot

16
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,070
really is what it's all about.
Yeah,

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,040
that's a lot of it,
right?

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,000
Hanging out with your,
being with your friends and family,

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,650
you know,
you need one of those technical wants in

20
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,960
your life.
It's pretty impressive.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,623
Yeah.
That thing is all my friends would come 

22
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,531
over here.
Just go,

23
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:50,610
whoa.

24
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,491
Yeah.
That's a,

25
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:52,710
that's a life changer.
Yeah,

26
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,080
absolutely.
But it's also a giant time waster.

27
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:55,914
I know.
I don't know.

28
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,963
I've got a golf sim at the house,
so I got to figure out where I can put 

29
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,440
that.
Golf is the one I've always avoided.

30
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,710
I've always avoided golf because I just 
saw it suck away people's time.

31
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,720
I don't go.
That's the thing,

32
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:07,554
like I don't have the time and the 
patience to really block that whole day 

33
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,124
off to go play outdoors,
but to go over there and just hit the 

34
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,230
driver for 30 minutes on the simulators.
So fun.

35
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,453
Well,
I would imagine with what you do for a 

36
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,004
living with.
I think what you do is one of the 

37
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,930
craziest,
wildest,

38
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,720
most demanding things a person could do 
for an occupation where,

39
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,640
I dunno,
it's,

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,530
it's right up there,
you know?

41
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,364
No,
other than being a soldier or a 

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,943
firefighter or a cop or a fighter 
fighter and bullfighting and bull 

43
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,164
riding,
those types of things are those people 

44
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:42,210
boxing.

45
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,640
That's some bull riders that's on 
another level.

46
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,474
That's another level of crazy as hung 
out with those guys and they are on 

47
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,090
another day or crazy people.
You know,

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,610
it takes a certain mentality to,
to be able to climb onto a bull.

49
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,043
Yeah,
they have a certain energy about them 

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,560
that they got that I don't give a fuck 
energy.

51
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,470
It's cranked up the tab.
Yeah.

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,660
Have you ever been in Vegas when they 
have the finals?

53
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,503
I haven't actually,
but they're everywhere and they're all 

54
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,380
crazy.
I know that they are really,

55
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,730
I know a lot of those guys and uh,
um,

56
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,870
our car,
our paths have crossed several times and

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,880
every time you're around them you're 
like,

58
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:21,060
are we going to end up in jail tonight?
That's a real possibility.

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,643
Yeah.
I mean there are throwbacks real 

60
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,080
throwback.
They are legit wildman.

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,090
I agree.
Yeah.

62
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,380
I mean,
but what,

63
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,870
but driving,
driving a race car,

64
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,560
I mean you have a giant engine,
you're strapped into a seat,

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,423
you're and down the road at extreme 
speeds right next to other cars doing 

66
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,580
the same thing.
Just the intensity and the,

67
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,423
just the everything.
Being on nine at all times like that is 

68
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,550
a wild way to make a living,
sir.

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,331
Yeah,
thanks.

70
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,021
I mean,
I,

71
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:51,660
um,
when I was a little,

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,030
when I was little thinking about,
you know,

73
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,730
what the hell am I going to grow up and 
be a,

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,623
I was,
my father was really successful in the 

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,040
sport so I would go to

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
the races and I would watch him race and
see him win and watch him go through 

77
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,490
victory lane and,
and celebrate and all those things.

78
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,140
And I thought,
man,

79
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:10,090
this is what I gotta do.
I gotta do this,

80
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,530
this is,
this looks fun.

81
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,510
This looks exciting.
People are,

82
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,990
you know,
people are in all of the drivers,

83
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,260
the race,
my father,

84
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,123
the,
the personalities and I just wanted to 

85
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,190
do it real badly.
But I knew that the odds of making it or

86
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,024
tufts,
so there's only 40 guys in the field 

87
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,184
every weekend.
So there's 40 guys in this in the whole 

88
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,640
country that are going to get the shot 
to do it,

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,553
you know?
And may the odds of me even with my dad 

90
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,290
being a successful,
his,

91
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,530
he was,
I'd have a lot of doors open to me.

92
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,230
But the odds of me actually getting 
there and being able to stay,

93
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,070
have the staying power and the success 
and talent I just knew were tough.

94
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,380
So I didn't know if I'd ever get that 
chance.

95
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,220
Um,
but it is.

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,513
I don't know.
I remember the first time I went to a 

97
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:58,834
two and a half mile track.
It's Talladega and you hold it wide 

98
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,300
open.
I was uh,

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,260
working at my dad's dealership,
changing oil.

100
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,040
He owned a Chevy store in Newton,
North Carolina.

101
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,600
And uh,
the phone rang and he said,

102
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,493
my dad,
my dad was on the van and he was in 

103
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,594
Talladega for a test and he said,
get your helmet and your suit and meet 

104
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:20,020
me at the race track the next day you're
gonna fly the king air to the,

105
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,400
to the track.
Don't know,

106
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,810
don't ask questions,
just do it.

107
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,670
And so I got there and I knew I was 
going to Talladega and I thought,

108
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,780
man,
I must be driving this.

109
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,643
This is gonna be crazy.
I'm going to go around this two and a 

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,480
half mile to track full speed at 190 
miles an hour.

111
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,313
I'd never done,
I never went faster than 90 or 95 on a 

112
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,493
race track before.
Never drove anything bigger than a half 

113
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,540
mile.
And uh,

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,220
I pulled out,
he's got there,

115
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,270
he's like,
you're gonna test this car,

116
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,170
get in,
get ready.

117
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,830
He puts me in there and he's like,
you got a hold of wide open if you don't

118
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,710
hold a lot up and the motor's not going 
to work it,

119
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,420
it'll hurt the motor.
You got to hold it the way they tune the

120
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,760
motor to run wide open.
It has to run it,

121
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,043
it has to run at full throttle if you 
tried to go around there and half 

122
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,720
throttle to burn the Pistons that a run 
to lean all those things.

123
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,554
So he,
he was saying that and I thought to 

124
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,254
myself,
is he just telling me that just to make 

125
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,320
sure I hold a lot open because he 
thought I would,

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,570
I would,
I would be opposed to not do it.

127
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,500
And so I was like,
man,

128
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,550
I,
I'm a little nervous,

129
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,350
uh,
to hold it wide open.

130
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:24,250
But I pulled out on the track and mash 
the gas full throttle and I'm going down

131
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,084
the back straightaway and I was like,
I'm looking down the back straightaway 

132
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,160
into the next corner,
this long corner.

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,160
And I'm like,
how's it going to stick?

134
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,910
You know,
how's the car going to,

135
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,810
how's the car not going to flat of the 
racetrack like it.

136
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm going so fast,
I don't,

137
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,750
it doesn't feel like it's going to stay 
in the track.

138
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,360
And uh,
and I kept running,

139
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,280
kept running through my head about my 
dad's saying,

140
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,360
I got to hold it wide open.
I'm like,

141
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,320
well that's it.
It'll,

142
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,870
it'll,
it'll go wide open around here.

143
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,960
So I don't think he would,
you know,

144
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,953
I believe everything he says and you go 
in the corner and you turn a into the 

145
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,810
corner and there is more grit than you 
can imagine.

146
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,643
Like the,
it,

147
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,493
there's so much grit.
The truck of the car is stuck to the 

148
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:13,910
track with such grip that you've never 
felt this before in your life.

149
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,360
This grip,
like you can't slide across that track.

150
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,500
That or the tires and the car,
a hold of the track,

151
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,480
so tough and tight that nothing going to
make it.

152
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,570
It just goes around there like it's the 
craziest thing.

153
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,690
And so now today when I tell people,
uh,

154
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,713
when I got,
we got this two seater car and we take 

155
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,220
people for rides and they get in there 
and I'm like,

156
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,090
man,
what am I going to do?

157
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:35,924
What are you going to do to explain to 
somebody what this is going to feel 

158
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:37,994
like?
Whether I will tell you things to pay 

159
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,580
attention,
to pay attention to the grip.

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,550
You're not going to believe how much 
grip this car has.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,970
Like it's,
you're,

162
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,393
you're just not going to believe that 
it'll stick to the track the way it 

163
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,244
does.
So pay attention to that and pay 

164
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:51,590
attention.
Now,

165
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,030
bumpy and violent,
it is,

166
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,313
you know,
you drive a cadillac or a any car down 

167
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,111
the street,
well,

168
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,210
it's six,
eight inches off the ground.

169
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,540
These big old inflated tires and big,
giant sidewalls.

170
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,960
And it's going to feel nice.
You know,

171
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,803
when it hits a little bumps,
our cars are rigid and stuck to the 

172
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,870
ground and don't have much travel in the
suspension and you know,

173
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,190
it's just,
it's,

174
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,900
it's built to hand to go fast,
not to feel good,

175
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,763
you know,
and it's gonna it's rough as hell and 

176
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,320
shakes,
shakes the hell out of you.

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,320
And um,
that's what I remember about that.

178
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,130
And as soon as I got over that initial 
fear,

179
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:28,730
I think that was the only time I ever 
had any real fear of driving a car.

180
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,170
As soon as I was like,
well,

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,430
alright,
what do you know?

182
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,533
Anything,
nothing else is going to be as scary as 

183
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,380
that was.
Right.

184
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,313
Driving a car.
And I've been flipping and when I 

185
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,140
flipped for the first time and our,
you know,

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,870
the car's tumbling and flying parts 
flying off the air,

187
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,340
my eye,
I thought to myself that I wasn't scared

188
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:55,090
or I never was scared of flipping.
My thought was I just did something.

189
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,530
A lot of people never get to experience,
you know,

190
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:00,410
I did something that,
uh,

191
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,800
that only a few people know what that's 
like.

192
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,020
And,
and I feel safe,

193
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,420
I've always felt incredibly safe inside 
the car,

194
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,560
you know,
with,

195
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,880
especially with the,
I mean,

196
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,714
in the last 20 years,
this safety stuff has really been 

197
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,110
focused on and improved and better and 
better and better.

198
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,900
But I'll look at the interior of our 
cars today versus 20 years ago.

199
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,733
And it said,
I can't believe some of the stuff that 

200
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:27,080
we used to climb into that.
So you felt calm while it was flipping?

201
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,660
Oh yeah.
I always will have seen cars flipped,

202
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,060
right?
I've seen it for years.

203
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Right.
And so I know it's possible.

204
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,330
So I get in there and I got turned 
around at a race in 1998.

205
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:43,331
I was racing at Daytona and uh,
I got turned around and the car,

206
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,260
so I'm flipping for the first time in my
life and this car is like over 3000,

207
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,040
3000 pounds.
So it's.

208
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,430
But it flies up in the air.
Like it's paper,

209
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,020
man.
It's the craziest thing in the world.

210
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,430
It's so weightless,
you know,

211
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
and what it felt like to me [inaudible].
So the car rolled on its side and came 

212
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,534
down kind of on its side.
It felt like somebody wrote a prop wall 

213
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:09,480
of grass up against the car,
you know what I'm saying?

214
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,730
When I was on my side and I could see 
the ground,

215
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
I felt like I was right side up because 
as you're flipping,

216
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,033
the force pushes you down in the seat.
So you feel internally you feel gravity 

217
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,620
all the time.
Like you're,

218
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,530
you know,
as a cars flipping your.

219
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,930
You're pushed into the seat so you feel 
great.

220
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,240
You feel weight of yourself in the seat.
That never changes.

221
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,430
You never kind of come up out of the 
city like that,

222
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,010
you know?
And so it was like somebody wrote a prop

223
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,863
Walla grass up against the side of the 
car and then against the roof and then 

224
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,480
against that side and then this,
you know,

225
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,314
it kept doing that and I'm like,
it's just the weirdest feeling and you 

226
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:46,490
feel completely safe and you feel like,
you know,

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,200
nothing's going to harm me,
but this,

228
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,020
any,
you know,

229
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,460
just,
you.

230
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,290
Just.
One of the things we always talk about,

231
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:57,291
it's like get your hands on to something
because the spinning makes your arms and

232
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,103
you just go like this and if you watch a
lot of old wrecks from the sixties and 

233
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,414
seventies,
you'll see the guy's arms come flying 

234
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,330
out the window and they're just kind of 
flopping around.

235
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:10,850
They can't pull it spinning so fast.
You can't pull it in and uh,

236
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,693
your arms go like that.
So as soon as you know you're going 

237
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:13,974
upside down,
you grabbed the bottom of the steering 

238
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:15,890
wheel and just Kinda,
you know,

239
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,070
watch.
But um,

240
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,513
I flip my pickup truck one time on 
Christmas Day and I wasn't holding on 

241
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,680
the steering wheel and my arm went out 
the window,

242
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,540
you know,
for like a split second.

243
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,190
It banged around in the,
in the,

244
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,090
in the window seal.
And I was like,

245
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,900
man,
you know,

246
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,140
I got it back in and grabbed a hold the 
steering wheel with both my hands.

247
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,310
And so ever since then I've like,
you know,

248
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,153
now I know like anytime I'm in a crash,
you gotta have your hands a hold of 

249
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,190
something because that's the one thing 
that you can't control.

250
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,260
You're strapped in with your seat belt 
and everything,

251
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,950
but your arms are,
you know,

252
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:51,843
can go anywhere.
And in that moment when the car's 

253
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,320
rolling or barrel rolling or flipping 
you,

254
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,400
it's so fast.
Like you can't,

255
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,760
your arms just go this way.
It's the craziest thing in the world.

256
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,953
That's the only fear I guess is that 
your arm could get outside the window 

257
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:08,640
and get crushed or something because you
guys have had that happen.

258
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,080
Yeah,
I would imagine.

259
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,973
Yeah.
How'd you flip when you were on 

260
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,080
Christmas?
On Christmas Day?

261
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,180
My sister,
uh,

262
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,670
she knows this,
she just won't be news to her,

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
but um,
uh,

264
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,463
it,
it's probably not fun for her to hear 

265
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:21,930
every time I tell it.

266
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,370
But we,
I had a pickup truck with a tape deck in

267
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,204
it and I had,
she got me the Walkman cd with the 

268
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:33,680
adapter for the tape tape deck that you 
stick into you,

269
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
you know,
you said adapter.

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,980
And she bought me the Walkman extended 
after.

271
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:39,090
And I'm in my,
I'm in,

272
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,520
I'm in my truck.
I got an extended cab as 10.

273
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm driving from my house to my memos 
house where a farmer union is.

274
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,400
My Dad's there.
Everybody's,

275
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,350
their whole family's there.
I'm a little late,

276
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,093
um,
and I'm driving down the road and I got 

277
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:57,400
to mess around with that Walkman.
And I drove off into the ditch and I hit

278
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,234
a driveway,
covert pipe drainage pipe in a driveway 

279
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,770
and went like seven flips and destroyed 
this truck in the middle of the flip.

280
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,800
And I remember that happening and 
everything.

281
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:12,580
All my change jacket,
anything that was loose in the car,

282
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,100
ended up down in one corner,
like flow board.

283
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,443
Everything sort of collects into that.
One corner is spinning and it crushed 

284
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:24,040
the windshield down.
The mirror was down into the radio,

285
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,740
you know,
we was,

286
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,460
it crushed the roof down real bad.
I was really lucky.

287
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,683
I had my hands on top of the steering 
wheel and the windshield kept slapping 

288
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,570
my knuckles and knocked on,
busted all my knuckles real bad.

289
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,760
And so then I let go and my hands went 
this way and then I finally got him back

290
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,170
in and grabbed the bottom of the 
steering wheel.

291
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,433
The tires were broken and busted off the
truck and this I got out of the truck 

292
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,500
and I was fine.
Didn't have any injuries other than just

293
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:56,530
the knuckles kind of being scraped up 
this,

294
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,430
this newly married couple.
They just are either got engaged or just

295
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,264
got married.
We're driving the other way and saw the 

296
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:07,060
whole thing and they stopped and uh,
they were like,

297
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:07,451
yeah,
right.

298
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,284
I'm like,
yeah.

299
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,873
And uh,
of course there's this line of cars 

300
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,380
behind me stopped on the road and this 
one lady pulls up and I was like,

301
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:17,410
I need to borrow your cell phone to call
my dad.

302
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,280
She's like,
you're in shock.

303
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,330
You need to sit down.
I was like,

304
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,230
no,
I'm not in shock.

305
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,064
I just needed to borrow my cell phone.
So she walked to the next car and I got 

306
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:26,650
a cell phone from this person.

307
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,230
I called my dad and I was like,
Dad.

308
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:29,951
I was like,
man,

309
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,360
I flipped my truck.
I had pe,

310
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,660
I had got,
I'd financed this thing for five years.

311
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,494
I was paying $100 a month is perfect.
I was working at dealership changing 

312
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:39,454
oil,
probably making $130 a week and I just 

313
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:49,120
got this truck for probably two,
three months and I'm used truck,

314
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,110
but it was,
it was good.

315
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,010
It's junk.
Uh,

316
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,370
I called dad and I'm like,
man,

317
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,263
he's gonna be mad,
can't be too mad because I'm paying for 

318
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:57,814
the truck,
but he's gonna be mad at me because I'm 

319
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:04,861
screwing up family reunion.
And Christmas he comes to get me a,

320
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,110
I'd flip this truck real close to where 
our farm was.

321
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:10,180
So he ran over to the farm and got this 
flat bed truck.

322
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,014
And uh,
he pulls out there with the flatbed 

323
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,400
truck and he pulls up and as soon as he 
pulls up,

324
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,234
state trooper pulls up in the State 
Trooper Guy and dad talked for a minute 

325
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,960
and to get state troopers,
like,

326
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,410
you know,
one single car accident.

327
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,091
You okay?
Yeah,

328
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,040
everybody's Okay Dad,
you,

329
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,430
Daddy,
you going to put this on flatbed?

330
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,041
Take it home.
Yeah.

331
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:28,571
Okay.
Okay.

332
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,260
Um,
you know,

333
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,210
I ain't gonna I ain't gonna investigate 
or anything.

334
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,920
Everything's cool.
Y'All just go about your business.

335
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,754
So he left because he did a solid there 
and didn't give me any kind of traffic 

336
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,134
ticket.
And so me and dad put the truck on the 

337
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:44,800
flatbed and we're driving back and he 
started laughing and I was like,

338
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,634
man,
I expected you to be really mad because 

339
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,810
he was a fiery kind of dad,
you know,

340
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,644
and,
and,

341
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,600
uh,
pull the belt out and go to town,

342
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:53,970
you know,
he,

343
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,220
he was a rough,
strict,

344
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,600
tough,
tough dude.

345
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,000
And so I thought I was going to get,
um,

346
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,380
a good customer at least.
But he started laughing and I said,

347
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,121
man,
what's the funny?

348
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,440
And he goes,
I was 18 when this happened.

349
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,580
He goes,
when I was 18 years old,

350
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,140
I've flipped my car.
He's like,

351
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,330
I can't get mad.
He's like,

352
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm just glad you ain't got hurt.
I'm like,

353
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,413
well,
that's nice.

354
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,040
So we drove back.
I took pictures of it and uh,

355
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,720
got me,
got any insurance for it.

356
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,554
Got like 11,
12 gram for the insurance to be able to 

357
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,400
buy another truck.
So it all worked out.

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
So that was the first time you ever flip
something or did you,

359
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,130
were you the first time?
That was not the race car was next.

360
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,390
So the race car is like,
Oh,

361
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,830
I've been here before.
Yeah.

362
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,720
And there's nothing in the race car.
It's,

363
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,170
it's not as bad as a passenger car.
You only got that strap,

364
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,004
you know,
you're moving around and banging around 

365
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,100
in there.
And then the race car,

366
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,810
you're in there pretty tight.
Yeah.

367
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,733
Do you feel weird when you're in a 
passenger car to is for the lack of 

368
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,650
support,
lack of support and safety?

369
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,750
Uh,
you know,

370
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,410
I,
I do because compared to the way our cup

371
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,290
cars are now or the race cars are now,
man were cocooned in their,

372
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,960
the seat and everything.
The headrests,

373
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,540
you got six slash seven point harness.
I mean in a street car,

374
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,840
you really just got the strap.
I mean it's um,

375
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,090
I certainly,
uh,

376
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,930
you know,
I'm more,

377
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,410
I'm much more cautious as I get older on
the highway and people were like,

378
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,280
hey man,
how do you do it?

379
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,130
How do you drive on how you drive a race
car and then go 45,

380
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,260
55 on the road.
And it's really easy actually,

381
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:22,094
you know,
just kinda chill out all your fast 

382
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,124
driving out of the way.
When I was younger I was getting 

383
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,554
speeding tickets all the time,
but when as I got older I just didn't 

384
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:31,910
care to be in a hurry anymore.

385
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,893
Yeah,
I would figure the way you drive for a 

386
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,750
living,
you just get it out of your system.

387
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,670
Yeah,
I get plenty of.

388
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,730
I had plenty and plenty of high speed 
action and hi jinks on the race track.

389
00:16:42,731 --> 00:16:44,750
I don't,
I calmed down the road.

390
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,340
What kind of car do you drive in real 
life?

391
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,721
Well,
it's funny.

392
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:48,554
I,
um,

393
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,140
I,
I just bought a brand new Silverado.

394
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,210
I hadn't bought a truck and a long time 
I had,

395
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,400
I still have my old Silverado bald is 
about,

396
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:55,791
oh,
four.

397
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,090
Oh six.
But this new one a,

398
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,520
I like a lot of new ones are bad.
I didn't like the old ones that much.

399
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,220
They just look kind of basic,
like the new ones are really sweet,

400
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,050
look under character lines and the body 
lines.

401
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,950
It's just a good looking truck.
So about that.

402
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,623
Um,
but my,

403
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,360
what I was driving before that,
I got a 48,

404
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,433
a pickup truck and a,
it's all rough as hell on the outside 

405
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,960
and I'm original,
faded all messy and ugly looking.

406
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,960
But it's got a vortac motor and good 
drive train in.

407
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:30,980
It drives good,
but it's easy to work on and I just love

408
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,590
fooling with it.
I took the original banks bench seat out

409
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:34,424
and put these old bucket seats in from 
an 80 a chevy blazer and some made it 

410
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,390
comfortable and just the way I wanted 
it.

411
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,224
So I drove.
I drove that a lot this summer until I 

412
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:49,241
got this new truck and I got a 76 Chevy 
Laguna that I love to drive.

413
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,890
That thing just kind of floats,
floats down the road man,

414
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:59,891
and it's a dark midnight blue tinted 
windows and just a really cool because I

415
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,924
love the seventies in the style of the 
cars in the seventies even though kind 

416
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,270
of the bigger ones,
like in the late seventies,

417
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,340
like the 4:42
oldsmobile cutlass,

418
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,960
it was big,
big,

419
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:10,794
big cars.
There's something about those guys that 

420
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,850
I really dig.

421
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,420
Is that your car?
That's my car right there.

422
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,550
Yeah.
I love that thing man.

423
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,950
I had a 19,
73 Chevelle.

424
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,943
Yeah.
That reminds me of that kind of body 

425
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,010
style.
That's it.

426
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,060
I got it for 42.
That's sort of the sister that also bill

427
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,930
for 42.
That's red and I'm Kinda the same.

428
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,060
Tenant went same.
I did the same wheels,

429
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,350
same tire,
same tent,

430
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,213
same.
I put a spoiler like a nascar style 

431
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,690
spoiler on the back and the front and 
kind of look because those cars were big

432
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,630
in Nascar.
Uh,

433
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,953
so those,
those cars don't get as much love as a 

434
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,540
60 slash muscle cars.
Well,

435
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
we'll get there.
I think as we get older.

436
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,500
The what's cool gets older.
Roommate.

437
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah.
Like,

438
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,760
I mean nothing.
I mean this car,

439
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,940
the [inaudible] 67 Camaro.
Those cards.

440
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,970
Yeah.
I got a 67.

441
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:59,640
I thought I had a 69,
but uh,

442
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,593
like the 55 share,
all those things will always hold their 

443
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:04,140
rightful place in history.

444
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,110
But these cars like that car right 
there,

445
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,820
that wasn't very cool.
Ten,

446
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:09,930
15,
20 years ago.

447
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,813
No.
But as we get older that car becomes 

448
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,130
cool,
you know?

449
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:14,860
And,
and,

450
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,860
and one day we'll be driving around in 
like a 85 pickup trucks.

451
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,330
Go on man listening.
So,

452
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,690
so awesome.
So really think so.

453
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,843
I mean know about that.
I just think that the car might just be 

454
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:31,590
cool because you own it.
I don't know.

455
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,020
I think that it's got these old 
character lines,

456
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:36,000
man,
like it does have old.

457
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,040
You know what's interesting?
I was,

458
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,930
I was just talking to a friend of mine 
about this one in 1970.

459
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,700
My mom bought a barracuda.
Yeah.

460
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,583
And when I was in high school in 1981,
I was a freshman in high school and she 

461
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,754
had this bear coat and it was like a 
classic car and it was like a classic 

462
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,140
muscle car.

463
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,460
Right.
But that's the only 11 years old.

464
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah.
Like if you had a car today from 2007,

465
00:19:58,561 --> 00:19:59,030
whether.
Yeah,

466
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,820
you wouldn't be a class.
So yeah,

467
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,270
you're right.
It's weird.

468
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,620
It is weird.
It is weird.

469
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,500
Like a 1969 when I was in high school in
1969,

470
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:10,440
which is only an 11 year old car was 
amazing.

471
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,830
Like whoa.
People would stop and stare at it.

472
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,320
Do look at that 69 Camaro.
Yeah.

473
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,780
I got an 88 s 10.
That was the first pickup truck.

474
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,760
Uh,
I owned or had,

475
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,653
that was like the car I got when I was 
16 years old and I got one and restored 

476
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,060
it and uh,
which was a terrible investment,

477
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,520
but um,
it makes sense for me because it,

478
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,480
you know,
because it was my first truck boat and I

479
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,250
didn't think anybody would give a shit 
about it.

480
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,670
Right.
Because it's an Stn,

481
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,513
it's like the,
the bottom of the barrel and pickup 

482
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,740
trucks for Chevrolet in 1988 and,
and,

483
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,530
but I drive that thing around and people
were like,

484
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,693
wow,
that's the cleanest as 10 I've seen in 

485
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,943
20 years.

486
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,390
That's it right there.
Oh,

487
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:50,224
that's nice.
Yeah.

488
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,430
And so what's something about seeing one
of those,

489
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:55,720
it's in great shape.
I like that it made it through.

490
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,490
Yeah,
there's not many of them left.

491
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,350
I mean for,
for good reason.

492
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,380
But what was your first car?
My first car was a 73 Chevelle.

493
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,021
Yeah,
that one.

494
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:08,530
But I got it out on anyone.
Good car man.

495
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh,
I love.

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,980
She's.
So would you buy,

497
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,500
would you get a 73 and restore it to get
a 70?

498
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,010
So that's my favorite year.
Sixty nine and 70 are my favorite years.

499
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,220
I go back and forth between six slash 
nine slash 70 with Chevelles.

500
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,320
Both amazing years.
Yeah.

501
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,550
Yeah.
I liked those cars.

502
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,430
They're,
they're uh,

503
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,150
they're a big muscle car.
It's a big.

504
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,060
It's bigger than the Camaro.
Yeah.

505
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,830
I have a 19,
69 Nova.

506
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,861
Really?
Yeah.

507
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:34,930
I would just like a smaller.

508
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,340
Yeah,
like that right there.

509
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,740
Daddy looking car that is as classic and
American muscle cars you get.

510
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,180
That's a 1970 with silver with black 
stripes come out.

511
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,090
They used to race Novas my dad raced a 
Nova.

512
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,120
Yeah.
Nope.

513
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,800
I liked Novas because their light is a 
light car and because you know,

514
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:57,590
you put a big engine in it and new 
suspension and you know,

515
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,220
I have a,
a Nova,

516
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,240
a lagging,
but I just bought a 66.

517
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,700
Oh Wow.
That's my next project.

518
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,940
I'm about it from a buddy for five grand
and um,

519
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,980
it's in,
it's,

520
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,390
it's pretty bad shape,
but I'm going to,

521
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,253
that's my next project.
Soon as I get some time I had this 

522
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:18,850
little girl,
Allah and she's six months.

523
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,190
Um,
so it's kind of made it tough.

524
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,970
Do any kind of proxy.
Thanks.

525
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,540
It's awesome.
But it does,

526
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,470
uh,
it does eat up.

527
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,393
Everything is on the side right now and 
it will be forever until they move out 

528
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:36,634
and then it's still a little bit on the 
side because you got to call and check 

529
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:39,754
on them.
Yeah.

530
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,710
Yeah.
So it's awesome though.

531
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,010
It is,
it's amazing.

532
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:43,960
I can't,
I couldn't.

533
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,943
It's like getting married and having a 
kid and all that stuff is not nothing 

534
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,940
like I thought it'd be.
It's no one can explain it to you.

535
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,340
Especially a kid part.
Yeah,

536
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,960
they can explain it to you.
I've had friends that have kids.

537
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,111
They just go,
we'll,

538
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:57,944
we'll talk after the kids bright.
There's no way you're going to be able 

539
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:01,600
to figure this out until it actually 
happens.

540
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,800
Yeah.
I've had people,

541
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,100
everybody tries to tell you this is what
it's going to be like,

542
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:06,934
man.
You Ain't gonna believe that greatest 

543
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:08,500
thing ever.
Boy,

544
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,700
you just don't even know.

545
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,100
And it still does.
It doesn't help.

546
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,083
It doesn't,
don't sink in till you go through the 

547
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,640
experience.
When you go through that experience,

548
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:16,361
you're like,
damn,

549
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,820
they were right here.
This is the greatest thing ever.

550
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,500
It's a different kind of love.
It is just to,

551
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,950
it's just,
it's hard to explain.

552
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,820
It doesn't,
doesn't make,

553
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,290
you know,
when my,

554
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,690
if I come home,
my daughter's run up to me and jumped in

555
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:29,524
my arms and I catch him and they give me
a kiss and I'm hugging them and there's 

556
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,890
a kind of love that doesn't exist in any
other.

557
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,753
Nothing in my life.
Nothing you could have ever felt before 

558
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:40,450
with anything or anybody else.
It is,

559
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,380
it's just different.
Yeah.

560
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,700
I can't wait.
I can't wait for that.

561
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,830
She's six months and uh,
everybody's like,

562
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,870
man,
and you'll,

563
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,310
you'll probably agree there like it goes
fast.

564
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,510
It goes fast,
it goes fast.

565
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,360
We're sort of in that moment wherever,
like come home,

566
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,390
like can't wait for her to talk.
I can't wait to hear her voice.

567
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,280
Like,
what is her voice going to sound like?

568
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,143
You know,
what kind of voice is she going to have 

569
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:01,004
and what is she going to like and what 
are we going to want me to do with her 

570
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,670
and those kind of things.
Yeah.

571
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:06,690
It's awesome.
Yeah,

572
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,820
it's awesome.
But yeah,

573
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,290
it does put your projects on the side is
my projects are on the side golf.

574
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,280
Sam's on the side.
Hunting's on the side.

575
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,560
I ain't going to go hunting this year.
I was,

576
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,394
I was going to go.
I usually go in October or November 

577
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,083
first.
November when you guys have a spot in 

578
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,131
Ohio.
Yeah.

579
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,710
Me and one of the best white tail spots 
in the country.

580
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,610
Man,
Buddy Martin,

581
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,170
Martin truex Jr.
He races too.

582
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,453
And uH,
we just been buddies a long time and 

583
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:32,330
he's hard core.
He's heavy duty into the hunting and so,

584
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,080
uh,
we got,

585
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,300
I wanted to hunt but not,
you know,

586
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,540
I'm not going to be going every week,
uh,

587
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,713
but I knew he was probably interested in
probably buying some land and us 

588
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,210
managing it together and learn and how 
that process goes.

589
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:46,550
So we bought this land and we've put the
crop,

590
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,620
we've put,
we've put the food plots in,

591
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:49,790
not per,
not ourselves,

592
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,624
but we've managed the land on how you 
want to change it and I'm sort of 

593
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:54,914
managing the hurt and you know,
it's been a really educational 

594
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:00,750
experience.
Uh,

595
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,770
And I got a lot of people don't hunt,
don't even understand what we're talking

596
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:04,280
about,
you know,

597
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
the whole process.
Yeah.

598
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,860
Like if you buy a nice piece of land,
people who are,

599
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,520
especially if you look at like there's a
bunch of organizations that uh,

600
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,403
you know,
teach classes in how to manage a giant 

601
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,490
piece of property,
but laying out food plots and,

602
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,453
and people buy these big chunks of 
property specifically for whitetail 

603
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,450
hunting.

604
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

605
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,530
So we have about a thousand acres and 
that's awesome.

606
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,610
All we do is bow hunt for white tail.
That's it.

607
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,444
Will,
it will go in there twice a year maybe 

608
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,900
or what at least once a year for Turkey.
And we eat what we kill it.

609
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,360
We ate,
we killed a,

610
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:40,040
we got to Turkey last year and was 
eating it that night.

611
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,020
I mean,
that's,

612
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,380
that's amazing,
isn't it?

613
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,211
It's crazy.
Yeah.

614
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:44,044
When you can eat it and it doesn't even 
ever touched the freezer never goes in 

615
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:49,220
the frigerator just straight from the 
harvest,

616
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:50,990
right to the grill.
Yeah,

617
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,340
it's great.
It's incredible.

618
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:53,174
I love deer.
Deer jerky is probably my favorite and 

619
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,810
we fry a Turkey nuggets and stuff like 
that.

620
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:01,460
I mean it's pretty cool.
That's awesome.

621
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,294
Yeah.
So that's a cool little getaway for you 

622
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:06,260
to write a thousand acre.
A little slice of heaven.

623
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,120
Yeah,
it's driving distance.

624
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,410
So because I love a road trip,
I'm,

625
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,620
I mean if I wanted to I could fly out 
there,

626
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,813
but I like the road trip.
The whole thing for me really is 

627
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,970
everything before the shot that you take
into,

628
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,013
you know,
on the deer or it's the drive up there 

629
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,500
with your buddies talking about what are
you going to do,

630
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,483
what he can't wait to do,
what's been going on with everybody 

631
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,440
getting up there and getting everything 
laid out.

632
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,650
Looking at the map on the wall,
you know,

633
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:33,484
it.
Get that big laminated map on the wall 

634
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,211
and be like,
man,

635
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,990
this big good stan.
Which ways of limbo,

636
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,853
and let's talk about the win.
What's weighing going to be doing 

637
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,790
tomorrow morning?
We're going to go tomorrow morning,

638
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,460
you know,
and then you know,

639
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,420
everybody has,
you know,

640
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:48,840
everybody gets their hands into cooking 
dinner that night.

641
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,693
So you know,
everybody gets a sad or something 

642
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:54,120
they're dealing with and managing and 
it's just fun,

643
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,920
you know,
just,

644
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,200
just spending time with your buddies 
because you don't never know.

645
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,103
We don't take tHat time anymore.
We don't really make time anymore and 

646
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,000
it's kinda,
you go,

647
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,020
you're gonna go do that for two days,
you know,

648
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,260
so you're gonna make time to be with 
each other and enjoy it.

649
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,573
I like taking my buddies and like taking
friends of mine that don't hunt or 

650
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,084
haven't ever hunted and letting them 
sort of understand what that experience 

651
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:16,500
was like.
And it's pretty cool.

652
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,663
It is cool.
But it's tough to get someone who's 

653
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,030
never hunted before.
Who is an enough sit in the stand?

654
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,670
yeah.
I can't get my wife to go.

655
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:24,930
I wanted amy to go.
She's,

656
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,720
she knows what hunting is about.
She's into it,

657
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,120
but um,
she don't want to go.

658
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,010
We got to,
we even got the redneck blinds,

659
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:32,844
you know,
the real clinical deals and you sitting 

660
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,034
there in the chair and move all you 
won't and you ain't got to worry about 

661
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,180
your scent too bad or anything like 
that.

662
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:42,260
And she won't even go sit in that.
I'm hoping in a little olive oil

663
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,320
want to go.
So we'll see.

664
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,633
Yeah,
maybe it's better that she doesn't go 

665
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,370
break.
Yeah,

666
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,223
you're,
I need a little place where like if you 

667
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:52,434
get like,
if she wanted to go every time you were 

668
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,000
going that.
Oh,

669
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,820
come on.
Oh,

670
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,320
what do you lIke it too much?
Yeah.

671
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,620
Yeah.
well I would imagine like again,

672
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:05,454
so what you do for living,
having something that's peaceful and 

673
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,144
quiet now,
nature would be very important to kind 

674
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:15,270
of balance out the just the wild hectic 
nature of race car drivers.

675
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:15,640
Yeah.

676
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,473
I mean for me that's,
I'm getting when I get in the stand and 

677
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:21,454
I sat down and I look out across the 
field and look at the land and 

678
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:27,500
everything.
Um,

679
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,713
man,
you ain't got to worry about and you 

680
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,920
know,
answer no email or,

681
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,873
or getting back to this guy or setting 
up this appointment or answering this 

682
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,430
question or,
you know,

683
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,460
It's just,
it's even better.

684
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,473
It's better than going on vacation.
Like we go on vacation with my wife or 

685
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,913
with my buddies or whatever.
You still can't really ever really 

686
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:51,281
young,
you know,

687
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:54,160
disconnect from everything you're doing.
It seems like though,

688
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:57,640
when I go hunting I can completely get 
rid of technology,

689
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,110
you know,
if I want.

690
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,530
And you know,
it's just a and sitting in the woods,

691
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,140
it's peaceful,
you know,

692
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,470
there's still good for you.
It is good.

693
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,453
It is.
It's therapeutic even though nothing's 

694
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:14,020
happening.
It's kind of cleansing in a way.

695
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,850
Weird way.
In a weird way.

696
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,723
Just I think human beings have a certain
amount of requirement for time in 

697
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,590
nature.
Yeah,

698
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,423
I think.
And you don't realize you have that 

699
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,990
requirement until you're out.
You wouldn't.

700
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,610
Yeah.
You wouldn't know it until you go sit in

701
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:26,240
the stand.
You're like,

702
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,590
wow,
I needed a little bit of this.

703
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,020
I think even a park,
you know,

704
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,863
and even people that go to central park 
in New York city that go to that park 

705
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:34,310
and sit down,
but that tree and they just feel better.

706
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,090
Yeah,
yeah,

707
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,830
exactly.
That's exactly what it is.

708
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,370
I mean,
in your,

709
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,920
your work environment is a concrete 
slab.

710
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,800
You know that you're drIving how fat,
what's the fastest?

711
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:49,801
You go to 15 when that,
when that passes,

712
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,630
you realize how fast to 15 really is 
cheese.

713
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,550
Sit in that car and do it long enough.
You forget.

714
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,923
Do you have apprehension about the 
horsepower wars with just modern 

715
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:04,600
consumer cars?

716
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,643
Because I look at some of these cars 
that they're putting out that are 

717
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,344
amazing.
Like the new core of that [inaudible] 

718
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,690
700 plus horsepower right from the 
factory that dodge demons,

719
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,543
like 800 horsepower.
Like they are putting out these insane 

720
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,840
race cars right from the factory that 
any dummy like me,

721
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,090
I could just go to a stiff.
I have the cash.

722
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,063
I go to a corvette dealership and pick 
one up and all of a sudden I'm on the 

723
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:30,170
highway.
Yeah.

724
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,150
Yeah.
I don't.

725
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,073
I don't have a problem with it now until
it becomes a common occurrence where 

726
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,080
people don't know how to control,
you know,

727
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,570
or know how to manage what they're doing
behind the wheel of something like that.

728
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:43,690
But until,
until that's like a common issue.

729
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:46,660
I don't know that it'll need regulation.
yeah.

730
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,690
Yeah.
I don't necessarily think of.

731
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,480
I wouldn't be surprised though that one 
day maybe you know,

732
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,650
regulated because everything gets,
you know,

733
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,590
governance.

734
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah.
Maybe too much.

735
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,670
Maybe we should just appreciate that you
can do that.

736
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,313
I know.
I mean I want to be able to build 

737
00:31:03,191 --> 00:31:04,810
whatever I want to build.
Right.

738
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:07,470
you know,
if I want that in production,

739
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:08,890
ought to be able to produce whatever 
they want.

740
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,190
I agree.
But I feel like I feel at the same way I

741
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:15,460
feel about guns,
like I'm very pro second amendment.

742
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,870
I feel like,
uh,

743
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,793
I am a responsible gun owner.
I have a lot of friends that are 

744
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,570
responsible gun owners.
I've used guns for hunting.

745
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:24,670
I think you should have a gun for 
protection.

746
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:25,900
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with that,

747
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,123
but I don't think it would be a bad idea
to have some sort of course that you 

748
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,024
have to go through.
So you understand all the aspects of 

749
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:37,750
safety and precautions that you should 
take and how to correctly loaded gUn and

750
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:38,480
clean and gun.

751
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,313
AbSolutely.
Yeah,

752
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,680
but this is not really the case right 
now,

753
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,120
you know,
and it's not necessarily.

754
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:46,870
I'm not talking about gun control as 
much as I'm talking about gun safety and

755
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,840
gun responsibility.
I feel like the same way about a car.

756
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,753
Yeah.
I feel like if you're going to go out 

757
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,144
and buy a corvette z r one,
I mean the kind of body mashing 

758
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:57,244
acceleration that g forces you can get 
from something like that right from the 

759
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:02,470
factory,
zero to 60 in under three seconds.

760
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,483
That's an insane automobile.
Like maybe someone should like take you 

761
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:08,530
around a track a little bit and that's a
great idea.

762
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,650
I guess that would be the case if you 
were going to buy something like that or

763
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:12,484
getting a car like that,
you would need some kind of a trainer 

764
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:14,824
course.
They had to pass her three hours on a 

765
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:16,660
track.

766
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,493
If you're.
If you have to have particular licensed 

767
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:21,640
to drive 18 wheelers down the 
interstate,

768
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,350
you know there should be a style or a 
type of license that you need to achieve

769
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:28,420
to have a certain type of,
you know,

770
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,780
you want to go buy a viper acr and take 
it on the road.

771
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:34,300
Those crazy race car vipers.
You could juSt drive.

772
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,300
She'd probably know how to drive hyper.
Yeah.

773
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:41,720
Those things are a little bit a handful.
They're a little too happy.

774
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,793
They're pre dealer.
They're so crazy too that the race car 

775
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,120
one with all the vents and all the arrow
all around it.

776
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,223
That was just an insane thing that you 
can just go buy that and take that on 

777
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:50,931
the road.
No.

778
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah,
the giant as v 10 in it.

779
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,770
It's pretty crazy.
It's awesome.

780
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah.
Do you.

781
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,800
So do you drive like fast cars on the 
road ever,

782
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:05,540
or do you?
Mostly are you just like,

783
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,930
just mostly driving normal relaxed on 
the road.

784
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,460
So I,
um,

785
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,580
I got a lot of speeding tickets when I 
was younger.

786
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,050
Uh,
that was a shocker.

787
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Yeah.
And I,

788
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,470
and it seemed like it would just never 
failed.

789
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,740
Anytime I got behind the wheel of a 
corvette or anything like that,

790
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:27,950
I'll be getting pulled over for rolling 
through.

791
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:31,520
Lights are rolling through a stop sign 
or reckless driving or whatever.

792
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,170
And I kept,
I mean,

793
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,690
it happened as recently as two or three 
years ago.

794
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I got pulled over for a rolling through 
a stop sign and speed and uh,

795
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,410
and the guy's like,
man,

796
00:33:45,411 --> 00:33:47,270
you don't need these tickets,
like,

797
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:49,400
what are you doing?
And I was like,

798
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,960
you're right.
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

799
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,510
I don't need to be driving this damn car
is what's up.

800
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,990
I need to get out of stupid car.
I don't need to a corvette with all this

801
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:57,500
power.

802
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,560
And so,
uh,

803
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,020
and I've,
I've got this original,

804
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:08,150
um,
I got this original,

805
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,403
a 65 impala that's been in my family 
since it was brand new and it's kind of 

806
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,444
been the community car.
It was passed around and got banged up 

807
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,260
on the corner corner,
right front corner,

808
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,210
couple of crashes here,
a couple of crisis area.

809
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:23,210
You just gotta needed a car because his 
broke down so that he used it for awhile

810
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,103
and such.
And it was just pat and I finally got 

811
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:26,054
it.
I bought it for two grand from my dad 

812
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,730
and I've fixed it up.
It's got a two barrel to 83.

813
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,470
Wow.
It doesn't go anywhere,

814
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,730
right.
And I just as much rather drive that car

815
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,740
is a little low powers it has.
Um,

816
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,903
no,
and I won't get myself into any stupid 

817
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,710
trouble,
you know,

818
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,060
being in a hurry or being impatient.

819
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,010
And so that's,
you know,

820
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,950
that's,
that's what I,

821
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,990
that's what I try to do.
I actually,

822
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,520
I don't care about as much what kind of 
power the car has as much.

823
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,710
I like a driver,
I want to,

824
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,490
I like nice cars.
I liked know,

825
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,543
frame off restorations,
but I'd rather have a driver that's 

826
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,790
reliable and easy to work on and I think
that's why I liked that 48 pickup truck.

827
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,490
It's got the vortec motor,
which is just a,

828
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,450
you know,
it's,

829
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:20,200
it's not a powerhouse is just dropped in
and out of a job out of,

830
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,400
out of a junkyard crash and it's a,
it's easy to work on,

831
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,160
like a me and a buddy of mine put 
electric wiper motor in it the other day

832
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,840
because it had the little vacuum on it 
and it just didn't,

833
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,860
didn't work.
And uh,

834
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,300
and it's easy to.

835
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,950
It's easy to work on.
I put,

836
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,823
we put these seats in it and we put a,
we got old ammo box for a console and 

837
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,220
shit like that.
Do you just enjoy,

838
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,550
because it's also,
it's,

839
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,070
it's,
it's something that's sort of related to

840
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,050
what you do for a living,
but then again,

841
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,570
not in kind of just a project.
Automobile.

842
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,710
Yeah.
Um,

843
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,790
I uh,
I think the reason why I like to work on

844
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,920
cars is because it,
I don't know,

845
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,320
that makes you a,
it puts,

846
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,233
it,
makes you a little invested in the car 

847
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:08,350
and there was a,
there was a pin,

848
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,110
there was a point of time where I was 
just kinda like,

849
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:11,280
that's cool,
I want to buy that,

850
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,930
I'll get that,
I'll drive that a year now.

851
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:14,530
I don't like that anymore.
Well that's cool.

852
00:36:14,531 --> 00:36:16,720
I want to buy that.
I'll get rid of this one,

853
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,573
get this one.

854
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,850
And that got old real fast for me.
And so I started to,

855
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,993
that's when I stopped.
That's when I put a little more time in 

856
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:27,180
that 65 and palette and fixed it up.
And,

857
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,510
and I'm like,
that's,

858
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,360
I've never let,
I've never seen that car.

859
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,570
Never gonna sell it.
I'm that 48 truck.

860
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,860
I'll never sell it just because of the 
work I put into the,

861
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,771
you know,
the time,

862
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,640
the time that I've spent with it.
Um,

863
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,300
I've had,
I mean,

864
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,133
you know,
and I,

865
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,243
I've got,
there's people that are helping me work 

866
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,470
on these cars.
I got a buddy of mine that,

867
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
that actually helps me work on these 
cars,

868
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,960
but um,
when I finished that novel wagon,

869
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,940
I'll probably never sell it even though 
it's probably nothing special if someone

870
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:58,740
else were to look at it,
but it's what I,

871
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:00,000
you know,
it's what I put into it.

872
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,870
Yeah.
You've got sweat equity and the more you

873
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:04,704
work on these cars,
the more confidence you get and trying 

874
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:07,254
to do more,
getting into the jobs that you didn't 

875
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:10,134
think you were capable of doIng.
Have you ever thought about a buildup 

876
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,464
straight from scratch?
That's probably this little a nova 

877
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,030
wagons going to be.
Yeah.

878
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,650
I wanted a nomad.
so my dad had a nomad and uh,

879
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,690
it was uh,
this thing had polished aluminum on the,

880
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,933
on the underneath floor pan and mirror.
He parked it on a mirror in the shop so 

881
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,330
you can look underneath it,
you know,

882
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,750
and look how good the damn thing was.
It was a boat.

883
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,990
It was frame off,
hardly ever seen the road.

884
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,120
I mean,
just clean as it could be from indian.

885
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,460
And I love road trips,
the nova wagon.

886
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:47,911
I mean,
uh,

887
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:50,580
the,
the nomad is the perfect road trip car,

888
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,433
but I,
I just don't want to spend the money on 

889
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:55,110
a black on the nova.

890
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,710
I mean,
a nomad chassis and body is,

891
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:03,711
they're just ridiculous to buy and I 
want to build the car.

892
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I'm not a expert mater.
So this nova wagons,

893
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,140
perfect.
It's a wagon.

894
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:14,970
It's not a nomad,
but it's a little smaller,

895
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,810
which I liked and if I screw it up it's 
okay.

896
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,650
If I screwed up a nomad build,
I'd be pissed.

897
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,080
Why are nomad so expensive?
I don't know.

898
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,880
They're just rare and it's like the,
you know,

899
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,590
it's like the old.
It's like the old 55 chevy wagon.

900
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,990
It's just put into my head what a nomad 
looks like.

901
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,860
What year?
Like at 55.

902
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,850
Fifty six.
Fifty seven.

903
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,530
Pull up while you're 55.
Nomad.

904
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,030
Oh yeah.
Say that to me is my ultimate car.

905
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,810
Uh wow.
But damn man,

906
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:49,280
I mean they're just so high.
That's a beautiful car.

907
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,730
That's a different era.
You know,

908
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,683
when you look at the muscle cars of the 
19 sixties and then you go to something 

909
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,000
like this,
like that's a whole different world.

910
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,920
Yeah.
That's a different kind of thing.

911
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,860
I'd like to get.
Um,

912
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,093
there was this one nomad,
this guy chopped up and narrowed up and 

913
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:08,350
they made a,
one of those things.

914
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:10,570
Um,
it's like a rat rod.

915
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,060
Yeah.
Um,

916
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,000
that was,
that was an idea for this nova wagon.

917
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:16,834
but I think I'm on.
I don't think I'm gonna chop it up and 

918
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,510
then we'll keep it as it is.
When I was in high school,

919
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:20,344
there was a man in the neighborhood when
I was a kid that had a 55 chevy and it 

920
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:27,520
was the greatest thing anybody has ever 
seen in their lives.

921
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:30,790
And we would all wait while this guy 
drove by and his 55 chevy,

922
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,790
we just couldn't believe it was a real 
car that someone could own this.

923
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,570
It was black and meant it was a 
beautiful car,

924
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,660
manual transmission.
He would dress drive by and that thing.

925
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,670
And we would all just have our jaws 
hanging out.

926
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,533
When I was a little boy had hot wheels,
my favorite hot wheel was the 55 

927
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,960
[inaudible],
55 chevy that had to flip hood diff.

928
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,820
The flames on the front.
It was like an original hot wheel.

929
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,210
And ever since then,
you know,

930
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,380
that's kinda,
that's kinda been my car.

931
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:02,400
But I went from the regular sedan to the
wagon.

932
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,160
I think that,
no,

933
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,993
that nomads pretty awesome.
Do you have like a full garage set up 

934
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:09,790
where you can do repairs on things?
It's kind of a farm shop.

935
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,410
So it's,
it's dirty.

936
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,340
We fix lawnmowers,
we do some modeling on our cars.

937
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:17,530
Whatever needs to be done in there.
I parked my uh,

938
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,520
apart my bus in there,
I got a busted would take the racetrack.

939
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,463
And so,
I mean it's kind of kind of just a big 

940
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:26,044
building.

941
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,020
We got a sandblaster in there,
we got a big ole,

942
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:34,021
we get a sheer in there.
We can do anything to manage vendor.

943
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,830
Yeah.
Whatever man shop.

944
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,470
Yes.
So tell me aboUt your book from you.

945
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,663
Well,
one of the things that was surprising 

946
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:47,170
that I had heard was you,
your experience with concussions,

947
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,853
you know,
um,

948
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,833
tell me about that.
So when I've had concussIons in that 

949
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,600
flip,
I was talking about 1998.

950
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:57,640
They tell him I got a concussion from 
that crash.

951
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,610
Uh,
I'd had concussions throughout my career

952
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,050
at many different points and didn't 
think anything of them.

953
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,140
I thought when you,
you know,

954
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,043
when you got a concussion,
you joked about it with your buddies 

955
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,873
about how it made you feel and you just 
rested until it was gone and you race 

956
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,590
through it,
uh,

957
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,850
and eventually go away and you were 
fine,

958
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,863
you know,
it was just something that would go 

959
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,304
away.
And you never thought anything about 

960
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,030
steve never thought about seeing a 
doctor.

961
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,710
You never thought about getting 
treatment.

962
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,770
You didn't know there was even treatment
available for concussion.

963
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:31,570
You just thought it was something like a
bruise.

964
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,433
You know?
So this is going on throughout my whole 

965
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:34,544
career.

966
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,060
I was racing it.
I was testing at Kansas,

967
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,943
a motor speedway in 2012 blue right 
front tire hit at 185 miles an hour and 

968
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,230
it screwed me up.
And so that was a really not,

969
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,740
you know,
that wasn't a typical crash,

970
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,700
not something that drivers deal with 
usually in their career.

971
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,650
This was something that was unique to 
me,

972
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:00,883
uh,
and it was just a terrible impact at a 

973
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:04,450
bad angle,
at a very,

974
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:05,284
very fast rate of speed.
And I got out of the car and I knew 

975
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:11,980
something was wrong with me and I 
couldn't,

976
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,130
I couldn't,
I felt,

977
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,233
you know,
just like I'd been hit in the head with 

978
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:18,664
a bat,
a shocked and shell shocked in a way or 

979
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:23,920
just couldn't.
I couldn't,

980
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,043
uh,

981
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,320
shake it off,
you know,

982
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:29,570
you just kind of wanted to shake your 
head and get it out,

983
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,140
whatever it was and you couldn't.
Um,

984
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,290
that's why I failed immediately.
Immediately after that crash,

985
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,124
we went,
dark test was done because the car was 

986
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:39,524
killed.
So we went over to this place to get 

987
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:44,360
some lunch and we're sitting there and I
started getting sick,

988
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,950
nauseous before we ever,
you know,

989
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,650
wouldn't eat and uh,
we just ordered,

990
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,740
just sat down and I started,
I'm sitting with my team,

991
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,000
all my guys and I'm,
uh,

992
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,460
starting to,
I think phil,

993
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:56,294
I'm gonna throw up right there in front 
of them and I'm getting nervous and I 

994
00:42:58,941 --> 00:42:59,774
don't,
haven't said to them that I feel this 

995
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:02,451
way,
you know,

996
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:04,580
so I don't want to tell them I feel this
way,

997
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,770
but my crew chief evil,
it's like my,

998
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:08,943
like a brother.

999
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,590
Um,
I was like,

1000
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,443
steve,
I am getting sick and something's wrong 

1001
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:15,050
with me.
I don't know what's wrong with me,

1002
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:15,884
but I got to get out of this room is a 
business lunch hour full of full of 

1003
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:20,320
people,
noises,

1004
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,120
talk and chatter,
a shit going on.

1005
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,910
And I got to get the hell out of there.
Um,

1006
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,180
and as I was getting up to leave my wife
come walking in,

1007
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,460
they were,
she was coming to get me.

1008
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,370
We were going to Washington redskins 
monday night game and uh,

1009
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:37,710
sitting on a box with dance,
not or whoever else there.

1010
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,710
So we had them plans to go.
I said,

1011
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:44,120
amy,
I'm a good lay down in the car.

1012
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,013
I just got to lay down in a car for a 
minute and I laid down all the way in 

1013
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:50,570
the car all the way to the airport.
I'm thinking,

1014
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,670
this is,
this is bad,

1015
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,080
this is worse than I've ever failed 
anything,

1016
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:55,340
but hopefully it's going to go away.

1017
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:00,020
And so we get the game we get.
We went and the redskins game,

1018
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:02,310
we watched the game,
uh,

1019
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,523
did that whole thing and I went about 
four weeks of feeling bad and sick for 

1020
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,270
about four weeks and it finally went 
away.

1021
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,573
And I was,
I knew that was unusual for it to be 

1022
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:19,250
that long,
but in my mind I wasn't thinking doctor.

1023
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,860
I wouldn't think in treatment.
I wasn't thinking anything like that.

1024
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,670
It ain't cross my mind to tell anybody 
or that I really needed.

1025
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,380
I thought,
you know,

1026
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,500
I thought that I had been dishonest and 
not a,

1027
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:35,103
you know,
I hadn't,

1028
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:37,400
I hadn't been honest with everybody 
about the way I was feeling,

1029
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:40,040
but I didn't ever think that it was 
going to cost me anything.

1030
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,990
So I thought,
alright,

1031
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,950
I'm feeling better.
I'm good.

1032
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,440
Go to this race.
I've been racing the whole time.

1033
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,450
Right?
Finally four weeks later I'm great.

1034
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,160
I go to another race,
I'm racing,

1035
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,780
I crashed and it all came right back,
like as bad as it was,

1036
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,280
if not worse.
And that's when I said I gotta go to the

1037
00:44:58,281 --> 00:44:59,240
doctor.
This is bad.

1038
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,074
I can't,
you know,

1039
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,610
I can't even,
you know,

1040
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,823
I can't keep crashing like this.
Just putting these concussions so close 

1041
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:11,570
together is a bad deal is dangerous and 
my,

1042
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:12,963
I couldn't bite my tongue,
like my attitude and my emotions and 

1043
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:17,294
shit was out of whack.
Like I couldn't control mY anger and I 

1044
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:20,204
was like,
anybody would anybody say something I 

1045
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,094
didn't like?
I'm like,

1046
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,190
you know,
I want to tell him to fuck off,

1047
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:28,520
you know?
And that was just not like me.

1048
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:32,760
I couLdn't,
I couldn't keep myself calm and uh,

1049
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,070
everything that I heard like made me 
angry.

1050
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,243
It was the craziest thing.
Even people just talking about stuff 

1051
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,160
would just get under my skin.
I'm like,

1052
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,333
er,

1053
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,550
real impatient.
Um,

1054
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,770
and there were some new symptoms.
But,

1055
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,701
uh,
finally,

1056
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,310
uh,
I went to the doctor and,

1057
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,990
and uh,
got to,

1058
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,060
I went to this neurosurgeon in 
charlotte,

1059
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,440
dr petit.
He's like,

1060
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,210
I want you to meet this guy in 
pittsburgh.

1061
00:46:02,211 --> 00:46:03,044
His name's mickey collins.
He works with the pittsburgh steelers 

1062
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:08,260
and the penguins.
And uh,

1063
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,730
I'm like,
I,

1064
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,030
I go up there and I'm thinking I'm going
to meet this guy that works,

1065
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,830
works with the penguins and the steelers
and he sees,

1066
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,620
know players,
but he's a,

1067
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,730
he's a doctor that sees anybody and 
everybody,

1068
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:21,740
like there's kids in there,
you know,

1069
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:25,890
they got hurt playing on the playground.
There's workers a con,

1070
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,530
you know,
carpenters,

1071
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,590
housewives,
everybody's in that damn waiting room to

1072
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:35,140
see this man.
He sees about 25 people a day and um,

1073
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
he's an expert on head injuries and he's
got,

1074
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,490
you know,
he's just,

1075
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,640
he's on the cutting edge of whatever the
hell the new shit is.

1076
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,680
He knows and he's,
you know,

1077
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,920
his team and his people are 
investigating it.

1078
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,120
And so there he fixed me.
So I go there and I'm like,

1079
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,370
this is what happened.
This is how it happened.

1080
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:56,690
I crashed,
I hid it.

1081
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,120
I didn't tell anybody about it.
I was sick for four weeks.

1082
00:46:59,121 --> 00:46:59,954
I got better.
I crashed in this race and I feel sick 

1083
00:47:01,191 --> 00:47:02,420
again.
And he was like,

1084
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:03,710
well,
these are two different injuries of,

1085
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,140
to two different parts of your brain.
The first injury you bruised this,

1086
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,013
uh,
right front edge of your brain when you 

1087
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:12,010
hit the wall.
He said this,

1088
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:12,883
the second crash,
you twisted the base of your brain and 

1089
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:17,414
injured some things in the back of your 
brain and that's why you're having the 

1090
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,710
emotional and different things like 
that.

1091
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:22,920
So,
uh,

1092
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,860
but we,
he went deeper into it than that.

1093
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:25,940
He was like,
you know,

1094
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,190
we did all these tests and um,
digital

1095
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:33,250
tests and all kinds of stuff for,
for,

1096
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,970
and I'd go back,
I mean,

1097
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,813
we did this thing,
we went through the gamut for a whole 

1098
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:42,721
day of doing tests and then I went back 
every week before I,

1099
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,760
you know,
and in two weeks I was back racing again

1100
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:48,850
as clear and uh,
so he,

1101
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,793
he took an injury that I hid and took 
four weeks to heal and healed it in two 

1102
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:55,730
weeks.
What did he do to him?

1103
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:59,440
Um,
he gave me.

1104
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,210
I never took any medication on this 
particular issue.

1105
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,110
He gave me a home exercises and eye 
exercises.

1106
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:08,944
There was a,
I had problems with focusing and making 

1107
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,260
my eyes work,
tracking in an object,

1108
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,450
like a bird flying across the sky or 
anything like that.

1109
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:18,010
I couldn't,
my eyes couldn't stay on it.

1110
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:19,720
If I looked at you,
um,

1111
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:24,460
eyes would bounce off of you and they 
just wouldn't stay,

1112
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:25,720
you know,
if you said,

1113
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:26,231
hey man,
I'm gonna,

1114
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,064
take a picture and you held up a camera 
and I tried to look at the lens and 

1115
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:30,170
smile.

1116
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,880
My eyes would want to jump off of that 
object they would want,

1117
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,743
they didn't want to look at what I 
wanted them to look at and track 

1118
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:39,760
anything going anywhere.
And this was the cause of that.

1119
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,480
Um,
the,

1120
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
the brain has the ocular stuff.
I mean,

1121
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:49,744
you can have injury to that part of your
brain or you can have an injury to the 

1122
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:54,370
vestibular parts of your brain that,
that,

1123
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:55,430
uh,
that may have,

1124
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,010
like if you have bad balance then that 
your ads in your balance work together.

1125
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:05,670
And so if you have a vestibular issues 
that can create ocular issues and um,

1126
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,493
that can create that,
that can affect your anxiety and 

1127
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,650
depression and things like,
so all these,

1128
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,800
you can have an injury to one part of 
your brain that affects for other areas.

1129
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,070
And so,
and we talk about that in the book.

1130
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,770
Mickey comes into the book and I'm,
I'll talk,

1131
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,330
you know,
I'll say this is what I was feeling.

1132
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:29,164
This is what I did.
And mickey will come in behind me and 

1133
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,370
say this is the medical science behind 
that.

1134
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:34,204
And this was how we treated it and why.
But I would have an injury to one 

1135
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:39,580
singular area,
my brain,

1136
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:40,414
but I would have four different symptoms
affecting for different parts of my 

1137
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:47,500
brain for different senses and um,
you know,

1138
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:51,940
he would have to hone in on the one that
was broken and then know to fix it.

1139
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,803
And when he started fixing it,
all the other ones would start 

1140
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,310
communicating together.
The brain would start working again.

1141
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:00,490
Balance and visual and all those things 
would start to work again.

1142
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:05,170
And anxiety and all those things.
You begin to come back in tune.

1143
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:07,150
No.
When you said he fixed it,

1144
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,080
like what is he doing?

1145
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,970
He.
Well,

1146
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:15,730
so he gave me physical exercises to do.
I had some balance issues.

1147
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:17,943
Basically if I was,
if I turned my head a or looked up and 

1148
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:23,680
down,
I would get dizzy and sick.

1149
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,290
Like my stomach would turn if I turn my 
head left it right.

1150
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,100
If I looked up and down,
just sitting there,

1151
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,130
like the best thing for me was to sit on
the couch and not move.

1152
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,740
And so like literally not move and not 
felt fine then.

1153
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:39,730
But if I moved an inch man,
it was like my,

1154
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,550
it'd make your stomach nauseous.
And so I did a lot of,

1155
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,290
I did a lot of exercises that created a 
ton of motion with my head.

1156
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,453
I'm lifting heavy balls up and passing 
them over my shoulder this way or that 

1157
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:54,494
way,
taking a ball and turning around and 

1158
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,453
heading this way,
taking the ball and turn around and 

1159
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,800
that,
just doing that for,

1160
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,450
for hours and hours and hours.

1161
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,380
And so I would train basically,
uh,

1162
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:09,080
I was training myself to,
to balance again,

1163
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,210
you know,
training my training,

1164
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:14,270
my,
my body to balance itself again.

1165
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,193
And in my,
if I couldn't see a horizon or a flat 

1166
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,660
surface,
uh,

1167
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,500
I couldn't tell which way was up and 
yeah,

1168
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,010
it was so bad.
And um,

1169
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,600
the visual stuff,
there was these,

1170
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:33,434
uh,
I had a string with these balls on it 

1171
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:38,810
and I would hold the string on my nose 
and hold it out here.

1172
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:41,270
and I had to look at all those balls and
it would.

1173
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,170
My,
my,

1174
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,003
my eyes are focusing.
Just all it's doing is really just 

1175
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:45,704
making my eyes change.
Focus from one to the next to the next 

1176
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,510
and back onto the next,
next and back.

1177
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,793
And there was this add chart on the wall
and it had all these letters and all 

1178
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,124
these numbers on it.

1179
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,980
And I had to,
I had to look at that.

1180
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,990
I chart and turned my head back and 
forth this way.

1181
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:04,991
But look at that.
I chart and count and count do from a to

1182
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:08,480
z but backwards knew the alphabet.
So I'd have to look for the letters.

1183
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,050
Where's the,
you know,

1184
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,950
and go backwards or one,
one to 20,

1185
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,823
you know,
all are you shaking your head too three 

1186
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,530
standing up and walking backwards and 
walking forward.

1187
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,870
And what is this doing to your mind?
Like how does,

1188
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,530
how does this fix your mind?
What is the process?

1189
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,210
You know,
I don't know what the real.

1190
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,133
I don't know what it's the I've had the 
problem with me was my vestibular 

1191
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:32,714
system.
So my ability to understand balance and 

1192
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:36,584
understand horizons.
And so I was putting my mind in a 

1193
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:44,090
perplex,
uh,

1194
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:48,800
in a complex environment or making my 
mind do complex things that you don't do

1195
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:49,510
every day.

1196
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,343
And it's just firing your brain.
It's kind of like stretching this 

1197
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:54,120
muscle,
you know,

1198
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,973
it's like,
it's like they used to say when you 

1199
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:59,320
would get hurt to go into a dark room 
and hide and er,

1200
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,320
you know,
no,

1201
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,180
no electronics,
no tv,

1202
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,780
just sit in a dark room and wait and 
what they're,

1203
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,093
what they believe today is that exposure
is what helps pushing yourself into 

1204
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:11,204
these complex environments and doing 
things that are really challenging for 

1205
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:14,630
yourself.
Even doing that,

1206
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,210
if I put you in front of that,
I chart made you turn your head back and

1207
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,890
forth and walk walking two steps 
forward,

1208
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,860
two steps back and doing it would be,
it'd been difficult for you.

1209
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,470
Um,
uh,

1210
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,950
so,
but for an injured person,

1211
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:29,010
it's super difficult.
It has to be really challenging,

1212
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,540
but it just sort of tunes to mind are 
retrains the brain to do balance,

1213
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,543
to balance it retrains the eyes to,
to track on objects and to lock on 

1214
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,700
objects and stay on them.

1215
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,490
And what's crazy is,
it sounds like physical rehab,

1216
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,230
what if you had a knee?
It is a physical.

1217
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,510
Yes.
There's a lot of physical rehab to it.

1218
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,643
Yeah,
there's a ton of it and don't think 

1219
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,470
about that when it comes to the mind 
though,

1220
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,343
I'm usually think of the mind is 
something that needs to be healed with 

1221
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:53,010
medicine.
Yeah,

1222
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,540
I agree.
um,

1223
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,173
the probably 85 percent of the work that
I did was physical therapy doesn't 

1224
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,273
change your diet or anything like that 
because they see inflammatory causing 

1225
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:08,400
foods or inflammation causing foods.
I did not.

1226
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:11,280
I did not change our drank strictly 
drank water.

1227
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,370
I didn't drink anything other than water
and uh,

1228
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,503
I incorporated and bananas and things 
like that into my diet that I never ate 

1229
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:20,480
before it of potassium.
Yeah.

1230
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,563
Yeah.
What would affect his potassium have on 

1231
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,373
just recovering?
I just hear that it's good for your 

1232
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,880
brain.
It's good for your brain is her.

1233
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,060
Yeah,
I did not.

1234
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,990
My doctor didn't say start eating this 
stuff.

1235
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,100
So it was just,
you know,

1236
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,350
you got,
you get tidbits,

1237
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,090
like when you go and get injured like 
that,

1238
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:36,924
you're going to get people texting you 
and giving you the information here and 

1239
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:40,290
there and you kind of take what you 
want.

1240
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,041
And go and,
you know,

1241
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:44,670
I don't know about that but um,
did you ever mess with cbd at all?

1242
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,650
Cbd?

1243
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,610
You don't know what that is?
No.

1244
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:47,630
No.
Interesting.

1245
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,280
Um,
cbd is a non-psychoactive form of hemp.

1246
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,210
Yeah.
And uh,

1247
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,193
it's a radical inflammation fighter and 
a lot of people that have some pretty 

1248
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,054
significant injuries to the brain.
A lot of fighters take it like right 

1249
00:55:02,481 --> 00:55:04,820
after fights.
It used to be,

1250
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,840
um,
it's still questionable federally.

1251
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,500
Yeah.
Like they're trying to,

1252
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,373
there's some pushes to try to make it 
illegal just because of pharmaceutical 

1253
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,314
drug companies kind of putting pressure 
on that doesn't do anything in terms of 

1254
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,130
like get you high or anything?

1255
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,750
No,
I've actually inflammation.

1256
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,593
I actually read a little bit about that.
I'm just a couple of weeks ago because 

1257
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:28,370
it controls anxiety and,
and,

1258
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,930
and it's helped a lot of people with 
that.

1259
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:32,590
One of my biggest,
one of the problems that I faced just on

1260
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,610
a,
on a regular everyday is,

1261
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,580
is where my anxiety is like,
is that because of being famous?

1262
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,453
I don't know.
I think it comes from like your 

1263
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:42,434
childhood and just things that you 
experienced in life and what are you 

1264
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:46,334
anxious about?

1265
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,250
Just general social situations?
Yeah.

1266
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,581
Yeah.
I mean I,

1267
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:56,000
I would avoid.
I would,

1268
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,360
I've gotten a lot better.
Like I go,

1269
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,090
I can't,
I,

1270
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:01,840
I,
I would avoid concerts.

1271
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,250
Even if I love the band,
I would,

1272
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:05,084
uh,
just because there's too manY people 

1273
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,763
there,
but there's a ton of people that are 

1274
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,900
going to bother you.
No,

1275
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,570
no.
Um,

1276
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,920
I don't think So.
And I like being bothered.

1277
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:14,630
I don't mind people coming up to me and 
saying,

1278
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:15,530
man,
that's cool.

1279
00:56:15,531 --> 00:56:17,990
I know who you are.
I mean that shit's feels great.

1280
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:23,110
But it was more about like,
am I going to be accepted it?

1281
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,130
My

1282
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,710
scene is.
I don't know,

1283
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:29,190
man.
I just always had a lot of anxiety over.

1284
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,233
Okay.
So anxiety about whether or not you're 

1285
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:33,720
going to fit in,
fit in?

1286
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:34,740
Yeah.
Okay.

1287
00:56:34,741 --> 00:56:35,574
So you felt like an hour

1288
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,820
when you're younger.
Yeah.

1289
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:39,530
Yeah.
so that anxiety,

1290
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,150
I don't know,
I still feel,

1291
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,890
um,
I,

1292
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:44,980
I don't,
you know,

1293
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:48,830
so that shit goes away hard,
takes a long time for that to go away.

1294
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:49,610
Yeah,
yeah,

1295
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,720
yeah.
Like my wife,

1296
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,530
um,
she uh,

1297
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,650
likes ashwagandha.
You ever heard the officer brown?

1298
00:56:55,651 --> 00:56:56,161
Yes.
Yeah.

1299
00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:56,994
So she,
she likes that and I take that every 

1300
00:56:58,251 --> 00:56:59,960
once in a while and I think that shit 
works pretty good.

1301
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,460
It kind of keeps you calm and.
Yeah.

1302
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,040
Yeah.
So,

1303
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:07,580
but I've never tried the.
I've read about when I was reading about

1304
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:10,160
ashwagandha is when I read about that 
stuff you're talking about.

1305
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,930
I'll get you some.
It'll help cbds.

1306
00:57:12,931 --> 00:57:13,910
Amazing.
And you know,

1307
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,753
it's really good.
There's some muscle balms that work 

1308
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:18,510
really good on sore joints and stuff.
I mean,

1309
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,110
but like nothing I've ever used before.
Better than anything.

1310
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,490
Cbd just gets right into the muscles and
just relaxes all the inflammation.

1311
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:30,270
And the best part about it is it's 100 
percent natural and no side effects.

1312
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,180
There's nothing right?
But in terms of like,

1313
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,650
there's a bunch of different cbd oils 
you can take,

1314
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,020
they chill you out,
but they don't get you high or anything.

1315
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:38,903
You're not weirded out.
But they just just calm me down and I 

1316
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:44,970
wonder how much that calming down is 
because of inflammation.

1317
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:47,370
Just reducing inflammation and just.
It just,

1318
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,760
it seems to.
Your body has a,

1319
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,080
your body knows what to do with it.
everybody's like,

1320
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,110
oh,
I know what this is.

1321
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,210
Is good.
Yeah,

1322
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,410
yeah,
yeah.

1323
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,930
I mean I got ted nugent into it.
Really?

1324
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,920
Man,
ted nugent.

1325
00:57:58,921 --> 00:57:59,754
Before he came down here,
he was Telling me how he's anti 

1326
00:58:02,161 --> 00:58:02,994
marijuana and this and that,
and we had this conversation about it 

1327
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:06,540
but makes people lazy.
I'm like,

1328
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,920
I don't think it does,
man.

1329
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:08,754
I think people are just lazy.
And I told him because I knoW he's got 

1330
00:58:11,281 --> 00:58:13,830
some serious knee problems,
had all these knee surgeries.

1331
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:14,461
He's,
you know,

1332
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:15,294
he's a madman.
He used to jump off the top of the 

1333
00:58:16,351 --> 00:58:19,260
fucking stage and land on the ground and
blues meniscus out.

1334
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,440
I got them on the cbd bomb now.
No,

1335
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,350
he texted me the other day.
So there's not a thing I've ever used to

1336
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,460
telling me like this before.
Really?

1337
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:27,443
Yeah.
So now I'm having cases sent to them 

1338
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,730
like every week night.
Yeah.

1339
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,010
He loves the shit.
I mean,

1340
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:33,480
he's,
he wants to endorse it,

1341
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,600
which is hilarious.
Like the motor city madman,

1342
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:38,640
ted nugent,
super anti marijuana,

1343
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,360
wants to enjoy an endorser,
a cannabis product that's helped us.

1344
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:43,783
Yeah.
But it doesn't do anything to you 

1345
00:58:44,551 --> 00:58:46,200
psychologically.
It doesn't affect me.

1346
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,430
Do you know,
calm me down.

1347
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,520
yeah,
that's what I read about.

1348
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:51,610
It doesn't have that part of the

1349
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,230
part of the drug that's my friend's son 
has.

1350
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,143
It's a type of epilepsy brendan shop.
And he started giving his kid cbd oil 

1351
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,130
and it stopped the epilepsy and the 
tracks.

1352
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,880
Yeah.
I think I read where they are.

1353
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:10,480
Um,
it's been used for that for years.

1354
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:11,710
Yes,
yes.

1355
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,370
Yeah,
yeah.

1356
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,030
To hail,
uh,

1357
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,450
for um,
god seizures and stuff.

1358
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,610
Yeah.
For seizures.

1359
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:18,444
Yeah.
It's just a radical inflammation 

1360
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,413
decrease.
Just figures out a way it does as some 

1361
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:27,290
sort of interaction with your body,
which reduces inflammaTion.

1362
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,070
But it's like I said,
it also calms people down,

1363
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,220
alleviates anxiety,
and no side effects.

1364
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:36,110
That's the most important one.
Some people,

1365
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:38,840
it gives them a weird stomach.
They don't like the way,

1366
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:39,674
but I think they'll probably take it too
much or maybe it's expired or something 

1367
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:43,180
like that.
YeAh.

1368
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,503
I've never had those issues.
But I'll get you something to look into 

1369
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:47,180
that too.
Right?

1370
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,730
Yeah.
So what else did they do with you?

1371
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:50,564
Did you do any cryotherapy or anything 
like that that also would reduce 

1372
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:54,584
information?

1373
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,380
No,
no.

1374
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,010
Basically I went and um,
in this,

1375
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:03,090
in 2012 we did basic basic,
uh,

1376
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:08,150
physical therapy and I therapy,
I eye tests and different eye exercises.

1377
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,633
Um,
and in two weeks I was back in the race 

1378
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:14,880
car raced for,

1379
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,380
that was in 2012.
I raced all the way to 2016 to weeks.

1380
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:20,850
You felt 100 percent.
Yeah.

1381
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,370
That's amazing.
So With all these crazy exercises you're

1382
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:24,204
doing,
when did you feel like it had settled 

1383
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:26,161
in?
Like,

1384
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:27,240
wow,
this is really working?

1385
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,343
Uh,

1386
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,391
pretty.
I mean,

1387
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:33,280
and if it was a two week period it 
wouldn't,

1388
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,600
you know,
it was a day or two,

1389
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:35,830
I guess,
you know what I mean?

1390
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:36,664
I can't even remember.
I can't remember that far back a day or 

1391
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:40,181
two.
Yeah.

1392
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:41,014
I mean,
I imagine it was feeling pretty good 

1393
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,270
after a couple of days.
I'd have to.

1394
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,460
I don't know.
I mean,

1395
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:47,820
I don't know if that affected me right 
away or,

1396
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,010
but I know I was by the time we have,
I take an impact test,

1397
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:53,650
which is basic kind of measures,
memory and Things like that,

1398
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:56,560
all kinds of different stuff.
And my,

1399
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,240
um,
measurements had come back to my norm,

1400
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:01,240
you know,
my basic,

1401
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,160
uh,
uh,

1402
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,841
you're,
you know,

1403
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:06,674
they kind of make you take the impact 
test beforehand so that gets your 

1404
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:09,643
blueprint of how you are and uh,
and then whenever you get injured you 

1405
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,950
take it again and they align that up 
against,

1406
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,480
against that and say,
okay,

1407
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:18,500
yeah,
you're deficient here.

1408
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:21,380
This is a problem.
Maybe it's not diagnosing a concussion,

1409
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:24,290
but it wants it.
It's asking us to look in this area.

1410
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,340
And um,
so you have a baseline and then you have

1411
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,450
whatever post,
you know,

1412
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,980
your injury or post crash a baseline is.
Um,

1413
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:34,814
so I was matching all my normals on that
impact test and that was kind of the 

1414
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:40,340
trigger for them to go,
man,

1415
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:42,350
if you feel good,
you look good here.

1416
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,180
All the thIngs are saying that your 
back,

1417
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,860
you know,
and uh,

1418
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,220
I wanted to go race.
So I felt pretty good.

1419
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:54,750
Is it a strange feeling knowing that you
can't see what the damages,

1420
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,380
like a brain injury is a strange one,
right?

1421
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:01,450
Because it's affecting everything in 
your body,

1422
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,160
but you don't,
you don't see it.

1423
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,950
Like if you have a broken arm,
you're looking at it,

1424
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,320
you know,
it's in a cast that gets fixed,

1425
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,340
you know,
you,

1426
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,300
you're,
you're aware of it,

1427
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:11,134
you're doing rehab on it,
you're looking at it while you're doing 

1428
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,144
it.
There's something about the brain where 

1429
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:18,220
it's all like you can kind of mind fuck 
yourself and say,

1430
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,083
hey,
I think I,

1431
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,093
I'm okay.

1432
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,773
So in the book I talk about these notes,
I started taking after that crash in 

1433
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:25,734
2012 when I would wreck after that I 
would get sick and I wouldn't tell 

1434
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:32,340
anybody and so I started writing these 
notes in my journal,

1435
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,353
in my phone and from 2013 all the way to
2016 I had this long journal of crashes 

1436
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,683
and how I felt and I would crash on 
sunday and I'd ride in the journal and 

1437
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:45,800
sunday night,
monday morning,

1438
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:47,190
monday at lunch,
money at night,

1439
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,083
you know,
every three times a day every day until 

1440
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,053
whenever I felt good,
which is usually either wednesday or 

1441
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:54,084
thursday of that week.
And I was writing these notes because I 

1442
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:58,554
couldn't tell if I was getting better 
than the brain injury or any type of 

1443
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:02,964
head injury.
I mean if you said how's it feel monday 

1444
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:07,740
and then you asked me again tuesday,
I'd be.

1445
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,300
I really don't fucking know man.
It just,

1446
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:11,610
it's there.
I don't know if it's better,

1447
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,503
I just feel bad.
And so I would try to write as detailed 

1448
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:18,330
as I could on a day,
on a monday.

1449
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,164
And then try to write as detailed as I 
could on tuesday and reread monday and 

1450
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,620
see is this better?
I can see in the comments or you know,

1451
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:28,470
I can't really remember exactly what I 
was feeling monday,

1452
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,290
but in the comments it seems better and 
I would write these notes right.

1453
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,513
And so I kept doing this and I thought I
was treating myself and eventually it 

1454
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:37,524
caught up with me like I had about a 
dozen concussions in a period of about 

1455
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:44,820
two and a half years.
And I got to where I couldn't walk and I

1456
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,890
called my owner and I was like,
man,

1457
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,060
I need to talk to you.

1458
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,520
I can't race this weekend.
I can't hardly walk.

1459
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:51,923
And my balance is so bad that I can't 
get up off the couch without holding on 

1460
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:57,540
to something and walking across the room
without grabbing stuff as I go.

1461
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,200
And jesus,
he,

1462
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,220
he was like,
we gotta go back to the doctor,

1463
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:03,600
what are you doing?
He was mad.

1464
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:04,320
He was lIke,
you know,

1465
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,880
what do you fucking do?
And getting to the doctor,

1466
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,460
why aren't you at the doctor?
And I was like,

1467
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:09,600
you're right,
I need to go to a doctor.

1468
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:12,960
I mean a concussed person doesn't have 
good judgment and self awareness,

1469
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:13,794
you know,
you're just,

1470
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:14,663
you're just in a brick and you're in a.
It's like being hung over the worst 

1471
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:20,820
hangover,
you can't make decisions.

1472
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,673
And so I went back to pittsburgh and saw
mickey again and I had to stay out the 

1473
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:29,520
entire whole half of the year in 2016 to
get better.

1474
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,700
It took me five months to get,
well instead of two weeks.

1475
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,360
Wow.
And that time I was on,

1476
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,223
they put me on medication that will drop
my anxiety levels so the anxiety levels 

1477
01:04:40,141 --> 01:04:40,974
would stay down so that I could 
concentrate on the injury and what 

1478
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:49,530
medications I'm on.
I don't know exactly the names,

1479
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:51,930
but um,
it was uh,

1480
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:57,720
it was very,
very small doses and it would take about

1481
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,810
three weeks for just kind of kick in.
I'd have to take it for awhile before it

1482
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:01,644
started working.
But it just made me real chill and it 

1483
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:10,371
made me not analyzing myself every 
single day when I got up,

1484
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,210
when I got up,
I wouldn't go,

1485
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,530
hmm,
is it still there?

1486
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,393
Is it as bad as it was?
Let me walk across the room and see how 

1487
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:17,274
I feel.
Let me go do this and test this and trY 

1488
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:21,770
this and try this and try this all day 
long and see how I feel.

1489
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,510
It made me stop doing that because I was
driving myself crazy.

1490
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,950
And um,
he gave me a lot more physical therapy,

1491
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,330
basketball movements,
anything that got my head moving.

1492
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,733
Um,
I do those exercises for about tWo 

1493
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:39,453
weeks.
Some of them would stop triggering 

1494
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:43,720
symptoms.
I'd go back to this place in pittsburgh,

1495
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,650
we'd go through about 30 more exercises 
and I'd take home about 15 that made the

1496
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:50,070
symptoms trigger.
And I do them for about two,

1497
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,270
three weeks and some of them would stop 
working.

1498
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,313
I'd go back to him,
we'd go through more physical exercises 

1499
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:57,400
to kept doing that process over and over
and over.

1500
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,280
I took the medication for about a year 
and a half.

1501
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,100
Um,
and I had a lot of,

1502
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,550
they gave me this,
a computer program for my eyes and I was

1503
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,533
wearing these,
I would wear these three d glasses and 

1504
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:14,470
uh,
uh,

1505
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,304
this computer program would try to take 
these three d objects and go to two d 

1506
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,040
and three d and my eyes would literally 
try.

1507
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,290
It would've felt like it was trying to 
rip my eyes apart.

1508
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:24,663
It hurt,
like physically hurt when this object 

1509
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,700
would try to go from,
from a three d to two d and it was going

1510
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:31,534
very,
very slowly and it felt like it was 

1511
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:36,940
trying to rip my eyes apart and imagine 
your ads are tethered together.

1512
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:38,710
So when you look left,
they both go there,

1513
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:40,270
right?
And they both go wherever you look,

1514
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:41,710
they go together like they're supposed 
to.

1515
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,950
And mine didn't want to do that.
Mine.

1516
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:47,380
You couldn't physically see my eyes 
towed out or going the wrong way.

1517
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:50,320
You couldn't see that.
But when I try to look over here,

1518
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,560
they both didn't go to the same place.
And that was that action or that,

1519
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:01,930
that computer program was strengthening 
that activity of my eyes,

1520
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:06,190
trying to do something together and I 
would walk.

1521
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:07,143
So if I,
I've got these buffalo on my property 

1522
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,580
and they're across the field,
wait,

1523
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:12,191
you know,
200,

1524
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:15,850
300 yards out across the field,
out the back window of my living room.

1525
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,013
And if I walked across the floor,
every step I took would knock my eyes 

1526
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,874
off of the buffalo,
like they're way out there and I could 

1527
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:25,120
look at them.
But if I took a step,

1528
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,390
my eyes would shake and I couldn't,
I'd have to find them again,

1529
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,830
you know.
And so that was,

1530
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,820
that computer program would strengthen 
my ability.

1531
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:37,030
It's called gaze stabilization.
It would make it to where when I walk,

1532
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:39,500
I don't know if I'm walking or bouncing 
across the room,

1533
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:40,334
um,
I could still look at you in the eyes 

1534
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:41,830
and,
and,

1535
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,260
you know,
like a normal person.

1536
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,330
And if I,
when I was in my,

1537
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:47,800
at my worst,
I couldn't do that.

1538
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,570
And so,
uh,

1539
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,880
but that took a long time to fix.
And,

1540
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:53,483
uh,
the book basically is me admitting 

1541
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:57,190
making those mistakes.
Uh,

1542
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,660
I should have went to him as soon as I 
got sick again the first time instead of

1543
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,494
trying to document it myself and,
and hide it and manage it myself and 

1544
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:08,800
trying to get to whatever the end of my 
career was.

1545
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,633
Whenever that moment was in retire,
thinking I was going to walk away 

1546
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:15,420
without anybody ever knowing.
Um,

1547
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:18,050
and,
and I had to retire after that.

1548
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:18,884
After that 2016,
you're missing half a season and going 

1549
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,930
through all that,
I didn't want to go through it again.

1550
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,080
I had one more year on my contract in 
2017,

1551
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:29,610
so I'll finish that season.
And that was that.

1552
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,560
Were you apprehensive while you're 
finishing that sense?

1553
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:33,440
Yeah,
I didn't want to get hurt.

1554
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,630
I didn't want to go back through that 
whole process again.

1555
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:37,820
It goes through that rehab again.
I didn't want to get sick again.

1556
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,030
Me and my wife just got married on new 
years of 2016,

1557
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:44,270
17.
So we're newlyweds were getting,

1558
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,220
she's pregnant.
Uh,

1559
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,500
we're going to have a baby.
Um,

1560
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:49,903
you know,
I didn't want to go through any of that 

1561
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:51,404
stuff sick.
You know what I told my doctor you'll 

1562
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,120
like this since now we know each other 
so well.

1563
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,680
Um,
when I was ill in the hospital or when I

1564
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:01,514
was with mickey in pittsburgh as my 
wedding was a on new years and I was 

1565
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,640
probably around october or right.
No,

1566
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,440
this was probably in august.
I said I need two things.

1567
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,280
I was like,
I need to be able to,

1568
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:17,114
uh,
go through my wedding on my wedding day 

1569
01:09:20,871 --> 01:09:22,640
and my wedding night and that whole 
experience.

1570
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:25,370
I want to do it with a completely clear 
headed and I want to be able to remember

1571
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,350
everything.
I don't want to be on any drugs.

1572
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:28,184
I don't want to have any symptoms.
I don't want to even be thinking about 

1573
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,204
my head.
Reminded about it and one in a moment 

1574
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:34,784
during that night,
I want my wedding to be perfect and I 

1575
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:38,504
want to be able to climb up in my deer 
stand without feeling like I'm gonna 

1576
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:43,430
fall out of it.
And he said he'd fix it.

1577
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:48,490
And I was hunting that I was hunting 
that october or november

1578
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,250
you,
you,

1579
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:51,360
um,
in,

1580
01:09:51,361 --> 01:09:55,800
in doing these exercises and then fixing
the issues that you were facing.

1581
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:59,230
Were you,
were you concerned though about longterm

1582
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:00,143
effects?

1583
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,293
You know,
I wrote a absolutely over the last five 

1584
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:05,014
years.
It's,

1585
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,100
it's,
it's been hard for me to turn,

1586
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,400
turn mY back on articles,
um,

1587
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:14,733
uh,
stories about nfl players and their 

1588
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,420
history and these guys,
you know,

1589
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,273
the,
the whole lawsuit brought up so many 

1590
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:23,920
stories about what these guys have went 
through,

1591
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:24,754
what their families have went through.
It's been impossible not to read that 

1592
01:10:28,151 --> 01:10:31,920
stuff and fear that is that,
you know,

1593
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,580
is that something that's going to happen
to me?

1594
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:35,410
Uh,
if I do,

1595
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:37,790
I need to be worried about my,
you know,

1596
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:41,650
a longterm health and what,
you know,

1597
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,330
I,
I would,

1598
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:44,523
it took me the longest time to watch 
that concussion movie because I just 

1599
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:49,030
didn't want to know what he had to tell 
me,

1600
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,310
you know?
And I,

1601
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:52,144
uh,
eventually I got to a place where I 

1602
01:10:57,761 --> 01:11:01,810
thought I'm after.
I talked to mickey,

1603
01:11:01,811 --> 01:11:04,210
you know,
when I was in hurting 2016,

1604
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:04,781
I said,
mickey,

1605
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:06,430
why aren't you shutting me down?
Like he,

1606
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,880
he shut down some player,
I don't know the guy's name,

1607
01:11:09,881 --> 01:11:12,040
I don't know who,
whether he was a hockey player,

1608
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:14,550
a football player,
but guy was making millions of dollars

1609
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:17,670
and he was in his mid twenties and 
mickey had to say,

1610
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,504
you can't play anymore and I want to 
make you to tell me that I didn't want 

1611
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:24,150
to have to go out,
go out the room and say,

1612
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:25,040
y'all,
I'm retired.

1613
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:27,450
I don't want to do this anymore.
I want to say y'all.

1614
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,470
Mickey said I got to retire.
I don't know,

1615
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:31,620
but he wouldn't.
And he said,

1616
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,510
you know,
you're not where that guy is and I don't

1617
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:34,344
see what's going on.
I don't see anything going on with you 

1618
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:37,590
that tells me you can't race if you want
to race.

1619
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:38,041
I said,
well,

1620
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:38,950
what if I get hurt again?
He,

1621
01:11:38,951 --> 01:11:39,930
he's good.
He said,

1622
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:41,430
if you get hurt again,
if I can fix it,

1623
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,110
if you,
it's up to you.

1624
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,560
If you want to go through that.
He said,

1625
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,820
you're just as likely to get hurt as you
were before the injury.

1626
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:51,090
You're going to race and racing and 
racing is dangerous.

1627
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:52,403
Uh,
you gotta make up your mind whether you 

1628
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:58,230
want to go out there and risk getting 
hurt again and if you do I'll fix it,

1629
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,070
can come right back here and we'll fix 
it all over again and us like.

1630
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,060
And I was like,
all right,

1631
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,473
if you're not shutting me down then you 
must not be worried about my longterm 

1632
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:08,480
health.
AnD he's like,

1633
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,313
oh,
I'm not worried about your long term 

1634
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:11,880
hill.
There's nothing going on here that I see

1635
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:13,800
that would make me concerned about your 
longterm health.

1636
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,360
And so with all that said,
I got married,

1637
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,313
I had a little girl.
I'm sitting there on them days at home 

1638
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,663
with them and I'm thinking to myself,
what if I'm sitting here worried about 

1639
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,110
cte or my mind,
you know,

1640
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:36,270
going away and it never happens.
You know,

1641
01:12:36,271 --> 01:12:37,104
am I gonna wait,
am I going to sit here and worry about 

1642
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:41,910
that at 44 all the way through my 
fifties and sixties and seventies?

1643
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:43,920
And then one day wake up at 80 and go,
damn,

1644
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:46,110
I lived pretty good life.
Why did I worry about all that?

1645
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,783
Um,
why didn't I enJoy what was in front of 

1646
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:53,370
me?
And so the other.

1647
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,980
So I'm going to enjoy what's in front of
me,

1648
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:56,963
not going to worry about cte,
not going to worry about my longterm 

1649
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:01,380
health.
And there's another thing too,

1650
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,633
the,
the conversation about concussions is 

1651
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:10,140
really just skyrocketed into,
you know,

1652
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,020
into warp speed over the last five or 
six years.

1653
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,543
And the,
the way they treated me in 2012 to the 

1654
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:21,870
way they treated me in 2016 was 
completely 180 degrees because they know

1655
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:23,430
so much more and they're so,
you know,

1656
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,130
they understand so much more about 
treating the injury.

1657
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,170
And so if I do have any problems 
whenever that is,

1658
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,543
I'm confident that there'll be something
there for me that there'll be something 

1659
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,990
there to give me a good quality of life.

1660
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,750
I've had a hell of a run.
I had a lot of fun.

1661
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,120
I raised hell.
I partied,

1662
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,160
I won,
I lost.

1663
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:46,980
And if it all ended now,
I wouldn't be,

1664
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:51,120
I wouldn't have missed out on anything 
other than my wife and my little girl.

1665
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:56,720
And so I'm content with where I'm 
content with where I am.

1666
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,430
All I want to be able to do is just,
you know,

1667
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:06,450
be a good father and be a good husband.
And I think,

1668
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,463
you know,
I think I'm going to have that 

1669
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,110
opportunity.
But if anything does happen to me,

1670
01:14:10,111 --> 01:14:12,490
I think that there'll be some,
some information,

1671
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,323
some medicine,
something that would give me a good 

1672
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:17,590
enough quality of life that I would be 
able to enjoy those things.

1673
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,170
I think you made the wise choice in 
retiring.

1674
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:23,100
Oh yeah.
And I Think that I'm,

1675
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:26,270
look,
I'm very familiar with head injuries.

1676
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:30,990
I'm around people that have had them all
the time and I think it's um,

1677
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,220
it's something that we are understanding
now more than ever before,

1678
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:38,360
but someone like you writing a book 
about this and your experience with it I

1679
01:14:38,361 --> 01:14:39,194
think is really important for people.
I think it's going to help a lot of 

1680
01:14:41,271 --> 01:14:42,104
people.
It's gonna help a lot of people 

1681
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:46,580
understand it and the more we talk about
this more,

1682
01:14:46,581 --> 01:14:47,414
this gets out there in the public,
the more it helps just regular folks 

1683
01:14:51,051 --> 01:14:53,960
that have had concussions.
Understand what a significant thing this

1684
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:54,550
is.

1685
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:55,383
Yeah.
This,

1686
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,223
there's,
this book is to not discourage you from 

1687
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:02,230
doing what you want to do.
If you want to race,

1688
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,550
race,
if you own a fight,

1689
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,620
fight,
if you want to do whatever it is,

1690
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:06,454
play football.
I'm not discouraging anybody from doing 

1691
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:09,860
that.
I'm encouraging you.

1692
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,550
I'm just saying that when ever you are 
hurt,

1693
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,384
wherever you,
if you ever do find yourself with a 

1694
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:17,110
injury,
don't make the bad choices that I made.

1695
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:20,100
That's really all I'm doing here is to,
uh,

1696
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,210
share with people the mistakes that I 
made.

1697
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,430
I never would have known about mickey 
had somebody not taking me to him.

1698
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:28,264
I would've never even considered the 
fact that there was treatment for head 

1699
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,820
injury had I not met mickey.
I mean,

1700
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:34,713
there's people out there today that 
don't know there's treatment that 

1701
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:40,000
they're living with these injuries are 
veterans,

1702
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,213
um,
that don't think that they can be 

1703
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:44,500
healed.
A,

1704
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:46,570
there's people in my timeline all the 
time saying,

1705
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:47,404
man,
I'm glad you're talking about 

1706
01:15:47,561 --> 01:15:48,394
concussions.
I had one and I'm dealing wiTh it all 

1707
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:50,351
the time.
Boy,

1708
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:51,184
it's just nagging me every day,
and the truth is that you don't have to 

1709
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:56,070
even live that way.
There's better.

1710
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:59,380
There's a better quality of life with 
the information that they know today,

1711
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,920
even if this injury was 10 years ago or 
15 years ago.

1712
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:07,060
There's stuff todaY that can help give 
you a better quality of life.

1713
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,040
And so that's what the book's about.

1714
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,313
It'S an amazing time.
And when you think about the fact that 

1715
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:17,550
2012 you had an injury and they treat 
you one way to thousand 16,

1716
01:16:17,551 --> 01:16:20,490
they had already advanced their 
techniques and I'm sure they've advanced

1717
01:16:20,491 --> 01:16:22,260
even more now in 2018.
It's.

1718
01:16:22,261 --> 01:16:23,094
It's amazing.

1719
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,013
Yeah,
and we're live.

1720
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:24,913
We're living in this.
We're living in this big learning 

1721
01:16:27,711 --> 01:16:28,700
experience right now.

1722
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,281
Yeah,
I know.

1723
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:32,440
They're starting to do some stuff with 
stem cells as well and you know,

1724
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,293
there's a guy named dr neil riordan that
I've had on the podcast before that he 

1725
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,483
did wonders for mel gibson's dad and so 
mel gibson came on and went to talk 

1726
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:42,264
about this.
They have to do treatment and Panama 

1727
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,653
because they can't do a lot of the 
treatments here in the United States 

1728
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,344
because they're not legal yet,
but the effects that they're having on 

1729
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:53,880
people that are,
they're bringing down to Panama,

1730
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,040
it's just mind blowing,
you know,

1731
01:16:56,041 --> 01:17:01,041
and I'm hoping that's gonna also help 
people with traumatic brain injuries and

1732
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,510
cte and some other things as well.

1733
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1734
01:17:04,441 --> 01:17:07,050
I'm excited for them to find a way to,
um,

1735
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,980
to take cte in living human being.

1736
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:10,943
They already have figured out ways.
They've figured out a way to do that 

1737
01:17:12,931 --> 01:17:13,890
now.
It's very,

1738
01:17:13,891 --> 01:17:16,710
very recently started to do that.
But you know,

1739
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:17,544
it's a,
it's a major concern obviously for 

1740
01:17:19,561 --> 01:17:22,020
fighters,
but I would imagine that someone in your

1741
01:17:22,021 --> 01:17:24,480
line of work,
it's not thought about the same way.

1742
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,280
Look,
if people think About it with football,

1743
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,233
they don't think about in terms of they 
don't directly associate boxing with 

1744
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:31,344
head injury.
They don't directly associate race card 

1745
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:34,280
now.

1746
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,120
Yeah.
And,

1747
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:35,954
and I'm,
I'm hopeful that there aren't a lot of 

1748
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:38,744
drivers that have experienced what I've 
experienced and crash the way I've 

1749
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:44,240
crashed and there there's drivers that 
will raise their lives without it,

1750
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:45,460
you know,
uh,

1751
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,990
without ever having that experience.
And I'm glad for that.

1752
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:50,120
But for the guys that have,
I've got,

1753
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:53,030
I've had veterans retired guys call me,
say,

1754
01:17:53,031 --> 01:17:53,720
man,
I've,

1755
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:57,360
I've given him my doctor's number to so 
many damn people ever since I've,

1756
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:02,180
I've spoken up about this in 2012 to now
and this book a mickey says there's,

1757
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,570
there's at least three people a week 
that come in his office talking about me

1758
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:08,810
and that's why they're there.
And so that's the whole mission,

1759
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:09,644
man,
is because mickeY gave me my life back 

1760
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,860
twice.
I'm telling you man,

1761
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:16,800
at 16 I was in bad shape and I was,
I was without what?

1762
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,830
Without my wife and without mickey.
I don't know,

1763
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:19,664
that automated it out till the end.
And this book or anything else and this 

1764
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:25,140
podcast,
anything,

1765
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:26,223
any ever,
any opportunity to talk about this is 

1766
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:31,360
only to push more people to mickey,
uh,

1767
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,280
so that he can do the same thing for 
them.

1768
01:18:33,281 --> 01:18:34,040
He did for me.

1769
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,660
That's amazing.
Um,

1770
01:18:35,661 --> 01:18:36,494
there's a guy named Dr.
Mark Gordon that's also been on this 

1771
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:39,434
podcast before that it does a lot of 
work with tbi and soldiers and football 

1772
01:18:43,371 --> 01:18:44,870
players and stuff like that.
So there's,

1773
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:47,900
there's a lot of other doctors out there
that are specializing in this.

1774
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:50,060
We realize that this is a significant 
issue.

1775
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,820
Just so happy that those people are out.

1776
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:54,530
Yeah,
well they're getting some good,

1777
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,723
you know,
they're getting some opportunities to 

1778
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:57,530
actually,
you know,

1779
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:58,543
get up,
get up there and speak up about it and 

1780
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:02,360
make it known.
And I know there's got the mic,

1781
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,313
I have mickey,
there's a bunch of makers out there and 

1782
01:19:05,561 --> 01:19:06,400
there,
you know,

1783
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:08,120
and there's a lot getting learned right 
now.

1784
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,273
Well there's just so many people that 
are silently suffering that don't want 

1785
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:13,000
to open their mouth because they don't 
want to appear weak.

1786
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:15,110
Well that'S part of it too.
Yeah,

1787
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:16,630
a lot.
A lot of people don't want to.

1788
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,390
There's people,
there's some people that just don't know

1789
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,280
where to go,
you know,

1790
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,593
I don't think that they can afford it or
don't think that they're going to get 

1791
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:25,870
that out.
You know,

1792
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:26,703
like when I,
when I first went to mickey I thought I 

1793
01:19:28,121 --> 01:19:31,030
was going to go in there and see just 
steelers in nhl players.

1794
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:33,220
Right.
That's how ignorant I was about it.

1795
01:19:33,221 --> 01:19:36,010
And you know,
he sees every man.

1796
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,863
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1797
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,400
Now do you,

1798
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:44,030
me being a race car driver is such a 
wild,

1799
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:47,150
exciting,
powerful way to make a living.

1800
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,250
Do you ever get the itch now?

1801
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:50,960
Yeah,
sure.

1802
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,160
I,
um,

1803
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,270
I ran a race and uh,
about a month or a month,

1804
01:19:55,310 --> 01:20:00,310
two months ago at richmond,
Virginia and it's a,

1805
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:02,480
uh,
we haven't finity level.

1806
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:03,733
We haven't extended the series that's 
sponsored by xfinity and basically our 

1807
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,220
college

1808
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,053
level,
they race on saturdays before the big 

1809
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:13,830
show on sunday at the same track and 
it's a,

1810
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:14,880
it's a,
uh,

1811
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,370
abbreviated race.
Um,

1812
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,610
and I got a couple on a couple of cars 
that race in that every week.

1813
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:21,444
And so I ran in a race at richmond to 
scratch the itch a little bit and had a 

1814
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:27,840
blast.
We ran great lead a lot of laps,

1815
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:30,300
had fun competItion,
everything we wanted to accomplish.

1816
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,573
Um,
I'll probably run one more next year at 

1817
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:34,794
another track and probably do that every
year until I just don't feel like doing 

1818
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:39,060
it anymore.
Just for fun.

1819
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:39,930
Yeah,
just for fun.

1820
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,110
But no more than that.
And I never go back to the cup series,

1821
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,123
the six.
So the cups that people talk about it 

1822
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:46,051
like,
man,

1823
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:51,051
you can just go back.
It's like you can't just go back.

1824
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:55,050
it's like,
it'd be like,

1825
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:56,020
um,
when it,

1826
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,740
it'd be like one of the fIghters,
you know,

1827
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,603
just taking a couple of years off and 
then jumping back in for the 

1828
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:02,570
championship match,
you know,

1829
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,350
you,
you just,

1830
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:04,290
it's too elite.

1831
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:05,640
You know what I'm saying?
Well,

1832
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:06,474
that's just happened.
Conor mcgregor just came back after two 

1833
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:13,530
years off and fought khabIb normal.
So it's good point.

1834
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,393
Yeah.
I mean he probably would've lost anyway 

1835
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:16,920
to be.
Yeah.

1836
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,590
It could be just a monster.
Yeah.

1837
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,990
But who knows,
he might not have.

1838
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,000
If I would go back,
I wouldn't,

1839
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,580
it would take me six months just to get 
up to speed,

1840
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:31,150
not even really even get competitive,
just to get up to speed physically and,

1841
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,053
and mentally bring yourself to your 
agent and it ain't something you just 

1842
01:21:35,461 --> 01:21:37,300
get out of and go back in.
I mean,

1843
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:38,650
the people on the outside looking like,
wow,

1844
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,200
you steering,
you're just shifting.

1845
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:40,951
Yeah,
it's a big deal.

1846
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:42,240
Yeah.
Hit the gas.

1847
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,040
Go.
It's such a man.

1848
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:46,530
If you take a week off,
you just get so behInd.

1849
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,980
What is it that you get behind what?
Um.

1850
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:53,940
Well,
there are.

1851
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,220
So our sport,
we were,

1852
01:21:55,221 --> 01:21:57,390
I was telling him about this with a 
friend today and he made a good point.

1853
01:21:57,391 --> 01:22:02,391
He said there was a guy that he says our
sport is the only one where the,

1854
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,850
where the ball is governed and the 
bottle is inspected,

1855
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:07,170
like the race car,
the car,

1856
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:08,940
right.
The physical card itself.

1857
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,713
Uh,
so technology is one of the things that 

1858
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:18,240
is like what's fast today will be 
obsolete and slow six months from now.

1859
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:23,010
You wouldn't even think about running it
and six months really?

1860
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,120
Yeah.
Wow.

1861
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,430
Um,
yeah,

1862
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,410
I mean it's,
it's,

1863
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:32,540
it's constantly evolving and somebody 
next door,

1864
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,503
the guy next to you and the guy next to 
him and the guy next town's always 

1865
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:38,030
constantly trying to build a better 
mouse trap and,

1866
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:39,063
and everybody's in what's new and bad 
ass today is going to be okay and not 

1867
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:48,240
very good six months from now and 
they're constantly,

1868
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:49,074
uh,
so the teams are constantly working and 

1869
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:54,780
if you're not in those cars and current 
and in that flow,

1870
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,120
in that changing,
in that cycle,

1871
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:02,130
in that we'll um,
then you can't,

1872
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:03,600
you're,
you're behind.

1873
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:06,040
Like when you geT in the car and you get
around a team,

1874
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:08,470
like you're behind on,
on what's,

1875
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:09,550
what,
what's in the car,

1876
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,520
what's happening with the car.
And I don't know,

1877
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:14,470
it's just not something you just jump in
and out of cars.

1878
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,870
You're not the,
you're not really the,

1879
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,330
the key component like your body is,
your body is a fighter,

1880
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:25,130
you know your body and your body is the 
tool.

1881
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,880
I'm a football player,
same thing,

1882
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,670
quarterback his arms,
the tool right in racing.

1883
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:31,504
It's the car.
And so if you're not in it and around 

1884
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:36,064
it,
every day,

1885
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,590
you will be behind

1886
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:39,613
on technology,
understanding what's happening and what 

1887
01:23:41,091 --> 01:23:42,190
teams are doing,
what you're,

1888
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,183
what you need to be doing.
The damn dash is full of switches with 

1889
01:23:45,381 --> 01:23:47,920
all kinds of shit going on.
And this needs to be on.

1890
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,690
This needs to be off and this needs to 
be back on and off and own.

1891
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:54,530
And there's a levers,
there's brake levers,

1892
01:23:54,531 --> 01:23:56,510
some drivers have for fucking brake 
levers,

1893
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,990
or you can shut off the left front,
the right rear,

1894
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:02,720
the right front,
you can put all the breaks from the back

1895
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:03,800
to the front,
from the back,

1896
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,240
from the left of the right.
I mean,

1897
01:24:05,241 --> 01:24:08,510
that's just the breaks and yeah,
I mean there's just so many.

1898
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:11,210
There's,
there's just a lot going on

1899
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:12,783
that it would take you awhile to get 
back up to speed if you were to take 

1900
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:19,300
some time off.
It's not,

1901
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:20,913
it's just not as easy as it used to be.
I had no idea there were that many 

1902
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,163
options.
Oh yeah,

1903
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:26,491
yeah.
I mean,

1904
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:29,160
you could have as many as you own or as 
little as you want.

1905
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,083
Some guys really think that that stuff's
a good tool for them to be able to 

1906
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,593
adjust the brakes and change how the 
brakes work on all four corners of the 

1907
01:24:35,551 --> 01:24:36,384
car and some of them do,
they move them during the race while 

1908
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:39,931
they're racing,
you know,

1909
01:24:39,931 --> 01:24:41,310
they're changing them,
fooling with them,

1910
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,510
you know,
in an indy car,

1911
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:44,200
you know,
you can adjust the roll bars and all the

1912
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:47,760
wings and all that stuff and you know,
in those cars and stuff like that.

1913
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:49,810
So I mean there's a race car driver,
there's,

1914
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,750
there's a ton

1915
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,360
of stuff going on in that car that 
people don't even know about.

1916
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:56,220
yeah.
So.

1917
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:00,030
So it would just take you a while to get
all that stuff.

1918
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,180
Automatic mind.
Yeah.

1919
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,533
I would get into,
I would get in the car and forget about 

1920
01:25:05,191 --> 01:25:10,191
those tools and forget that I had those 
adjustments and knowledge and be getting

1921
01:25:10,321 --> 01:25:13,710
beat by guys that are using it everyday.
Now.

1922
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,713
How,
what,

1923
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,980
how much time are you in a car in a 
race?

1924
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,680
three hours.
Probably three and a half hours.

1925
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:20,723
Do you do anything or do you,
do you take anything to keep you 

1926
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,610
concentrating at your full potential 
during that time?

1927
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,620
Vitamins or.
I never did.

1928
01:25:31,621 --> 01:25:35,790
I just mixed water and orange gatorade.
I'm your electrolytes.

1929
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,050
Yeah.
50 slash 50.

1930
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,210
Yeah.
Uh,

1931
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:40,920
jimmy johnson,
several of those guys do energy,

1932
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:44,910
choose different things.
A lot of gatorade oriented stuff.

1933
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,000
Gatorade's a sponsor for jimmy,
so he's going to have the gatorade chews

1934
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:50,130
or whatever.
You must be sweating like a pig in those

1935
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:50,640
things,
right?

1936
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,200
You sweat a ton.
As you lose,

1937
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:55,560
you lose anywhere from six to eight 
pounds race.

1938
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:56,773
Um,
it's all just water weight and he just 

1939
01:25:58,201 --> 01:26:01,140
put it right back on in a day or two.
Is it really hot in the car?

1940
01:26:01,141 --> 01:26:02,060
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

1941
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,070
So.
And I'm in

1942
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,903
chicago this year.
It was a hundred and 50 degrees in the 

1943
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:08,250
car.
Whoa.

1944
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,600
So it's a sauna?
Yeah,

1945
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,513
we had a template.
We had these temperature gauges in the 

1946
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:13,064
car,
so we're seeing them on from the 

1947
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,700
broadcast booth.
We can see you're in the,

1948
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:17,543
in car camera.
It'll be pointed at a temperature gauge 

1949
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:21,614
and all of the guys cars were 150 
degrees inside all the drivers and it 

1950
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:26,850
was miserable.
That's insane.

1951
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,830
So is there any fear of people blacking 
out from,

1952
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,113
you know,
that's something that I've always kind 

1953
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:32,900
been concerned with.

1954
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,780
I think that we don't have that concern 
today,

1955
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:46,230
but it is coming and we need to like if 
we had 150 degree incar temperatures,

1956
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:51,160
I think that we need to think about how 
to try not to have that,

1957
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:53,140
you know,
try to do something to where man,

1958
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,960
is that really necessary that we put the
drivers through that.

1959
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,173
Is it because the engines in front of 
you as you're driving the heat from the 

1960
01:27:00,461 --> 01:27:03,580
engine just blows in danvers compartment
that in the brakes,

1961
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:04,730
everything.
The breaks spring,

1962
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,570
the breaks are going to be a thousand 
degrees on,

1963
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,400
on the calipers and that heat radiating 
into the car.

1964
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,020
The drivers can open up these knack,
naca ducks,

1965
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:14,620
uh,
to,

1966
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,240
to allow air into the car.
But that,

1967
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:18,110
that's going down.
Well,

1968
01:27:18,111 --> 01:27:19,000
yeah,
it's going to slow you down.

1969
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:21,550
It's going to hurt the performance of 
the car and so,

1970
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,023
um,
the drivers try to trim the cars out so 

1971
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:27,430
much that there's not a lot of air 
moving around in the car and it's so low

1972
01:27:27,431 --> 01:27:28,264
to the ground,
there's no air moving around under the 

1973
01:27:30,281 --> 01:27:30,730
car either.

1974
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:31,563
So that air under the cars just got a 
baking in there and just sitting in 

1975
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,380
there.
Um,

1976
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:38,080
so they're miserable.
They're miserable,

1977
01:27:38,081 --> 01:27:39,680
miserable,
miserable car.

1978
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:42,130
That's when I watched races and I'm 
like,

1979
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,173
you know,
I'd love to get out there and do that 

1980
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,300
for a few minutes,
but damn,

1981
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:48,910
running three hours,
150 degree race car,

1982
01:27:48,911 --> 01:27:53,110
it's miserable.
It is the worst experience.

1983
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,080
I can't imagine being in a sauna just 
sitting there for three hours.

1984
01:27:56,090 --> 01:28:00,430
never mind driving her car around a 
bunch of heavy focus on something.

1985
01:28:00,431 --> 01:28:02,140
Yeah,
everyone's going 200 miles an hour.

1986
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,340
the worst part is when you slow down,
like the caution comes out cause that it

1987
01:28:06,341 --> 01:28:08,410
gets hotter.
Like it just when the car,

1988
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,253
when the coach comes out and you have to
come in and change tires and you're 

1989
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:15,220
sitting there and you go about eight or 
10 pace laps at 50 miles an hour,

1990
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,500
you're just,
that's when you get to think about it,

1991
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,210
you know,
that's when you're sitting there going,

1992
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,000
damn,
this is hot while you're racing.

1993
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,270
You're almost so hyperfocused on what 
you're doing.

1994
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:25,363
It can.
It kinda doesn't bother you as bad 

1995
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,723
distracts you.
Is there anything they can do to cool 

1996
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:32,460
you off with your suit?
Does your suit.

1997
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:33,903
There's these new vests that we were 
that has a jail in it and it's a you 

1998
01:28:36,881 --> 01:28:37,714
plug into a little machine that pumps it
in so you unplug it to get out of the 

1999
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:42,454
car and those work really well.
Actually we use the usable in the last 

2000
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,910
year of my career and it was very 
comfortable.

2001
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:51,040
So there's some,
there's some innovative stuff out there.

2002
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:53,680
They have a helmet,
a cooler,

2003
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,780
a.
There's a hose that plugs in top of your

2004
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:58,180
helmet and it blow some air in there.
It's a little bit cooler,

2005
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:03,210
but it draws those two things,
draw much amps that the teams don't want

2006
01:29:03,211 --> 01:29:05,160
to use them.
The drivers want to use them,

2007
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,173
but the crew chiefs don't want you to 
draw on that many amps off the rate off 

2008
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:08,934
the alternator.
They want to use amps for other things 

2009
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:12,270
that are gonna.
Make the car go faster.

2010
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:13,090
Yeah.
No,

2011
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,070
make you comfortable.
That's why there's no ac.

2012
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,510
Yeah,
I would imagine.

2013
01:29:16,511 --> 01:29:17,830
Yeah,
man.

2014
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:18,963
Now when you think back of on doing all 
that stuff that you did do and think 

2015
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:25,534
about those kinds of races and think 
about all the endurance and all the 

2016
01:29:28,331 --> 01:29:31,660
different aspects of it,
does it ever seem kind of crazy that you

2017
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:32,494
did it?

2018
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:34,740
Yeah.
Like that I,

2019
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,290
that I raised.

2020
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:38,450
Yeah.
I mean now that you're not racing,

2021
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,570
like whoa,
what a wild way to make a living.

2022
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,150
Yeah.
Like I can't believe it happened to me.

2023
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:45,950
No shit.
Like,

2024
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:50,570
um,
my dad was a sort of this

2025
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:52,023
um,

2026
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:58,120
invincible.
He wrote and I wanted to do what he did.

2027
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:01,430
I didn't think I was going to get to do 
that.

2028
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,820
When I started doing it,
I was thinking to myself,

2029
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:08,090
I can't believe this is happening to me.
When I started to,

2030
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:09,740
when I won a few races,
I never,

2031
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:10,723
man,
I never.

2032
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:13,820
So when I was in,
when I was 20 years old,

2033
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:14,750
I wasn't thinking,
man,

2034
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:17,300
don't be a champion.
I'm a win 20 races.

2035
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,240
I'm a win 50 races.
I'm going to kick some ass.

2036
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:21,343
I was thinking,
I sure would love to do this and pay my 

2037
01:30:23,391 --> 01:30:24,224
bills.
I w I would love to do this just for a 

2038
01:30:26,211 --> 01:30:27,980
living,
not have to work.

2039
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:30,950
I'm changing oil.
It wasn't the best,

2040
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,780
you know,
it wasn't where I wanted to be.

2041
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,510
A workinG in a service department was 
fun,

2042
01:30:35,511 --> 01:30:36,344
but damn,
I wanted to be a race car driver and so 

2043
01:30:39,051 --> 01:30:41,300
when I made it,
I didn't really.

2044
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,520
I wanted to win,
but damn,

2045
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:48,080
I just want to be able to make money to 
afford to do it for a living in him.

2046
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:50,710
That's all I ever wanted.
So the winds,

2047
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:51,573
they turn 500 words and all that shit 
was a bonus and when I look back on it 

2048
01:30:55,611 --> 01:30:56,391
now,
I'm like,

2049
01:30:56,391 --> 01:30:56,920
man,
I,

2050
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:58,700
I was so lucky.
Holy cow.

2051
01:30:58,701 --> 01:31:01,940
Was I lucky to do what we did and do 
what I did and when,

2052
01:31:01,941 --> 01:31:02,960
what I did and

2053
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,580
very lucky.
Do you think you had such great success?

2054
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:10,990
Not just because obviously your dad is 
one of the greatest of all time,

2055
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:15,730
but also because your love for it was 
what propelled you.

2056
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:19,150
It wasn't trying to seek fame or 
fortune,

2057
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,220
it just,
you just truly love racing.

2058
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,350
And that's why you became so great at 
it.

2059
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,670
Yeah.
My dad's a,

2060
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:28,150
the link to my father opened up a shit 
ton of doors for me.

2061
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:32,980
Opened up so many opportunities for me.
I'll even today,

2062
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:33,933
um,
it made my path much easier than some 

2063
01:31:36,011 --> 01:31:38,650
other fellows that I know.
Um,

2064
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:43,540
but I think that my,
my passion for it and my,

2065
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:44,771
uh,
yeah,

2066
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:46,720
my love for it,
my love for its history,

2067
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:51,040
my wanting for it to be healthy,
the sport,

2068
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,033
uh,
all those things is what probably made 

2069
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,940
me make good decisions as I went along,
you know,

2070
01:31:57,010 --> 01:31:57,843
and when I would talk or get in a 
position to make a comment or say 

2071
01:32:01,361 --> 01:32:02,194
something,
I always tried to think about how that 

2072
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,130
would represent the sport.
Um,

2073
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,233
I didn't understand what building a 
brand meant until way too late in my 

2074
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,100
career.
Good.

2075
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:12,483
Yeah.

2076
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:16,170
Concentrating on that.
It's always a mess.

2077
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:17,773
No,
I mean I wished I'd known a little bit 

2078
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:19,714
about trying to bring my brand and I 
wouldn't have been such a hard ass and 

2079
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:23,800
hard to work with a lot of times like 
there's been,

2080
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,693
there were some sponsors I loved and I 
did everything they wanted and there 

2081
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:31,780
were some that I just weren't,
I wasn't as good as I should have been,

2082
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,370
you know,
I wasn't,

2083
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,051
uh,
you know,

2084
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:35,884
I have regrets,
but I'm just saying like I did as I was 

2085
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:42,130
going through this career.
I wasn't thinking about me,

2086
01:32:42,131 --> 01:32:42,964
me,
me.

2087
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,680
I didn't even know how to build my own 
brand.

2088
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:45,514
I didn't know what that meant.
I waS thinking about a man that I love 

2089
01:32:48,111 --> 01:32:49,090
this.
This is great.

2090
01:32:49,091 --> 01:32:51,490
I can't believe I get to do this.
I can't believe I'm here.

2091
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:54,850
I can't believe I'm racing here racing 
this person doing,

2092
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:56,980
driving this car,
got this sponsor shit.

2093
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,873
You knoW,
this,

2094
01:32:58,150 --> 01:33:01,270
everything.
Everything was the best of the best.

2095
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:03,550
You know,
I had had great sponsors,

2096
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:05,290
awesome,
awesome equipment.

2097
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:08,320
Um,
everybody always nice,

2098
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,251
you know.
hey,

2099
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:10,870
how you doing?
Everybody's so nice.

2100
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,130
My wife just hates that because 
everywhere I go I'm like,

2101
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:16,470
everybody's so nice.
How has this?

2102
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,730
But they were so nice.
She goes,

2103
01:33:17,731 --> 01:33:19,380
everybody's nice to you.
You know,

2104
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:21,000
she,
it so bent out of shape.

2105
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:24,900
She get mad at that college.
She says she's,

2106
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,510
I don't know,
she just says you're normal people.

2107
01:33:27,511 --> 01:33:29,680
We don't get everybody nice.
Yeah.

2108
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:33,420
You live in a different world.
That is interesting.

2109
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:34,313
Yeah.
He live in this world where everybody's 

2110
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:37,770
happened to me.
Like a hot chick.

2111
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,793
Yeah.

2112
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,410
Kinda.
Yeah.

2113
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:43,510
Write me like you're a hot chick.
Yeah.

2114
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:48,790
Where you go.
It's kind of similar,

2115
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:54,240
I suppose.
I guess what the world's like.

2116
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:56,460
Everywhere they go.
Everybody loves him.

2117
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:57,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

2118
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,310
People are super,
super excited to see him.

2119
01:33:59,311 --> 01:34:00,144
Yeah.
They know there's danger out there and 

2120
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:02,184
some of these men,
but everybody's very friendly to the 

2121
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,130
right.
Yeah,

2122
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,173
very similar,
but a large lady with the unfortunate 

2123
01:34:08,461 --> 01:34:10,340
looks so has a different view of that.

2124
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,020
Yes.
Yeah.

2125
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:14,780
Yeah.
Um,

2126
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,700
how much did you learn about racing from
your dad?

2127
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,740
Hardly nothing,
man.

2128
01:34:20,741 --> 01:34:21,574
I mean we uh,
obligate asked all the time what your 

2129
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,284
dad taught you about x,
y and z and we never talked about race 

2130
01:34:28,441 --> 01:34:31,450
and I'm really never.
Wow.

2131
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,343
Yeah.
We never talked about reason mind you 

2132
01:34:33,941 --> 01:34:35,680
started racing professionally?
Yeah.

2133
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:36,940
Wow.
Yeah,

2134
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,590
we never did.
Um,

2135
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:44,120
he was always a don't,
you know,

2136
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:45,753
finished.
He was so worried that me and kelly 

2137
01:34:48,791 --> 01:34:51,460
wouldn't finish school that we would 
give up on school.

2138
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:55,630
He gave up on school is an eighth grader
at 16 years old when he was 16 in eighth

2139
01:34:55,631 --> 01:34:58,280
grade and quit and never finished high 
school.

2140
01:34:58,281 --> 01:35:00,200
Never got no ged,
nothing.

2141
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,980
And people would come to him and say,
are people would talk about him,

2142
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:09,530
um,
even while he was alive and ever since.

2143
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,720
And uh,
say,

2144
01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:15,740
look what this guy made of himself 
having quit the eighth grade.

2145
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:19,130
That's awesome.
And he always hated that.

2146
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:20,910
That was embarrassing,
uh,

2147
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,860
for people to,
you know,

2148
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:23,743
he was embarrassed that he quit.
He knoWed how bad it disappointed his 

2149
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,493
own father.
So he was always like worried about 

2150
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:32,450
where I was,
who I was hanging out with,

2151
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:35,150
were there,
I was doing my homework.

2152
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,800
And then even when I started racing,
it was who I was hanging out with,

2153
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:42,650
what I was doing with my free time,
what I was focusing on,

2154
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,150
whether I was,
you know,

2155
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:45,310
thinking about,
you know,

2156
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,153
what I was,
whether I was on time for sponsor 

2157
01:35:48,801 --> 01:35:52,550
appearances and never is it drive this 
corner.

2158
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:54,410
This is,
I get around this racetrack.

2159
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:55,693
He never talked about this stuff.
It was always the person not being a 

2160
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:01,010
man,
being bright,

2161
01:36:01,190 --> 01:36:03,080
being good to people,
being on time,

2162
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:07,880
being ready to work,
a looking your best.

2163
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:10,670
Um,
general,

2164
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:13,700
you know,
morals and values.

2165
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:14,533
He didn't,
we never sit down and talked about 

2166
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:17,174
racing like I'm going to show you how to
get around this corner and this is how 

2167
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:21,950
you shift and shit like that.
Well,

2168
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:25,040
in that respect it was probably 
brilliant of them because look,

2169
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:30,070
the championships came and you also 
turned out to be a great man.

2170
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,300
Thanks.
I appreciate you saying that.

2171
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:36,140
I uh,
I don't know.

2172
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,753
I always felt like that when I was 
younger I kind of let my father down 

2173
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:41,954
because there was this one time I was 
probably 12 years old and there was 

2174
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:47,840
this,
me and my buddy,

2175
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,190
we were going to play,
man,

2176
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,090
we're here.
We're outside.

2177
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:50,924
We're going to play outside.
My dad's standing over there and there 

2178
01:36:53,091 --> 01:36:55,880
was a bucket full of shit and he's like,
hey,

2179
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,370
come here.
And pope junior pick that bucket up,

2180
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,233
move it over here.
And I went over there and tried to pick 

2181
01:37:00,831 --> 01:37:02,150
it up and I was like,
I can't lift it.

2182
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:05,810
And he got so pissed off at me because 
they knew I didn't try.

2183
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,660
And he got,
he said to my buddy ryan,

2184
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:09,740
he was ryan,
come here,

2185
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:11,390
pick the bucket up and take it over 
there.

2186
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:15,260
And he turned around and gave me this 
look of pure fricking disappointment.

2187
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,460
And I felt like that set the tone for 
our relationship.

2188
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:22,070
Wow.
For one bucket.

2189
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:24,710
I know,
I feel like that that was the,

2190
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,953
uh,
that was our relationship in a nutshell 

2191
01:37:29,181 --> 01:37:33,490
for most of my teenage years.
You know,

2192
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,200
he looked at me as,
you know,

2193
01:37:36,201 --> 01:37:37,410
I don't know what he's going to mount 
to.

2194
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:40,520
I don't know what this gives you to do.
I don't know what,

2195
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,593
what,
you know,

2196
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:42,463
what skills he has or what is it you 
don't ever get his act together or 

2197
01:37:45,351 --> 01:37:46,940
whether he's ever going to figure 
himself out,

2198
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:47,774
you know.
And I probably didn't give him much 

2199
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:51,440
reason to think different.

2200
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,140
Um,
but then when we got,

2201
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,080
when I started racing,
um,

2202
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:02,370
when I started racing late models,
I ran 159 races and he never came to one

2203
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:05,280
a through 94,
95,

2204
01:38:05,281 --> 01:38:06,270
96,
97.

2205
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:07,104
I raced at myrtle beach,
South Carolina every weekend and he 

2206
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:10,014
never once came down there to watch me 
and so he didn't know whether I was a 

2207
01:38:13,531 --> 01:38:15,930
good race car driver or a bad race car 
driver.

2208
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:17,700
He didn't know whether I was,
you know,

2209
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,940
working on my car or understanding how 
they,

2210
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:21,923
you know,
what,

2211
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:22,883
what,
how,

2212
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,840
how to build the car,
fix the car.

2213
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,920
And when I would do good I'd come home 
and I'd have a trophy and I'd say,

2214
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:29,820
hey man,
I want.

2215
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:30,361
And he'd go,
well,

2216
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:33,450
who wasn't there?
And I'm like,

2217
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,313
shit.

2218
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,073
He really did the first.
I remember coming home With the trophy 

2219
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,240
and I could not wait until he,
he would walk.

2220
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:44,900
I kept my car in this,
uh,

2221
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,833
in this building that was his.
And he put all his deer head up there 

2222
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:51,600
and call it a deer hit shop.
I'm talking 35,

2223
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,610
40 minutes in this place,
a couple of elk.

2224
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:55,223
And uh,
he'd come in here every monday morning 

2225
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:00,960
before lunch.
And I had that trophy sitting up.

2226
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,050
We'd brought it home and it was right in
view.

2227
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:04,963
Soon as he walks in,
I got the car working on my car and he 

2228
01:39:08,791 --> 01:39:11,460
comes in there and I'm like,
I'm like,

2229
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:14,130
he's like,
so you want,

2230
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,090
huh?
He's a trophy.

2231
01:39:15,091 --> 01:39:15,924
I was like,
yeah,

2232
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,150
we did.
And he's like such and such,

2233
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:21,240
must have not been there because there 
was this one guy and then robert,

2234
01:39:21,241 --> 01:39:23,550
pat used to beat us all the time and he 
goes,

2235
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:24,660
robert bus not been there.

2236
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,261
I was like,
no,

2237
01:39:25,261 --> 01:39:26,460
he wasn't,
he wasn't there.

2238
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,790
I was so pissed off,
man.

2239
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,613
I finally won a damn race.
I thought that he was going to come in 

2240
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:35,490
there and slap me on the back and man,
when,

2241
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,353
you know,
give me an,

2242
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:41,480
give me a good talk and give you more 
motivation that he didn't do that.

2243
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:44,610
I don't think so.
I don't think it did.

2244
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,900
I think it made me want to.
It did not make me want to win more.

2245
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,040
Um,
but then one day,

2246
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:58,190
so right around the end of 1997,
I was out of money.

2247
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:00,030
He was like,
hey,

2248
01:40:00,031 --> 01:40:01,520
you know,
you're out of money and race.

2249
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:02,850
I was like,
shit,

2250
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,010
my life is coming to an end.
As far as I know it.

2251
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,170
I'm not going to,
I guess my racing career,

2252
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:08,220
this is,
it is.

2253
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:09,900
It's coming to an end in 1997.

2254
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:15,120
Um,
he was sitting down and talking to a.

2255
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,073
He had a car that races in the xfinity 
series that I told you about on 

2256
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:21,054
saturdays and he,
his driver was leaving to go to a cup 

2257
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,030
car and he was talking to his best 
friend.

2258
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:31,170
Tony senior is the guy's name that 
actually crew chiefs that car.

2259
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:32,004
And he's like,
who we're going to get to drive this 

2260
01:40:33,481 --> 01:40:34,980
thing.
Who should we get?

2261
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:37,380
We got to hire a driver.
And tommy senior said,

2262
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:38,850
why don't you put dale junior and there 
he goes,

2263
01:40:38,851 --> 01:40:41,640
what are you serious?
You really think so?

2264
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:42,533
He's like,
you're going to spend a little money on 

2265
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:45,270
this car.
why don't you spend it on your own kid?

2266
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:46,940
You know,
why don't you just put may,

2267
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,760
I can,
I can probably make a driver out of him.

2268
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,800
Tony senior says so and so.
They made the decision to put me in this

2269
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,140
car,
in the xfinity series.

2270
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:01,960
You'd think that dad would come tell me 
or we would have press conference.

2271
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:05,530
Not be a press release.
At least I walked into.

2272
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,780
This is the month before the season 
starts.

2273
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,360
I think I'm out of or I think I'm out of
racing.

2274
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:11,640
Right?
I ain't been,

2275
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:12,483
I ain't even talked to anybody about 
what I'm racing or if I'm racing in a 

2276
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,010
couple months.
I think that it's dried up.

2277
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:22,630
Opportunities are gone.
I'll walk into the shop to get something

2278
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:27,040
where tony and seniors car tony seniors 
race car was and my name was on the roof

2279
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,430
and I was like,
I thought it was a joke,

2280
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:34,870
like a mean joke or a prank.
And they were laughing tony senior and,

2281
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,733
and uh,
some of the guys in shop laughing and 

2282
01:41:37,121 --> 01:41:37,571
I'm like,
man,

2283
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:41,710
that's messed up man.
Y'all are dicks for putting that name on

2284
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:43,100
there to say no.
It's funny in there.

2285
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:45,130
And they were like,
it's true,

2286
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:45,970
man.
I was like,

2287
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:49,420
you mean I'm a race car?
I'm racing this car.

2288
01:41:49,421 --> 01:41:50,350
And they were like,
yeah.

2289
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:51,940
I was like,
really?

2290
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:56,650
And uh,
I mean obviously I was thrilled,

2291
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,431
like,
man,

2292
01:41:57,431 --> 01:41:59,650
I couldn't believe it,
but this is the way I found out,

2293
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:03,790
not from my own dad.
And I'm like,

2294
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:05,440
dad,
I'm racing the car.

2295
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:08,650
Yep.
I mean like days later when I see him,

2296
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,500
I'm like,
so I'm going to race the car.

2297
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:11,170
And he's like,
yep,

2298
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,010
yep,
sure.

2299
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:17,080
Birgit get ready and said yeah.
And I mean it waS,

2300
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:20,170
it.
He was the strangest dude when it came.

2301
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:21,910
He didn't,
he didn't really.

2302
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,853
But once,
so I started racing that car and I had 

2303
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:29,320
had great success.
We won six or seven races the first year

2304
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:30,154
we won another six or seven races the 
second year of championships in both 

2305
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:33,641
seasons.
So,

2306
01:42:33,641 --> 01:42:34,474
I mean,
the choice to put me in that car worked 

2307
01:42:35,441 --> 01:42:38,290
out better than he probably ever 
imagined,

2308
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,993
ever in 159 and late model races that I 
ran from 94 to 97 and one slash four in 

2309
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,770
159 late model races I won for.

2310
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:48,963
So he put me in this car on a whim and a
prayer and we ended up winning the 

2311
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:55,960
championship two in a row.
So he is thinking,

2312
01:42:55,990 --> 01:43:00,130
damn,
this little shit can drive a car.

2313
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,850
And that's when our relationship 
completely changed.

2314
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,320
That's when I hit his arm around me.
We were doing shit together.

2315
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:10,060
We were doing,
we were doing,

2316
01:43:10,061 --> 01:43:12,220
we had sponsored deals and promotions 
together.

2317
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,233
We were doing photo shoots together.
I saw him all the time and we talked 

2318
01:43:16,811 --> 01:43:17,950
about all kinds of,
you know,

2319
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:21,970
we talked about life girls and,
and everything,

2320
01:43:21,971 --> 01:43:22,631
but racing,
you know,

2321
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:24,490
we didn't talk about race in much but 
just fine.

2322
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:27,400
But um,
it was awesome.

2323
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:30,880
And so not eight 99 and in 2000 I went 
to cup.

2324
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,590
He,
he,

2325
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:36,220
he built a team around me.
We had budweiser come in for $10,000,000

2326
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:37,054
a year,
which was the biggest sponsorship 

2327
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:41,040
anybody had and at that time,
um,

2328
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,210
and uh,
so.

2329
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:45,000
And then he got killed in 2000.
One and two.

2330
01:43:45,001 --> 01:43:47,440
Started the season in daytona 500.
So those three years,

2331
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,221
98,
99,

2332
01:43:48,221 --> 01:43:51,680
2000 were as good as it could get.
Wow.

2333
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:52,583
Yeah.

2334
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:56,143
That must have been amazing.
It must have been amazing for you to 

2335
01:43:58,401 --> 01:43:59,270
turn that corner.

2336
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,900
Yeah.
It was like a light switch he went from.

2337
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,590
He went from not really engaging with 
me.

2338
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,390
Me not a comfortable around him feeling 
ashamed.

2339
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:13,790
I'm not.
May not measuring up.

2340
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,330
He's because he's 10 foot tall,
cowboy boots,

2341
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:19,490
black hat,
tougher and shit.

2342
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:22,130
Not gonna.
Intimidate her.

2343
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:27,160
That was his nickname and I was blonde.
Pale short as hell.

2344
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:32,810
Not a muscle on me and had accomplished 
nothing,

2345
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:35,370
you know?
And so it.

2346
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,343
But it overnight.
It was like completely changed when we 

2347
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:43,310
started running great and people were 
coming up to me,

2348
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:45,650
I'm like,
dude,

2349
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,540
you're freaking.
You're doing awesome.

2350
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,400
And you know,
and he's.

2351
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,280
And he was a.
He was really happy with that.

2352
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:53,143
He was pretty proud.
It's crazy that he never talked to you 

2353
01:44:55,731 --> 01:44:56,600
about race.
No.

2354
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,430
That's just so strange.
Him.

2355
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:03,050
I can't imagine that was one.
It was only one time that he did that.

2356
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,230
We were at a track called bristol,
Tennessee.

2357
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,740
We were,
we were at a track in bristol,

2358
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:08,010
Tennessee,
uh,

2359
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:12,350
it's a half mile high banked racetrack 
and we run 15 second laps around there.

2360
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:13,184
It's really fast and it's,
it's kind of technical and tough to get 

2361
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:16,940
around.
Um,

2362
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,620
and I had been raised.
I'm out there practicing and I wasn't,

2363
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:25,500
I wasn't doing it right.
And he got up on the uh,

2364
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:26,773
he got up on one of the haulers and got 
on the radio and started talking to me 

2365
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,150
and he was like,
hey man,

2366
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,270
I'm going to tell you how to drive it.
And so this one day,

2367
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,780
one time in this one practice for about 
five minutes,

2368
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:40,003
he's like,
I'm gonna tell you how to drive his 

2369
01:45:40,971 --> 01:45:42,790
track.
So I'm out there driving and um,

2370
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:45,770
when he's like lift right here and I 
lift and he getting the gas,

2371
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:46,604
okay,
I'm turning the area and he's just 

2372
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:48,494
telling me how to drive the track.
And that was the only time he ever did 

2373
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:54,310
that to just think of how much it would 
improve.

2374
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,450
I know it really helped me there that 
day.

2375
01:45:56,870 --> 01:46:00,170
I mean like his,
like when he told me how to do it,

2376
01:46:00,171 --> 01:46:01,400
I'm like,
holy shit,

2377
01:46:01,401 --> 01:46:02,234
this is what I would have never thought 
of doing it this way and this is way 

2378
01:46:04,431 --> 01:46:06,860
better.
So yeah,

2379
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,380
maybe you could have given me a few more
tips on some things.

2380
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,290
I mean,
come on man.

2381
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,283
That's how that has to be so crazy 
because that's your profession or your 

2382
01:46:17,111 --> 01:46:18,610
dad is a superhero.

2383
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:22,230
Well,
I think that I finally made it a cup and

2384
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:23,933
I think had he lived,
he would have been in my ear all those 

2385
01:46:27,691 --> 01:46:28,650
years,
you know,

2386
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:29,521
do this,
do this,

2387
01:46:29,521 --> 01:46:31,590
don't do this.
This is the best decision today.

2388
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:33,683
So maybe he just didn't,
wasn't in a hurry to do it because he 

2389
01:46:35,611 --> 01:46:37,290
didn't know that he wasn't going to be 
around for it,

2390
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:38,663
you know,
how hard was it to race after he was 

2391
01:46:40,831 --> 01:46:45,270
gone?
I thought about whether I should quit or

2392
01:46:45,271 --> 01:46:46,460
not.
Um,

2393
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,650
you know,
I probably,

2394
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:51,513
if it hadn't paid a lot of money and I 
didn't have partners and people that 

2395
01:46:57,211 --> 01:47:01,410
were depending on me are counting on me,
I probably could have easily walked away

2396
01:47:01,411 --> 01:47:02,244
from it.
But we had a great partner in budweiser 

2397
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:09,740
that was incredibly supportive.
Um,

2398
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:11,913
I had a lucrative opportunity in front 
of me personally to be a be a race car 

2399
01:47:15,341 --> 01:47:16,174
driver for as long as I wanted to,
which I wanted and I just had to go 

2400
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:23,890
through missing him really bad for a few
months.

2401
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:24,670
You know,
I had to,

2402
01:47:24,670 --> 01:47:27,460
I had to go to the race track and 
everywhere I looked,

2403
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:28,630
you know,
there's dad,

2404
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:31,990
there were fans morning,

2405
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:33,133
uh,

2406
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:37,900
there were signs and paintings and 
things,

2407
01:47:37,901 --> 01:47:38,734
you know,
there was just markings and 

2408
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,700
acknowledgements and just shit 
everywhere for like a year.

2409
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:45,240
Uh,
and I appreciated it.

2410
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:47,750
I knew why it was like that.
Um,

2411
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:53,310
but it took awhile for me to sort of get
to where I didn't.

2412
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,380
Um,
I was,

2413
01:47:56,381 --> 01:47:58,390
I went,
there was a little period of me,

2414
01:47:58,391 --> 01:48:03,391
the period of time where I was real self
destructive and just like a mad,

2415
01:48:03,491 --> 01:48:05,290
you know,
everything.

2416
01:48:05,291 --> 01:48:08,260
And um,
you know,

2417
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,610
took me awhile to calm down and get to 
work,

2418
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,570
you know,
for,

2419
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,430
for,
for awhile there,

2420
01:48:15,431 --> 01:48:17,650
it was just sort of going through the 
motions,

2421
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:20,490
the,
you know,

2422
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:21,363
I mean,
it must have always known mean everyone 

2423
01:48:23,591 --> 01:48:26,170
knows there's dangers involved in racing
cars.

2424
01:48:26,171 --> 01:48:27,004
but when it hit someone so close as your
own father that had to change what 

2425
01:48:32,081 --> 01:48:33,400
racing felt like to you.

2426
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:38,293
Yeah,
I'm sure.

2427
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,820
I'm sure it would have completely been a
different experience.

2428
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:42,723
I'm emotionally had that not happened.
Had racing for me would have meant 

2429
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:51,200
something completely different.
Um,

2430
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:54,860
you know,
I just was,

2431
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:56,740
he was in,
he was this,

2432
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:03,040
he was this invincible god that wasn't 
supposed to get hurt,

2433
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:05,090
wasn't supposed to.
I mean,

2434
01:49:05,091 --> 01:49:06,050
he was,
he was,

2435
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:08,840
he was supposed to get hurt and drive 
hurt and be tough.

2436
01:49:08,841 --> 01:49:09,674
And um,
he wasn't supposed to get killed and 

2437
01:49:13,311 --> 01:49:15,050
leave us all,
you know,

2438
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:16,880
he left the whole sport,
you know,

2439
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:18,980
and,
and no one knew what to do.

2440
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:21,320
Like that was like,
the whole sport was sitting there going,

2441
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:23,360
oh shit,
what do we do?

2442
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:27,260
You know,
he was the guy for everyone.

2443
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:30,710
And even in even the competitors,
you know,

2444
01:49:30,711 --> 01:49:32,660
looked up to him like he was the,
yeah,

2445
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:34,430
like that,
that's the man.

2446
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:35,353
And uh,
so it was tough on the whole sport to 

2447
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,820
big giant void for the whole sport.

2448
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:42,723
Um,

2449
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,950
but I,
you know,

2450
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:49,360
we just uh,
huddled together,

2451
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:52,450
me and my team in our company,
we are rice for my dad's company,

2452
01:49:52,451 --> 01:49:54,400
so that whole company kinda just kinda 
held,

2453
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:57,070
held itself together and everybody kinda
pulled,

2454
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:57,933
pulled together and worked our way 
through it that first year and 

2455
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:01,540
[inaudible] just that year,
you know,

2456
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,300
that he was killed now that was just a 
kind of a tough year.

2457
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:08,230
I don't even really remember anything 
much about What happened that year.

2458
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:11,800
Um,
won a couple races,

2459
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:13,720
uh,
but it was,

2460
01:50:13,721 --> 01:50:14,680
uh,
otherwise,

2461
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:16,960
you know,
the races where we didn't win.

2462
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:21,480
I can't even,
I don't even remember much about them,

2463
01:50:21,481 --> 01:50:23,200
you know,
just retaining too much from.

2464
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,910
It was just kind of a daze,
you know?

2465
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,250
Oh,
four was a great year.

2466
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:29,350
I think we kind of finally,
we're coming out of the funk,

2467
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:30,453
you know,
around 2004 kind of coming out of the 

2468
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:33,244
cloud of that.

2469
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:39,150
I would imagine that being a race car 
driver and having your dad be who he was

2470
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:41,433
always carried a lot of weight.
But did it carry more weight after he 

2471
01:50:44,921 --> 01:50:46,750
was gone with her more eyes on you?

2472
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,760
Yeah,
I thought so.

2473
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:49,080
Um,
you knoW,

2474
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:51,690
I thought he,
he was tough.

2475
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,340
He knew who he was to the sport and he 
knew,

2476
01:50:57,990 --> 01:51:02,990
he knew that he carried,
he carried a big massive fan base and he

2477
01:51:03,631 --> 01:51:06,150
knew that people listen to when he spoke
and all those things.

2478
01:51:06,151 --> 01:51:08,920
And so when he was gone,
I think some people are,

2479
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:12,960
some people kind of looked at me to try 
to carry that same load and even be that

2480
01:51:12,961 --> 01:51:14,850
same person and I just wasn't going to 
do it.

2481
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,190
Um,
I was like,

2482
01:51:17,191 --> 01:51:18,360
man,
I'm going to be me.

2483
01:51:18,361 --> 01:51:20,400
I'm going to be the pr,
you know,

2484
01:51:20,401 --> 01:51:22,640
like I said he was,
he's this template,

2485
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:27,650
tall black hat and I'm,
I'm this short scrawny pail kid.

2486
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,730
You know,
I was,

2487
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:30,893
I couldn't be who he was,
I'd have been faking it and I couldn't 

2488
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,280
be the intimidator,
you know,

2489
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,593
so I just have always,
ever since then been me and if that's 

2490
01:51:42,181 --> 01:51:43,320
good,
if you'd like that.

2491
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:45,570
Um,
great.

2492
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:49,230
Uh,
I think I've been relatable,

2493
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,910
honest,
genuine,

2494
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:56,790
and the fan base that I gained when,
when he passed away,

2495
01:51:56,791 --> 01:51:57,624
I thought we nurtured that and grew that
and I think we did a lot of great 

2496
01:52:00,151 --> 01:52:01,140
things,
uh,

2497
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,960
and,
and outside the sport to,

2498
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:05,760
uh,
to do that.

2499
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,763
Um,
so I'm kind of proud of all those 

2500
01:52:09,721 --> 01:52:13,230
things.
I thought I handled that well.

2501
01:52:13,590 --> 01:52:18,420
I'm considering there are a lot of 
different avenues to go at that time and

2502
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:19,343
I think I chose some good ones and 
certainly probably could have made some 

2503
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:27,291
different decisions and have regrets.
But for the most part I was able to,

2504
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:30,630
you know,
add to his legacy a little bit.

2505
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,670
That was something that was important to
me.

2506
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:35,490
I didn't go out there and win 90 day.
I'm racist.

2507
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:39,630
I didn't win seven championships,
but I didn't hurt his legacy.

2508
01:52:39,631 --> 01:52:41,520
I added to it,
uh,

2509
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:44,540
made a lot of people happy.
Uh,

2510
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:46,040
there was an on the tracK,

2511
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:49,160
you know,
that was good for a lot of people.

2512
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:51,980
Deal.
You got a great perspective.

2513
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:55,010
Thanks.
Really do any book.

2514
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:59,270
It's called racing to the finish.
It's out now.

2515
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:01,430
Go get it folks.
Thanks.

2516
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,060
Thank you,

2517

I appreciate you having me.
Appreciate you being here.

2519
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:05,870
Great to meet you.
Great to meet you too.

2520
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:06,890
Thank you.
We should do a hunt.

2521
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:08,073
Nice.
Let's do it.

2522
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,680
Let's do it.
You name it.
