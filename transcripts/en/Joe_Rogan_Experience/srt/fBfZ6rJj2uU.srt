1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,880
You know what's amazing is,

3
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:03,630
um,

4
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,350
how well kids can
manipulate their body to my,

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,560
my daughter can do a,

6
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,221
what is that called?

7
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:09,390
When you put your feet on the ground,

8
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,130
your back bends and you put your hand.

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,641
Yeah,

10
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:11,971
right there.

11
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,730
A little spines are so
incredibly flexible and you know,

12
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,490
and she can go up on their
tippy toes and she's only six.

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,020
She can also climb a rope.

14
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,340
I have a rope in my garage.

15
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,350
You've seen my garage is
preeclampsia the only great,

16
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,510
she grabs that rub and climbs
all the way to the top.

17
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,680
And I was watching her do that.

18
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:25,891
I was like,

19
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,300
how many women can do that?

20
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,400
Like she's a tiny little girl.

21
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,234
She's six.

22
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,440
Like how many grown women can support
their own weight like that and climb a

23
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:34,710
budge?

24
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,580
Grown man can't do it.

25
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:35,911
No.

26
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,630
Most my,

27
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,931
yeah,

28
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:37,550
most grown men,

29
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,770
they couldn't climb a rope if their
life actually dependent on it.

30
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,431
Yeah.

31
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,264
And that's sad.

32
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,103
It is sad.

33
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,140
And that's one of the best
things I ever did for my kid.

34
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,480
I just hung a rope in
our foyer of our house.

35
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,430
We had like one of those
cargo architecturally designed
houses that the kitchen

36
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,900
went up three fours,

37
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,734
you know,

38
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,490
with uh,

39
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:56,910
like a,

40
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,270
uh,

41
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,510
uh,

42
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,530
by level type thing,

43
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,433
split level.

44
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,680
And uh,

45
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,090
took my life in my own
hands with my drill.

46
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,130
Tried to hang that damn broke man.

47
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,390
I tied myself a with my Jujitsu about and
was leaning over the back and he tried

48
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,620
to find a,

49
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,720
a beam with a beam finder and the,

50
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,210
you know,

51
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,043
got the drill.

52
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,050
This is all while they actually
wife was out of the house.

53
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,640
She comes home,

54
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,660
she has this rope hanging down in the
middle of her foyer by our kitchen.

55
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,973
And uh,

56
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,700
you know,

57
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,810
I got both kids climbing.

58
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,730
That rope is at the beginning
of the divorce proceedings.

59
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,850
Probably my whole,

60
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,190
for the moment I said I do with the
beginning of the divorce proceeding.

61
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,720
That's how it works.

62
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,950
That's how it works.

63
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:37,050
Sometimes it's just the
idea of getting married,

64
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,290
let's,

65
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,240
we're going to be normal.

66
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,470
We're going to be like everybody else.

67
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:41,340
We're going to get married.

68
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,090
Well,

69
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,890
it'll work out once
we're married or workout.

70
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,031
It never does,

71
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,540
man.

72
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,890
I preferred and marriage.

73
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,783
Right.

74
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,010
And unmarried is where I have my money.

75
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,940
She has hers,

76
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,110
I got my credit card,

77
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,973
she has hers,

78
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,740
I have my possessions,

79
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,574
she has hers.

80
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,020
I don't tell her what to do.

81
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,340
She doesn't tell me what to do.

82
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,641
You know,

83
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,570
it's like an agreement.

84
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,460
We're together because
we want to be together.

85
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,330
We don't need a government agency to
tell us that we can live together and we

86
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,290
definitely don't need a government agency
telling us that we're allowed to be a

87
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,100
partner.

88
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,251
Well,

89
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,780
that doesn't sound very romantic stuff.

90
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,810
I don't know what kind of
woman's can accept that,

91
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:16,710
but I'll tell you right now,

92
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,850
I am not going to,

93
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,541
I'll tell you right now,

94
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:18,841
Steve,

95
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,950
I want a traditional marriage.

96
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,200
I know we won't be able to tell
my friends and I'm married.

97
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,071
That's the other thing.

98
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,540
Chicks love to tell their
friends who married,

99
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,920
very few guys like you're excited to tell
their friends they're getting married.

100
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,341
Like,

101
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:29,671
see,

102
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,504
I got her.

103
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,890
She's marrying me.

104
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,760
I did it.

105
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,450
You know,

106
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,931
they go,

107
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,171
Yay,

108
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:34,471
we're good.

109
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,131
We're getting married.

110
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:35,281
Like,

111
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:35,521
well,

112
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,390
congratulations.

113
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,650
But it's never like this
milestone accomplishment.

114
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:40,831
Like,

115
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,071
wow,

116
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,060
you pulled it off,

117
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,871
but a girl will like,

118
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,830
look,

119
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,311
I'm kidding me.

120
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:44,630
Like,

121
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,660
oh my God,

122
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,040
I can't believe in girls.

123
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,000
They get so excited.

124
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,080
I'm so happy for you.

125
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,914
They'll hug.

126
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,260
It's a complete different
experience for the male.

127
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,030
Women have got it in their head,

128
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,350
which some I should say because
of movies and of the stories.

129
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,370
You know this romantic happily
ever after idea that they have to,

130
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,090
they have to get legally bound.

131
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,073
They don't think of it as,

132
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,800
you know,

133
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,760
it's you.

134
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,790
The way you look at it
as so harsh and so jaded.

135
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,590
It's not a legal contract.

136
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,010
It's,

137
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,240
it's a beautiful agreement and it's you
take your relationship to a next level.

138
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,493
Yeah.

139
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,920
Until you hit those divorce
proceedings and then you realize,

140
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,401
oh,

141
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,810
this is a contract.

142
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,150
Like this is a legal
contract with the state,

143
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,570
and now I've got to bring in lawyers and
we've got to figure out how to fucking

144
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:33,040
divvy up my money and the lawyers
get a giant chunk of that action.

145
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,540
That's the big scam.

146
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,090
That's what's when I'm Phil Hartman,

147
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,560
before his wife killed him,

148
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,030
when he was trying to get divorced,

149
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,110
shot him in his sleep.

150
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,153
He um,

151
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,510
was ranting to me,

152
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,430
but I go just fucking give
her half and he was like,

153
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,091
it's not a half.

154
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,924
That's the thing.

155
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,050
It's a third because the
lawyers get a third too.

156
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,370
You'll lose two thirds.

157
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,500
It's not half pretty much man.

158
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,540
It was just steam it as well.

159
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,460
I like done the non marriage,

160
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,790
you know,

161
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,110
that's nice than non marriage.

162
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,970
The line keeps their own personality and
you don't like just get all wrapped up.

163
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,971
See this Guy Jamie was showing me
these yesterday's Russian oligarch 4.5

164
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,630
billion.

165
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,520
I in a divorce.

166
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,241
Of course.

167
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:16,550
I guess when you have billions in Bellin's
is probably not that big of a deal.

168
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:16,980
Yeah,

169
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,330
it's a big deal.

170
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,340
No matter how much money you got,

171
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,240
the idea that some chick is going to be
going off bang another dudes with your

172
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:29,241
money and riding Ferrari's and flying
private jets everywhere and buying castles

173
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,480
all with your cash.

174
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,871
Why?

175
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,800
Because he had sex with her.

176
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,910
I guess they don't have prenups
in Russia or if they do,

177
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,810
he didn't get one.

178
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,201
I mean,

179
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:38,900
he's just maybe thought
it was going to be,

180
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,050
this is going to be different man.

181
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:42,360
Fuck all the other 50% of the
people that could make it.

182
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm not even hedging my bets.

183
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,391
I'm all in.

184
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,300
He pushed all his chips
on the table and you know,

185
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,970
the thing that I think
sours a lot of marriages,

186
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:54,000
and I can speak from experience because
I've been married and divorced three

187
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:54,834
times,

188
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,790
three times,

189
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,310
three times.

190
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,630
You fucking crazy,

191
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,080
man,

192
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,441
man.

193
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,710
I keep going back from Warren.

194
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,020
I finally got smart.

195
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:01,420
You know,

196
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,253
I

197
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,523
pretty crazy.

198
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,300
Wow.

199
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,470
So many of us guys,

200
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,770
we,

201
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,603
we get,

202
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,370
we get the,

203
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,000
uh,

204
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,450
a woman who was the,

205
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,231
what I call it,

206
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:13,064
the girl,

207
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,730
you know,

208
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,530
really fun to be around very,

209
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,070
you know,

210
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,903
feminine,

211
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,003
uh,

212
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,640
just you relate to,

213
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,040
uh,

214
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,180
together as friends
and then what do we do?

215
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,370
We turn around and
change her into a mother,

216
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
you know,

217
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,130
and mother is a whole different animal,

218
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,450
a whole different being
than that girl that,

219
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:34,860
that,

220
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,160
that,

221
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,420
that,

222
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,220
that young girl that was carefree and Yup.

223
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,440
And Fun to be around.

224
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,740
And you go to the movies and you'd go
out and you'd play and you'd just have a

225
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:47,210
great time and all that just goes right
out the window once you turn her into a

226
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:47,491
mother.

227
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,770
And I'm not even talking about kids,

228
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,641
you know,

229
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,110
I've seen plenty of people without kids.

230
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,760
The woman's still becomes the mother.

231
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,860
Oh yeah.

232
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,170
You know,

233
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,310
like a mother substitute.

234
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,631
Well,

235
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,220
they become a dominant role.

236
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,440
The man's decision making
and they sort of Cook,

237
00:05:59,441 --> 00:05:59,710
Cook,

238
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,730
control him in a very motherly way.

239
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,340
I think that becomes very
unattractive to women too.

240
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,690
Like I don't think a lot of women,

241
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,360
like the man that they
didn't like that role.

242
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,661
I mean,

243
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,190
they didn't want to be put into that role.

244
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,550
You know,

245
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,270
a lot of women,

246
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,511
you know,

247
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:11,650
they,

248
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,880
they had like a strong guy
that kind of take care of them.

249
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,320
Right.

250
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,430
Well,

251
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:14,991
I don't know.

252
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,200
I mean,

253
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,430
I wouldn't want to generalize,

254
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:17,250
but the,

255
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,960
what I've seen from the
women that dominate the men,

256
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,231
the,

257
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,450
like the guys that I know with
a woman tells him what to do.

258
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,670
And those guys also have
a hard time getting sex.

259
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,560
Like almost universally,

260
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,000
it's almost,

261
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,910
it's almost like a rule.

262
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,970
Like if the woman dominates and the
woman tells you what to do and the woman

263
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,790
does control your spending and controls,

264
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,770
you know what your hobbies are and tells
you what's going to happen and where

265
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:38,604
are you going to go.

266
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,980
Those guys don't get much sex.

267
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,070
And I don't know if that's related to
like a woman being attracted to a man that

268
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:49,450
she can't control or not attracted
to a man she can control rather well.

269
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,780
The mother doesn't like sex.

270
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,420
The mother is against sex.

271
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,700
And that's what happens so
often in these marriages.

272
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,481
And you know,

273
00:06:56,481 --> 00:07:00,230
I've had a lot of women that
are misuses and you know,

274
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:00,980
they uh,

275
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,960
body workers and man,

276
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,440
when,

277
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,860
you know,

278
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,860
they tell me it's uncanny how many other
male clients will always proposition

279
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,620
and tried to rankle sex out of them,

280
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,800
raising legitimate.

281
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,760
It was like,

282
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,230
I'm not talking about prostitutes.

283
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,591
Right,

284
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:15,831
right,

285
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,130
right.

286
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,360
And I mean it's pretty common.

287
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:17,610
Yeah.

288
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,870
Guys are just sex starved.

289
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,940
Did their relationships,

290
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
their marriages.

291
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,390
But the thing that really used to rankle
me most more than anything was the way

292
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,130
women would not want to be.

293
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,350
They would want to separate
their guys from their,

294
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,621
their,

295
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,454
their friends.

296
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,020
And they really resented the fact that
God has come to two Shitzu trading as it

297
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,710
got the owned it you,

298
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,543
she's at school,

299
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,370
man,

300
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,581
the,

301
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:42,380
the wives and girlfriends would give
the guys such a hard time about gone and

302
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,214
train it.

303
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,210
If anything,

304
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,900
they should be encouraged and they
got to go as much as possible.

305
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,221
And you know,

306
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,900
they pulled these guys out of there and
that's a damn shame to do that to a guy.

307
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,250
It's also damn shame for a guy to pull
his woman out of something that she loves

308
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:58,610
to do.

309
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,301
Oh well yeah,

310
00:07:59,301 --> 00:07:59,930
of course.

311
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,141
I mean,

312
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:00,800
to be fair,

313
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,191
of course,

314
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:01,371
yeah.

315
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:01,561
It's,

316
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,850
it's a terrible thing when people
try to change the person who they're,

317
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,650
they love and control them.

318
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,251
I mean,

319
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,170
could you imagine your
friend doing that to you?

320
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,110
Like a friend going,

321
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,701
come on man,

322
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,840
you're not going to work out.

323
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,130
What are you working out for?

324
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,150
I don't want you working out.

325
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,630
Hey,

326
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,580
I don't want you working out.

327
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,220
You're my friend.

328
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,053
You're coming with me.

329
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,050
And like what?

330
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,790
Like I don't like you camping,

331
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,810
camping,

332
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,370
you know I don't like
you going to ball games.

333
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:22,671
He'd be like,

334
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,950
what the fuck are you talking crazy?

335
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,190
But when that friend happens to be
someone that you have sex with or you're

336
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,250
romantically connected to girlfriend,

337
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:31,761
fiance,

338
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,091
wife,

339
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:32,990
whatever you want to call it,

340
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,300
that person all of a sudden has a some
sort of a role they can dictate like your

341
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,230
actual day,

342
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,340
like dictate what you do,

343
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:44,300
whether it's a guy doing it to a wife or
a girlfriend or a woman doing it to her

344
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,131
husband or her boyfriend.

345
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:49,040
It's a weird thing that people just sort
of accept ed the Ed and it happens so

346
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,960
often and it's always gross.

347
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,000
No wonder that divorces
at its all time highs,

348
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:54,590
right?

349
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,620
Fucking idiots.

350
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,560
All of us to three jobs.

351
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,940
Did you think about on number three
when that one failed and you like,

352
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,751
motherfucker,

353
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,740
what's wrong with me?

354
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:06,000
Why don't I do this three times?

355
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,810
Pretty much.

356
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,560
It was like,

357
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,220
damn you,

358
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,510
man.

359
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,690
I had a lot of shame actually,

360
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,010
and a lot of feelings of

361
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,980
unworthiness or whatever,

362
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:17,490
you know?

363
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,500
I like the feeling of being
a failure and all that,

364
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,090
and then I just realized,

365
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,241
well,

366
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:21,511
you know,

367
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,550
some people just aren't cut out.

368
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,300
I should have never been in
that situation the first.

369
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,633
Okay,

370
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:37,590
okay.
