1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,420
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,550
This is how we begin.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,240
Ready,

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,990
set,

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,800
go.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
The first part of the podcast
is not required listening.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,330
It's essentially commercials,

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,190
but occasionally it becomes entertaining.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,671
In fact,

10
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:19,120
sometimes more entertaining
than the actual podcast itself.

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,350
This is disturbing.

12
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,550
And as we're winging this entire thing
and have no real program for how it's

13
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,810
supposed to run a,

14
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,310
we don't know what to
say when that happens.

15
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,203
Sorry.

16
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,733
Oops,

17
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,840
I took the wheel to me.

18
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:32,381
Hits too,

19
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:32,770
too,

20
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:32,921
too,

21
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,754
too many hands.

22
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,301
Well,

23
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,980
expect one of those shows,

24
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:36,814
ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,240
expect possibly a few oh Brian moments
of this podcast brought to you by

26
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:43,780
kerosene games.

27
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,140
Um,

28
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,640
kerosene.

29
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,970
We're brought to you by a bunch of things.

30
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,570
Um,

31
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,100
but everything we're brought to you by,

32
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,100
we believe in that is our own 100% pledge.

33
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,420
We're never going to tell you dawg shit,

34
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,160
we're never going to sell you
something that's not good.

35
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
We've been offered a lot of different
things that we didn't agree with that

36
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:02,050
neither Brian nor I thought
were interesting or just,

37
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:02,381
you know,

38
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:02,860
stuff that,

39
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,370
it just,

40
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,690
it just didn't seem like it was
something that we should be endorsing.

41
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:08,890
So that's what we're trying to do.

42
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:13,180
We're trying to only endorse shit we
would use and stuff we believe in.

43
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,920
And this kerosene games is a brand new
startup and they have games that they're

44
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:22,921
developing specifically for iPads and
four I iPhones and high end android

45
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,630
devices starting in February.

46
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,020
And what what it is is a lot of the games
like especially like really high end,

47
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,160
big beautiful games,

48
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,420
a lot of them there,

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,670
they start out making him for consoles
or they started out making them for a PC

50
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,040
and then they poured it over to an iPad.

51
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,270
That's not what these guys do.

52
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:48,190
What these guys do is they make bad ass
games right out of the box for iPods and

53
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,240
touchscreen devices.

54
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,750
Um,

55
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,650
all you know,

56
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,633
the,

57
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,290
the,

58
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,290
the various intuitive
controls that they've put into
these games they've put in

59
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,100
and designed for use with an iPad.

60
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,360
So it doesn't feel clunky at all.

61
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,820
The graphics are fucking awesome.

62
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,300
It's a really cool game and I've gotten
nothing but positive feedback from

63
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,800
people that went out and bought it.

64
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:09,634
It's only three.

65
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,300
It's really cheap to 99.

66
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,310
I don't know why they say
to you 99 not three bucks.

67
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,173
Stop playing with,

68
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,051
do they do that?

69
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,310
I don't want to save a penny of fuck.

70
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,500
Say $3 should three Oh one it says it's
supposedly some psychological thing and

71
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,360
then you pass people that there.

72
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,280
We're just to the nation of pussies.

73
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,060
That's what it is.

74
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,930
Like one penny.

75
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,780
One Penny keeps you from
fucking buying something.

76
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,441
Well,

77
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:35,420
can I get it for two 99 then I'll
be happy with my purchase with $3.

78
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,021
I don't even know.

79
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:41,021
Is it worth $3 and just a nation of
people poisoned by car smoke or something,

80
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,810
but not this mother fucker.

81
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,250
This blade slinger character.

82
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,830
He's like a bionic cowboy.

83
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,460
Um,

84
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,860
I don't know why they call him a cowboy
because there's no fucking couch.

85
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,190
I guess I used to do is wear
that hat and you're a cowboy.

86
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,320
This motherfuckers never
seen a cow in his life.

87
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,330
How he got this guys,

88
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,660
the last thing from a cowboy,

89
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,530
you know what a cowboy is?

90
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Cowboy is a guy who has to take these
cows and move them in a certain direction.

91
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,450
It's the most boring
ass fucking life ever.

92
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,640
He just run it around pushing cows.

93
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:12,930
That sort of real cowboy does.

94
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,420
Occasionally you have to last
a one and it's a big day.

95
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,780
So when you were playing
cowboys and Indians as a kid,

96
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,340
he does lassoed cows and stuff.

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,731
No,

98
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,470
I did you understand
all always got killed.

99
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,621
No,

100
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,630
I never understood that.

101
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,610
Stanwood cowboys really worth that.

102
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,250
The cowboys were like always fighting
Indians in some sort of a fucking,

103
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,041
you know,

104
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,460
a Hatfield versus the McCoy sort of a way.

105
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,440
I didn't really understand
what a cowboy was.

106
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
I was young when I did this,

107
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,840
my friend.

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,340
Anyway,

109
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,710
um,

110
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,880
it's kerosene games.

111
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,340
The game is played slinger
and it's only three bucks.

112
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,520
The Fox and iPad eight inch is one of the
coolest things in the road and playing

113
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,900
this game on it.

114
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:46,380
It's so,

115
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,640
it's so much better
than a GameBoy nowadays.

116
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,790
Like it's like a game boy
that's also a computer.

117
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,090
I mean,

118
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,421
it's great.

119
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:52,830
The graphics on this are amazing.

120
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,221
Yeah.

121
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:53,410
The,

122
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,070
I thought,

123
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,710
I thought the tablets were stupid
as fuck when they first came out.

124
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,371
I was like,

125
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,090
this is,

126
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,530
but they're so convenient.

127
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,430
It's so cool.

128
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,160
And it's amazing how much
you can store on them.

129
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,090
I mean that,

130
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,960
that hey,

131
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,580
oh yeah,

132
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:05,951
fuck.

133
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,611
What are you doing there?

134
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:06,941
Fell out.

135
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,774
It was very real.

136
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,240
Those,

137
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,370
it doesn't matter if it's real,

138
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:09,820
the tits.

139
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,810
Even if it's of your tits,

140
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,590
we can get in trouble.

141
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,160
It's art.

142
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,391
Is it?

143
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:13,560
Painting is painting of tests.

144
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,950
I still think we can get in trouble.

145
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,630
Uh,

146
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:15,791
we,

147
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,500
we are also brought to you by desk squad.

148
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:17,711
Dot.

149
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,730
TV does squad dot.

150
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,950
TV is the place where you
can get the only place.

151
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,911
As far as I know,

152
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,691
we can get those,

153
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,130
a funky a tee shirts that,

154
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,160
that Brian makes the desk quad tee shirts.

155
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,910
It's a,

156
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,910
I don't know how to describe it other
than a psychedelic cat with a suicide vest

157
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:33,401
on him.

158
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:33,990
For some folks,

159
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,251
you know,

160
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:34,881
it's really hard.

161
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:37,700
It's trying and trying and
trying to draw the next one.

162
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,070
I'm in the middle of trying
to draw the next one and it's,

163
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,140
it's hard to try to top,

164
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,490
yeah.

165
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,041
Now I feel like I,

166
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,521
there's like,

167
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,354
I'm stressed about

168
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:44,800
these,

169
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,101
these,

170
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:45,521
if you're,

171
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,720
you dig these shirts too.

172
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,420
These are completely designed
and produced by Brian.

173
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,540
So like you're not like getting,

174
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,051
you know,

175
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,300
he's not like hiring an artist to do it.

176
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:55,630
So you're,

177
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,250
you're actually getting his artwork.

178
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,670
So I need this room or something.

179
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,060
Maybe you need to not shroom,

180
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,900
take some coffee and joined the marines.

181
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,650
All right.

182
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,070
Anyway,

183
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,551
death squad.

184
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,031
Dot TV.

185
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:10,360
Go there and fun when the
upcoming shows our cause.

186
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:10,571
Uh,

187
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,404
there's always,

188
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,950
there's always something going on in
this wacky world and there's also desk

189
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,951
squad podcast network on iTunes where you
can listen to the fabulous Kevin Perez

190
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,281
pointless,

191
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,210
which is up tomorrow.

192
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,040
Awesome.

193
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,590
One of my favorite podcasts and you
can only get that off of death squad on

194
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,400
iTunes.

195
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,450
We are also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t,

196
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,620
makers of Alpha brain and shroom tech
and hemp force and all the shit that we

197
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,910
talk about on this podcast,

198
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,490
goddammit ad nauseum.

199
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,290
We also have this new dude who's onboard,

200
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,780
Dr Robert Lasar.

201
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,340
Apparently he's some super
smart neurosurgeon and he's
a big fan of Alpha brain.

202
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,733
Um,

203
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,710
if you are not,

204
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,120
you know,

205
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,430
there's a lot of people crying snake oil
when it comes to anything that has to

206
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,960
do with cognitive function.

207
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:56,711
They're like,

208
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,410
wait a minute,

209
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,520
what is this?

210
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,170
What kind of nonsense is this?

211
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,160
Because there's a lot of stink.

212
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,341
Well,

213
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,180
going around ladies,

214
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:02,750
gentlemen,

215
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,850
Remember when people were
selling those hologram bracelets?

216
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:05,540
Yeah,

217
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,530
and I love the people that's
still wear them in Vegas.

218
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:14,300
This chick was telling me that they took
the real technology from that bracelet

219
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,130
and they incorporate into their own,

220
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,521
but the,

221
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,650
that that bracelet was ripping people off.

222
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,730
But this shit works.

223
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,180
I go,

224
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,380
you got a Hologram?

225
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,571
Or like,

226
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,161
what is that?

227
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,030
Is that a Hologram?

228
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,870
Like what's it called?

229
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,070
W what are you calling it?

230
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,491
What do you call it?

231
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,370
You got a piece of plastic on
your wrist if you believe it.

232
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,510
It makes you feel better.

233
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,950
A lot of how you feel is
affected by your attitude a lot.

234
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,570
And if you truly feel like you've been
gifted with this fucking rubber band

235
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,351
around your wrist,

236
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,870
that makes you move better,

237
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,490
you're going to start thinking
like a person who moves better.

238
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,250
Cause that's a big part of
what's fucked up about you.

239
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,363
All right,

240
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,070
Janet together bitches.

241
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,091
So,

242
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:50,500
um,

243
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,460
in in that vein,

244
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,430
I would be very sensitive to anything
that I thought was a placebo.

245
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,460
The science behind Alpha
brain is all rock solid.

246
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,390
You can look it up,

247
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:04,050
you can look up all the different
various ingredients and the history of,

248
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,690
of human use of these ingredients,

249
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,760
including things like memory tests.

250
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,381
And there's,

251
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:13,381
there's a lot of shit that people have
learned about the efficacy of nootropics

252
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,451
and,

253
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:14,730
uh,

254
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,500
the,

255
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,500
the weight of evidence clearly sides on
the idea that vitamins and nutrients we

256
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,440
know affect human performance.

257
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,440
We know they affect your body's ability
to recover your body's ability to be,

258
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,860
to be nourished in a way that allows it
to move and function and operate at its

259
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,850
optimum levels.

260
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,970
I'm a big fan of supplementation.

261
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm also a big fan of eating right.

262
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,400
I think that's one of the most
important and underlooked things.

263
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,390
People just don't get enough fucking
vegetables in their diets and uh,

264
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,450
one of the reasons we started selling
these BLENDTEC blenders at [inaudible] dot

265
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:59,240
com is for that very reason to try to
encourage people like you want to really

266
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,074
be healthy,

267
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,290
go to the supermarket as
often as you can go three,

268
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,101
four times a week.

269
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:09,101
If you can get Kale and cucumbers
and celery and garlic and,

270
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:09,771
and,

271
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:13,070
and get some sort of fruit like an
apple so it doesn't taste like death.

272
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,240
Throw it in there with some coconut
oil and rock that shit every morning.

273
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,010
You'll be a new human being.

274
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,280
You're just getting this just big wave
of nutrients first thing in the morning

275
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,790
and then go about your day,

276
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,710
take some multivitamins,

277
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,090
take some protein supplements
and get some fucking workouts in.

278
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,220
You can go get some kettle bells@onat.com
and we even have a DVD you can follow.

279
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,480
Try to follow it.

280
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,590
You'll fucking puke.

281
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:41,630
It's the extreme
kettlebell cardio workout.

282
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,010
It's brutal.

283
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,660
It's a brutal DVD.

284
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,910
I can't get through it with a 35 pounder.

285
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,490
I know dudes who can do,

286
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,220
it's crazy.

287
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,810
It's a crazy workout man.

288
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,980
And we sell that.

289
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,780
We sell everything to make you man
the fuck up and your shit together.

290
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:56,650
And if you use a code name,

291
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,250
Rogan,

292
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,590
you'll save 10% off any n
all supplements that um,

293
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,710
as for Mike,

294
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,340

Hold on.

297
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,620
No I don't.

298
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:06,880
Um,

299
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,661
those t shirts,

300
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:08,020
uh,

301
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,240
they're,

302
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,481
they,

303
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,030
they're selling out faster
than I can make them.

304
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,631
I'm sorry.

305
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:11,180
I I,

306
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,210
I appreciate that everybody's
trying to buy him.

307
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,110
Um,

308
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,460
there's nothing I can do.

309
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,120
We put it in order and I've made
a much bigger order this time.

310
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:19,690
So uh,

311
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,070
thank you for all the
people that are buying them.

312
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,400
No,

313
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,060
it's higher-primate.com and I think
most things are out of stock right now.

314
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:25,960
Sorry.

315
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,793
You fucks.

He is an author about all things freaky
and we're going to get down to business.

319
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,580
We're going to start this party as soon
as Brian knows how to press that button.

320
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,650
Is it cause a visit

321
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,603
issue?

322
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,760
The Joe Rogan experience.

323
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,170
Joe Rogan podcast.

Thanks for coming down on me.

331
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,301

00:09:58,301 --> 00:09:58,490
uh,

333
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,130
Matt stags are a publicist,

334
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,043
um,

335
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,170
uh,

336
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,120
requested you or a suggested you.

337
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:10,121
I was so all over this cause this is like
so right in my wheelhouse of shit that

338
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:11,414
I enjoy.

339
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,343
Um,

340
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,770
bullshit and stuff that
might not be bullshit.

341
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,340
You know,

342
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,140
and there's a lot of both going around,

343
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:18,590
right?

344
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,330
There's a lot of bullshit folks,

345
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,410
don't get me wrong,

346
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,030
but it's not all bullshit.

347
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,893
There's some,

348
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,940
there's some weird shit
out there in the world.

349
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,410
And does that mean hope there?

350
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:28,860
I,

351
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,110
I,

352
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,440
I made a beep off my phone,

353
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,010
but there's a lot of people that almost
immediately discount anything fringe,

354
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,240
whether it's psychics or whether it's,

355
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:39,690
uh,

356
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:39,841
you know,

357
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:43,170
I've gotten angry people over
the last couple of weeks,

358
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,710
like angry emails and angry tweets because
I suggested that something might be

359
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,260
going on.

360
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,140
When you think about
someone and the phone calls,

361
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,020
the phone rings and it's
them and that people like,

362
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:55,291
Oh,

363
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,550
you're attaching that to it.

364
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,960
This is a person you think about all day.

365
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,090
Like Sam Harris said
some very logical points.

366
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,030
And I agree with him
absolutely for the most part.

367
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,540
But there are specific isolated instances
where you feel something and then

368
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,670
something happens where you
know someone's looking at you.

369
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:11,781
Yeah,

370
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:12,600
yeah.

371
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,670
Remember at Sheldrake did a,

372
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:14,950
uh,

373
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:19,950
a controlled study in which he had people
list for people who were present in

374
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:21,391
their lives.

375
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,950
Somebody who might in fact call them.

376
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,690
And then for,

377
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,010
I forget how long a period it was,

378
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,090
a week or two weeks,

379
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:27,924
something like that.

380
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,950
Um,

381
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,671
they were supposed to,

382
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,070
anytime the phone rang
before they answered it,

383
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,130
think of which of these
four people it was.

384
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,930
And um,

385
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,550
they thought of the correct
person a more at a rate,

386
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,840
higher than chance,

387
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,220
significantly higher than chance.

388
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,570
And I don't have all those,

389
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:45,831
the,

390
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,171
the,

391
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,400
the numbers in my head right now,

392
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,160
but it ended up being as
statistically significant fact.

393
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:50,521
Right?

394
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:53,620
So instead of being a right when
it was one of those four people,

395
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,730
one out of four times,

396
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,100
they were right far more often.

397
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,060
Wow,

398
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,960
that's interesting.

399
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,250
And Yeah,

400
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,390
well there's that because they knew that
this one motherfucker just calls me all

401
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,100
the time and he's money in the bank.

402
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,930
I'm going to prove some psychics.

403
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,580
It's just one.

404
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,410
What if one guy just fucking
calls you all day and you're like,

405
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,380
I know it's Marty and you pick it up and
it's Marty because Marty calls you all

406
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,470
day.

407
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,340
I suppose it could be.

408
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,300
It could be that they had,

409
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,330
they had so many people involved in the
study that it would seem to be what it

410
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:21,641
was,

411
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,220
is statistically significant
effect in writing a book though.

412
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,650
Do you start looking for
fuckery and studies like that?

413
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:27,500
And because you know,

414
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,300
of course your purpose initially was
kind of did to disprove a lot of this

415
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:31,990
stuff.

416
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,990
And I have to tell you the chapter on
telepathy in particular have scared the

417
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,680
hell out of me because I had gotten so
used to hearing this skeptical line.

418
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:39,311
There's no evidence,

419
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:39,851
there's no evidence,

420
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:43,530
there's no evidence that I
really expected to find weapons.

421
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,060
And,

422
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,790
um,

423
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,880
when I realized I was going to have to
hang my ass out on the line and saying,

424
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,301
you know what,

425
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,800
there's actually some evidence.

426
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,731
Uh,

427
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,600
it was scary.

428
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,830
That was scary.

429
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,850
Was it scary because you thought like
intellectually you'd be criticized and

430
00:12:57,851 --> 00:12:59,410
you'd be marginalized.

431
00:12:59,411 --> 00:12:59,861
Shore.

432
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,350
I thought it'd be ostracized within
the profession of journalism,

433
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,130
you know,

434
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,671
for saying this.

435
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:04,900
But the fact is there's,

436
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,010
there's a really high level debate going
on between really smart people about

437
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:12,640
the proper way to slice and dice these
studies in terms of analyzing the

438
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,900
statistics that are generated.

439
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,390
And we can't at this point
really be sure whether or not,

440
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,020
um,

441
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,960
sigh as they put it is that's
the whole field of telepathy.

442
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,430
Whether or not cy exists,

443
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,150
but there's,

444
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,090
there's a lot of really strong
evidence that would suggest it does.

445
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,201
And I,

446
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,290
and I mentioned this in my book,

447
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,880
a couple of the leading skeptics,

448
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:31,714
Chris French,

449
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,990
uh,

450
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,430
Richard Wiseman have both allowed that
by the standards of any ordinary science,

451
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,160
telepathy is proven right.

452
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,211
So if,

453
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:44,680
if they were just judging
kind of a pharmaceutical and
looking at the same sorts

454
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,030
of numbers that these guys are,

455
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:46,960
are generating,

456
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:47,770
um,

457
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,371
they would say,

458
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:48,581
okay,

459
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,690
something's happening here.

460
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,050
Right?

461
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,330
There's a,

462
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,163
there's an effect.

463
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,830
But because it's a quote,

464
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,190
extraordinary claim,

465
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:54,821
uh,

466
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:56,530
we don't understand the physics of this,

467
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,960
what the mechanism would be
that would allow for telepathy.

468
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,820
We need greater evidence.

469
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,341
And what,

470
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,430
when you say that it's been proven how so?

471
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,350
Well,

472
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,630
he's,

473
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,441
there again,

474
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,030
this is why he's been in
French who I'm quoting,

475
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,440
but they would say that like,

476
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,180
say something like the Ganzfeld,

477
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,630
uh,

478
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,980
test if you're familiar with that.

479
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,251
No.

480
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:12,641
What does that,

481
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,010
okay.

482
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,080
The Ganzfeld test,

483
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,250
um,

484
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,630
they'll have a,

485
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:16,910
the,

486
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,640
there's many different ways to set it up,

487
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,450
right?

488
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,980
But one of the ways to set it up
is you've got a person who is the,

489
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,843
um,

490
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,103
uh,

491
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,050
one of the sub test subjects that has,

492
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,400
have to ping pong balls,

493
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,270
put over their eyes,

494
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,373
right?

495
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,130
Um,

496
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,870
they have white noise being pumped into
their ears and they're put into a very

497
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,840
comfortable chair where they're
just sort of kind of suspended.

498
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,130
So there's very,

499
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,490
very little input into
the system at that point.

500
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,020
And there are the receiver,

501
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,650
right?

502
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,970
And they're in a soundproof room,

503
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,710
so they're getting no normal whatsoever,

504
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,330
but they're supposed

505
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,890
to to just kind of go within,

506
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:55,220
right,

507
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,390
listen to themselves,

508
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,410
what thoughts occurred to them and
start reporting back on what it is that

509
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:04,130
they're seeing in their mind's
eye hearing in their mind,

510
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,023
that kind of thing.

511
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,710
And in another room,

512
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,880
uh,

513
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,190
the center is actually,

514
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,170
they're in a soundproof room,

515
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,700
two locked away from,

516
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:14,534
from the receiver.

517
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,270
They are looking at some sort of stimulus.

518
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,010
They're looking at an image on a computer,

519
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,880
um,

520
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,110
perhaps or you know,

521
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,220
photos in front of them.

522
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,870
And um,

523
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,930
they are trying to send that image to
the person in the other room who they may

524
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:30,411
or may not know,

525
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,244
depending on the study.

526
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,910
And then there are there for target
images that are then presented usually in

527
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:41,510
the best studies than
an impartial judge will,

528
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,590
um,

529
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,320
look at a transcript of
what the receiver said,

530
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,573
right?

531
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,410
And then they'll have four
images in front of them,

532
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:53,530
one of which was the target
that the center was actually
trying to mentally send

533
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,524
to the receiver.

534
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,160
And you would expect that if the person
with the ping pong balls over their eyes

535
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,670
got absolutely nothing,

536
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,700
then the judge would select the
correct image one out of four times.

537
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,290
But instead you do enough trials
and the men analyses on these,

538
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,700
when they crunch all the numbers from
all the studies together and shows more

539
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:18,320
like a 32% effect instead of
being right one on a four times,

540
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,270
they're right 32% of the time.

541
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,420
And this Wiseman and
French would allow that.

542
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:27,800
These studies are generally
well controlled enough that
if this was an ordinary

543
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:29,300
claim that was being presented,

544
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,380
uh,

545
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:30,861
this was,

546
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:33,980
this is fine and we would accept this
as evidence that something's up here,

547
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:35,720
some kind of information transfer.

548
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,350
The problem is because we don't understand
the physics of how this would work,

549
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,600
they say we need greater evidence than
this and they keep asking for greater and

550
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,210
greater levels of scientific
controls to be put on the studies.

551
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,890
And they keep,

552
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,690
um,

553
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,560
just finding ways to kind
of reject the result.

554
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,590
I've never been skeptical of the
potential for psychic phenomenon,

555
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,510
but I've been very skeptical about
almost every store that I've ever heard.

556
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,381
Unfortunately,

557
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:05,810
I've met a lot of fakers,

558
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,160
I've been a lot of fake psychics.

559
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,730
I met a lot of crazy girls and want
to tell you they're like clairvoyant,

560
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,181
you know,

561
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,100
and people who are channelers and just,

562
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,980
there's so many looney tunes
that are connected to it,

563
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,310
but a 32% increase sounds to
me like probably what's real.

564
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,980
It's that I think that
human average though,

565
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,450
when you think that
would be about average,

566
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,460
if you were to do the same study with,

567
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,650
without having somebody trying to,

568
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:30,890
you know,

569
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,723
just the protein,

570
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,320
25% without it,

571
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:35,060
25% of 32%.

572
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,661
That's the idea.

573
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,880
So there's a small leap to seven.

574
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,810
Yeah.

575
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,643
Whatever it is,

576
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,103
chance.

577
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,150
But what's interesting in that 7%,

578
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:44,421
I mean,

579
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,340
if it's really statistically real,

580
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:48,980
if the study hasn't been fucked with the,

581
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,440
um,

582
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,030
the idea is that it's just a little bit,

583
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,620
right?

584
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,500
It was just a little bit,

585
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,100
the idea is that there's this weak signal
that we're not normally picking up on.

586
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,960
Especially look at the way we live now,

587
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,950
where we're constantly,

588
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,191
uh,

589
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:03,020
constantly being bombarded by
information and input and just stimulus.

590
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,140
But when you shut all that out and you
close your eyes and you don't have any

591
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,490
sound that distracts you,

592
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,360
what's there?

593
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,310
Are you receiving any kind
of accurate information?

594
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,090
And I'm,

595
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,460
I found the research really tantalizing.

596
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:14,971
And I also,

597
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,331
like I said,

598
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,740
I found it scary because I thought,

599
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:16,831
well,

600
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,090
here I am now I'm going to write that.

601
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,870
You know what?

602
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,490
When they tell you there's no evidence.

603
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,690
That's kind of bullshit,

604
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,130
right?

605
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,390
There's,

606
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,750
there's,

607
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,340
in fact there,

608
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,030
there is some evidence and the question
is whether or not it's risen to the

609
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:28,680
level yet where we have to accept it.

610
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,753
Right?

611
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,580
Yeah.

612
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,560
It's a fascinating possibility
that I think is inevitable.

613
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I think it's inevitable
either technologically or
it's inevitable due to our own

614
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:43,860
bodies advancing and
changing and mutation.

615
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,020
Because I feel like if you look
at lower primates and you know,

616
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:49,250
they're,

617
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,030
they're very rudimentary language.

618
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,360
I think the chimps repeat certain
sounds and they meet might mean certain

619
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,080
things,

620
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,940
but it's nowhere near what we can do.

621
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,310
And I've got to assume
that this isn't the end.

622
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,140
This isn't the last version of the ape.

623
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,381
You know,

624
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:02,500
if,

625
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,620
if apes are going to
continue to be successful,

626
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,930
this model's not going
to stick around forever.

627
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,190
You could look at this one of two ways.

628
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,900
One way maybe we're
evolving the ability right?

629
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,030
Another way,

630
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,900
maybe we're losing it,

631
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,350
right?

632
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,930
So back in the day when we were,

633
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,620
you mentioned before the sense of being
stared at been some really good research

634
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:19,951
on this.

635
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,161
Again,

636
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,650
when the skeptics I mentioned
Richard Wiseman did it,

637
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,820
did a study with a woman named Marilyn
Schlitz where they collaborated and they

638
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:30,270
did three separate studies trying to
figure out whether or not somebody could

639
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,010
sense that.

640
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:35,040
Some of us staring at the back of their
head and they had realized controls on

641
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,161
it.

642
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,830
Why spin was part of uh,

643
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,080
you know,

644
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,913
the experiment.

645
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,750
Two out of the three times they did it,

646
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,270
they,

647
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,250
they got it again,

648
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,610
a statistically significant
effect where people were right of,

649
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,270
you know,

650
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,430
far more often than chance
would have suggested.

651
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,100
And if you think of it
in an evolutionary sense,

652
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,330
which I do in the book,

653
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:52,020
right,

654
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,950
is that back in the day when we
were being hunted all the time,

655
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:56,220
right,

656
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,180
when we didn't have the
kinds of fortifications we
have now against the angry

657
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:01,970
packs of wolves that are out there and,

658
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,610
and,

659
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,443
uh,

660
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,010
we would have needed to have this ability
to know that we're being stared at.

661
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:08,971
You know,

662
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:09,331
we would have,

663
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,670
it would have helped us
survive as a species.

664
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,863
Yeah.

665
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:13,651
Yeah.

666
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:14,370
It makes sense.

667
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,110
Especially,

668
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,391
you know,

669
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,580
when you consider there's gotta be some
pretty intense focus when a Predator

670
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,520
locks on you,

671
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,481
you know,

672
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:26,481
and that if there is some sort of a
psychic bond out there between entities,

673
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,800
like the feeling like this
motherfucker is about JP,

674
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,110
that's what it should fricking kick in.

675
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:31,944
Right.

676
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,230
Does you know what if they can feel it?

677
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,400
You know,

678
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I think that there's probably a lot of
senses that we lost in our separation

679
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,300
from the,

680
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,930
the natural world to here.

681
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,810
Just intuitive senses.

682
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,800
The army has done some research on

683
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,670
um,

684
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,020
intuition really and,

685
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,430
and who their most intuitive,

686
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,570
intuitive people are.

687
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:57,370
And it's the Co these people are the ones
that they'll sort of look at to notice

688
00:20:57,371 --> 00:21:00,730
when there's a hidden explosive
device on the ground in Iraq.

689
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,420
Right.

690
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,450
And they've found that that
to two groups in particular,

691
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,141
I think there was a third,

692
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:05,561
but there's two.

693
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,760
What I was remember that,

694
00:21:07,761 --> 00:21:09,860
that are really good at this um,

695
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,030
hunters and uh,

696
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,080
people from the inner city.

697
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,120
And so suburbian milky people
are fucking useless apparently.

698
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,180
So I knew that was the problem.

699
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,730
Everybody a break about it from the
point of view of the person in the inner

700
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:25,240
city,

701
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,630
they've got to be aware of their entire
environment and the potential for

702
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,464
danger.

703
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,310
And they've got to get used to honoring
that impulse that something's a little

704
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,144
off here.

705
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,350
I need to respect that,

706
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,950
you know,

707
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,790
in order to stay alive.

708
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,600
And so the people who are best at finding
these hidden explicit devices just can

709
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:43,090
tell it something just
feels off in this area.

710
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,910
And then they start
focusing in on what really,

711
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,330
well,

712
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:46,841
I didn't know,

713
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,351
first of all,

714
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:51,120
that the army actually used intuitive
people to try to find bombs.

715
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,370
Keep,

716
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:51,700
keep,

717
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,331
keep in mind,

718
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,170
this is not about,

719
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,980
um,

720
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,850
psychic ability,

721
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,510
right?

722
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,990
It,

723
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,870
at least they're not talking
about it in that context.

724
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,670
The army has done remote viewing,

725
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,390
uh,

726
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,020
uh,

727
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,471
research,

728
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,221
all that stuff in the past.

729
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,030
But you know,

730
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,481
this is,

731
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,570
this is a very straightforward intuition.

732
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,630
You can somebody who can just very,

733
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,850
very aware of their surroundings,

734
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,190
very aware of what's around them and alert
to something that just seems wrong in

735
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:18,850
the environment.

736
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,550
That's not necessarily psychic at all.

737
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,623
Um,

738
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,530
but it's real and it,

739
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,040
and it,

740
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,860
but it hearkens back to that a little bit.

741
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,720
That idea is psychic though.

742
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,563
I mean,

743
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,110
you can just have some spidey sense.

744
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,450
Well,

745
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,410
I think that they're,

746
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,520
I think they're telling a lie,

747
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,151
you know,

748
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:38,200
I think they're toeing the line there.

749
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:42,730
Right up on that line where spidey sense
and Taco spidey senses right where we

750
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:43,564
should be.

751
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,010
But the language they're using is,

752
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,480
is clearly very,

753
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,320
um,

754
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,591
you know,

755
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,080
hardcore have a dream.

756
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,930
This is something that I've always wanted
to ask someone like you have police

757
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:57,350
really used psychics to find
victims or any of that stuff?

758
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,110
Was any of that stuff
ever really panned out?

759
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,301
I,

760
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:03,310
I've actually done a lot of police
reporting in my past as well as,

761
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,521
you know,

762
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:04,031
this book.

763
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,830
I mean it's kind of generally,

764
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:06,970
I read about cops,

765
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,990
crime courts,

766
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:08,651
politics,

767
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,484
that kind of thing.

768
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,410
I spend a lot of time with cops and
there's one homicide detective I know who

769
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,230
had absolutely it just,

770
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,760
and he's actually a religious guy,

771
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,630
which is sort of interesting.

772
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,940
He hates psychics.

773
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,283
They have,

774
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,210
they have led him on so many or tried to
lead him on so many wild goose chases.

775
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,090
They screw with him when he's in the
middle of a tough homicide investigation.

776
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,060
He's getting phone calls
sometimes when it was higher.

777
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,780
UPS will be,

778
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,890
maybe you ought to listen,

779
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,300
maybe you gotta hear this out.

780
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:37,571
You know,

781
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,190
he cannot stand them.

782
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:40,930
But I recently met and I've really,

783
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,280
I've got to follow up with this guy.

784
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,503
Um,

785
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,740
and I haven't yet,

786
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,190
but I met a retired

787
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,180
homicide detective who told me he wanted
to talk to me because he has worked

788
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:53,480
with a psychic who gave him
good actionable information
on multiple occasions.

789
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,190
And I haven't had a chance to,

790
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,440
to sit down with Pankaj yet.

791
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,730
I bet it was bone or trying
to promote a business.

792
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,810
I know how that works.

793
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,850
That's what he was doing as an old guy.

794
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,684
I'm not sure he's both.

795
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,980
He's got to do what he's gotta do.

796
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:07,851
You know,

797
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,380
chick's got a psychic business.

798
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,480
I touch to keep the lights
on this day and age.

799
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,310
I've always wanted to know.

800
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,060
Um,

801
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,560
I've heard a lot of people talk about it,

802
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:18,500
but everybody that I've heard talk
about it hasn't researched it.

803
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:18,861
You know,

804
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:19,270
it hasn't,

805
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,660
it's not everybody wants to say,

806
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:20,820
you know,

807
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,140
psych,

808
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,630
they've used psychics to find bodies.

809
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm like,

810
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,570
have they,

811
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:23,781
have,

812
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:24,500
they really,

813
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,400
I don't know if they have,

814
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,001
you know what Joe,

815
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:29,600
there's a couple of cases that are
still sort of tantalizing out there that

816
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:29,691
would,

817
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:30,740
maybe something happened,

818
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,111
you know,

819
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:31,450
maybe,

820
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,960
maybe they didn't get actual information.

821
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,793
But for the most part,

822
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,760
if you even watch the
psychic investigators show,

823
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:39,230
what's really sort of funny about
it is that even when they're saying,

824
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:39,710
you know,

825
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,390
that this information was so valuable,

826
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:42,830
usually if you're really paying attention,

827
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:44,750
it's not actually the
information that broke the case.

828
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,700
It's,

829
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,020
it's information that
after the fact seem to fit.

830
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,213
And,

831
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:49,700
um,

832
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,540
so I'm still,

833
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,170
you know,

834
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,003
I'm still,

835
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,450
I'm still skeptical and everything,

836
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,360
but I'm skeptical of the
psychics helping detectives.

837
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,580
But I'm really open to it because again,

838
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,270
if this,

839
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,460
if there is this sort of
weak signal out there,

840
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:02,091
you know,

841
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:03,650
that occasionally we pick up on,

842
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:06,020
well then maybe sometimes it
provides actionable information.

843
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,480
Do you remember this
psychic friends network?

844
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,130
Yup.

845
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,960
Do you remember what show it was?

846
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,880
A Dionne Warwick or Warwick and Dionne
Warwick are caught with weed at the

847
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,070
airport as what made her psychic.

848
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,531
Yeah.

849
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,650
That's what we should make to asshole.

850
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:19,484
She was working with.

851
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:20,390
When you,

852
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,030
I think when you smoke pot you
get a little more kick there.

853
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,320
You make that a quote.

854
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,154
Go ahead.

855
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,900
I just to discredit me,

856
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,670
take it in context though.

857
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,820
I think you,

858
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,900
you become super sensitive and in,

859
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,640
in that that like you
become very aware of,

860
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,260
people are creepy very,

861
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:37,340
where people are angry,

862
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,290
very aware of weird tension.

863
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,740
You know,

864
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,940
it makes it like really sensitive.

865
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,160
It makes you really
aware of bad acting too.

866
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,770
It's tough to get high and
watch some bad acting like Whoa,

867
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,990
you're fucking faking it.

868
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,330
And that is sort of like what,

869
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,670
what acting really is,

870
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:52,021
is the,

871
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:57,021
the best actors can lock into a role so
deeply that they almost must believe it

872
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:59,300
in themselves because
they're convincing you,

873
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,890
even though you know
it's Daniel Day Lewis,

874
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,461
you know,

875
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:04,820
you know he's not really an Irish boxer.

876
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,420
You believe it cause he's,

877
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,460
he's tricked you.

878
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:07,940
He's,

879
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,880
he's bypassed all of your psychic energy.

880
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,820
But when you're high and you
watched someone faking the funk,

881
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:14,630
just going through the,

882
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,080
you're like,

883
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,501
oh,

884
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,760
what are you doing up there?

885
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,200
Like you see them acting.

886
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,250
It's just rude.

887
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,540
It's disgusting.

888
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,570
It'd be interesting to watch it early
and later Deniro in that context.

889
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,153
Yeah.

890
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,180
You're so right.

891
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,910
Is there ever a guy who's
fallen so far for grains?

892
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,400
It's so sad.

893
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Meet the Fockers really to fuck
you to whatever the number two was.

894
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,411
Little Fuck,

895
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:38,510
we fucked you again.

896
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,500
Those little fuckers are bad.

897
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:39,741
I mean,

898
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,330
I'm not even saying
that that's a bad movie,

899
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:42,260
but it's just like,

900
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,470
that's Robert Deniro,

901
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,011
you know,

902
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:48,130
and he's doing some
new movie now with Lnr,

903
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,130
although are they get in a fight
with each other or Alan Arkin rather?

904
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,890
It's just like he was in that movie.

905
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,810
We play like a wizard and shit.

906
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,913
Yeah.

907
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,880
Oh my God.

908
00:26:57,881 --> 00:26:59,140
What was the movie with Robert De Niro?

909
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:00,430
Played like a wizard wizard.

910
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,500
It was like a really bad,

911
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,300
like the Hobbit type movie.

912
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,430
It looks so stupid.

913
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,510
I was like,

914
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,343
Robert,

915
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,610
what is going on?

916
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,020
I guess after a while you're like,

917
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:11,830
fuck it.

918
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,730
I did my time.

919
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,530
I feel I did my Goodfellows.

920
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:15,880
I did my raging bulls.

921
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,880
I'm just from here on
in and have some fun.

922
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,660
Yeah.

923
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,640
I think about what he
did for Cape Fear and he,

924
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,930
he was fucking incredible
on a wait for a raging bull.

925
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:26,470
I mean,

926
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,830
you know,

927
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,760
too much sacrifice.

928
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,910
He's a taxi driver and he said just a
fucking tremendous actor just in his prime

929
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:34,661
and his youth.

930
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:36,040
He was just unstoppable.

931
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,060
The deer hunter,

932
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:37,420
I mean,

933
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,231
my God,

934
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:39,340
that was a fucking movie.

935
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,990
He did some incredible,

936
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:41,890
incredible shit,

937
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,050
but the stuff he's doing now,

938
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,043
Barb,

939
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,913
Barb,

940
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,863
Robert,

941
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,353
sad,

942
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,470
sad to see man,

943
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,540
it's fucked.

944
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,120
I'm sure he's feeling
really sad right now.

945
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,720
Getting that Betty is that
he's not as nearly as happy

946
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,570
busy was during the raging bull days when
he was just creating something fucking

947
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,530
magnificent.

948
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:04,300
You know,

949
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,970
I think tiff,

950
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,250
he got into with JC watts.

951
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,300
Robert De Niro got a tiff with Jay Z.

952
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,530
Yeah.

953
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,281
Jesus Christ.

954
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,210
How is that possible?

955
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,870
She was apparently a trying to Phelan
Jay z to talk about some sort of

956
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,480
entertainment event
that was going on in JC.

957
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,360
Didn't call him back.

958
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,990
And so de Niro in public kind
of dressed him down for it.

959
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,370
Wow.

960
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:21,660
That's,

961
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:21,970
yeah.

962
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,180
And I thought that's a little much,

963
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,290
you know,

964
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,280
I wonder if that one
was just too busy too.

965
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:26,630
You know,

966
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,340
Bobby de Niro calls you,

967
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,300
you call them back.

968
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,511
Well,

969
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,580
how about maybe didn't
really know it was you,

970
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,350
you know,

971
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,740
if it's Bobby,

972
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:34,540
Bobby Genero,

973
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,940
what if he got the hoe phone number or
something we checked or would have Jay z,

974
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,470
you see that wizard movie and was like,

975
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:41,390
what the fuck Bobby Dinero,

976
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,470
what's you two inside?

977
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,230
You Owe me 20 bucks

978
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,650
or what if just hanging out with Robert
Deniro was just uncomfortable for us

979
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,580
upon smoker.

980
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,061
Like if he,

981
00:28:51,061 --> 00:28:52,550
like he just wanted to
hang out all the time.

982
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,311
I kind of fucking,

983
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,340
Robert Deniro was coming over,

984
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:54,460
right?

985
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,710
Yeah.

986
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,543
What if,

987
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,930
what if he's like studying you?

988
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:58,740
Yeah.

989
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,280
You know,

990
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,660
like,

991
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,900
and he went to drink wine with you?

992
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,030
Yeah.

993
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,170
As a character actor,

994
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:05,250
he's studying you thinking if
he could play you in a movie,

995
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,250
he starts rubbing your
feet and Bobby didn't you?

996
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:08,380
Okay.

997
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,600
As Brian Red Ban red band in the future,

998
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,653
that would be him,

999
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,880
Robert De Niro as red band in the future.

1000
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,290
It's you and like 50 years and you see

1001
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,880
still,

1002
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,310
you would probably do that role.

1003
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:21,821
Yeah,

1004
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:22,390
yeah,

1005
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,223
yeah.

1006
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,940
You still partying it up,

1007
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,740
still talking like you're 12,

1008
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,230
but now it's creepy cause
you're like almost 60.

1009
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:29,771
And everybody's like,

1010
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:31,270
what the fuck is he going to grow up?

1011
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,253
Nope.

1012
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,153
Stop Rolling up.

1013
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,410
It's Bobby de Niro as
red band in his sixties.

1014
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,300
That's a good idea for a movie.

1015
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,233
It is.

1016
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:41,841
No,

1017
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:42,674
it's not.

1018
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,690
So don't make that.

1019
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,061
So what,

1020
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:49,030
what subject did you get started with?

1021
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,760
What led you to just pursue this,

1022
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:52,120
uh,

1023
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,451
the,

1024
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:52,810
um,

1025
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,021
the,

1026
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:57,190
the storyline in this book or the idea
of won in this book of just chasing down

1027
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,300
all things French.

1028
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,710
There were a couple of things that,

1029
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,440
and that motivated me.

1030
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:02,890
Um,

1031
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,020
one of them was a family goes
story I grew up with as a kid,

1032
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,860
um,

1033
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,300
where supposedly our house,

1034
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,530
these are my red band notes by the way,

1035
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:08,621
in.

1036
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,060
And as you're noticing this,

1037
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,631
I'm going to,

1038
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,630
I'm an avid listener of the show and I
know he might say totally random shit

1039
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:14,740
that will totally distract me.

1040
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,980
And if you guys don't want to be
able to take a note on where I was,

1041
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,610
it's good.

1042
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,940
Move the car.

1043
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,510
We should have it for you.

1044
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,373
You're far,

1045
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,100
definitely guess captain flow record.

1046
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,950
So I um,

1047
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,600
I grew up with a ghost story,

1048
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,340
a ghost that was supposedly in my house.

1049
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,320
This stuff happened when I
was five or six years old,

1050
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,790
so I have very fragmented memories of it,

1051
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,990
but it was a,

1052
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,893
um,

1053
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,440
it's really sort of
starts with the cliche.

1054
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,120
It was a thing that
went bump in the night,

1055
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,991
only at bumped.

1056
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:44,390
It thought it,

1057
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,223
it boomed.

1058
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,790
Uh,

1059
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,080
it happened only at night.

1060
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,600
I would go on for tens
of minutes at a time.

1061
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,510
It sounded like it was coming
from somewhere upstairs.

1062
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:56,650
So my parents and the first floor
thought it was on the roof of the house.

1063
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,840
My brother and I on one side of the house,

1064
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,640
thought it was on the roof over our heads,

1065
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,050
my sisters in their room.

1066
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:04,510
I did not share an adjoining wall with us.

1067
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:09,511
Thought it was on the roof and or
in there up the high in the walls.

1068
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,280
And um,

1069
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,670
at first that's what it was.

1070
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,510
It was this noise,

1071
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,261
but it was so loud.

1072
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,690
It would wake everybody up
and it would go on for awhile.

1073
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,760
And my parents hunted for
a prosaic explanations.

1074
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,520
Um,

1075
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,540
didn't fit with like a water hammer
or anything with the plumbing.

1076
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,270
It didn't fit with the house settling
because of how long it went on.

1077
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:30,250
And you have an addict
or was it just a roof?

1078
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,143
No attic.

1079
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,223
And um,

1080
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,870
my sister started
reporting stranger things.

1081
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:35,920
It's really movie shit.

1082
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,250
Right?

1083
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,360
They started reporting that,

1084
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,260
um,

1085
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,470
their bed frames would shake in the
middle of the night and wake them up.

1086
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,350
A claim that they saw a woman
walk right through the room.

1087
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,190
Um,

1088
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,700
you know,

1089
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,660
literally eight ghost,

1090
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,320
right.

1091
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,071
My parents,

1092
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,450
and I find this really important.

1093
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,590
My parents set that aside and
discounted it for a couple of reasons.

1094
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:57,580
It was coming from kids and who would
want to believe that that's true.

1095
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:57,881
I mean,

1096
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,550
I think one of the things the
skeptics always do is say,

1097
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,181
you know,

1098
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:04,900
it's sort of wishful thinking
and superstition that
people hear a noise and they

1099
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:05,950
leap to ghost.

1100
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,600
But my family didn't.

1101
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:11,740
And so they spent nine months or a year
trying to recreate the noise and various

1102
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:14,530
ways trying to figure out what it was.

1103
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,810
And when my sisters would
tell these crazy stories,

1104
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,090
they were just kind of like number one,

1105
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:20,020
they didn't want to believe it.

1106
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,570
Who wants to believe your starters
are being terrorized at night.

1107
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,060
Right.

1108
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,160
Something going on in their room.

1109
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,720
But finally,

1110
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,990
and I was raised Catholic and we
hadn't fallen out of the church yet.

1111
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:29,824
That was still coming.

1112
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,030
But um,

1113
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,450
my dad went to the family priest and he
told him what was going on cause he'd

1114
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,440
run out of other answers
and the priest said,

1115
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:38,621
you know,

1116
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,040
usually cases like this,

1117
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,370
which I always find that
language interesting as well
because it implies he does

1118
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:44,840
this on a fairly regular basis.

1119
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,460
Usually in cases like this,

1120
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:47,990
I come over and I blessed the house.

1121
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,670
So he came over,

1122
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:54,671
and I remember this vividly because
to have father Crowley come into the,

1123
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,060
uh,

1124
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,360
come into the house with the vestments on,

1125
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:00,290
in swinging,

1126
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,523
um,

1127
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,900
like the incense around and
praying and Latin was intense,

1128
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,290
right?

1129
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,123
As a kid.

1130
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,263
Um,

1131
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,660
I said like,

1132
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,471
it was like six.

1133
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:09,950
He was,

1134
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,270
he was God himself,

1135
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,631
you know,

1136
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,480
standing up on that pulpit
and he comes in our house,

1137
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:17,960
he's swinging incense around and
when he leaves and he says to my dad,

1138
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,230
uh,

1139
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,651
so long,

1140
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:18,921
Jerry,

1141
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:20,240
I'm sure everything will be fine.

1142
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,270
But that night actually things got worse.

1143
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:25,850
The booming went on longer
and louder than ever before.

1144
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:28,910
And for the first time it seemed
to locate in a specific spot.

1145
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:32,420
So instead of coming from
this sort of Amorphous area,

1146
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,470
somewhere up on the roof,

1147
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,900
it hits at the top of the stairs,

1148
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,711
the landing,

1149
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:39,440
and then it came downstairs
like one step at a time.

1150
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,150
My father said it sounded like a kid
throwing a tantrum and when it hit the

1151
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,650
bottom floor,

1152
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,933
um,

1153
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,430
they could feel the floor
shake under their feet.

1154
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,031
My parents,

1155
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,110
and we never heard it again.

1156
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,340
And so I grow up with this
story and I think of it as a,

1157
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:56,721
you know,

1158
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,441
for a long time,

1159
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:58,580
all the way through adolescence.

1160
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,620
It was just sort of thing.

1161
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,440
Um,

1162
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,771
I don't know,

1163
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,011
man,

1164
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,030
an article of faith,

1165
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:03,070
like I didn't even question it.

1166
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,310
It,

1167
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,370
it just was,

1168
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:04,911
but you know,

1169
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:05,810
you get into college,

1170
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,750
then you start meeting other people and
you start getting familiar with critical

1171
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,051
thinking.

1172
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:09,884
You're like,

1173
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,120
the hell is that.

1174
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:11,631
You know,

1175
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:12,530
what the hell was that?

1176
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:14,900
That's not how old were
you when this was going on?

1177
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:15,740
I was about six.

1178
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,890
And so whenever memories I
have it are very fragmentary,

1179
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,240
but I gotta tell you,

1180
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,990
Joe and I asked my parents about it
for the book and I actually interviewed

1181
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:24,110
them.

1182
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,790
I knew someday I was
going to write about this.

1183
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,480
Right.

1184
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,660
I interviewed the many years
before I really settled on,

1185
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:30,680
this is the book I'm gonna write.

1186
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,790
And I actually sat down and I recorded
it and I will never forget when they were

1187
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,430
describing that last night
when it came down the stairs,

1188
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,080
they turn white,

1189
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,880
they held hands across the table.

1190
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,200
They were still frightened.

1191
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:43,520
Just by the memory of it.

1192
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,630
So for them,

1193
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:47,240
whatever it was was tremendously real.

1194
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,650
And I wanted to explore
that and see what we could,

1195
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:56,450
there have been anything strange there
could they have possibly somehow and in

1196
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:57,680
my brothers and sisters do could we,

1197
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,960
all of us somehow imagined all this.

1198
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,130
And so that was part of my
inspiration for the book.

1199
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,470
What is your conclusion on that?

1200
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,930
Do you,

1201
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,850
do you look back?

1202
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:08,091
I mean,

1203
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:11,900
I don't remember anything that happened
when I was six that I can tell you

1204
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,490
reliably what really happened.

1205
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,620
I have just a few that's Jews.

1206
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,563
Sure,

1207
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:17,991
sure.

1208
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,040
And that's true of,

1209
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,760
of uh,

1210
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,370
generally of,

1211
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:20,720
of,

1212
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,331
of people.

1213
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:23,390
I mean it's very hard to
trust childhood memories.

1214
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,460
I'm not sure I should trust
my own memories of that event.

1215
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:29,480
That's another thing that's sort of kind
of disassociated me from it makes it

1216
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,700
hard to now 43.

1217
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,091
Yeah.

1218
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,320
When you look back at six,

1219
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:33,501
I mean,

1220
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:34,460
how much do you really,

1221
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,710
how much do you remember if sex actually
have a creepy amount of memories?

1222
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:39,490
From my childhood?

1223
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,323
Yeah.

1224
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,470
But a legit,

1225
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,270
well that's the question I need to,

1226
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,260
but I don't know how
legitimate they did this.

1227
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,230
A great psychologist,

1228
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,250
child psychologist,

1229
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,283
uh,

1230
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,160
did a lot of studies on this.

1231
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:52,450
And one of the things
he pointed out in his,

1232
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,280
in his own life,

1233
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:54,960
he,

1234
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,260
he had this very vivid memory of being
kidnapped because he was told he was

1235
00:35:59,261 --> 00:35:59,830
kidnapped.

1236
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,850
And then years later,

1237
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:04,330
the person who was supposedly the witness
to the kidnapping admitted that they

1238
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,164
made the story up.

1239
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,920
And so he had this really shocking,

1240
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:11,020
vivid memory through his whole life.

1241
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:13,930
I forget at what point it was
revealed to him and it wasn't true.

1242
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,630
So that's how much we can
be deceived by these things.

1243
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,430
And you asked the conclusion I came to,

1244
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:20,110
and I think it's very healthy conclusion.

1245
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,250
The conclusion I came to is,

1246
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:22,360
I don't know what the fuck happened.

1247
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,201
Right.

1248
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:26,170
And there's still mystery there.

1249
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,500
None of the normal prosaic
explanations work for me.

1250
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:29,930
Right.

1251
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,330
It was not a water hammer.

1252
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,440
It was,

1253
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,980
it was not.

1254
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,251
No,

1255
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,450
it was not a rat making a noise.

1256
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:35,080
That pig.

1257
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,210
It was not a a plumbing problem,

1258
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,870
you know,

1259
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,610
it was not the house settling.

1260
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,330
Do you remember it being really loud?

1261
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,290
Really loud.

1262
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Really loud.

1263
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,980
Like someone slamming a door
or something like that at loud.

1264
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,480
Loudest like a sledge hammer getting,

1265
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,600
getting a weld at its loudest and so
you go outside and there's no one on the

1266
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:55,060
roof.

1267
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,570
Yeah.

1268
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,351
Funny story there.

1269
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:56,660
And My,

1270
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,930
my parents cause I was so,

1271
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,120
I was so young and I remember this,

1272
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,631
this one,

1273
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,100
I know this fricken memory is true.

1274
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:08,370
I remember them taking me outside at
night because we were scared to show me,

1275
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,400
show me that there were raccoons dumping
on the roof because it was nighttime

1276
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,050
and this was the story
that gave their little kid.

1277
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,801
Oh honey,

1278
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,810
it's just raccoons jumping
up and down on the roof.

1279
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,880
And I was young enough that I was like,

1280
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,860
okay raccoon sometimes dope up,

1281
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:21,694
down on the roof.

1282
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,340
Who though?

1283
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,490
I mean if they suppressive,

1284
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,220
they're fucking,

1285
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,690
you know,

1286
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,590
girls would fight back some
gangster shit going on,

1287
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:28,930
gangs,

1288
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,690
raccoons and turning it down on your roof.

1289
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,823
Not enough of them.

1290
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,760
It was an ally.

1291
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,320
Many nights.

1292
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,870
Yeah,

1293
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,651
and too many nights,

1294
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:35,980
man.

1295
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,420
I mean tens of minutes at a time.

1296
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,500
Raccoons are just bouncing up and down
on your roof was like the octagon for the

1297
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:44,370
ultimate fighting championship
when you're sleeping.

1298
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,980
That would be nice to get
out in the middle when you
open the door and they just

1299
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:48,161
get,

1300
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:49,780
goes through his climb
up the trees and hard.

1301
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,110
There's the crafty,

1302
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:53,040
those fucking raccoons.

1303
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,630
I would have set up cameras everywhere.

1304
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,070
I would have figured that shit out too.

1305
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,270
Long time ago though.

1306
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,210
Yeah,

1307
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:58,530
I would.

1308
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,530
I'd put everything in 1975 in 1975 we
weren't walking around with these HD

1309
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,600
cameras.

1310
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,433
That vision,

1311
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,110
I get courtroom sketch artist,

1312
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:08,790
he's just put them on
every corner of the house.

1313
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,630
Courtroom sketches is the dumbest thing
ever that they still have to use someone

1314
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,220
to sketch what's happening.

1315
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,750
You can't take a picture.

1316
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,650
It's the beauty of it.

1317
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,513
What does that mean?

1318
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,030
It's like we're not supposed to be able
to see inside the sacred courtroom where

1319
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:22,590
the decisions are being rendered.

1320
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,521
So instead,

1321
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,370
here's an artist's
depiction of the action.

1322
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,720
The fuck are you showing me drawings for?

1323
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,030
You know he can show
it to me or you can't.

1324
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,040
Is that the a real guy at the table?

1325
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:32,880
That's what he looks like.

1326
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,830
That's the drawing represents
what he looks like.

1327
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,080
Right.

1328
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,370
Show me a fucking picture.

1329
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,204
Stupid.

1330
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:37,661
Okay.

1331
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:38,011
My game,

1332
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:39,820
when we plan a flash would be distracting.

1333
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,990
Is that what it is?

1334
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,340
How about no flashes?

1335
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,990
Yeah,

1336
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,250
it seems pretty easy
to just do no flashes.

1337
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,113
You know,

1338
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,231
it's shutter clicks.

1339
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:47,830
Even weirder.

1340
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,780
Someone's fucking staring
at you and drawing you.

1341
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,640
That's even weirder,

1342
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:52,474
man.

1343
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,171
Imagine,

1344
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,640
you know you're talking about your,

1345
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:56,440
your experience and
trying to tell the truth,

1346
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:57,370
the whole truth and nothing but,

1347
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,000
and some fucking Weirdos.

1348
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,780
I ball in you and drawing your face.

1349
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,670
That's gotta be a little mind fuck.

1350
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,370
And it would be probably affects your
decision making skills when you're in

1351
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,204
court.

1352
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:07,880
Actually,

1353
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,591
it's fucking true.

1354
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,260
If the cameras are a lot easier to handle
that as somebody who was sitting here

1355
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,150
drawing some asshole using
outdated technology and
could be get here on a horse,

1356
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,190
he'd be taking license
with my image to yeah,

1357
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:19,300
he got there on a horse.

1358
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,730
All his books are written in script.

1359
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,360
We have courtroom sketch room
artists for that show that I do.

1360
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,720
They have,

1361
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,230
they draw during the whole con uh,

1362
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,141
live podcasts.

1363
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:29,980
The secret show thing.

1364
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,933
That's hilarious.

1365
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,803
Like here's the Ari,

1366
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,580
let's think the thing that's a good idea

1367
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,330
and we sell it in the
artist's gets all the money.

1368
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,661
No,

1369
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:38,494
it's a good idea.

1370
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,300
That's a way better idea
and use it in court.

1371
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,810
See we found a new use for those people
and I'll have to do that anymore.

1372
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,720
No,

1373
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,400
this is too though.

1374
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,830
So as the years went on and
I would share that story,

1375
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
I stopped sharing it.

1376
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:49,211
Right.

1377
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:52,780
Because I was starting to run into
more and more people who were totally

1378
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,340
adamantly opposed,

1379
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,670
not,

1380
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,440
not only oppose the idea of ghosts,

1381
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,660
I'm pretty suspicious
about the idea of coast.

1382
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,350
Right.

1383
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,630
They were adamantly
opposed to the idea that,

1384
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,010
that there was even a mystery there.

1385
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,770
And so that's kind of what
I hold out for in the book,

1386
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,360
that sometimes we just
need to be able to admit.

1387
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,800
I just say the words,

1388
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,510
I don't know what happened.

1389
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,710
People want to rush to some
kind of conclusion whether
they have enough evidence

1390
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,820
or data or not.

1391
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,780
And I ran into people over the years
who would insist it had to be a water

1392
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:21,850
hammer even though it doesn't fit.

1393
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,810
Uh,

1394
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,430
you know the story at all.

1395
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,550
What is a water hammer?

1396
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,700
That's when the water's Donk,

1397
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:26,881
donk,

1398
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:27,091
donk,

1399
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,241
donk,

1400
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:27,451
donk,

1401
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:27,631
donk,

1402
00:40:27,631 --> 00:40:27,871
donk.

1403
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:28,091
Again,

1404
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:31,780
it has that crazy noise that
I used to live in apartment

1405
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,230
building.

1406
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,070
He heard that a lot.

1407
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:33,780
Yeah.

1408
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,360
Sudden flow of water stops and then
you get that sound because the energy,

1409
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:40,390
the water buildup is converted to caustic
energy cause it's gotta go somewhere.

1410
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,621
Oh,

1411
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:42,460
that's what it is.

1412
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,133
And it doesn't,

1413
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,640
it doesn't last that long.

1414
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,890
And it doesn't make that kind of noise.

1415
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:48,670
And it sounds like,

1416
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,290
it doesn't sound like
it's coming from your,

1417
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,570
your roof or last tens of minutes.

1418
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,550
And it certainly never
locates on the steps,

1419
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,130
but this is all when you were six.

1420
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,521
Yeah.

1421
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,150
So,

1422
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,690
so in the end you kind of
have to trust it or not,

1423
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:01,901
right?

1424
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,160
That's the question you're left with.

1425
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,590
Do I trust my mother and father's account,

1426
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,550
my sister's account,

1427
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,390
my brother's account,

1428
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,740
and you know,

1429
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:10,650
on somewhat on someone like do,

1430
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,900
but can I really buy into the
idea that there are ghosts?

1431
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,091
I mean,

1432
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,230
so one of the things I explored,

1433
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:14,860
and I,

1434
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,910
I find this really interesting,

1435
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:17,590
I mean there are people
out there working with,

1436
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,150
um,

1437
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,060
sort of other,

1438
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:19,540
uh,

1439
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,170
other technologies to determine if maybe
there's an abundance of electromagnetic

1440
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,300
energy in the air in certain areas,

1441
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:27,130
then it fucks with your temporal lobe.

1442
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,900
Then you have drilling.

1443
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,550
I mean,

1444
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:29,770
where,

1445
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,830
where was this that it
was in Pittsburgh maybe.

1446
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,760
And I'm not a lot of fault lines.

1447
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,460
I don't think they're all
others occasional or is
that one in Ohio that they

1448
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,060
just found out that we're
making the earthquake happened,

1449
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,790
something that happened,

1450
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,520
something.

1451
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,000
And,

1452
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,833
um,

1453
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,120
a guy working with infrasound,

1454
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,840
uh,

1455
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,790
getting Vic Tandy did
research and infrasound.

1456
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,880
It's a level of sound beneath
even the range of human hearing,

1457
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,440
but it actually has an effect.

1458
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,740
It can create a sense of pressure
and an easiness in your chest.

1459
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,491
Uh,

1460
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,860
it actually can even
impact sort of the eyeball,

1461
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:02,690
the actual vibration in the air and cause
you to see a cloudy shapes when there

1462
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:03,524
aren't any.

1463
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,150
I don't think any of those
concerns clearly explain,

1464
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,100
uh,

1465
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,380
what ha whatever happened
in my house either.

1466
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,910
But what I like about it is at least,

1467
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,630
at least here somebody is thinking
creatively and not thinking so poorly of

1468
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:16,220
their fellow human that they just,

1469
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:16,401
yeah,

1470
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:19,040
you heard a creaking floorboard and you
jumped to a fucking ghost because you're

1471
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:19,531
that stupid.

1472
00:42:19,531 --> 00:42:21,530
And that's a superstitious it,

1473
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,120
these sorts of explanations,

1474
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,600
I think grant people the
proper dignity to be,

1475
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,473
uh,

1476
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,470
that they're reporting things at least
somewhat accurately write something

1477
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,000
really unusual was happening.

1478
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,741
It's,

1479
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:33,400
um,

1480
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,400
it's a very unfortunate reality that we
live in that I can't trust anybody to

1481
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,590
tell me like what really happened.

1482
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:41,740
Sure.

1483
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,580
So when you,

1484
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:44,680
when a legitimate event,

1485
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,600
if the legitimate event occurs,

1486
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:47,980
it's immediately dismissed.

1487
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:53,610
If you really looked at how many strange
things exist both in the natural world

1488
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,080
and in the,

1489
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:56,590
uh,

1490
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,401
just the,

1491
00:42:57,401 --> 00:43:00,130
just the world of space,

1492
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,510
just the world of dark matter and
supernovas and all those things are way

1493
00:43:04,511 --> 00:43:05,650
crazier than ghosts.

1494
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:06,281
Okay.

1495
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:08,530
A ghosting shit compared to the sun.

1496
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,490
You know what I mean?

1497
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,200
The idea that we're
living in a multiverse,

1498
00:43:11,201 --> 00:43:14,110
that there's an infinite number of us
having this conversation right now and

1499
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:17,980
then something that is life exists at
all that you can see with eyeballs,

1500
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:18,221
you know,

1501
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,640
that is just as freaky as
something that used to live,

1502
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,480
but its essence in some
form stays for some reason.

1503
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I think the idea that this dimension
that we live in is super concrete and you

1504
00:43:31,031 --> 00:43:31,151
know,

1505
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:36,151
just cause you can hit it with a fucking
balled fist and push it into a street

1506
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:37,760
and watch a car slam into it.

1507
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:41,980
But when you're dealing with real solid
objects and that's all there is here,

1508
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,890
I told him necessarily by that I don't,

1509
00:43:44,891 --> 00:43:45,370
I don't,

1510
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:50,370
I don't believe in most of what I hear
in terms of psychics and psychic readings

1511
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:52,330
and ghost stories.

1512
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,280
I think most of it's bullshit,

1513
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,490
but I think it's very possible
that something remains of
you and that you're not

1514
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:04,720
just skin tissue and bone tissue
and blood and more than me.

1515
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,350
Yeah,

1516
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:10,180
there might be something going on and
that something might leave your body and

1517
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:15,181
exist in some other state and almost
an enact assessable environment that's

1518
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,770
parallels us.

1519
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,690
And that's not outside
the realm of possibility.

1520
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,070
It sounds so woo woo,

1521
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,090
but it's not.

1522
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,100
It's not because life itself,

1523
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:24,670
the,

1524
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,050
the whole idea that your,

1525
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:31,051
your body is just this big chemical
reaction and electromagnetic and

1526
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,090
oh that's crazy.

1527
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,690
Neuroscientists can't yet answer the
basic question of how consciousness is

1528
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,290
produced.

1529
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:37,621
Right?

1530
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:41,880
So how we get from the physical stuff
of the brain to nonphysical subjective

1531
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:43,950
experience is a complete
and total mystery.

1532
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,050
And yet it is the thing that
really defines our lives,

1533
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,910
our internal experience of the world.

1534
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,130
And there is no explanation for it.

1535
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,050
Like how scientists get to what's,

1536
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,850
what part of the brain does what?

1537
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,860
Like this guy got an injury here.

1538
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,120
So that removes this part of the brain
that removes his ability to do this.

1539
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,470
He's got an injury here.

1540
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:05,070
So,

1541
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,210
well now we know that this,

1542
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,220
this inhibits walking and this is where,

1543
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:08,551
you know,

1544
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,110
your eyesight is dealt with.

1545
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,560
But what they can't figure out is where's
the thinking person with morals and

1546
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,050
ethics and love?

1547
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,490
Where's he in there?

1548
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,590
Is he just a crackling?

1549
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,820
Is he just the energy that makes
all those cells fire where she,

1550
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,170
where's the girl who can,

1551
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,770
you know,

1552
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,180
who can enjoy the things
that she enjoys and,

1553
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:34,200
and enjoy the food that
she can do is where,

1554
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,040
where's all that?

1555
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,570
And there's something
else to consider too,

1556
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:36,751
Joe,

1557
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:37,290
is that,

1558
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:37,561
okay,

1559
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:41,070
so we get these damage to our brain
and we'll lose certain faculties.

1560
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,620
Sometimes we only lose
them for a certain time,

1561
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,130
right?

1562
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,420
Because of neuroplasticity.

1563
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:50,310
These things come back online and where
an or other parts of the brain simply

1564
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,480
pick up those functions.

1565
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,970
And this is easier to do when you're
younger than when you're older.

1566
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:54,600
But,

1567
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,380
um,

1568
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,280
the thing that fascinates me are people
who will lose their memory for a certain

1569
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:02,580
time and then those
memories begin to come back.

1570
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,601
And this is a,

1571
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:04,081
again,

1572
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:05,820
a relatively common thing.

1573
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,350
Sure.

1574
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:06,860
How,

1575
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,710
how does that happen?

1576
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,180
Where were the memory is stored?

1577
00:46:09,181 --> 00:46:10,740
Where did they go and they were gone?

1578
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:14,580
It's a very good question and it's one
that happens when people get concussions.

1579
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,560
There's a concussions cause a great
deal of short term memory loss.

1580
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,641
It's out of the,

1581
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:20,791
uh,

1582
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,440
actually looked at this
a little bit in the book.

1583
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:27,441
I mean doctors will assess how
severe a person's injury was by,

1584
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:28,590
uh,

1585
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,150
coming up with a degree of memory loss.

1586
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:30,930
Like asking them,

1587
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,940
what's the last thing you
remember before the injury?

1588
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:34,830
What's the first thing you
remember after the injury?

1589
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,470
And the,

1590
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,990
the longer the blank period,

1591
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:38,610
the more hurt you are.

1592
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,950
I looked at near death experiences
in the book and that's,

1593
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,260
so that's one of the things that
you mean there because what's,

1594
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:48,261
what's weird about these guys is that in
girls is they oftentimes come back with

1595
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,510
a totally flowing memory of an event
that should have knocked their memory,

1596
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:57,900
producing capabilities offline
for a certain amount of time.

1597
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,000
And yet somehow didn't seem too,

1598
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,463
um,

1599
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,690
and I'm,

1600
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,960
I'm okay with saying like,

1601
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,100
like within your death experience,

1602
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,180
I take a lot of flack really from both
sides because believers will contact me

1603
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:11,190
and say they're upset that I
won't come out and say that,

1604
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:11,671
you know,

1605
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,430
the near death experience is smoking
gun evidence that there's an afterlife.

1606
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,280
Uh,

1607
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,541
you know,

1608
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,850
I don't think it is smoking gun
evidence that there's an afterlife,

1609
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,920
but I also don't think
it's yet been explained.

1610
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,000
And,

1611
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,840
and again,

1612
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:24,750
we end up back in this place where
everybody wants to act like they know

1613
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:25,141
everything.

1614
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,000
Everybody wants to push
everything into a conclusion.

1615
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,840
I think the most rational
thing to say is we,

1616
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,010
we fully understand that

1617
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,461
experience.

1618
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:30,790
Yet,

1619
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,240
you know,

1620
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,470
in the near death experience,

1621
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,350
it has to be related to what you're,

1622
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,200
you're on brain can produce as
far as psychedelic chemicals.

1623
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:43,060
It has to be your own brain produces the
most potent psychedelic drug known to

1624
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:43,570
man.

1625
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,420
And why wouldn't it produce that
shit if you were going to die?

1626
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,460
If you're in high stress periods,

1627
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:49,300
if you're freaking,

1628
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:49,601
if it's,

1629
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:50,530
this is the end,

1630
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:52,060
your body thinks this is it,

1631
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,980
we're going to die and then it comes back,

1632
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:54,791
you know,

1633
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:55,091
you,

1634
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:57,910
you've very likely could have come
back from a psychedelic trip as well.

1635
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,350
Well,

1636
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:58,891
let me tell you,

1637
00:47:58,891 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm just going to cut
straight to the chase.

1638
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,300
The best evidence that
the MD has to provide.

1639
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,840
Okay.

1640
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,250
This is the Best Janice minor holding
a researcher did a study where she went

1641
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:10,410
through all the medical literature and
all the research that's been done in

1642
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:10,581
India,

1643
00:48:10,581 --> 00:48:13,020
you so far and she tabulated,

1644
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,710
um,

1645
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,970
veridical perceptions,

1646
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,890
so accurate and true perceptions that
people got wow quote out of body.

1647
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,430
And what she came up with is that,

1648
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,443
um,

1649
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,100
out of 38 cases in the medical literature
where people were able to recount what

1650
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:34,101
was going on in the room when they were
flatlined or above the table and all

1651
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,000
that stuff of stuff,

1652
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,600
right when they were in this
sort of severe physical distress,

1653
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,750
35 of them were accurate and
every detail they reported,

1654
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,790
two of them had minor errors.

1655
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,320
This sort of errors I'd have,

1656
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:46,740
you know,

1657
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,690
if I was trying to describe
what I had for breakfast today,

1658
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:48,890
you know,

1659
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:49,050
I mean,

1660
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,380
I might miss something and then one
person was just totally off the freaking

1661
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:52,980
reservation.

1662
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,400
Right.

1663
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,530
One person who is just,

1664
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,950
she totally wrong about everything.

1665
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,240
Um,

1666
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,230
but 30 what was the,

1667
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,390
what was funny about his team or her?

1668
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,231
You know what,

1669
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:01,560
I haven't,

1670
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,540
I haven't read all the
details of what they said,

1671
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:04,291
but it was,

1672
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:04,620
I mean,

1673
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,790
they were just off on everything.

1674
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:05,891
I,

1675
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:07,140
no idea what machines were used.

1676
00:49:07,141 --> 00:49:10,080
They had no idea how many people were
in the room had been an incredibly

1677
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:10,830
accurate,

1678
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,440
35 of them were accurate
count of how many phones?

1679
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,180
38.

1680
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:14,670
Oh my God.

1681
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,503
In their entirety.

1682
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,660
Now the skeptical response to this is
that the researchers themselves sort of a

1683
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:21,440
quote,

1684
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,780
you know,

1685
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,810
would have suppressed information that
wasn't accurate because they were so

1686
00:49:24,811 --> 00:49:29,450
blown away by what they were
hearing that they went ahead and,

1687
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,970
um,

1688
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,910
only recorded sort of positive responses
because the negative ones weren't

1689
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:35,670
making any impact with them
or weren't landing with them.

1690
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,833
And the other,

1691
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,530
uh,

1692
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:37,830
uh,

1693
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,060
the thing I'll propose is that,

1694
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:39,790
well,

1695
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,390
um,

1696
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,120
maybe

1697
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,690
pretty serious accusation and why,

1698
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:45,610
why would they say that they have
the questions and as all the,

1699
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,520
everything's been recorded,

1700
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:47,354
of course,

1701
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,000
uh,

1702
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,480
you know,

1703
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,580
we'd have to go back through every
last study to figure out what,

1704
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,060
you know,

1705
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,830
what research materials
they had in every case.

1706
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,251
But I mean,

1707
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:53,970
that's just one,

1708
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,721
one objection.

1709
00:49:54,721 --> 00:49:56,370
They lodge any other
objection in lounges that,

1710
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:56,820
well,

1711
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,460
maybe they had some sort
of anesthesia awareness,

1712
00:49:59,461 --> 00:49:59,701
right?

1713
00:49:59,701 --> 00:49:59,931
The Pr,

1714
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:01,170
if the person wasn't anesthesia,

1715
00:50:01,171 --> 00:50:03,270
sometimes you're still aware
of what's going on in the room.

1716
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,380
Um,

1717
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:04,970
so they'll,

1718
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,420
they'll log that one in there too.

1719
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,320
Or they'll,

1720
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,100
they'll say that,

1721
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,933
um,

1722
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,113
uh,

1723
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,900
they call it a PR profusion
level of blood to the brain.

1724
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,680
Maybe they were getting cardiac massage
and that does supply a certain amount of

1725
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,641
blood to your brain.

1726
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:21,440
So maybe,

1727
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,781
uh,

1728
00:50:21,781 --> 00:50:24,930
some part of the brain was still operating
and able to retain a certain amount

1729
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:25,764
of information,

1730
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:26,910
but it just,

1731
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:27,560
it's,

1732
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,850
these are possibilities.

1733
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,290
These are ideas

1734
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,170
that maybe explain it,

1735
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,640
but 35 out of 38,

1736
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,550
that's it.

1737
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:35,960
It's,

1738
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,570
it's remarkable and it's
enough to push it into an area.

1739
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:39,101
And we have to say,

1740
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:39,710
you know,

1741
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,750
maybe something is going on here.

1742
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:41,901
I mean,

1743
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:45,650
do you ever feel in a
psychedelic experience that
you get accurate information,

1744
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,970
not just stuff that your
mind is coming up with,

1745
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,740
but some sort of signal or contact
with something that's quote real?

1746
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,980
Will you believe that whether or not
it's happening is the big debate,

1747
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,300
right?

1748
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,820
You know,

1749
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,820
there's people that absolutely believe
that they're in contact with entities and

1750
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:07,100
there's other people that believe
that you're just accessing the,

1751
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:07,341
the,

1752
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:12,341
the imagination and the mind is
interfacing with distortion of its visual

1753
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:18,611
abilities in massive form
and you're putting context
to that and trying to make,

1754
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,250
make like rational understanding of it.

1755
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,170
One of my favorite stories in the book,

1756
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,060
um,

1757
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,371
I,

1758
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:26,810
when I was researching
and near death experience,

1759
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:29,780
I look pretty deeply in the
story of Elizabeth Kubler
Ross who wrote the book on

1760
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:30,614
death and dying,

1761
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,550
which kind of galvanized the whole hospice
movement and made end of life care in

1762
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:35,900
this country and really around the world.

1763
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,733
A lot more humane.

1764
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,600
And she is one of the first people ever
to encounter the near death experience

1765
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:45,440
and she did it before that
phrase was even coined.

1766
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:49,820
I mean it was Raymond Mooney wrote the
book in 1975 she in the 60s was running

1767
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:52,110
across patients in the hospital ward.

1768
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:56,030
She was a psychologist who are telling
these same kinds of stories and when I

1769
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,000
find really a couple layers
to this when I get to you,

1770
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:02,300
but what's really fascinating is she
wanted to reject this stuff at first,

1771
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:05,570
completely her research partner,

1772
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:05,991
the reverend,

1773
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:06,261
while I'm,

1774
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:07,020
we will Amara,

1775
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,510
who is really terrific dude,

1776
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:09,740
I loved interviewing this guy.

1777
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:10,610
He's still around.

1778
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,110
He was a reverend and he
had been appointed to sort
of go along on the hospital

1779
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:16,130
wards with her.

1780
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,650
What she was doing is very controversial.

1781
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:20,870
Nobody talked to the
terminally ill at that point.

1782
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,960
They were the sort of shunted off to the
side and so the fact that she was doing

1783
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,820
this was was really angering.

1784
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:26,900
A lot of the hospital staff.

1785
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:30,260
So the administration put this reverend
with her as a way of saying it,

1786
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,480
kind of giving her their blessing
as a way of saying she's,

1787
00:52:33,481 --> 00:52:33,591
it's,

1788
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:34,700
she's not her alone.

1789
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:35,061
Right.

1790
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:35,570
There's,

1791
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:39,080
there's somebody with her and I would
imagine Ramaro was pretty formidable,

1792
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,890
so nobody wanted to fuck you over
tomorrow because I met the guy,

1793
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:43,724
he's awesome.

1794
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,713
But anyway,

1795
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:48,830
one of the early stories they encountered
before they started even researching

1796
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,500
this experience because they'd hear
these stories and kind of blow them off

1797
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,640
because they didn't know
what to do with them.

1798
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,013
Finally,

1799
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:55,820
he's out near the elevators.

1800
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:59,450
One day a woman goes into cardiac arrest.

1801
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:00,501
He,

1802
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,760
she's resuscitated right.

1803
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,720
Right there in the hall,

1804
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,021
you know,

1805
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,640
they went to work on it
or they resuscitated her.

1806
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,240
He goes to see her later and she starts
describing the scene of what happened.

1807
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,260
Exactly.

1808
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,110
And she even describes that she was
able in this stuff sounds ridiculous.

1809
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:12,590
Right.

1810
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,590
But she was able to float in at one point
behind a resident who was taking notes

1811
00:53:18,951 --> 00:53:20,420
because one of the things they did with,

1812
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:20,641
you know,

1813
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:23,300
if you've got an inexperienced doctor
on the scene like that and there's an

1814
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,440
emergency thing going on,

1815
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,123
they generally just don't

1816
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,870
just take notes on what's going on.

1817
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,090
It's a way of giving them something
to do and keeping them out of the way.

1818
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:33,600
The people who really know what
he's done right now and um,

1819
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:39,050
she was able to describe what he had
previously doodled on the notepad that he

1820
00:53:39,571 --> 00:53:41,730
was now taking notes on
her resuscitation on.

1821
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,301
Now,

1822
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,300
Reverend Amara completely rejects this,

1823
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:45,601
right?

1824
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:50,601
He hears this and he thinks I'm going
to prove you wrong because this doesn't

1825
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:51,714
fit his dogma.

1826
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,000
This is not what's supposed
to happen when somebody dies.

1827
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:54,540
Right?

1828
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,540
So he goes and he finds the med student
and he looks at the page of doodles or

1829
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,190
the page of notes and it has some doodles
and the doodles match with what she

1830
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:06,024
described.

1831
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,630
He asked the student if he never
interfaced with this patient and all,

1832
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:12,300
they hadn't ain't asked the patient
if they ever interface with students.

1833
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,134
She hadn't.

1834
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,491
You know,

1835
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:19,350
what we're left with now is we can say
that Reverend Mwalimu Mara is lying.

1836
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,530
And I will never fucking say
that because he wasn't right.

1837
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,520
Um,

1838
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,430
or we have a genuine mystery
here and that's where I land.

1839
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,510
There's a genuine mystery here.

1840
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,760
So th can one read about this?

1841
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,690
Is there obviously

1842
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,540
my book,

1843
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,570
this is completely in your book.

1844
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,570
The story is it was
recorded anywhere else.

1845
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,560
Um,

1846
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,290
you know,

1847
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,550
intriguingly,

1848
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,110
um,

1849
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,990
Kubler Ross herself wrote about it.

1850
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,710
Not,

1851
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,260
I don't think it is great a detail as
I ended up doing it through a Mara,

1852
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:47,771
you know,

1853
00:54:47,771 --> 00:54:48,604
because she had,

1854
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,740
so what happens is they have this event
happened there really shaken by it and

1855
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,670
um,

1856
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,340
but they also are noticing
that the patients who are
reporting these experiences

1857
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:58,174
are changing.

1858
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:00,910
They are no longer afraid to die.

1859
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,121
I mean,

1860
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:05,380
you've got to imagine the anxiety that
you would confront a terminal diagnosis

1861
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:06,400
with these people.

1862
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:10,750
Start losing that anxiety and
start wanting to talk to her about,

1863
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:10,931
you know,

1864
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:11,170
what,

1865
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,260
I want to clean up my
relationships before I go.

1866
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,250
They start talking to live in hard and
the time they have left rather than

1867
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:20,650
trembling at the fact that
they're going to pass on.

1868
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,121
It's,

1869
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:22,780
it's a huge dramatic effect.

1870
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,240
And that's when they decided
to start taking notes.

1871
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:29,770
Like this whole idea that the near death
experiences merely wishful thinking is

1872
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,963
bullshit,

1873
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,361
you know,

1874
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:34,120
and it's at least bullshitting
in her experience at a Mara,

1875
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:34,990
his experience of it,

1876
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:39,250
they rejected it till they really couldn't
reject it anymore because here they

1877
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:41,650
are researching what happens
when you're terminally ill.

1878
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,390
And one of the things that was coming up,

1879
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,930
uh,

1880
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,830
in dozens of cases where people who
were losing their fear because of this

1881
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:48,220
event,

1882
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:51,070
and that's how they ended up justifying
doing any research on it at all.

1883
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,630
So when she wrote her book,

1884
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:54,070
she had a lot of
different stories to tell.

1885
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:55,890
I don't think she hit that story
as hard as she should have.

1886
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,760
Um,

1887
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,240
the,

1888
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,240
the near death experience being created
or being facilitated maybe is a better

1889
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:05,041
word by,

1890
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:05,520
um,

1891
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,700
by a psychedelic experience by
the brain producing chemicals is,

1892
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:10,300
um,

1893
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:10,661
it's,

1894
00:56:10,661 --> 00:56:11,100
it's,

1895
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,960
it doesn't mean that there
isn't something still going on.

1896
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,800
It might mean that that's a chemical
gateway to whatever's going on and that's

1897
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:22,801
how the brain can release is this stuff
and it interfaces with whatever the fuck

1898
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,290
it does.

1899
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:25,250
When you have these trips,

1900
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,270
there's a researcher,

1901
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:27,260
are you familiar with them?

1902
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:29,120
I remember their last is a Carhart Harris.

1903
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,780
No.

1904
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,613
Um,

1905
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,360
he did a study on,

1906
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,253
um,

1907
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:34,161
well mushrooms,

1908
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:36,080
the active ingredient in mushrooms,

1909
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,190
um,

1910
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,880
with uh,

1911
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,220
uh,

1912
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,730
psilocybin and he,

1913
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:41,923
um,

1914
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,230
he found that it seemed to
suppress a brain activity.

1915
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:49,130
The brain actually seemed less active,

1916
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:51,350
particularly the parts of
the brain responsible for,

1917
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:52,010
uh,

1918
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,760
making connections and relaying
information from one spot to another.

1919
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,330
Yeah.

1920
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,280
What he thought was really
interesting about that,

1921
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,390
and I would tend to agree with them,

1922
00:56:59,420 --> 00:56:59,661
is it,

1923
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:04,340
you would think at moments of heightened
experience and heightened perception

1924
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,080
that we would see an
excitement in the brain,

1925
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:09,500
right.

1926
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,160
Um,

1927
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,330
greater activity.

1928
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,760
Well here he was seeing
a diminished activity,

1929
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,280
less activity and it calls,

1930
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,970
he called me back anyway to the idea that
a lot of what the brain does is filter

1931
00:57:19,971 --> 00:57:20,810
our experience.

1932
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,500
A lot of our processing is
unconscious information.

1933
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,660
We're picking up from the
environment all the time.

1934
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,520
That doesn't rise into our awareness,

1935
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,400
our brains making the decision for us
as to whether or not we need to be,

1936
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:31,940
you know,

1937
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,220
worried about that little noise
behind us for the creaking,

1938
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:35,270
the chair's making or whatever.

1939
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:35,870
You know,

1940
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,840
we don't even register it
necessarily consciously.

1941
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,990
And so the question becomes
when you take this chemical,

1942
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,960
which I may or may not be
interested in taking myself,

1943
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:46,430
I think we might be interested in it.

1944
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:46,881
I think,

1945
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:47,900
I think I might be,

1946
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,060
when you take this chemical,

1947
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,560
are you actually stopping the brain
from filtering so much information?

1948
00:57:54,561 --> 00:57:57,200
Are you actually accessing more
of the raw data that's out there?

1949
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,191
Yeah,

1950
00:57:58,191 --> 00:57:58,940
that's a,

1951
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,530
that's an interesting question.

1952
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,543
The um,

1953
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,420
the,

1954
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:07,420
the thing about the mushroom experience
is that the mushroom experience actually

1955
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,160
mirrors Norman,

1956
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:10,400
huge,

1957
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,320
normal human near neurochemistry.

1958
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:13,221
Part of,

1959
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:13,610
uh,

1960
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:16,300
what makes up a mushroom is an,

1961
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,940
and dimethyltryptamine you mean the same
stuff that you bring produces or your

1962
00:58:19,941 --> 00:58:21,110
lungs and your liver.

1963
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,550
They know that the human body produces
it and it's been thought that the pineal

1964
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:25,881
gland,

1965
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,790
a lot of people get very angry if you're
not at the very specific about this

1966
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:29,210
cause they,

1967
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,180
it's just anecdotal evidence
that the pineal gland,

1968
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:34,460
which is the third eye
of eastern mysticism,

1969
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:37,040
producers this whatever produces it,

1970
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,960
whatever they find one day,

1971
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:41,360
ultimately they believe
it's the pineal gland,

1972
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:45,380
but you got to cut people's brains open
within like a certain amount of time

1973
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:49,000
while they're dead and then
extract it to see if it's like,

1974
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,281
yeah,

1975
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:51,860
it would have been
intense I think to find,

1976
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,480
they're trying to find better ways to,

1977
00:58:53,481 --> 00:58:53,750
uh,

1978
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,583
to measure.

1979
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:59,480
But the most important thing is it's
unquestionably produced in the body.

1980
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,420
So the body is unquestionably producing
this incredibly potent human neuro

1981
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:04,971
transmitter,

1982
00:59:04,971 --> 00:59:08,420
which is part of the
ingredients of mushrooms.

1983
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:13,340
Like psilocybin mushroom is something
like four Fox oarlock say n and

1984
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,420
dimethyltryptamine.

1985
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:15,160
And I know I,

1986
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,360
I fucked up the first
part the way you say it,

1987
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:18,081
but it's,

1988
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:18,621
it's and,

1989
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,810
and dimethyl trip team
with something tagged on.

1990
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,960
And my point is that people that take
mushrooms have the exact same sort of

1991
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:31,841
feeling when it comes to that
without the near death sort of um,

1992
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,090
connotation to it that they will die,

1993
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,210
but they have the feeling like they
have to clean up relationships.

1994
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,630
They have the feeling like they want
to live like right now with joy and

1995
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:42,464
happiness.

1996
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,030
It's a very religious experience for
a lot of people and a lot of scholars

1997
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:50,240
actually believe it's the
origin of religious experience
and you know about the

1998
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,220
death anxiety research going
on there right now too,

1999
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:52,460
right?

2000
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:52,851
Yes.

2001
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:53,100
Yeah,

2002
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:53,510
I do.

2003
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,810
Yeah.

2004
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,280
Fantastic stuff.

2005
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,860
If I do a fringe ology
to which I intend to,

2006
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:01,940
I intend to look pretty deeply into deeply
like as in you're going to take them.

2007
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,290
Yeah.

2008
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,910
You're going to have to look.

2009
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:06,080
I do emersion journalism.

2010
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:06,950
I mean I debated like,

2011
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,030
am I going to be coy or not?

2012
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:09,920
But like I do emersion journalism,

2013
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:11,751
that's what I do.

2014
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:14,330
I get into what I'm reporting
on as much as I can.

2015
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,630
I think I'm a psychedelic
experiences are very,

2016
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:18,464
very helpful.

2017
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,190
They can certainly send you off
a path and to the nutty land,

2018
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:27,380
but I think they're very helpful and
they're probably part of what's made us

2019
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:28,700
humans in the first place.

2020
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,181
I mean,

2021
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:32,180
every single religion has some
sort of substance that they,

2022
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:32,840
you know,

2023
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,700
they talk about whether it's monetary,

2024
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,331
whether it's,

2025
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,060
you know,

2026
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:36,680
Soma,

2027
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,130
there's,

2028
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,550
there's like so many of them throughout
which are clearly some sort of

2029
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:45,551
psychedelic entheogenic they would take
and ritual form and help them connect to

2030
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,430
God.

2031
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,400
It might have aided evolution in some way.

2032
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,090
Yeah,

2033
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:49,520
that's,

2034
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:49,880
yeah.

2035
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,640
The Terence Mckenna stoned
ape theory is a fascinating,

2036
01:00:52,641 --> 01:00:54,320
fascinating idea and it's,

2037
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,951
you know,

2038
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:56,990
it's really one of those
who the fuck knows things.

2039
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,660
It's tough to go back and try to
figure out what the hell happened.

2040
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,040
That turned us from,

2041
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,431
you know,

2042
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:06,431
some sort of monkey type creature in ape
of a lower age to however it became a

2043
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:08,744
human Ming.

2044
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:09,950
I just think,

2045
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,830
I think in general we need to be willing
to say who the fuck knows more often.

2046
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,360
Well if you do mushrooms,

2047
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:16,280
it should say who the fuck knows all day.

2048
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,870
Cause if you do it
you're just going to go,

2049
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:18,440
I didn't,

2050
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,150
how could I have known that that's there.

2051
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,620
How did you know?

2052
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,060
And that DMT is mushrooms
times a million plus aliens.

2053
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:31,750
So it's impossible to even wrap a word
around it and all those things can uh,

2054
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,110
they can change you just like a
religious experience could change you.

2055
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:40,070
They can also freak you the fuck out
and make you think you're haunted.

2056
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,050
Like afterward we can,

2057
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,333
you can lose,

2058
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,450
you could blow a fuse.

2059
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,440
It's a lot of possible for a
lot of people just do too much.

2060
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,280
It's all about the situation
or yourself and find,

2061
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,213
do you find that,

2062
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,830
I mean I would take it with so
much excitement at this point,

2063
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:57,260
like just so much like you would,

2064
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,070
let's do it,

2065
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:58,920
but you're not crazy.

2066
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:00,070
You're a successful author.

2067
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:01,190
He seemed like a nice guy.

2068
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,980
If you're a naughty person
and ingest that shit,

2069
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,660
if you're barely hanging on to sanity,

2070
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,380
I wouldn't,

2071
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,580
I wouldn't recommend it.

2072
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,250
What was dis what,

2073
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:10,970
um,

2074
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,860
what was the most shocking find for
you in the writing of this book?

2075
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:16,110
What,

2076
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:16,670
what,

2077
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:19,620
what's the one thing that set
you back and really made you go,

2078
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:20,190
wow,

2079
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,930
I might've started with the telepathy,

2080
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:23,230
but the other thing was meaning,

2081
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,620
um,

2082
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,230
Ricky soils in Stephenville,

2083
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:25,860
Texas.

2084
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,431
He was a,

2085
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:27,210
uh,

2086
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,370
one of the witnesses to what
became known and Ufo circles is a,

2087
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,900
the Stevenville lights this January 8th,

2088
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:34,980
I think 2008,

2089
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,210
um,

2090
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,100
citing and a soils,

2091
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:39,600
eh,

2092
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,430
so on January 8th,

2093
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,270
dozens of people I like to say they had
the misfortune of looking out because,

2094
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,320
um,

2095
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,810
they face a lot of heat after
they reported what they saw.

2096
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:49,830
Um,

2097
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,690
but it was some kind of,

2098
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,573
um,

2099
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,290
series of lights in the sky that moved in,

2100
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:59,040
such with such a unity that it seemed
to be one craft would have been very,

2101
01:02:59,041 --> 01:02:59,874
very big.

2102
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:00,600
Um,

2103
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,400
at what point it was actually trailed by,

2104
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,350
have sixteens that
couldn't catch up to it.

2105
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:05,790
And,

2106
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,270
um,

2107
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,180
these were the sorts of reports you're
getting at as Steven belt at the time.

2108
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,750
And Ricky came forward to the newspaper
and said that he had seen something many

2109
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:17,250
weeks before.

2110
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,671
Uh,

2111
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:22,671
I think it was shortly after Thanksgiving
and it was a solo daytime siding and

2112
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,780
it was the wildest story of all
the stories and ever for told me.

2113
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:28,111
Right.

2114
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:28,921
And in relation to the book,

2115
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:31,980
this was probably the wildest and
part of that had to do with the,

2116
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,150
with Ricky himself.

2117
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:34,770
He didn't want to tell me the story.

2118
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,030
I had to go through an intermediary who
talked him into ultimately speaking to

2119
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:39,750
me.

2120
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,680
As far as I'm aware,

2121
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:42,750
he has not done another interview since,

2122
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,780
and we're now looking at three and
a half years since I spoke to him.

2123
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,200
He made not a dime on this,

2124
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:49,650
you know,

2125
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,251
if anything,

2126
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:52,050
he just faced a lot of ridicule,

2127
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:52,710
uh,

2128
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,670
locally in Stephenville first.

2129
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:55,680
So,

2130
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,960
except of course from the people who'd
seen it or had a loved one see it.

2131
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,543
And um,

2132
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,720
so he has the siding,

2133
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:01,590
he's out hunting.

2134
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,970
And this is one of the things that people
use to sort of subtly undermine him.

2135
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:06,331
I,

2136
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:06,460
you know,

2137
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,550
in the same way that Monica Lewinsky
was sort of framed for all of America by

2138
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:12,270
the fact that the dress that ended up
with a semen stain came from the gap,

2139
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,111
right?

2140
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:14,580
So we now we know where she shops.

2141
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:16,340
Like she's this low rent little girl.

2142
01:04:16,341 --> 01:04:16,740
All right?

2143
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,510
That's how people did her end.

2144
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:19,650
Um,

2145
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:20,430
with,

2146
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,121
with Ricky,

2147
01:04:21,121 --> 01:04:24,480
one of the things people like to report
sort of demean him is that we call him a

2148
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:25,314
deer hunter,

2149
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:25,920
right?

2150
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:26,641
He's a father.

2151
01:04:26,641 --> 01:04:27,451
He's a machinist.

2152
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:28,590
He's had his job for 15,

2153
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:29,401
20 years.

2154
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:31,080
You mean he's a lot more
than the deer hunter,

2155
01:04:31,081 --> 01:04:32,730
but he was out hunting
deer when this happened.

2156
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:37,170
Why did they think that that's somehow
or another get located him as a hick?

2157
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:37,860
You know what I mean?

2158
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,461
He's in Stephenville,

2159
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:38,821
Texas,

2160
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,170
which is literally a cow town.

2161
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,570
You were talking before about
the cowboy with kerosene games.

2162
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:43,920
These are cowboys.

2163
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,600
These are people who are raising cattle,

2164
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,320
right?

2165
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,860
And,

2166
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,310
um,

2167
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,040
the cliche of,

2168
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:51,330
of Ufo sightings is that it's,

2169
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,260
it's quoted six.

2170
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:52,800
See them,

2171
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,580
right?

2172
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:53,791
Uh,

2173
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,624
one of the cliches.

2174
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,773
But anyway,

2175
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:56,790
um,

2176
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:01,790
Ricky's out deer hunting and he trips
over a branch and he doesn't fall down,

2177
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,360
but he has to know sort of steady
himself and he glances up and he notices

2178
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:06,811
overhead.

2179
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:11,130
Now something he ended up saying
it was 300 feet over his head.

2180
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:15,960
He gauged this by the fact that there's
a water tower in the community that is

2181
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,130
300 feet high and it seemed
about the same height.

2182
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,810
He cannot see an edge to whatever
it is that's floating above him.

2183
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,670
And it's not making any sound,

2184
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,740
but it is hanging over the trees.

2185
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,990
And in it there are this series
of sort of inverted cones,

2186
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:36,550
which he intuitively suspected must be
part of the propulsion propulsion system.

2187
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,380
So the narrow part is up further into
the craft and then it widens as it

2188
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:41,171
telescopes down.

2189
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:41,890
Right?

2190
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,700
And so there's these series of
inverted cones and his first instinct,

2191
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:49,900
and I think people use this to sort of
position him to his first instinct was to

2192
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:50,710
put his gun on it,

2193
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:52,090
but put his sight on it,

2194
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:52,660
right?

2195
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,530
Just instinct.

2196
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,513
What the fuck is that?

2197
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:54,870
I've got,

2198
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:55,270
you know,

2199
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:58,870
he was pointing the gun at it and
then quickly within a second or two,

2200
01:05:58,871 --> 01:05:59,704
realize,

2201
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,713
you know,

2202
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,050
I'm not going to shoot it,

2203
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:02,501
this thing,

2204
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,191
whatever it is,

2205
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:04,120
I'm not going to shoot at it.

2206
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,440
And so he,

2207
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:08,440
he lowers his gun and in
room telling me about this,

2208
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,670
that he just told himself,

2209
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:10,510
calm down.

2210
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,850
Remember as much of this as you can.

2211
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,170
Just look at it,

2212
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,303
take it in.

2213
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,160
And then whom,

2214
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:17,900
uh,

2215
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,990
I forget exactly how long
he was looking at it,

2216
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:24,730
but for a little while and it
just shot off and it went so fast.

2217
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:25,360
He said,

2218
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,950
there's no word for this kind of speed.

2219
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,410
There's no word that can
describe this kind of speed.

2220
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:33,190
It went from being blocking my entire
field division because it was so big to

2221
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:34,870
just shooting up into the air.

2222
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:35,890
Um,

2223
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:36,550
like,

2224
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:40,750
like a lightning flash was so
convincing to you about his story.

2225
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,051
Well,

2226
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:42,880
here's what was here
was the convincing part.

2227
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,090
I mean,

2228
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:45,820
I'm used to sitting across
from people and having me,

2229
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,211
you know,

2230
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,250
and having them tell me
all kinds of information.

2231
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,443
Um,

2232
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,830
and I have to look at various tells and
just sort of see how I feel about them.

2233
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:54,041
Right.

2234
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:54,874
Are they telling the truth?

2235
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,060
Ricky just seemed utterly,

2236
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:59,440
completely truthful.

2237
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:00,990
He wasn't getting nothing from this,

2238
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,740
that the,

2239
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,020
you know,

2240
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,170
obviously the skeptics point of view,

2241
01:07:04,171 --> 01:07:05,680
the cynics can come in and go,

2242
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:06,610
what if he was crazy?

2243
01:07:06,611 --> 01:07:07,780
What if he's a good liar?

2244
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,520
You're basing your belief off.

2245
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,840
This is the most shocking thing.

2246
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,030
An anecdotal story from a good liar.

2247
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:13,751
Well like I said,

2248
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:15,040
I want to start with
the telepathy actually.

2249
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,960
Cause I could look at that
research myself in judge it.

2250
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:17,230
But,

2251
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,051
but you know,

2252
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:18,884
he freaked you out.

2253
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,070
He freaked me out in this
sense because here's the thing,

2254
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:21,580
Joe,

2255
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:21,911
to me,

2256
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:23,260
he is demonstrably not crazy.

2257
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:24,400
He's fully functional.

2258
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:25,720
He's still got the same job.

2259
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:29,350
He's still got the same friends
you go drinking with them.

2260
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,840
I actually met him for lunch when we could
have a beer or two and just hammered.

2261
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:36,190
You don't know the dude and
unless you've seen him hammered,

2262
01:07:36,191 --> 01:07:39,370
you don't know my wife and
kids and he's got a whole life.

2263
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:40,830
I was running that line.

2264
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,910
The fucking Ted Haggard,

2265
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,050
the guy,

2266
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,240
the church Guy Smokes meth.

2267
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,480
And so interesting to me
about a story like that.

2268
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:52,510
What we're left with is the idea
that what we have to say as well,

2269
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:53,050
he must,

2270
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,160
he must be crazy.

2271
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,590
Something must be off right with him.

2272
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,560
What was it people saw
several weeks later?

2273
01:07:59,561 --> 01:07:59,960
I mean,

2274
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,740
one of the things that interests me
about that story is they were very near a

2275
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:04,690
military base and in,

2276
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:04,991
and again,

2277
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,771
this is all in the book,

2278
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:09,610
but one of the things that happened to
him after he reported his signing as he

2279
01:08:09,611 --> 01:08:12,730
started getting calls from somebody who
was identifying themselves as a member

2280
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:13,564
of the military,

2281
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,160
who is advising him not to
about this anymore and saying

2282
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,993
they wanted to meet with him.

2283
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,710
That was me.

2284
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,543
I was calling.

2285
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,811
I'll just try and get,

2286
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:19,980
uh,

2287
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,130
get them to come on the podcast.

2288
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:22,770
It was Robert Deniro.

2289
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,920
I was rehearsing my role and you're all,

2290
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,633
uh,

2291
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,810
yeah.

2292
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,501
You know,

2293
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:32,590
I wish he just pulled out his phone and
took a picture of that would have been

2294
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:34,270
half one mother fucker out there.

2295
01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:35,350
To your hunting without a phone.

2296
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,653
A funny part about it,

2297
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:38,850
this one of the witnesses,

2298
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,560
a constable,

2299
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,010
um,

2300
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:42,270
that's what they call their sheriff there.

2301
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,170
Um,

2302
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,003
Leroy Gaten,

2303
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,880
right?

2304
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,520
Had a camera nearby
when he had his siding,

2305
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:52,550
it was in his car and he was 10 feet
from his car and he had to make a choice.

2306
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,860
Do I take my eyes off this unbelievable
sight and miss it or do I go grab the

2307
01:08:57,961 --> 01:08:58,590
camera?

2308
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,350
And his choice was to
stay rooted to the spot.

2309
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,603
And,

2310
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,290
and I think that that's another thing
where I just sort of cautioned the

2311
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:05,701
skeptics.

2312
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:06,750
I mean at the end of the day,

2313
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:07,830
you know,

2314
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:11,010
what they saw in Stephenville is
an unidentified flying object.

2315
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,190
And we ended up with believers
who hear that and say,

2316
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:15,090
we don't know what it was.

2317
01:09:15,091 --> 01:09:16,230
Therefore aliens.

2318
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,370
And that's ridiculous.

2319
01:09:17,371 --> 01:09:17,880
Right?

2320
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,220
But we also ended with skeptics.

2321
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:21,180
You want to explain it away as flares.

2322
01:09:21,181 --> 01:09:23,970
And you know what that's
equally fricking ridiculous

2323
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,910
was you said fricken and then I'm like,

2324
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,630
listen man,

2325
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,560
we're grown adults here.

2326
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,730
Fucking thank you.

2327
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,820
[inaudible] you heard Brian,

2328
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:36,270
and this is the first podcast I've been
on where like swearing is just like

2329
01:09:36,271 --> 01:09:36,660
cool.

2330
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,120
Really?

2331
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,550
Yeah.

2332
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,071
The other one,

2333
01:09:38,071 --> 01:09:41,790
it's always where maybe Matt doesn't
disinfect and I didn't realize it,

2334
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:42,541
but the other ones,

2335
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,374
they're clean.

2336
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:43,591
You know?

2337
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:44,880
If you listened to them
then they're clean.

2338
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,940
We fucking square our asses off.

2339
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:48,631
You know what I mean?

2340
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:50,280
Like I swear all the fucking time.

2341
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:50,730
Well,

2342
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:52,080
but I'm used to in this setting.

2343
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,010
That'd be cool if,

2344
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,170
do you have photos where
Bigfoot's instead of ships,

2345
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:55,801
they're just flying.

2346
01:09:55,801 --> 01:09:56,634
They clients.

2347
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,393
Well remember

2348
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:04,560
I used to have a joke that if there was
going to be Ufo is why would they come

2349
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:07,260
in the form of a disc if they
can get here from another planet,

2350
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,980
they could make themselves look a cloud
like that's something we've already

2351
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:15,540
figured out how to do with like those
Japanese jackets that show you an image of

2352
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,190
what's behind you on you.

2353
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:19,620
Have you ever seen that there
are people new technology,

2354
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,660
there are people actually
who do claim they come here.

2355
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:22,494
It's clouds.

2356
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,453
I'm sure.

2357
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,900
Oh well I have a problem.

2358
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:26,640
I have a friend who's
got a problem rather,

2359
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,030
uh,

2360
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,310
I didn't know he was nutty and uh,

2361
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,320
we were in the Improv
one night and he's like,

2362
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:31,951
check these out.

2363
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:34,980
And he started showing me
pictures of clouds and I go,

2364
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,191
oh,

2365
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:35,870
it's beautiful.

2366
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:36,001
Like,

2367
01:10:36,001 --> 01:10:36,310
I don't know,

2368
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,550
he's on his iPhone showing me
pictures of clouds cause you know,

2369
01:10:38,551 --> 01:10:39,540
they're out there all the time.

2370
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:40,290
They're always,

2371
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,310
they're following me all the time.

2372
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,473
I go,

2373
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:42,901
I go,

2374
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,250
what exactly are you saying?

2375
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:44,611
He goes,

2376
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:45,720
these are flying saucers.

2377
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:45,961
He goes,

2378
01:10:45,961 --> 01:10:47,910
these are from another planet
because they're out there,

2379
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:48,840
they're falling all the time.

2380
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:49,883
And I realized,

2381
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,311
Oh,

2382
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:52,020
I thought this dude was just nutty.

2383
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:54,810
I thought he was like
a nutty comic and no,

2384
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:55,441
no,

2385
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:56,141
he's got something,

2386
01:10:56,141 --> 01:10:56,974
somethings,

2387
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,230
some,

2388
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:03,230
a is connected to B and B is hanging
down here loose and sparking and are

2389
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,620
smoking aliens.

2390
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:05,040
Joe,

2391
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,970
I totally met people who are so invested
in this idea that they're being,

2392
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,863
um,

2393
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:10,610
uh,

2394
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,020
they've been abducted or if they're,

2395
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:13,390
you know,

2396
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:14,051
visited by aliens.

2397
01:11:14,051 --> 01:11:19,051
I met a guy who claimed to have an
implant in his leg and he didn't want it

2398
01:11:19,091 --> 01:11:22,390
removed because the times
that he's thought about it,

2399
01:11:22,391 --> 01:11:26,080
he began to feel nauseous and
this made him think that the,

2400
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:26,621
you know,

2401
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:31,621
the aliens don't want him to have it
removed and just this whole trip into lots

2402
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,290
of New Zealand because
there's a lump under his skin.

2403
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,323
Right and right.

2404
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,310
And that could be glass that's
been working its way up.

2405
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,301
You know what I mean,

2406
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:42,280
for decades or who knows
what the fuck it is.

2407
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:42,481
Right.

2408
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:44,670
It like some kind of growth and um,

2409
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,450
so I definitely

2410
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,281
met people like that.

2411
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,800
I mean I think that's one of the things
that impressed me so much about Ricky.

2412
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:49,011
Right.

2413
01:11:49,011 --> 01:11:49,520
As he's,

2414
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,550
he didn't want to give the interview.

2415
01:11:50,551 --> 01:11:53,930
He hasn't done another interview
since there's no profit in it for him.

2416
01:11:53,931 --> 01:11:54,441
If anything,

2417
01:11:54,441 --> 01:11:56,210
he just faced embarrassment over this.

2418
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,733
Well,

2419
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,020
I wish a story was enough for me,

2420
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,030
but I still have an open mind.

2421
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,510
I still have an open mind because even
though I know that most people are full

2422
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:05,900
of shit,

2423
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:10,070
I still know that we can send a rover
to Mars if we can send a rover to Mars,

2424
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,360
if there was a,

2425
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:15,860
some sort of a civilization out there
that wasn't just a thousand years advance,

2426
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:21,100
but millions of years advance and
perhaps they live in a solar system that

2427
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:24,680
doesn't get pelted by asteroids every
couple of hundred million years and wipes

2428
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:25,640
out everything on the planet.

2429
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:26,120
Yeah,

2430
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,280
I mean who knows what level of
achievement they've had technologically.

2431
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:32,090
It's absolutely possible.

2432
01:12:32,091 --> 01:12:33,350
One of the guys I write about in the book,

2433
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,730
a Doctor Edgar Mitchell

2434
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,730
now's astronauts,

2435
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,790
his family in a hundred years,

2436
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,970
if you just sort of trace
this blood bloodline,

2437
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:46,160
they moved west in a horse drawn wagons
and then he was on the moon a hundred

2438
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:53,580
years later that that's technology
advancing from a horse drawn wagons to the

2439
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:53,760
moon.

2440
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,320
And um,

2441
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,070
well he's a big UFO believer.

2442
01:12:57,071 --> 01:13:00,970
He's actually said that he saw
some things when he was in space.

2443
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:01,630
No,

2444
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:01,900
he,

2445
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:02,300
well,

2446
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:02,500
no,

2447
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:02,671
no,

2448
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:02,861
no,

2449
01:13:02,861 --> 01:13:04,570
not in relation to Ufo is at all.

2450
01:13:04,571 --> 01:13:07,690
He said he maintains that he
saw nothing in terms of Ufo.

2451
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:09,430
She had a huge,

2452
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:11,290
he does believe in Ufos.

2453
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:13,720
He says he's talked to members of the
military since he was shorter than that.

2454
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:15,290
There that Ufo is,

2455
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,100
should be identified as alien
craft and some cases right,

2456
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:18,211
that,

2457
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:19,180
that we are being visited.

2458
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,820
But what happened in space
was completely different.

2459
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:22,100
It was,

2460
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,950
it was a religious or a spiritual,

2461
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:25,510
I'll say spiritual experience.

2462
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:26,270
He had,

2463
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:26,520
uh,

2464
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,520
an epiphany where he had the same sort
of experience that people report in

2465
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:36,541
meditation when they hit this kind of
bliss or sometimes on psychedelics where

2466
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:43,741
it was like everything dropped away and
he felt himself being at one with the

2467
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:45,520
entire universe,

2468
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,050
that everything was connected,

2469
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,000
everything was one thing.

2470
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,510
And it was a feeling that
he had all the way back.

2471
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:52,871
Uh,

2472
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:53,201
you know,

2473
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:55,870
over a period of a day or two,

2474
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,150
he would have this experience every,

2475
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:58,661
every,

2476
01:13:58,661 --> 01:13:59,230
uh,

2477
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,063
um,

2478
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:01,183
you know,

2479
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,080
uh,

2480
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,080
regularly feel this sense of
wonder and the sense that he was,

2481
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:08,830
you know,

2482
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,320
he rejected his parents' religion.

2483
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:15,330
He'd gone down the science path and
it completely altered his perspective.

2484
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:21,390
And made him think that there's some
way of uniting spirituality and science.

2485
01:14:21,391 --> 01:14:21,750
He,

2486
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,980
he landed and started the institute of
noetic sciences to try and find some sort

2487
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:29,820
of connection between
spiritual experiences and um,

2488
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:30,160
you know,

2489
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,650
in some scientific basis for them.

2490
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,031
Yeah.

2491
01:14:33,031 --> 01:14:33,421
He,

2492
01:14:33,421 --> 01:14:33,891
what,

2493
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:38,130
what Edgar Mitchell's deal
is with a sock with um,

2494
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:38,940
uh,

2495
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,940
aliens rather is that he has talked
to quite a few people that were high

2496
01:14:45,931 --> 01:14:46,764
knowing,

2497
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,730
uh,

2498
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,450
people,

2499
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:48,930
uh,

2500
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:52,980
in the Joint Chiefs of staff
intelligence committees type characters.

2501
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,380
And they told him there was a Ufo crash,

2502
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:59,100
that there was an alien space
craft at Roswell and that um,

2503
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:00,330
uh,

2504
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:02,310
it's pretty fascinating
stuff listening to him,

2505
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,080
a reading rather this thing.

2506
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,890
And he had something to do
with the disclosure project
with Dr. Steven Greer who

2507
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,630
one day we would like to get him on this
podcast as well cause he's another very

2508
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,040
highly credible person.

2509
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,490
And,

2510
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:14,970
uh,

2511
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:19,020
his disclosure project included a lot
of very high level of former military

2512
01:15:19,021 --> 01:15:23,040
people who talked about their experiences
and they think that it's high time

2513
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:27,780
that we start being honest about what
these people in high levels of the

2514
01:15:27,781 --> 01:15:29,540
military have already experienced.

2515
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:30,540
You know about it.

2516
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:32,490
And the fact that there's,

2517
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:37,420
there's probably a high
level of probability that a,

2518
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:42,660
we are consistently visited by some freaky
dudes from another part of the world

2519
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:44,760
or another dimension or,

2520
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:48,780
but they're just can slip in and out like
that and we don't really know what the

2521
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:49,590
fuck is going on.

2522
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,780
Well,

2523
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,613
that whole,

2524
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,910
the one of the arguments
should get from this section

2525
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,110
thanks is that our planet is,

2526
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:56,291
you know,

2527
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,400
one among so many.

2528
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:58,630
How would they find us?

2529
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,900
What kind of propulsion system
could possibly carry them here?

2530
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,053
Um,

2531
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:07,130
and they're basing this all off on what
we know right now with our technology

2532
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,480
and our understanding at the moment.

2533
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:09,081
But as you said,

2534
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:12,020
like if you've got a civilization
that's been around for thousands or

2535
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,360
potentially even a million or more years,

2536
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,400
who knows what they could have.

2537
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:16,710
That's,

2538
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,330
it's a,

2539
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:22,070
it's a silly sort of argument
to me because it's based
so much on this idea that

2540
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:26,390
this is advanced is where ever going to
get to the fact that 200 years ago when

2541
01:16:26,391 --> 01:16:27,500
you wanted a picture of something,

2542
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:28,340
you want to draw it.

2543
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,310
If you want to get around you
gotta to ride a fucking animal.

2544
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,140
It was the dumbest time ever.

2545
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,410
You had to draw 200 years ago,

2546
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:40,150
you had a draw things to let anybody
else know what they look like.

2547
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,390
We're still doing that in the courtroom.

2548
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:41,990
What the fuck?

2549
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:42,860
What the fuck?

2550
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,680
But it's really incredible
if you stop and look at that,

2551
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:50,720
that we've gone from that in 200 years
to making high res videos with your cell

2552
01:16:50,721 --> 01:16:51,111
phones,

2553
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,610
watching streaming videos,

2554
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:54,860
playing video games on a tablet.

2555
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:55,430
I mean,

2556
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,540
just that leap.

2557
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,850
No one saw coming before photographs.

2558
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:03,851
No one would have imagined that this tiny
blip in human time of 200 years could

2559
01:17:05,361 --> 01:17:06,590
have that much innovation.

2560
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:06,760
Sure.

2561
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:06,971
You know,

2562
01:17:06,971 --> 01:17:10,040
the only time I really get sad
about dying now is what I think

2563
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,970
about the shit I'm going to miss.

2564
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:12,170
You know,

2565
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,670
the advances that are coming up,

2566
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:14,420
like I'd like to,

2567
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,670
I'd like to experience
that slight privacy.

2568
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,720
You're going to miss privacy.

2569
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,970
That shit's out the window son.

2570
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,051
Yeah,

2571
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:21,531
that's a,

2572
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:23,210
that's the first thing
that's going to go I think.

2573
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,360
I think there really would be no
privacy and about a hundred years,

2574
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:27,261
100 years.

2575
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:29,090
I think everyone's going to
know it probably won't even,

2576
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,900
that belong to would take that
long strangely disinterested
in privacy now too.

2577
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:33,141
I mean,

2578
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:36,530
I can't get over how rob people are in
terms of the information they share about

2579
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:40,070
themselves on Facebook
and you lose a phone,

2580
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:41,240
you lose your diary.

2581
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:41,571
You know,

2582
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:44,840
like you could get all your family
photos or people's phone numbers,

2583
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:45,830
your past texts,

2584
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:46,700
you or emails.

2585
01:17:46,701 --> 01:17:47,260
I mean,

2586
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:47,770
that person's,

2587
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,350
that's gained a huge part of your
privacy by just losing a phone.

2588
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,071
Yeah.

2589
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,020
If you don't have a fucking
password on a stupid,

2590
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,840
most people don't that that's true.

2591
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,470
Um,

2592
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,440
if you're like a person who wants to
like peer into someone's text messages,

2593
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,611
but I think,

2594
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:02,420
um,

2595
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,990
that that access ultimately
will one day just be universal.

2596
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,960
Everybody will be able to find
out anything that anybody's doing.

2597
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,140
People are walking around with apps now
that will automatically tweet where they

2598
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:12,560
are.

2599
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:12,831
Yeah.

2600
01:18:12,831 --> 01:18:13,664
That's crazy.

2601
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,640
Geotagging it's great if you
want to stalk them though.

2602
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,870
It's really stalking somebody in the
Geo tag and all over the fucking place.

2603
01:18:19,871 --> 01:18:22,550
You can narrow it down pretty good.

2604
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:23,990
Yeah.

2605
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,040
People are weird man.

2606
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,611
It's the,

2607
01:18:25,611 --> 01:18:25,850
the,

2608
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,070
the whole connection hasn't
been figured out yet.

2609
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:31,790
This whole connection between every
human being on the planet through the

2610
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:33,350
Internet really hasn't really been,

2611
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:33,831
I figured out,

2612
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:35,510
I thought you were going
mystical with that for a second.

2613
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,830
This whole connection does that as well.

2614
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:37,820
Trying to figure that out too.

2615
01:18:37,821 --> 01:18:38,200
Right.

2616
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,280
Well I think that as we said,

2617
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:44,420
I don't think that the human
body in this form is done.

2618
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,901
You know,

2619
01:18:44,901 --> 01:18:48,050
I think it's continuing to
change and continuing to,

2620
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,160
a lot of people don't like to use the
word evolve cause you know real evolution

2621
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:56,210
involves mutation and adaptation to your
natural surroundings and it might not

2622
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:56,840
just be that.

2623
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,261
It might be,

2624
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:58,580
there might be a lot of things going on,

2625
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:02,500
a constant move towards improvement
or around losing senses.

2626
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,630
Are you familiar with you that
the overview overview effect?

2627
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:06,643
You should play with that?

2628
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:06,861
No.

2629
01:19:06,861 --> 01:19:07,310
What's that?

2630
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,230
So that's what Edgar Mitchell experienced,

2631
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:09,500
right.

2632
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:09,891
And he,

2633
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:11,960
he's very adamant about this
and it seems to be true.

2634
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:12,900
Um,

2635
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,760
and NASA,

2636
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:14,594
uh,

2637
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,501
allows that,

2638
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,790
this happens now that that the
people they send up into space,

2639
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,480
um,

2640
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,360
are changed by the experience
of seeing the earth from space.

2641
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,430
It has a profound impact on them.

2642
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,670
They feel it.

2643
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,150
And for Mitchell it becomes
a spiritual experience,

2644
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:29,690
uh,

2645
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:32,120
for other people at it got
the more involved in politics.

2646
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:37,070
They recognize the how arbitrary the
lines between countries are in the lines.

2647
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:38,210
We draw a culturally,

2648
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:38,810
um,

2649
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:39,201
but they,

2650
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:44,201
they see just how fragile
our little planet is hanging
out there in space and it

2651
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:47,450
changes them.

2652
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:49,880
And I think most of us would
agree it's changing them,

2653
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,501
uh,

2654
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:51,290
for the better.

2655
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:53,360
They end up coming home and doing,

2656
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:53,960
um,

2657
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,440
sort of more altruistic
things with their lives.

2658
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,740
And now we're going to have
civilians being set up into space.

2659
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:03,620
Um,

2660
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,070
mostly wealthy civilians initially
because how much that rides going to cost

2661
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:07,923
right from

2662
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:11,440
Bigelow aerospace or virgin
every time I have $100,000,

2663
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,580
$150,000.

2664
01:20:12,581 --> 01:20:13,900
I came up with the price at this point,

2665
01:20:13,901 --> 01:20:18,550
but I had researched it and we're
going to have general civilians getting

2666
01:20:18,551 --> 01:20:22,240
shopping Sean up in his face and having
an experience of seeing the earth from

2667
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:22,660
there.

2668
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:27,100
And it's going to begin to
slowly change the culture,

2669
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:28,150
I would think.

2670
01:20:28,151 --> 01:20:31,030
Because if you look at how dramatically
it changed the lives of all the people

2671
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:32,260
who've gone into space,

2672
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:33,840
it's going to change these people too.

2673
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:34,763
To some degree.

2674
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:38,110
You're Mitchell's take
on it is very trippy,

2675
01:20:38,111 --> 01:20:38,944
man.

2676
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,620
It's very trippy when the,

2677
01:20:41,621 --> 01:20:42,251
when he was,

2678
01:20:42,251 --> 01:20:42,520
uh,

2679
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,121
in the,

2680
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:43,451
uh,

2681
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:45,340
the spacecraft coming home,

2682
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,101
this is his word.

2683
01:20:46,101 --> 01:20:49,660
Suddenly I realized that the molecules
and my body were created in an ancient

2684
01:20:49,661 --> 01:20:51,040
generation of stars.

2685
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,830
And suddenly that became
personal and visceral,

2686
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,090
not intellectual.

2687
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,340
And I had never had this experience.

2688
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:03,070
It was accompanied by bliss and
ecstasy I had never experienced.

2689
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:03,933
So he's calling,

2690
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,200
it's calling it Samadhi.

2691
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,070
I quote that in the classic actually,

2692
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:08,460
cause it's a,

2693
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,140
it's a heavy quote and um,

2694
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:10,771
yeah,

2695
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:14,910
he felt literally it was
like his flesh dropped away.

2696
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,260
His bones went away.

2697
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:17,490
Have you ever been to,

2698
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,060
um,

2699
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,410
the Keck observatory?

2700
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,100
No.

2701
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:20,933
The Keck Observer,

2702
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,870
Tori and Hawaii on the big island.

2703
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,070
And uh,

2704
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,661
there's,

2705
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:25,090
uh,

2706
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:28,510
one island and Hawaii that's so big.

2707
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,900
You get so high and the big island
that you go through the clouds,

2708
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:32,320
right?

2709
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:32,990
Hello?

2710
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:33,510
Yeah,

2711
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,910
yeah,

2712
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:34,121
yeah.

2713
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:35,380
Well he loads just the city.

2714
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:37,120
Then the Keck observatory is,

2715
01:21:37,121 --> 01:21:37,870
um,

2716
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:38,111
it's,

2717
01:21:38,111 --> 01:21:38,944
I think it's on them.

2718
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,230
It's not on the Mauna Loa volcano,

2719
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,060
which whatever one it is the biggest one.

2720
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:45,410
And it's that there's a,

2721
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:46,210
there's a,

2722
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:50,590
like a visitor station that's
down at like 9,000 plus feet,

2723
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,270
and then you go even higher.

2724
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,111
They have the,

2725
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:53,171
uh,

2726
01:21:53,171 --> 01:21:54,010
the telescopes there,

2727
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:58,690
but you get out of the car and you're
through the clouds and the way the big

2728
01:21:58,691 --> 01:21:59,441
island is set up,

2729
01:21:59,441 --> 01:22:03,130
they have these diffused lights so
that they don't create light pollution

2730
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,390
because of the observatory.

2731
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:09,550
So the fucking milky way was so stunning.

2732
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,590
It was so that to this day,

2733
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,020
all I think about when we
talk about going on vacation,

2734
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:15,310
it's like we've got to
get back to that Keck.

2735
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:16,240
I got to see that again.

2736
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:20,020
I just got to look up and see that again
because it really did feel like you

2737
01:22:20,021 --> 01:22:24,460
were flying through an
impossibly filled galaxy.

2738
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:28,240
Whereas like usually you see like
a few stars like here and there,

2739
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:28,960
you know,

2740
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,880
up there with that high,

2741
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,570
high altitude and the,

2742
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:35,620
the really zero light
pollution and clear skies.

2743
01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:36,490
It was amazing.

2744
01:22:36,491 --> 01:22:37,280
I studied

2745
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,990
dreaming in Hilo and the Big island.

2746
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,240
One of the things I would do is,

2747
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,491
uh,

2748
01:22:41,491 --> 01:22:42,680
at night before I go to bed,

2749
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,630
I would lay out in the grass and just
stare straight up because I'm in Philly.

2750
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:47,931
Right?

2751
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:48,141
Yeah.

2752
01:22:48,141 --> 01:22:51,230
You just don't get stars like that
in Philadelphia because there were,

2753
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,940
there were really no lights.

2754
01:22:52,941 --> 01:22:55,040
We were at this little
retreat type center and,

2755
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:55,933
and um,

2756
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:56,953
it just,

2757
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,930
it set the scene real well to go
upstairs and try and have a lucid dream.

2758
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:00,681
Yeah.

2759
01:23:00,681 --> 01:23:03,410
I would imagine it would set the
scene for freaking yourself out.

2760
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,580
So never gotten over that image.

2761
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:07,031
Just see.

2762
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:07,301
I mean,

2763
01:23:07,301 --> 01:23:10,120
there was only a couple hours
of just staring at the sky,

2764
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:12,460
but I couldn't believe
how beautiful it looked.

2765
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,270
I got to imagine it's probably a hundred
times more beautiful when you're in

2766
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:18,100
space orbiting the earth.

2767
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:18,791
You know?

2768
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:21,130
If you've seen those photos that
they take when they're up there,

2769
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:21,460
it's like,

2770
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,660
oh my God,

2771
01:23:22,661 --> 01:23:24,970
like you're orbiting the fucking plant.

2772
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:25,804
You're above it.

2773
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:29,320
Looking down at just the circular
nature of it all and like,

2774
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:29,950
oh,

2775
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,180
something to consider there too.

2776
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:31,971
That's really interesting.

2777
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:32,804
That

2778
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,080
fascinating about the overview effect.

2779
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,920
You can show people these pictures and
they don't have the reaction that you

2780
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,300
have from from being there.

2781
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:40,481
Oh,

2782
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:40,961
of course.

2783
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:41,670
Yeah.

2784
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:42,080
Yeah.

2785
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,230
Images never capture the,

2786
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,060
the real emotion of the moment.

2787
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:46,690
You know,

2788
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,420
the connection of the moment
when you're actually in space.

2789
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:51,310
It's got to be a real mind fuck.

2790
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:52,683
It's like the,

2791
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,200
the connection of camping as
opposed to actual camping,

2792
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:56,681
you know,

2793
01:23:56,681 --> 01:23:57,960
multiple wild fuck.

2794
01:23:57,961 --> 01:23:59,140
Are you going camping?

2795
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:00,820
What are you going to sleep in the woods?

2796
01:24:00,821 --> 01:24:01,780
Stupid in the,

2797
01:24:01,781 --> 01:24:02,710
don't you have a house?

2798
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,690
But once you do it and he'd go,

2799
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,531
oh,

2800
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:06,161
I get it.

2801
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:07,060
This is crazy.

2802
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:08,320
Like you're out here in nature.

2803
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:10,120
I use a totally different feeling.

2804
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:10,420
My,

2805
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,510
my wife is going to be really glad that
you're saying this because she wants me

2806
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,100
desperately to go tent camping with her.

2807
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:15,431
And I,

2808
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:15,710
and I,

2809
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,050
my feeling always,

2810
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:17,261
you know,

2811
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,190
let's just get a cabin,

2812
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:18,541
honey.

2813
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:20,230
We'll walk out in the woods at night.

2814
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:20,910
You know what?

2815
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:22,000
You want to go deer hunting.

2816
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,010
Then you can camp out and make,

2817
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:25,903
make,

2818
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:26,940
make,

2819
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,773
uh,

2820
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:28,181
make,

2821
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:28,360
uh,

2822
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,950
some sort of a agreement.

2823
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,780
We're back to the new
year all at one shot.

2824
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,090
Yeah.

2825
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,000
Deniros ridiculous.

2826
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:34,810
You've got to shoot him twice.

2827
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,070
Sometimes they go down,

2828
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:37,191
got to execute them.

2829
01:24:37,191 --> 01:24:38,024
Trust me.

2830
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:39,610
Um,

2831
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:40,190
yeah,

2832
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:40,381
the,

2833
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:40,531
the,

2834
01:24:40,531 --> 01:24:44,620
the thing that's weird about camping
is that when you're away from like

2835
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:49,510
electricity and House and all
that shit for a long enough,

2836
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,870
you kind of like get this
like real humble feeling like,

2837
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,201
oh,

2838
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:53,561
okay,

2839
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:54,394
I get this.

2840
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:59,110
Like we're just like another animal who
just figured out some way to separate

2841
01:24:59,111 --> 01:25:02,380
ourself so we can do our work
and we separate ourselves.

2842
01:25:02,381 --> 01:25:06,430
At our houses and in there we create
these computers and electrically hooked

2843
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:10,120
things together and all along as we
separate ourselves from the nature,

2844
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,620
because we're out there in the nature,

2845
01:25:11,621 --> 01:25:14,470
you might get eaten and you
got to go find some food.

2846
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:15,021
Yes,

2847
01:25:15,021 --> 01:25:16,150
shit can go wrong.

2848
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:16,620
Yeah,

2849
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,180
he put that pure l and your
hands bitch and go back to work.

2850
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,800
So you get your house and you're,

2851
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:21,370
you know,

2852
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,770
you hide from the connection
with the outside world,

2853
01:25:23,771 --> 01:25:25,570
but when you camping
and it's an escapable,

2854
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,880
it's a weird feeling when
you're out there for,

2855
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:30,490
I did a recently five
days with no cell phones,

2856
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:32,200
no electricity,

2857
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:33,034
no,

2858
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,820
no heat,

2859
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,653
no nothing.

2860
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,780
And we had to start a fire.

2861
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:36,581
If you want to stay warm,

2862
01:25:36,581 --> 01:25:37,420
and it was in Montana,

2863
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:38,260
it was freezing cold.

2864
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,890
But doing that you,

2865
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:44,950
you really have a different sort of
feeling and appreciation for what nature

2866
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,550
actually is.

2867
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,753
Nature's,

2868
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:52,930
it's like we're disconnected from one
of the fucking coolest things ever for a

2869
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:54,190
human to experience.

2870
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,170
We're completely disconnected from it.

2871
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:00,310
There's a lot of people who lived their
whole lives in cities and in suburbs and

2872
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:04,400
they drive back and forth from work
and they never out there in the woods.

2873
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,960
I'll never forget a guy and a college if
who went on this big long tirade and I

2874
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,740
thought he might be mentally unbalanced
because one of this big one fucking

2875
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,520
tirade that how like I'm still so,

2876
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:16,210
it wasn't philosophy class actually too.

2877
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,193
I'm so sick.

2878
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,900
People talking about the outdoors and
how the outdoors just so great outdoors

2879
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:21,520
suck.

2880
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,720
You get bit by bugs.

2881
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:23,380
You don't,

2882
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,460
you don't what the fuck's going on?

2883
01:26:24,461 --> 01:26:25,330
You know what's gonna Happen Next?

2884
01:26:25,331 --> 01:26:27,070
You get rained on your wet.

2885
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,210
What the fuck's great about that?

2886
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:30,820
That was his take on the entire outdoors.

2887
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,770
Well that spent his entire life like in a,

2888
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,160
in,

2889
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:33,791
in a mall.

2890
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:34,150
I guess

2891
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:35,920
that's the classic cynics approach,

2892
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:36,490
isn't it?

2893
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:39,700
Isn't it the classic cynics
approach you like for the hipster?

2894
01:26:39,701 --> 01:26:41,200
Like if fucking everything sucks,

2895
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:42,034
man,

2896
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,240
why the fuck that's,

2897
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:47,020
that is our are spoiled
societies creation.

2898
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:47,963
I have to tell you,

2899
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:53,130
that's one of the biggest pushbacks I've
gotten on the firm from that sort of

2900
01:26:53,131 --> 01:26:54,090
crowd on the book.

2901
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,570
Then like the whole idea that I was going
to go study lucid dreaming and learn

2902
01:26:57,571 --> 01:26:59,520
to meditate and and do all these things,

2903
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:00,354
you know like why?

2904
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:01,501
Right?

2905
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:02,820
Like why would you put
that kind of effort?

2906
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,230
It was sort of just sort of like,

2907
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:06,151
I don't know.

2908
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:08,850
I guess they feel so great in their
skinny jeans that the idea of doing

2909
01:27:08,851 --> 01:27:11,340
something to improve themselves
further or you know what I mean?

2910
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,140
Just seems like an admission of defeat.

2911
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:13,581
Right?

2912
01:27:13,581 --> 01:27:15,000
Cause there's supposed to
be so cool right there.

2913
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:15,790
Yeah.

2914
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:16,421
Well that is,

2915
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:17,201
that is the thing.

2916
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:18,490
Like why bother?

2917
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:20,260
What are you doing out
there with your head?

2918
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,731
Would you stupid,

2919
01:27:21,731 --> 01:27:22,990
psychic bullshit.

2920
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:23,981
It's not real.

2921
01:27:23,981 --> 01:27:24,701
It doesn't matter.

2922
01:27:24,701 --> 01:27:25,300
Yeah.

2923
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,133
Look at my genes.

2924
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,840
What if they have skinny jeans and
they're sag and have you seen that?

2925
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,190
That makes you fucking violent,

2926
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:30,630
doesn't it?

2927
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:31,030
Oh,

2928
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,620
it makes me want to throttle those little,

2929
01:27:32,621 --> 01:27:33,170
fuck.

2930
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:33,850
You're so skinny.

2931
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:34,511
You're skinny jeans,

2932
01:27:34,511 --> 01:27:34,961
your sagging,

2933
01:27:34,961 --> 01:27:35,500
there's a problem.

2934
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,410
They put the CIGGIES,

2935
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,170
they put them down low on purpose.

2936
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:43,200
Like that's a move to have your skinny
jeans kind of saggy male Cleve hello.

2937
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:43,691
Yeah,

2938
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,260
a little bit.

2939
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,860
It's like you just let
them know silly fucks.

2940
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:49,091
Yeah.

2941
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:50,200
That detachment thing,

2942
01:27:50,201 --> 01:27:51,280
it's really disturbing.

2943
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,600
It's such a weak,

2944
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:56,140
fake sort of a complacency.

2945
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:56,980
It's just,

2946
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,000
they're just terrified.

2947
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,340
So they're just pretending to
don't give a fuck about anything.

2948
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,453
I don't care about anything.

2949
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:03,080
Well,

2950
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:03,621
there's a lot.

2951
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:06,380
I think there's a lot of that terrified
I think is the operative word.

2952
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:06,921
I think it ain't,

2953
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:07,310
and I,

2954
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:07,671
and it was,

2955
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:08,280
it's funny,

2956
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,240
I am not to be able to quote
exactly what is Martin Sheen who,

2957
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:11,690
who,

2958
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,320
uh,

2959
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,640
in that guy went through the shit.

2960
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,061
Right.

2961
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:14,330
I mean,

2962
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,700
at the whole apocalypse now
filming in that whole story,

2963
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:18,050
the whole RQ went through.

2964
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:19,070
Um,

2965
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:23,060
the basic fact we need to understand
about life is that it's terrifying.

2966
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:23,720
Yeah.

2967
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,201
You know,

2968
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:25,034
we are,

2969
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:27,620
we are cauldrons of anxiety.

2970
01:28:27,621 --> 01:28:28,580
We have a part of our brain,

2971
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:31,640
the Bigelow that whenever we're
confronted by ambiguous information is

2972
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:32,570
immediately going to be like,

2973
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:33,404
check for danger.

2974
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:34,243
Check for danger.

2975
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:34,640
Yeah.

2976
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,271
And it,

2977
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:37,100
it sort of prohibits us from,

2978
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:37,701
you know,

2979
01:28:37,701 --> 01:28:38,181
learning,

2980
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:38,721
growing,

2981
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:40,340
trying to find out a new things.

2982
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:41,270
If we give into that,

2983
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,520
I mean we are,

2984
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:47,000
we're animals and we have instincts to
stay alive and those instincts are going

2985
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:49,000
to get fired up left and right all around,

2986
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,060
especially if you're in a city and is
constantly surrounded by people packed

2987
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:53,894
into a place.

2988
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,790
And I think your senses,

2989
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,200
the,

2990
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,440
the adapt your feelings and intuition
sort of adapt to that environment.

2991
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:01,160
That's,

2992
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,010
it really made sense when you

2993
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,420
were talking about people or hunters
and people who were inner city people.

2994
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,610
Because when you're in involved in a real,

2995
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,310
you have to,

2996
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,910
in an inner city situation
that's very primal

2997
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,740
and you have to learn to slow it down.

2998
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,740
You have to learn that because there's
so much happening around you in a way.

2999
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:18,690
You kind of have to
learn to slow it down to,

3000
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,560
to see what,

3001
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,850
what's important here,

3002
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,740
what do I really need that my eye on?

3003
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:26,250
Because there's so many different things
that could distract you potentially

3004
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:26,850
fuck you up.

3005
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,540
Yeah.

3006
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,210
What,

3007
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:28,750
um,

3008
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:33,750
what other information or what other
pieces of evidence about aliens have ever

3009
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:37,900
led you to believe conclusively
one way or another that,

3010
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:39,810
that there is something else.

3011
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,321
I don't,

3012
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:40,890
you know,

3013
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:45,510
that's another one where I conclusively
believe that Ufo is or unidentified

3014
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:46,261
flying objects.

3015
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:46,490
Right?

3016
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:46,800
Right.

3017
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,450
And there are times when
we just need to kind of,

3018
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,210
they're people who want to honor sort of
like materials science and their people

3019
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:52,980
want to honor some sort
of dogmatic religion.

3020
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,740
I want to honor that like gap
in our knowledge to some degree.

3021
01:29:55,770 --> 01:29:56,131
Right.

3022
01:29:56,131 --> 01:29:56,261
And,

3023
01:29:56,261 --> 01:29:59,170
and just acknowledge that it's there and,

3024
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,560
and that's what we're working through.

3025
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,771
You know,

3026
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:01,871
we,

3027
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:03,120
we need more information,

3028
01:30:03,121 --> 01:30:03,954
more data,

3029
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,580
not less.

3030
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,533
And,

3031
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:06,840
um,

3032
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,670
so,

3033
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,240
so the UFO question,

3034
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:09,880
I mean,

3035
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,740
have we been visited?

3036
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:12,390
I'm not entirely sure.

3037
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:12,601
I mean,

3038
01:30:12,601 --> 01:30:13,740
even at Stevenville signing,

3039
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,820
I didn't get a chance to get into this,

3040
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:15,291
but that Steven,

3041
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:16,124
it'll siding.

3042
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,580
There's a military base nearby.

3043
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:22,320
This guy claimed that he was harassed
for a weeks afterward by a member of the

3044
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:22,770
military.

3045
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:26,730
There's this story in the book about
somebody showing up on his property and in

3046
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:31,731
the middle of the night making his dog's
bark and just staring into his door and

3047
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:34,050
clearly wearing chemo gear.

3048
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,980
And this was during the same period when
he was getting these threatening phone

3049
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:38,730
calls from,

3050
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:41,460
from a guy who was identifying
himself as a member of the military.

3051
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,160
So is it possible that,

3052
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,083
um,

3053
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,523
you know,

3054
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,360
people are encountering at times,

3055
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,060
some sort of advanced military technology?

3056
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,290
It's to me,

3057
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:55,680
no coincidence that people
started reporting triangle
shaped Ufo shortly before

3058
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:57,210
the stealth bomber was right,

3059
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:58,470
ultimately revealed.

3060
01:30:58,620 --> 01:30:59,400
Yeah.

3061
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,560
So sometimes that's the explanation.

3062
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,610
Uh,

3063
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,450
but you know,

3064
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,350
for me it simply the
vastness of the universe,

3065
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:08,760
it's age.

3066
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:09,330
Um,

3067
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,290
the idea that we,

3068
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,450
we would,

3069
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:13,680
the chances that we're the only,

3070
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,903
only,

3071
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:15,983
uh,

3072
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:22,470
planet that's evolved life like this
seem so small that surely somebody out

3073
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:26,640
there has developed a kind of technology
would take to find us and get here.

3074
01:31:26,641 --> 01:31:26,821
I mean,

3075
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:27,240
that's,

3076
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:30,060
that's the kind of thinking
that that really opens me up.

3077
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:30,930
You don't mean to,

3078
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:31,670
to the possibility

3079
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:32,960
the numbers are just too crazy.

3080
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:38,500
100 billion stars with who knows
how many planets more than you know,

3081
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,780
more than one per per star.

3082
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,111
You know,

3083
01:31:42,111 --> 01:31:43,490
some of our binary systems,

3084
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:44,373
we don't know

3085
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,560
that's just this galaxy but commune.

3086
01:31:46,610 --> 01:31:47,330
It's a joke.

3087
01:31:47,330 --> 01:31:47,840
Yeah,

3088
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,930
and there are enough of these cases
where you know like Greer's people,

3089
01:31:51,931 --> 01:31:54,260
the military people would come forward
and say that something happened or

3090
01:31:54,261 --> 01:31:54,441
whatever.

3091
01:31:54,441 --> 01:31:54,770
Yeah.

3092
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:59,740
And enough of these people are are
credible and in and left and then on

3093
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,310
identified

3094
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:01,930
category that you start to think,

3095
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:02,350
wow,

3096
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:02,621
you know,

3097
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:03,070
maybe it

3098
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:03,880
some point.

3099
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,640
Some of these,

3100
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:08,770
so many people are full of shit and so
many people have told lies that if you

3101
01:32:08,771 --> 01:32:13,771
have any thoughts in your head that you're
going to be able to tell people that

3102
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:16,750
you believe in Ufos and
not have them ridicule you.

3103
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:18,580
That was good fucking luck.

3104
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,300
Good luck like being a serious
person and being taken seriously.

3105
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,740
If we had Obama,

3106
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:28,890
if Obama was on TV and he started talking
about Ufos and his experience and what

3107
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:32,080
he believes they are and that he
believes that we're being visited by

3108
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,380
intelligent beings from
some other dimension,

3109
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,040
he immediately is going to get,

3110
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:37,390
people will haul him off to crazy town.

3111
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:39,910
Look what happened to Dennis Kucinich.

3112
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:40,390
Yeah.

3113
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:41,620
When he told that story,

3114
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:41,890
uh,

3115
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:42,850
or you know,

3116
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:45,280
sort of was dragged through
that story during the debate.

3117
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,270
What was his story again?

3118
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:47,890
Was it,

3119
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:48,850
what year did he run?

3120
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:51,910
He ran in a recently 2004.

3121
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:52,280
Did he?

3122
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:53,113
Yeah,

3123
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:54,011
he,

3124
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:54,700
um,

3125
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,720
he had written,

3126
01:32:55,721 --> 01:32:56,261
or I'm sorry,

3127
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:57,130
Shirley McClain,

3128
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:59,620
who I guess is like a great
aunt or something to him.

3129
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,411
God mother.

3130
01:33:00,411 --> 01:33:01,270
It came from the relationship.

3131
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:02,920
She had written a red flag.

3132
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:03,963
Well,

3133
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,200
she'd been in the family.

3134
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:11,090
She rent a book in which he claimed that
he had seen a Ufo and Tim Russert asked

3135
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:14,680
him about it during a debate.

3136
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,750
And people immediately,

3137
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,340
and this is again,

3138
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,300
the language was Ufo,

3139
01:33:19,301 --> 01:33:20,280
not alien craft,

3140
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,123
but Ufo.

3141
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,310
The people immediately burst into
laughter and you can hear it,

3142
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:24,701
you know,

3143
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:25,121
on the video.

3144
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:26,410
I write about this in the book too.

3145
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:27,450
Um,

3146
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:29,770
when people immediately start
laughing and he starts saying,

3147
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:30,190
well look,

3148
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:30,371
you know,

3149
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:30,851
Ufo,

3150
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:33,340
it's unidentified and
people are still sort of,

3151
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,120
now you hear people kind of
gasping because instead of
rejecting it out of hand,

3152
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:38,030
he's,

3153
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:38,331
he's sort,

3154
01:33:38,331 --> 01:33:40,120
sorta trying to stick up for this.

3155
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:40,630
Those are the [inaudible]

3156
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:45,250
press people that you root for to get
killed by the aliens that were in that

3157
01:33:45,251 --> 01:33:46,360
Mars attacks movie.

3158
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,580
They'd come down with the Reagans.

3159
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:47,970
Yeah.

3160
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:48,440
Alright.

3161
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:48,800
Alright.

3162
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,600
Alright.

3163
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,270
Just start blasting them and killing them.

3164
01:33:51,271 --> 01:33:53,680
How and dignified to be
killed by cartoonish aliens.

3165
01:33:53,810 --> 01:33:54,641
The perfect end.

3166
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:56,370
So way to go and I'm a perfect 10.

3167
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,101
That movie.

3168
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:58,530
It was fucking awesome.

3169
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,011
That was it.

3170
01:33:59,011 --> 01:34:01,350
That's one of my favorite
all time alien movies,

3171
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,430
Mars attacks.

3172
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:05,700
It's a much more likely how it's going
to go down to this people that these

3173
01:34:05,701 --> 01:34:08,010
knuckleheads and think that the
aliens are going to come save us.

3174
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,540
We're not saving chimps.

3175
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:09,871
You know,

3176
01:34:09,871 --> 01:34:13,170
we're not going into the fucking
the Congo and given them laptops,

3177
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:13,541
you know,

3178
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:13,771
then,

3179
01:34:13,771 --> 01:34:13,930
right.

3180
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:14,320
They're not,

3181
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,580
they're not going to say us.

3182
01:34:16,530 --> 01:34:18,720
Why would they save us
the fuck out of here?

3183
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,943
And Mitchell,

3184
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,840
he knows,

3185
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:22,680
he knows something.

3186
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,500
He doesn't want to tell us this guy.

3187
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:26,270
Um,

3188
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:26,610
your,

3189
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:27,443
your guy,

3190
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,290
did he have drawings?

3191
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:29,700
Did he,

3192
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:30,960
did he ever swirls?

3193
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:31,500
Yeah.

3194
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,670
Did he like try to,

3195
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:33,121
well,

3196
01:34:33,121 --> 01:34:33,780
you know what's funny,

3197
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:34,021
he,

3198
01:34:34,021 --> 01:34:38,070
he tried to take pictures later of other,

3199
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:39,383
you know,

3200
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:40,080
another siding.

3201
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,790
He said he had using a cell phone
camera and he had another siding.

3202
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:44,460
Yeah.

3203
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:45,293
And this is Joan.

3204
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,201
Same town,

3205
01:34:46,201 --> 01:34:47,034
but at night.

3206
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:52,210
And this is 2008 and it's a Sheaf
of can picture what it Lou Clark.

3207
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,990
And actually it's a little
bit of video actually too.

3208
01:34:54,991 --> 01:34:56,160
I think you captured video.

3209
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:57,260
Um,

3210
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,910
he stopped showing it because,

3211
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:00,083
uh,

3212
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,590
he realized it was
embarrassingly bad comments.

3213
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,550
Rude.

3214
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,791
Well,

3215
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:05,331
here's the,

3216
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:06,170
here's the issue.

3217
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,760
Like how good a picture is a cell phone
camera gonna take of a light in the sky.

3218
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:11,950
Very fucking.

3219
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:14,600
Let me think about how good of
a picture as a take of a moon,

3220
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:14,890
you know,

3221
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,340
looks like a tiny little dot.

3222
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,960
It's impossible to see what an iPhone.

3223
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:20,720
So that's another one of this
sort of like a misleading,

3224
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:20,871
you know,

3225
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:22,400
the red herrings thrown
out there by the skeptics,

3226
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:24,200
but we're all walking around
with camera phones now.

3227
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:24,471
Yes,

3228
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:24,711
it has.

3229
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:26,630
Camera phones suck for the most part.

3230
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:29,960
They'd have a very hard time taking
a picture of a light in a dark field,

3231
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:30,290
right?

3232
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,123
Like dude,

3233
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,233
shucks guy,

3234
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,193
big foot.

3235
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:35,690
I did not know big foot research.

3236
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,700
I decided I was not going there.

3237
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,140
Maybe in book two,

3238
01:35:39,141 --> 01:35:40,250
after you take mushrooms,

3239
01:35:40,251 --> 01:35:41,670
then you commune with bigfoot.

3240
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:42,170
Yeah.

3241
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:42,500
Big,

3242
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,730
big foot to me was not on the radar.

3243
01:35:43,731 --> 01:35:44,564
Quiche is the thing.

3244
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,000
I was drawn to the idea that we're,

3245
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,420
the whole title of
phrenology came from this.

3246
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:52,310
These are subjects we
pushed to the fringe.

3247
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,770
But if you look at like
near death experiences,

3248
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:55,670
ghosts,

3249
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:57,400
Ufos,

3250
01:35:57,810 --> 01:35:58,280
uh,

3251
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:00,920
they speak to the big
existential questions,

3252
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:01,250
right?

3253
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:01,640
That,

3254
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:02,870
that really plague us.

3255
01:36:02,871 --> 01:36:04,310
The ones we don't have answers to.

3256
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,380
What happens when we die?

3257
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,420
Are we alone in the universe?

3258
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:08,811
You know,

3259
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:09,001
what,

3260
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:10,070
what's it mean to be human?

3261
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,150
These sorts of questions.

3262
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,830
Big Foot doesn't really,

3263
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,330
doesn't really get into that,

3264
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,320
into that field.

3265
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:15,980
He's not in it,

3266
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:16,161
you know,

3267
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:16,381
he's,

3268
01:36:16,381 --> 01:36:18,890
he's not something that's
gonna make me question.

3269
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:19,880
Um,

3270
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:20,100
uh,

3271
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:20,331
you know,

3272
01:36:20,331 --> 01:36:22,760
the idea that there might
be some undiscovered ape,

3273
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:26,480
it does not affect what happens when I
die or whether or not we're alone in the

3274
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:26,980
universe.

3275
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:27,813
Right.

3276
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,510
He got here on a fucking space ship.

3277
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,353
So you say this,

3278
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:32,330
but my friend called me up the other day.

3279
01:36:32,331 --> 01:36:33,051
I swear to God,

3280
01:36:33,051 --> 01:36:35,360
someone actually had a conversation
with me and both as to it.

3281
01:36:35,361 --> 01:36:35,990
They're on the phone.

3282
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,823
He goes,

3283
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:39,980
do you think that big food could
be like an interdimensional being?

3284
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,141
It comes up.

3285
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:43,430
People do throw that out there,

3286
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:44,264
but I didn't,

3287
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,610
I decided to stay away and I said,

3288
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:46,881
no,

3289
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:48,560
I don't think that.

3290
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:49,610
I don't think that at all.

3291
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:50,570
Even after you said it,

3292
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:51,680
I refuse to think it.

3293
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:52,151
You Fuck?

3294
01:36:52,151 --> 01:36:52,880
Who was that?

3295
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,750
I'm not telling you it was,

3296
01:36:53,790 --> 01:36:54,623
it wasn't me.

3297
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:55,650
It wasn't,

3298
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:55,910
yeah,

3299
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:57,110
it was not Brian Redman.

3300
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,680
Brian Redman could give a
fuck about big foot or Ufos.

3301
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:02,060
He is a silly boy,

3302
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:04,010
but he's not a silly boy.

3303
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:06,230
And when it comes to like
ghosts and shit like that,

3304
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:11,140
mom and my sister and my Stepdad
all say that their house is haunted.

3305
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:11,440
Really?

3306
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:12,520
I've stayed at that house.

3307
01:37:12,521 --> 01:37:13,240
I've screamed,

3308
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,320
like go started jerks and I,

3309
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,600
that was the edited version.

3310
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,381
But I like,

3311
01:37:17,381 --> 01:37:21,250
I tried everything to like see or hear
this goes that they all swear fine.

3312
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:21,530
Yeah.

3313
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:25,520
Maybe their haunted and their minds
and their fucking dreams are haunted.

3314
01:37:25,521 --> 01:37:26,000
That's right.

3315
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,020
The life is haunted.

3316
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:27,770
Maybe that,

3317
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,240
maybe their life sucks a fat one.

3318
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:32,090
So they manufacturer ghosts scare the
shit out of them in the middle of the

3319
01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:32,091
night.

3320
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:32,770
Yeah,

3321
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:34,010
they gave me all the time too.

3322
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:35,960
I went out with a ghost for about,

3323
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:36,290
uh,

3324
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:37,123
not dated,

3325
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,270
but along with them for
about nine months or a year.

3326
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:43,150
That seems like a long test.

3327
01:37:43,151 --> 01:37:44,120
Part of the research for the book,

3328
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:45,470
nine months for a year.

3329
01:37:45,471 --> 01:37:46,460
How often did you do it?

3330
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:47,510
Gosh,

3331
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,470
once,

3332
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:49,650
once a month probably.

3333
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:52,790
We went out and then when he
had like a quote hot case,

3334
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:53,653
I would go,

3335
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,520
there was one case I went out on three,

3336
01:37:56,521 --> 01:38:00,020
four nights in a couple
of week timespan um,

3337
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:00,990
and look,

3338
01:38:00,991 --> 01:38:04,500
there were times when the people didn't
want to think anything was going on in

3339
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:06,160
their house and uh,

3340
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:07,860
brought him in and hopefully to debunk it.

3341
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:11,580
But there were a lot of times that people
brought him in hoping that they had it

3342
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:12,990
goes to excited about it,

3343
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,510
showing pictures of dust
motes in the air and saying,

3344
01:38:15,511 --> 01:38:16,560
look at these orbs.

3345
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:17,820
What are the words kind of thing.

3346
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:20,720
Please explain to me what the
orbs are usually their dust modes,

3347
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,170
right?

3348
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:21,360
There's,

3349
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,310
there's just dust and
stuff floating in the,

3350
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:23,761
uh,

3351
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:25,980
in the air near the camera lens.

3352
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:28,500
And so the light flashes off of that.

3353
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:28,920
Uh,

3354
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,920
Dustin creates this round image
that's semi transparent and

3355
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,210
talk to Eddie Bravo because Eddie Bravo
believes you manifest them with positive

3356
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:38,600
thinking.

3357
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:39,290
Oh,

3358
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:39,440
I'm,

3359
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:39,820
you know,

3360
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:40,250
it's fine.

3361
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,120
Hold your hands out.

3362
01:38:41,121 --> 01:38:43,370
Like he's like got them
gathered in his hands.

3363
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,510
Here's what's going on there.

3364
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:45,011
Here's a test.

3365
01:38:45,011 --> 01:38:45,130
Right?

3366
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:45,230
Yeah.

3367
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:46,460
Bravo getting,

3368
01:38:46,461 --> 01:38:48,800
get into a room as still as possible.

3369
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,450
Take some snaps.

3370
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:51,343
Right.

3371
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,860
And,

3372
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:52,880
and uh,

3373
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:53,630
test it,

3374
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:53,901
you know,

3375
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:54,411
be really,

3376
01:38:54,411 --> 01:38:55,550
really still in that room.

3377
01:38:55,551 --> 01:38:58,280
See if the amount of
orbs seems to decrease.

3378
01:38:58,630 --> 01:38:58,881
Uh,

3379
01:38:58,881 --> 01:39:00,020
the longer he stays there.

3380
01:39:00,021 --> 01:39:00,950
And I think what he'll find,

3381
01:39:00,951 --> 01:39:01,470
cause I mean,

3382
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:04,580
I know some people who who did this is
that they go the fuck away because you

3383
01:39:04,581 --> 01:39:07,520
stop stirring up the air that you've
now been really still for a while and

3384
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:07,970
you're,

3385
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:09,650
and you're taking pictures
because generally speaking,

3386
01:39:09,651 --> 01:39:10,370
I mean that's okay.

3387
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,320
What about when you get
them in outdoor shots,

3388
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:15,580
bugs and got your bitch

3389
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:20,650
bitch outdoor or a member,

3390
01:39:20,651 --> 01:39:23,470
those aliens that just
happened to be the bugs,

3391
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:24,090
you know.

3392
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,990
Oh well that's a,

3393
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:27,540
that was a video artifact
from I'm filming.

3394
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,200
Um,

3395
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:28,531
those,

3396
01:39:28,531 --> 01:39:29,310
um,

3397
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,750
those fucking cones,

3398
01:39:30,751 --> 01:39:30,961
you know,

3399
01:39:30,961 --> 01:39:31,591
those rods,

3400
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:32,700
the Roswell rods,

3401
01:39:32,701 --> 01:39:32,881
you know,

3402
01:39:32,881 --> 01:39:33,714
that whole thing.

3403
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,130
That's hilarious.

3404
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:37,080
I bought that documentary.

3405
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:37,914
I was like,

3406
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:38,803
those things,

3407
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,960
this is crazy.

3408
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:40,740
I was like,

3409
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:43,920
maybe there's some war in part of the
world where there's a bug that just flies

3410
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:44,491
really fast.

3411
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:45,270
It looks really weird.

3412
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,650
I didn't even think it was that crazy.

3413
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:46,980
Right.

3414
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,340
But then they,

3415
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,000
they're thinking they're,

3416
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,480
you know,

3417
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,160
travelers from another planet.

3418
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:51,690
That's why they're still always there.

3419
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,110
Yeah.

3420
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:55,410
But it turns out that it's just
in monster quest broke this,

3421
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:59,280
it took monster quest
to debunk you a show.

3422
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:00,220
It never gets it.

3423
01:40:00,221 --> 01:40:00,480
Never,

3424
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,110
they never haven't debunk
shit except the rods.

3425
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:03,960
But the Rod,

3426
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,040
the got your bitch.

3427
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:09,270
It's just a video artifact of certain
cameras that when they put like a super

3428
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:10,520
high speed camera on it,

3429
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:11,354
it didn't happen.

3430
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:14,450
They got the exact same
area of photographed.

3431
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:17,730
They lit a fire and bugs would
like fly around the fire.

3432
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:20,280
And when the bugs a fly
on the fire on one camera,

3433
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:24,000
they would come out like these rods cause
the camera couldn't compete with it or

3434
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:26,760
couldn't rather pick up the image
when it was moving too fast.

3435
01:40:26,761 --> 01:40:27,361
Too close to it.

3436
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:28,230
It didn't know what it was.

3437
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:29,670
Focusing on the front and the back,

3438
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:30,480
you know,

3439
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:33,990
digital imagery is kind of funky but at
the high speed camera and they got it

3440
01:40:33,991 --> 01:40:37,890
loud and clear and it's like
a third or it is stupid.

3441
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:43,420
They this fucking asshole dedicated like
decades of his life to selling these

3442
01:40:43,441 --> 01:40:46,950
DVDs and telling everybody that's
fucking rods flying around the air.

3443
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:48,341
Yeah.

3444
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:51,820
I was trying to look for things that
would help me answer the big questions if

3445
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:52,571
only for myself.

3446
01:40:52,571 --> 01:40:53,740
I got of like,

3447
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:54,610
you know,

3448
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,730
I don't want to listen to some right
wing dogmatic religious person.

3449
01:40:57,731 --> 01:40:58,451
Tell me how it is.

3450
01:40:58,451 --> 01:41:02,290
I got tired of listening
to Richard Dawkins telling
me that I'm just meat and I

3451
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:02,561
just thought,

3452
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:02,980
you know what?

3453
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:03,250
If,

3454
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,020
if,

3455
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:04,930
if it's knowable,

3456
01:41:04,931 --> 01:41:05,890
if it's observable,

3457
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:09,580
that there's more to me than that I
should be able to find a way to experience

3458
01:41:09,581 --> 01:41:12,610
this directly for myself and learn
about it directly for myself.

3459
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:17,110
So I started looking into meditation and
Lucid dreaming and trying to find some

3460
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:21,010
way of experiencing myself in a
sense of disconnected from the meat.

3461
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:21,700
Right.

3462
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:24,490
My problem with Dawkins
is he doesn't seem happy.

3463
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:25,960
I love,

3464
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,400
it's not a great advertisement for it.

3465
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:28,750
It's a terrible advertise.

3466
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:30,280
He seems like a bitter old cont.

3467
01:41:30,650 --> 01:41:35,650
Like I love the idea that he's standing
up for science and he's standing up

3468
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:40,960
against religious ideology
and brainwashing and he's,

3469
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:46,200
but he's doing it in such an hour yet
sort of aggressive way that it makes you

3470
01:41:46,421 --> 01:41:46,631
go,

3471
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:49,740
like you're kind of a bad
spokesperson for the thing.

3472
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:52,360
But I'm sure from the
scientific community,

3473
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:57,070
like the encouragement is like so strong
and profound and almost hero like that.

3474
01:41:57,071 --> 01:42:00,850
It sort of encourages him to be
this aggressive force of reason.

3475
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,480
I'm sure there's enough people like
that that he gets the encouragement he

3476
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:04,781
needs.

3477
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:05,614
But um,

3478
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:05,891
uh,

3479
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:06,724
Peter Higgs,

3480
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:07,240
uh,

3481
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,330
the guy who first started us
off looking for the Higgs Boson,

3482
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:13,690
he recently even just came in and
said to Dawkins is a fundamentalist.

3483
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:18,730
Well you said he's embarrassing Dawkins
is his behavior against the or about

3484
01:42:18,911 --> 01:42:19,351
religion?

3485
01:42:19,351 --> 01:42:20,200
It's embarrassing.

3486
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,191
Yeah.

3487
01:42:21,191 --> 01:42:22,420
And he called him a fundamentalist.

3488
01:42:22,421 --> 01:42:24,250
He said he's an atheist fundamentalist.

3489
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:28,300
And that's sort of the worst insult
that you can level at an atheist because

3490
01:42:28,301 --> 01:42:29,111
they are so,

3491
01:42:29,111 --> 01:42:29,381
you know,

3492
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:31,150
they were reacting to
fundamentalism in their,

3493
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:31,750
in their view.

3494
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:32,441
But you know,

3495
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:33,820
if you adopt a point of view,

3496
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:36,100
did that degree with that passion.

3497
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:40,300
If it walks like a fundamentalist and
talks like a five minutes and quacks like

3498
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:41,280
a fundamentalist,

3499
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,040
that's what it is.

3500
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:46,150
I guarantee you that if you could get
Richard Dawkins to take place in at least

3501
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:47,410
one mushroom trip,

3502
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,580
if not several.

3503
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:53,260
I think one to find out what the fuck
it is and then reset and revisit,

3504
01:42:53,261 --> 01:42:55,990
go back in and sort of analyze
what the fuck is happening.

3505
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:00,310
I bet he will have a completely different
opinion as to the possibilities you

3506
01:43:00,311 --> 01:43:00,671
ever follow.

3507
01:43:00,671 --> 01:43:01,504
The God helmet,

3508
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:05,290
that's that thing that they put on you
and you stimulated certain parts of your

3509
01:43:05,291 --> 01:43:06,124
brain,

3510
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,980
the temporal lobe with
electromagnetic energy.

3511
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:12,490
It's religious experiences and on a
lot of other kinds of experiences too.

3512
01:43:12,491 --> 01:43:13,120
I mean,

3513
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:13,360
but,

3514
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,890
but the thing is the atheist community,

3515
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:17,830
that sort of fundamentalist materialist
community came out and said,

3516
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:20,260
this is an explanation for
God and religious experience,

3517
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:23,680
but people have all sorts of strange
experiences when they put that helmet on.

3518
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:28,800
But guess who didn't owe Richard fucking
Dawkins and when they screened him

3519
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:30,900
before he put it on because he,

3520
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:32,830
he wanted to take part in this,

3521
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:33,550
um,

3522
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:36,670
when they screened him and put him
through sort of the questionnaire they put

3523
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:37,504
him through.

3524
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:37,751
And I,

3525
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:37,930
and,

3526
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,460
and I have not seen it and so I'm not
gonna go to describe this in great detail,

3527
01:43:40,461 --> 01:43:42,730
but person you related
this much of it to me.

3528
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,923
Um,

3529
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:45,280
when they screened him,

3530
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:45,940
he,

3531
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,890
his temporal lobe was really,

3532
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:50,200
really in active,

3533
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:50,560
right.

3534
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:50,870
It's,

3535
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,500
it's,

3536
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,333
it's

3537
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:53,110
not,

3538
01:43:53,110 --> 01:43:54,350
it's not a normal,

3539
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,960
a normally active sort of temporal lobe,

3540
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:58,280
which is what they were
trying to stimulate.

3541
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:00,730
So when he didn't have
an experience person GRE,

3542
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:01,610
um,

3543
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,230
dis sort of dismissed it as saying,

3544
01:44:03,231 --> 01:44:03,560
well,

3545
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:03,831
you know,

3546
01:44:03,831 --> 01:44:06,770
this guy isn't built like the rest of us.

3547
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:07,041
And it's,

3548
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:08,960
and it's an intriguing
thing to think that is,

3549
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:10,063
is that part of the,

3550
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:13,210
of what created his world view,

3551
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:13,560
right?

3552
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:14,810
Is Atheistic worldview.

3553
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:15,710
And,

3554
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:16,420
um,

3555
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,310
is that the case or is it just,

3556
01:44:18,311 --> 01:44:23,311
he rejects religion so strong that an
area of his brain responsible for religion

3557
01:44:23,411 --> 01:44:24,550
just gets shut down.

3558
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:24,941
Totally.

3559
01:44:24,941 --> 01:44:25,571
That's a great point.

3560
01:44:25,571 --> 01:44:25,990
Cause that's,

3561
01:44:25,990 --> 01:44:27,190
that's the other possibility,

3562
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:27,730
right?

3563
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:28,790
It could be if that's the,

3564
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:29,230
the,

3565
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:29,600
the,

3566
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,240
the source of all life,

3567
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,670
unrealistic hope in that area.

3568
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:35,200
Not even unrealistic hope.

3569
01:44:35,201 --> 01:44:35,620
Right.

3570
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,550
Maybe reality,

3571
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:37,011
the,

3572
01:44:37,011 --> 01:44:38,140
the degree to which,

3573
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:39,303
um,

3574
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:39,941
you know,

3575
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:40,920
we feel it,

3576
01:44:40,921 --> 01:44:41,111
you know,

3577
01:44:41,111 --> 01:44:42,490
if you pray or if you meditated,

3578
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,590
do you feel like you're contacting
something sort of outside yourself?

3579
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:48,350
This is the part of the brain
that processes that information.

3580
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:48,681
We'll,

3581
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:50,360
if you're never using
that part of the brain,

3582
01:44:50,361 --> 01:44:51,590
if you're never stimulating it,

3583
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:52,460
right,

3584
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,170
um,

3585
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:54,620
it will become less active.

3586
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,060
That's neuroplasticity in action.

3587
01:44:56,061 --> 01:44:56,540
That's just how it

3588
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:56,931
works.

3589
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:58,060
That totally makes sense.

3590
01:44:58,061 --> 01:45:01,150
If you completely reject
any idea of Wu whatsoever,

3591
01:45:01,151 --> 01:45:03,190
the woo part of your brand,

3592
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,060
you know,

3593
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:09,060
there's a big issue that I have with
people that will say that an experience,

3594
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,340
whether it's an experience
like Edgar Mitchell had,

3595
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,950
or whether it's a psychedelic experience,

3596
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:16,630
the they'll say,

3597
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,730
especially in terms of
psychedelic experience,

3598
01:45:18,731 --> 01:45:19,960
I say that it's not real.

3599
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:20,541
Like it's you,

3600
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:24,370
you had an hallucination
but the same effect.

3601
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:29,740
It has the same effect rather
on you as a real experience.

3602
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:32,140
Like even if it's a hallucination,

3603
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:32,860
let's let's,

3604
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:36,760
let's defined a hallucination as you're
seeing something that's not there.

3605
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:41,790
Even if it's that from that you benefit
greatly and you have a real thing is

3606
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:47,590
going on in your imagination
or wherever it is,

3607
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:51,130
you really are receiving information.

3608
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:55,450
You really are looking at yourself in
the world in a totally different way.

3609
01:45:55,451 --> 01:45:56,680
It's actually happening.

3610
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:57,880
So this event,

3611
01:45:58,150 --> 01:45:59,140
this experience,

3612
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:00,131
whatever it is,

3613
01:46:00,131 --> 01:46:04,030
I mean we want to compartmentalize
it because you're,

3614
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:08,500
you're taking in some sort of a substance
alien to the body that tricks the body

3615
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:11,590
into having the state and achieving
the state and having this experience,

3616
01:46:11,591 --> 01:46:14,980
but it's still an experience
that you actually really have.

3617
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:15,280
Can,

3618
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:19,150
can we segue into lucid dreaming because
I heard you mentioned that you were

3619
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,420
sit in it and I really,

3620
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:23,900
maybe the most gratifying thing that's
happened to me in writing the book is

3621
01:46:23,901 --> 01:46:26,870
whenever I do a public appearance or
a podcast with a big enough audience,

3622
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:29,600
I end up getting notes from people
afterwards that they had a lucid dream.

3623
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:30,870
Either,

3624
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:31,140
you know,

3625
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:34,760
after the interview or after they went
and then read the book or whatever it is.

3626
01:46:34,761 --> 01:46:36,900
And I love turning people on to it

3627
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:37,990
because you a big,

3628
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:38,460
do you,

3629
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,000
do you do this on a regular basis?

3630
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:40,860
I do it on a wrangler

3631
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,060
basis before we had our,

3632
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:46,080
my wife and I just had fraternal twin
boys and I'm there almost six months old.

3633
01:46:46,081 --> 01:46:48,210
So sleep has been hard to come by at home,

3634
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:49,673
but it's,

3635
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,611
I'm so proud of this.

3636
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:51,480
Right before,

3637
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:53,610
before they came along,

3638
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:56,820
I was having a lucid dream every two
or three weeks without even trying.

3639
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,300
I mean just spontaneously because
I trained at it long enough,

3640
01:47:00,301 --> 01:47:02,400
hard enough that I was having
them every two or three weeks,

3641
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:03,450
um,

3642
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:04,710
since they were born.

3643
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:05,760
I actually recently,

3644
01:47:05,761 --> 01:47:07,410
cause they're starting to
sleep a little bit now.

3645
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:11,130
I actually had a couple just in the
last couple of weeks and it's over three

3646
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:11,670
weeks.

3647
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:12,503
I had to.

3648
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,230
And it's like,

3649
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:13,681
oh great.

3650
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:14,640
It's coming back online.

3651
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:19,380
This function of Steve Volk is returning
now that he's getting proper rest,

3652
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:19,861
you know,

3653
01:47:19,861 --> 01:47:20,694
and um,

3654
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,200
and it's,

3655
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,290
it's pretty terrific.

3656
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:22,630
And,

3657
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:26,640
and one of the great things about it is
that it changes your waking life as well

3658
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:28,230
as your dreaming life.

3659
01:47:28,231 --> 01:47:28,381
I mean,

3660
01:47:28,381 --> 01:47:32,520
it honestly wouldn't be worth the effort
if you were only doing it to experience

3661
01:47:32,521 --> 01:47:34,680
a change in your consciousness
when you're dreaming.

3662
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:38,850
So lucid dreaming for those that don't
know is the act of being aware and you're

3663
01:47:38,851 --> 01:47:41,970
dreaming while you're dreaming
and then choosing accordingly.

3664
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:42,600
Right?

3665
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,950
So think of it this way.

3666
01:47:43,951 --> 01:47:48,120
One great way of introducing people to
the idea is that we're going to talk

3667
01:47:48,121 --> 01:47:49,550
about the fill tank at four more hours.

3668
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,750
One of the ways of introducing people
to lucid dreaming to understand what it

3669
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:55,560
really is and,

3670
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,070
and usually I'm asking this if like
a crowded book reading or something,

3671
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:00,480
but I'll ask you guys here,

3672
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:02,790
have any of you ever woken
yourself up from a nightmare?

3673
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,320
Yes.

3674
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:04,980
Yeah.

3675
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:08,010
You were this close to having a lucid
dreaming Gillette having a lucid dream

3676
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,230
because you are aware you were
dreaming while you're dreaming.

3677
01:48:10,231 --> 01:48:10,620
You're like,

3678
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:10,951
Shit,

3679
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:11,784
this is a nightmare,

3680
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:12,420
right?

3681
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,700
I'm going to wake myself up and
you chose to wake yourself up.

3682
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,870
But the fact is,

3683
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:19,420
since whatever was chasing you or whatever
was happening that made it qualify as

3684
01:48:19,421 --> 01:48:20,190
a nightmare,

3685
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,600
had no external reality,

3686
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,640
you could have just walked
away from it and your dream,

3687
01:48:23,641 --> 01:48:24,150
you could have,

3688
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:25,710
because the laws of physics don't apply,

3689
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,180
flown away from it.

3690
01:48:27,450 --> 01:48:28,740
You could have gone up to it and said,

3691
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:29,340
Yo,

3692
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:29,610
what's up?

3693
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,510
Why are you chasing me?

3694
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:31,980
Completely control your room.

3695
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:32,700
Well,

3696
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:33,241
no,

3697
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:35,220
you control you within your dream.

3698
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:39,720
And for some people they find that they
can begin to control other aspects of it

3699
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:40,770
and make things happen.

3700
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:45,980
I had one that was totally like I could
stop time and we wind the tape and,

3701
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,610
and started again.

3702
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:49,340
I had a dream that I was in a cracks and,

3703
01:48:49,341 --> 01:48:49,531
and,

3704
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:51,510
and I got lucid and I'm,

3705
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:53,490
I'm actually already was
really outing myself here.

3706
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:54,990
I always had a phobia about driving.

3707
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:55,500
I do it.

3708
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,333
I've never enjoyed it.

3709
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:56,880
Right.

3710
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,450
But Lucid dreaming really
helped me push past that.

3711
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:01,590
Um,

3712
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:04,860
and one of the ways was I was
having this recurring nightmare.

3713
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,111
This is not one,

3714
01:49:06,111 --> 01:49:06,571
it's in the book.

3715
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:08,730
This is a bonus baby and
there's a different nightmare.

3716
01:49:08,731 --> 01:49:09,564
I dealt with in the book.

3717
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:10,693
Um,

3718
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:14,340
I had this recurring dream that I
would find myself outside the car,

3719
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:16,490
but the car was,

3720
01:49:16,491 --> 01:49:17,500
but I was driving the car.

3721
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:22,020
So there was like a me watching and then
it me driving and I would rack because

3722
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,630
I felt myself not in control of the car.

3723
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:26,760
And so I finally had a lucid dream.

3724
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:28,230
I got got lucid and realizes,

3725
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:28,381
oh,

3726
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:33,381
I mean in this fricking recurring dream
and I kept crashing the car from this

3727
01:49:33,931 --> 01:49:36,310
distance and I would just rewind it and,

3728
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,340
and try and get better control of it.

3729
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:40,980
But I kept trying to get better
control of it from a distance.

3730
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:45,210
And so finally I just kind of Zap myself
into the body that was driving the car,

3731
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:47,100
the me that was actually driving the car.

3732
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,591
It's like,

3733
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:48,010
well shit,

3734
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,240
I just need to drive the car.

3735
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:51,700
I need to actually be behind the wheel.

3736
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:52,870
Not In this disconnected way,

3737
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:53,950
but in this present way.

3738
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,850
I realize what the dream
had been telling me.

3739
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:01,160
How you purposely got involved in the
idea of lucid dreaming for the book.

3740
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:05,860
So how did you go about
manifesting a lucid dream?

3741
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:06,221
Okay,

3742
01:50:06,221 --> 01:50:06,780
so,

3743
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:07,540
um,

3744
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:12,210
I started researching the main guy
who has studied lucid dreaming,

3745
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,110
proved it was real and it holds for thing.

3746
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:18,580
Doctor Steven Lubbers started reading
his book and planning to go to Hawaii for

3747
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:21,210
his 10 day workshop and
I started convenient.

3748
01:50:21,211 --> 01:50:22,780
He has a 10 day workshop in Hawaii.

3749
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:24,340
It's,

3750
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,160
it's pretty cool.

3751
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:25,510
It's,

3752
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:27,400
I highly recommend vacation.

3753
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,750
It's an incredible vacation.

3754
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:29,650
And,

3755
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:30,310
um,

3756
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:31,780
and it's a vacation
that tapped me into it,

3757
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:33,190
like a whole new lingo of my life.

3758
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:34,540
And so,

3759
01:50:34,541 --> 01:50:35,374
um,

3760
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,610
it's the act of being aware.

3761
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:38,530
You're dreaming while you're
dreaming and choosing accordingly.

3762
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:42,400
And the F I realized once I read that,

3763
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:45,340
that I had woken myself up
from nightmares for years.

3764
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:47,110
And so it's like,

3765
01:50:47,111 --> 01:50:47,321
okay,

3766
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:49,420
I have an opportunity to do
something different here.

3767
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,550
So there's different ways
you can train for it.

3768
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:55,600
One of them is you take
the time to remember,

3769
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:56,020
uh,

3770
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:56,501
for instance,

3771
01:50:56,501 --> 01:50:58,900
a reoccurring dream or the
dream you had last night.

3772
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,530
Right?

3773
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:02,380
I really recommend doing
it with a recurring dream.

3774
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,950
You remember it particularly a
nightmare because those are so vivid.

3775
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:07,593
You remember it,

3776
01:51:07,750 --> 01:51:08,770
it's like a meditation.

3777
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,150
You meditate on it and you choose the
point in the dream where you wish you had

3778
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:13,984
become lucid,

3779
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:16,120
where you wish you had gained control.

3780
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,710
And so the,

3781
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:21,820
the dream and the book that I had worked
with was a dream where this creepy dude

3782
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:26,821
shows up outside my house and he's peeking
in through the window and eventually

3783
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:29,590
I end up getting angry that
he's trying to terrorize me.

3784
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:30,760
And I opened the door and we would,

3785
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:31,481
we would fight,

3786
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:35,410
we would clash and I would wake up
literally at times punching the air just

3787
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:37,450
because I'm going after this guy.

3788
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:42,250
So I decided to meditate on that dream
and look for the spot within that dream

3789
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:43,840
where I could,

3790
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:44,890
uh,

3791
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:45,723
get lucid.

3792
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:48,040
And Gosh,

3793
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:50,160
I'm not sure how long I at this point in,

3794
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:50,950
it's in the book,

3795
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:51,221
but I,

3796
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:52,750
it was probably a couple of weeks of,

3797
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:55,210
of work where maybe 10 minutes,

3798
01:51:55,211 --> 01:51:55,751
one day,

3799
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,351
five minutes,

3800
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:56,770
the next,

3801
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,960
maybe the 15 minutes before
I fell asleep one night.

3802
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:01,270
And finally the dream happened.

3803
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,680
And when the guys showed up in,

3804
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:04,150
in,

3805
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:04,540
uh,

3806
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:05,380
my window,

3807
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:06,940
I realized,

3808
01:52:06,941 --> 01:52:07,241
Shit,

3809
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:08,074
this is,

3810
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:09,610
remember this is the dream.

3811
01:52:09,611 --> 01:52:10,450
I'm dreaming.

3812
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:12,430
And to feel yourself like,

3813
01:52:12,431 --> 01:52:13,264
to feel this.

3814
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,880
You don't realize it until
you've had a lucid dream,

3815
01:52:16,060 --> 01:52:17,320
but this youth,

3816
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,070
there's a sense of disconnect between
you and the in the u and the dream,

3817
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,113
right?

3818
01:52:22,350 --> 01:52:26,920
Until you lucid dream and suddenly
find yourself in this dream body,

3819
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:27,220
you're,

3820
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,110
you're no longer watching it like a movie.

3821
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:32,290
You are in it and it's like the Matrix.

3822
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:32,890
It just,

3823
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:33,160
it's,

3824
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,320
you get to be neo.

3825
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,480
Suddenly the,

3826
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:37,361
as I said before,

3827
01:52:37,361 --> 01:52:38,350
the laws of physics,

3828
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:39,310
Plano part in,

3829
01:52:39,311 --> 01:52:41,800
most people find when they really begin,

3830
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:43,570
when they first have a lucid dream,

3831
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:46,390
there's this exhibit
exhilarating sort of feeling

3832
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,460
flying and dream sex.

3833
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:51,090
Like those are the first things
that people usually do this on.

3834
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,090
Anybody wants to fly him?

3835
01:52:52,091 --> 01:52:53,020
Fuck yeah,

3836
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,010
they banked some honey or they take off
and it just lets you know that what is

3837
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,090
what is best in life.

3838
01:52:58,091 --> 01:52:58,930
Conan was right,

3839
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,330
he was right.

3840
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:02,500
Everybody running around.

3841
01:53:02,501 --> 01:53:03,810
I just want support and have friends.

3842
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:04,663
The Fuck Outta here.

3843
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:06,060
What do you do when you're in your dream?

3844
01:53:06,061 --> 01:53:07,000
Did you make some friends?

3845
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:07,540
No.

3846
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:08,021
You fucking,

3847
01:53:08,021 --> 01:53:08,854
you fly.

3848
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,433
I,

3849
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:11,670
I have found that when I,

3850
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:13,500
we're doomed when I don't,

3851
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:16,470
when I don't have a plan in a lucid dream,

3852
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,490
I spontaneously,

3853
01:53:17,491 --> 01:53:18,500
the first thing I think to do,

3854
01:53:18,510 --> 01:53:18,661
like,

3855
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:19,950
because you can plan activities,

3856
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,530
you can say I want to have a
conversation with so and so.

3857
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:23,321
I've had a lot of,

3858
01:53:23,321 --> 01:53:24,800
a fair amount of deaths in my family.

3859
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:25,740
My Mom's Dad,

3860
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,780
my oldest brother is dead.

3861
01:53:28,030 --> 01:53:29,970
A brother in law who was very
much like a brother to me.

3862
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:31,320
He was in the family since I was 12.

3863
01:53:31,321 --> 01:53:32,460
We shared a room together.

3864
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:33,031
Uh,

3865
01:53:33,031 --> 01:53:33,721
he's dead.

3866
01:53:33,721 --> 01:53:35,130
I had two friends die of cancer.

3867
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:36,350
Um,

3868
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:40,380
and right around the time that the book
where I was working on the book and um,

3869
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:41,880
I wanted to see my mother again.

3870
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,730
So I had a lucid dream in which,

3871
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:44,971
you know,

3872
01:53:44,971 --> 01:53:46,380
I remembered that that's what I wanted.

3873
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,450
And I called out into the dream,

3874
01:53:48,451 --> 01:53:49,410
show me my mother,

3875
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,730
show me,

3876
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:51,541
show me my brother,

3877
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:52,620
show me my brother in law.

3878
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,030
And suddenly I was in,

3879
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:55,103
I was in the kind of like,

3880
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,041
when the dream started,

3881
01:53:56,041 --> 01:54:00,090
I was in kind of like a mall and I got
lucid because Leonardo Dicaprio showed up

3882
01:54:00,091 --> 01:54:02,250
and shoved me and I
realized it's Fucking Weird,

3883
01:54:02,251 --> 01:54:03,210
leaner decapitation Oh,

3884
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:03,900
I'm in a dream.

3885
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:04,171
Right.

3886
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:04,860
That's how I,

3887
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:06,030
that's how I gained lucidity.

3888
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:07,410
And um,

3889
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:10,170
and I remembered what it was
and I wanted to be there for,

3890
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:11,580
and so when I called out,

3891
01:54:11,581 --> 01:54:12,480
show me my mother,

3892
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,560
it was like the mall disappeared and
there I was just in this black space.

3893
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:21,840
And then my mom was there and
this is years after she died.

3894
01:54:21,841 --> 01:54:26,040
I got to hug her and it
felt every bit is real,

3895
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:26,851
is really doing it.

3896
01:54:26,851 --> 01:54:27,990
I could feel her warm,

3897
01:54:27,991 --> 01:54:28,890
soft skin.

3898
01:54:28,891 --> 01:54:30,240
I could feel the bones under the skin.

3899
01:54:30,241 --> 01:54:34,120
I could smell her shampoo
that she used on her hair,

3900
01:54:34,121 --> 01:54:34,651
that should,

3901
01:54:34,651 --> 01:54:35,700
I had not even thought of.

3902
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:36,361
You know what I mean?

3903
01:54:36,361 --> 01:54:36,710
Like a,

3904
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:38,460
that were memories of hugging my mother.

3905
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:39,713
Um,

3906
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:40,921
it's a beautiful,

3907
01:54:40,921 --> 01:54:41,641
beautiful experience.

3908
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:42,140
And I,

3909
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:43,400
I called for my brother
and my brother and I,

3910
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:43,801
they were there.

3911
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:45,240
We ended up doing like
kind of a group hug.

3912
01:54:45,710 --> 01:54:46,531
So it was really nice.

3913
01:54:46,531 --> 01:54:48,840
What do you think is going on
when you're having a lucid dream?

3914
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:50,123
I think you're dreaming,

3915
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:51,143
right?

3916
01:54:51,460 --> 01:54:52,230
What's,

3917
01:54:52,230 --> 01:54:55,600
what is it allowing you to piece
together this artificial reality?

3918
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:55,920
You know,

3919
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:56,350
they're not

3920
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,183
Carly.

3921
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:58,043
Um,

3922
01:54:58,540 --> 01:54:58,960
well,

3923
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,840
what's allowing you to dream?

3924
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:00,280
And we'll say,

3925
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,113
here's the thing,

3926
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:02,073
people think of

3927
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:04,790
sleep as losing consciousness.

3928
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:07,580
The fact is what you lose is awareness.

3929
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:10,880
You're conscious because you're able
to report what happened afterward.

3930
01:55:10,881 --> 01:55:13,370
Or at least most of us
have some memory of,

3931
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:16,400
of our dreams entering
into another dimension.

3932
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:17,300
So,

3933
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:20,240
so dreaming is what happens in
the absence of external input,

3934
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:20,720
right?

3935
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,460
We're not getting any
external input anymore.

3936
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,770
This is just our mind,

3937
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:25,963
right?

3938
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,210
Can we call that another dimension?

3939
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:29,870
When you,

3940
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:32,030
the dimension of imagination,

3941
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:33,380
whatever the fuck that is,

3942
01:55:33,381 --> 01:55:35,240
however it exists in whatever,

3943
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:36,380
whatever,

3944
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:37,243
whatever,

3945
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:37,701
you know,

3946
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:38,181
theater,

3947
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,630
it plays out in theirs.

3948
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,300
It's going on somewhere.

3949
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:41,781
I mean,

3950
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:44,190
whether it's just a bunch of firing inside

3951
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:44,551
your head,

3952
01:55:44,551 --> 01:55:45,750
it's not really real.

3953
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,850
At least inside your head.

3954
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,860
There's a whole fake world.

3955
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:51,120
Like what is that?

3956
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:51,510
That's,

3957
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:51,960
that's it.

3958
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,760
That's the mystery of consciousness,

3959
01:55:53,761 --> 01:55:54,060
right?

3960
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:55,200
That's the mystery of consciousness.

3961
01:55:55,610 --> 01:55:56,000
Where'd,

3962
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,930
where does this experience
really come from?

3963
01:55:57,931 --> 01:55:59,940
How could the neurons,

3964
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:04,770
this three pound gelatinous mass secreting
and emitting chemicals and electrical

3965
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:07,920
firings create this in any,

3966
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:11,700
the truth of this is that
we don't fucking know.

3967
01:56:11,701 --> 01:56:11,921
And,

3968
01:56:11,921 --> 01:56:15,260
and yet we're inundated
with people telling us what,

3969
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,840
what we should consider important and,

3970
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:21,600
and telling us at this point to just
drilling us with this kind of materialist

3971
01:56:21,601 --> 01:56:22,780
paradigm that you,

3972
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:24,660
that we are meet computers,

3973
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:26,030
that we have no freewill.

3974
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:28,260
All this sort of to me,

3975
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:28,501
you know,

3976
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:29,334
just sort of,

3977
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,800
I don't buy that the no free will thing.

3978
01:56:31,801 --> 01:56:32,634
And I think if,

3979
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,400
if they don't know how to explain it,

3980
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:36,234
how am no free,

3981
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:37,650
how we have freewill.

3982
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:41,820
It's because we don't know yet enough
about the brain and consciousness.

3983
01:56:42,140 --> 01:56:42,630
Um,

3984
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:42,901
but,

3985
01:56:42,901 --> 01:56:43,830
and I love Sam Harris.

3986
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:48,270
Sam Harris really turned me on to
meditation through reading his book and I

3987
01:56:48,271 --> 01:56:50,220
consider him like sort of
among the new atheists,

3988
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:51,120
he is a breed apart.

3989
01:56:51,121 --> 01:56:54,600
I love the interview you did with him
because he admits that the paranormals

3990
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,360
been unfairly stigmatized and,

3991
01:56:56,361 --> 01:56:57,194
and all this sort of stuff.

3992
01:56:57,270 --> 01:57:00,150
But he's one of the guys out there
trumpeting that we have no free will.

3993
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:04,770
And I am really happy for the
opportunity to talk about this because,

3994
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:05,850
you know,

3995
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:10,850
and he says rightly that a dogmatic
religion has an unhealthy effect on,

3996
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:12,150
on the psyche.

3997
01:57:12,151 --> 01:57:15,620
And it certainly does for a lot of
people write it as a healthy on effect on

3998
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,010
people in society.

3999
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:18,120
Um,

4000
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:18,481
because they're,

4001
01:57:18,481 --> 01:57:18,631
you know,

4002
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:19,464
they're fearful,

4003
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,680
they're judgmental of other
people and all this sort of stuff.

4004
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:26,010
But when you tell people
they have no freewill,

4005
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,410
they are more likely to cheat.

4006
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,730
Umm,

4007
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:31,230
and this has been researched,

4008
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:31,950
right?

4009
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:35,190
When you expose people to the idea that
they have no free will and then you give

4010
01:57:35,191 --> 01:57:37,420
them an opportunity to cheat,

4011
01:57:37,421 --> 01:57:38,340
it's something they'll do it.

4012
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,620
And if you tell people,

4013
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:41,813
um,

4014
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:42,720
uh,

4015
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:43,170
was the other one,

4016
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:43,530
oh,

4017
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,730
they did this as games,

4018
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:47,150
anything or it was a test.

4019
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,710
It was an academic test
and they cheated him,

4020
01:57:49,711 --> 01:57:53,110
cheat on an academic test because
they were told they have no freewill.

4021
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:56,340
So they were more Bo's idea that
they most likely had no freewill.

4022
01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:58,440
And the control group who was not,

4023
01:57:58,441 --> 01:58:00,480
was not exposed to that information,

4024
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:04,080
didn't cheat as much as the people who
are anywhere near as much as the people

4025
01:58:04,081 --> 01:58:07,620
who had been exposed to the
idea that we have no free will.

4026
01:58:07,710 --> 01:58:11,580
And when you say that Sam Harris
believes that we have no freewill,

4027
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:13,390
we should kind of does.

4028
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:18,400
It's a very comprehensive sort of a take
on things that has to do with not just

4029
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:20,250
natural selection,

4030
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:20,850
but the,

4031
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:21,100
the,

4032
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:26,040
the human organism itself and all the
reward systems that are put in place to

4033
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:27,270
motivate behavior.

4034
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:28,320
It's a,

4035
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:33,320
it's not like he believes that there's
an architect that's guiding your life.

4036
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:34,371
Oh No,

4037
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:34,530
no,

4038
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:34,980
no.

4039
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,390
I just want to let everybody else,

4040
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:37,350
you know,

4041
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:38,810
when you say you have no free will,

4042
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:39,690
like to,

4043
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:41,220
for a lot of people with a religious,

4044
01:58:41,610 --> 01:58:42,390
exactly.

4045
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,980
A fundamental idea and that's he's,

4046
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:45,420
he's more,

4047
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:49,680
he's looking at it completely the
opposite from a scientific perspective.

4048
01:58:49,681 --> 01:58:54,150
The idea is that you're motivated
constantly by a series of factors that are

4049
01:58:54,151 --> 01:58:54,984
beyond your control.

4050
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:55,621
Theoretically,

4051
01:58:55,621 --> 01:58:56,880
if this is a completely just,

4052
01:58:56,881 --> 01:58:57,091
you know,

4053
01:58:57,091 --> 01:58:59,400
sort of a naturalistic material universe,

4054
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:03,030
if we could measure all the variables
from the big bang until now,

4055
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,750
we could predict everything and
you're going to do your entire life,

4056
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:10,710
every choice you're going to make because
it's all the result of the conditions

4057
01:59:10,711 --> 01:59:11,910
that that led up to it.

4058
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:12,360
Yeah,

4059
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:17,360
and other crazy idea once of taking a
computer that's so powerful that you could

4060
01:59:18,541 --> 01:59:23,541
input in all of the data of everything
in the state that it exists right now in

4061
01:59:23,911 --> 01:59:24,450
the world,

4062
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:25,740
everything that exists in the world,

4063
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:27,480
in the state that it exists right now,

4064
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:32,510
and from that you could extrapolate
and go back through time and get a full

4065
01:59:32,881 --> 01:59:36,900
detailed depiction of every
single event that took place.

4066
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:40,530
It sounds completely ridiculous right now,

4067
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,570
but I don't think that's
ridiculous in the future.

4068
01:59:42,571 --> 01:59:44,900
I think we're going to
be able to get data from,

4069
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:46,970
I'm like whoever thought
like a million years ago,

4070
01:59:46,990 --> 01:59:49,000
you'd be able to get ice samples and that,

4071
01:59:49,001 --> 01:59:50,970
that was going to tell
you a climate change,

4072
01:59:50,971 --> 01:59:51,121
you know,

4073
01:59:51,121 --> 01:59:52,810
from thousands and thousands a year.

4074
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:55,890
And that's how we know what the
fuck was going on 6,000 years ago.

4075
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:58,140
You drill a gigantic chunk of ice and go,

4076
01:59:58,141 --> 01:59:58,341
well,

4077
01:59:58,341 --> 02:00:00,810
shit was different here and
looking at a foot higher,

4078
02:00:00,811 --> 02:00:01,710
it's different here.

4079
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:02,603
Yeah.

4080
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:03,573
Um,

4081
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:04,400
can I,

4082
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,790
if I can take this back to lucid dreaming.

4083
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:06,011
Yeah,

4084
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:06,480
please.

4085
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,770
So another way of,

4086
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,100
and this is the part that really
gets beneficial for your daily life.

4087
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:13,440
The part that was most
powerful for me in that sense.

4088
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:14,460
Um,

4089
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,800
the other way you can train
yourself to have a lucid dream.

4090
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:17,491
First of all,

4091
02:00:17,491 --> 02:00:18,660
you have to ask yourself the question,

4092
02:00:18,661 --> 02:00:20,640
how do you know when you're
awake or when you're dreaming,

4093
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:21,450
right?

4094
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:21,700
How,

4095
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:26,160
how do you know what's different and
what a lubbers found and what everybody

4096
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:28,490
else subsequently is found is that there,

4097
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:33,300
there's this kind of state tests you
can do to see which state you're in.

4098
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,280
And the idea is to start doing it.

4099
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:37,170
When you're awake,

4100
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:38,070
do it all the time.

4101
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,560
It should probably come from
some Q and the environment.

4102
02:00:40,830 --> 02:00:42,750
If something odd happens
where you just think,

4103
02:00:42,751 --> 02:00:42,871
oh,

4104
02:00:42,871 --> 02:00:43,800
that's strange,

4105
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,450
lock into that.

4106
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:46,080
Right?

4107
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,790
And here's how you would do a state test.

4108
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:48,540
Um,

4109
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:51,510
print changes in a dream.

4110
02:00:51,511 --> 02:00:52,650
If you look at it,

4111
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:55,590
something printed and then
look away and then look back.

4112
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:56,873
Um,

4113
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,320
sometimes you have to
do it a couple of times.

4114
02:00:58,740 --> 02:00:59,070
It,

4115
02:00:59,070 --> 02:00:59,821
it will change.

4116
02:00:59,821 --> 02:01:02,370
And the reason is because that print
doesn't have any external reality.

4117
02:01:02,371 --> 02:01:06,960
It's something that your
mind is producing a for you.

4118
02:01:06,961 --> 02:01:07,794
So,

4119
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:08,071
um,

4120
02:01:08,071 --> 02:01:08,790
I had,

4121
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:09,180
uh,

4122
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:10,140
print at one point.

4123
02:01:10,470 --> 02:01:11,430
I usually,

4124
02:01:11,431 --> 02:01:12,660
I've just been able to figure out,

4125
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,580
I just kind of lock into it and get,

4126
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:14,911
okay,

4127
02:01:14,911 --> 02:01:15,690
this is a dream.

4128
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:16,590
Like Leonardo Dicaprio,

4129
02:01:16,591 --> 02:01:17,424
push it,

4130
02:01:17,850 --> 02:01:21,360
push through and it was out in real life
and all sudden you thought you were in

4131
02:01:21,361 --> 02:01:21,721
a dream.

4132
02:01:21,721 --> 02:01:24,510
She started fucking random
people having sex with Leah.

4133
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:26,250
What the fuck man?

4134
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:27,690
I thought it was lucid dreaming.

4135
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:29,520
Well this is why this is why
you might want to do a state.

4136
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:29,940
Yeah.

4137
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:30,360
As well,

4138
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:30,550
right?

4139
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:30,870
Yeah.

4140
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:34,170
And so you check print and you see if
the print changed and I had print change

4141
02:01:34,171 --> 02:01:35,230
and to just um,

4142
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:40,280
like symbols at 1.0 book just changed
into a series of incomprehensible symbols.

4143
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,360
Um,

4144
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,470
digital clocks,

4145
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:42,800
uh,

4146
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,610
will really malfunction and machinery
in general will not function because you

4147
02:01:46,611 --> 02:01:46,671
know,

4148
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:49,460
you flip that light switch over there
and it's actually connected to the light

4149
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:50,294
bulbs.

4150
02:01:50,690 --> 02:01:51,740
But in the dream it's not

4151
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:56,240
anything you flip the light switch and
maybe the light goes on the first time.

4152
02:01:56,241 --> 02:01:59,690
Then when you turn it off it doesn't go
off because it's not actually connected

4153
02:01:59,691 --> 02:01:59,901
anything.

4154
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:00,051
Yeah.

4155
02:02:00,051 --> 02:02:02,870
I've had that happen in June was four
where I realized it was lucid because I

4156
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:04,520
couldn't turn the light
switches on and off.

4157
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:06,510
I've had that and so I realized,

4158
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:06,950
Oh,

4159
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:07,880
this is a lucid dream.

4160
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,900
Like this is a dream.

4161
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:09,400
Ed,

4162
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:10,400
did you do anything with that?

4163
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:11,180
Um,

4164
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:11,631
you know,

4165
02:02:11,631 --> 02:02:14,660
when I started taking nootropics,

4166
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,180
I had much more success
with lucid dreaming.

4167
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:22,250
I've found that my lucid dreams
before where we're so fragile,

4168
02:02:22,251 --> 02:02:23,390
they were like a bubble,

4169
02:02:23,391 --> 02:02:24,530
like a child's bubble,

4170
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:25,040
you know,

4171
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,870
when they blow with those things.

4172
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:29,240
But then once I started taking nootropics,

4173
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:32,510
there were like a fucking
volleyball and I was like hard,

4174
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:34,340
you can kick it around like it was,

4175
02:02:34,341 --> 02:02:35,000
it was different.

4176
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:35,833
He couldn't pop it.

4177
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:37,350
I can't wait to take my on.

4178
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,593
Yeah.

4179
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,280
Any new tropics,

4180
02:02:40,281 --> 02:02:40,551
you know,

4181
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:45,530
I obviously we sell on it products because
they're the best that we can possibly

4182
02:02:45,531 --> 02:02:45,771
sell.

4183
02:02:45,771 --> 02:02:47,060
We sell the best shit we can sell.

4184
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:48,090
But if you're not anyway,

4185
02:02:48,090 --> 02:02:48,741
for whatever reason,

4186
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:49,574
if you're skeptical,

4187
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,420
there's a lot of ingredients that the
GRI ingredients are available online.

4188
02:02:53,421 --> 02:02:57,500
Take any of those and whether
in conjunction or individually,

4189
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:59,600
there's a lot of different
companies and have them,

4190
02:02:59,601 --> 02:02:59,870
uh,

4191
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:01,430
I've always talked about neuro one,

4192
02:03:01,431 --> 02:03:01,881
which is,

4193
02:03:01,881 --> 02:03:02,450
um,

4194
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,770
Bill Roman [inaudible] stuff.

4195
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:04,790
It's all theirs.

4196
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:06,140
It's all fascinating stuff.

4197
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:08,360
And you will have an increase in

4198
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:09,253
brain functions.

4199
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:10,670
So when you're doing a state test,

4200
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:11,240
when you're,

4201
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:11,931
when you're awake,

4202
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:12,500
right?

4203
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,960
One of the other things you do
is you look for the behavior,

4204
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,330
a strange behavior in the
people that are around you.

4205
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,980
And it's my whole life though.

4206
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,541
When you're a comedian,

4207
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:22,490
I'm going to dream and you'll,

4208
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:23,750
you'll find,

4209
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:27,260
you'll find that initially when you
first start trying to do state tests,

4210
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:28,094
when you're awake,

4211
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:32,100
maybe the first day it feels
really awkward because now you're,

4212
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:33,380
I'm having a conversation with you,

4213
02:03:33,381 --> 02:03:34,910
but I'm also looking at
the print on your shirt.

4214
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:37,880
I'm looking down and then up and down and
then up to see that it stays the same.

4215
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:40,670
But after you get used to doing that.

4216
02:03:40,671 --> 02:03:42,950
And for me it only took a day,

4217
02:03:42,951 --> 02:03:43,671
day and a half,

4218
02:03:43,671 --> 02:03:43,851
you know,

4219
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:47,300
something like that of doing a state
test maybe eight or 10 times a day.

4220
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:51,980
I found that my state tests were actually
making me more aware and more mindful

4221
02:03:51,981 --> 02:03:56,120
of everything that was going on
around me all the time and it,

4222
02:03:56,150 --> 02:03:59,450
and it seemed to have that
effect of slowing my life down,

4223
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:01,190
making be more considerate of,

4224
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:02,211
of what's happening,

4225
02:04:02,211 --> 02:04:04,520
making me more present to
the person that I'm with.

4226
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:05,651
And suddenly I,

4227
02:04:05,651 --> 02:04:06,620
and I realized,

4228
02:04:06,621 --> 02:04:06,880
right,

4229
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,120
like when Sam or somebody says,

4230
02:04:08,121 --> 02:04:09,080
we have no free will.

4231
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:09,591
You know,

4232
02:04:09,591 --> 02:04:11,630
a lot of times we are just on autopilot.

4233
02:04:11,631 --> 02:04:12,620
We're just reacting.

4234
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,760
How often do you eat a meal in?

4235
02:04:14,761 --> 02:04:17,450
Don't really taste it because you
were busy and you were thinking about

4236
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:18,680
something else.

4237
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:19,580
Um,

4238
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,290
when I started practicing lucid dreaming,

4239
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:21,951
it was really,

4240
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:23,330
it's a mindfulness practice.

4241
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:23,541
I mean,

4242
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:26,690
it hearkens back to the Buddhist
practice of mindfulness.

4243
02:04:26,691 --> 02:04:29,060
You are just more aware of
what's going on all the time.

4244
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:30,081
I,

4245
02:04:30,081 --> 02:04:30,620
um,

4246
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:32,900
saw a movie that gave
me a great technique.

4247
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:33,800
I forget what it was.

4248
02:04:33,801 --> 02:04:35,870
I think it was through the
rabbit hole or one of those.

4249
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:40,540
What the bleep movies are
just overrun with fuckery.

4250
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:40,880
Yeah.

4251
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:41,050
Okay.

4252
02:04:41,050 --> 02:04:42,700
There's a lot of fuckery in those movies.

4253
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,481
However,

4254
02:04:43,481 --> 02:04:46,240
even amongst fuckery you
can sometimes get some,

4255
02:04:46,241 --> 02:04:50,710
get something you can use and one of them
is in one of the videos the guy said,

4256
02:04:50,770 --> 02:04:52,360
when you come to a doorway,

4257
02:04:52,510 --> 02:04:54,820
knock on the door and say,

4258
02:04:54,821 --> 02:04:55,960
knock on the side of the door and say,

4259
02:04:55,961 --> 02:04:58,990
am I dreaming and do that
during your waking hours?

4260
02:04:59,110 --> 02:04:59,771
Do that and go,

4261
02:04:59,771 --> 02:05:00,604
am I dreaming?

4262
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:02,260
And I did it.

4263
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,900
I walked up to a door and I said,

4264
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:05,830
am I dreaming?

4265
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:06,910
And there was nothing there.

4266
02:05:07,030 --> 02:05:07,301
I went,

4267
02:05:07,301 --> 02:05:07,901
Oh shit,

4268
02:05:07,901 --> 02:05:08,830
I'm fucking dreaming.

4269
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:10,930
And then I went into the lucid dream,

4270
02:05:10,931 --> 02:05:15,931
but it was amazing how quickly it shifted
over from just this random sleep and

4271
02:05:18,161 --> 02:05:21,160
dream state to just that
one action of am I Jamie?

4272
02:05:21,190 --> 02:05:22,001
Holy Fuck,

4273
02:05:22,001 --> 02:05:22,781
I am dreaming.

4274
02:05:22,781 --> 02:05:24,400
And then there's the conscious mind.

4275
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:27,670
Completely a rose inside of the dream.

4276
02:05:27,671 --> 02:05:28,120
Yes,

4277
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:28,430
I can.

4278
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:29,680
It didn't maintain it for very long.

4279
02:05:29,681 --> 02:05:31,510
I've still never been able
to maintain it for very long.

4280
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:32,170
I don't get it.

4281
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:32,970
I don't get laid at all.

4282
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:33,390
My dream.

4283
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,640
It helps to have a good
policy in my dreams.

4284
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:36,190
It,

4285
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:37,590
it helps to have a plan.

4286
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:39,240
So,

4287
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,470
so when you're thinking about,

4288
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:40,890
you will,

4289
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:41,723
you'll get there,

4290
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:42,990
you'll get there.

4291
02:05:42,990 --> 02:05:45,450
I'm never felt I had been a man of faith.

4292
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:48,510
You will get there if anybody will
let you make a jerk off too much.

4293
02:05:48,700 --> 02:05:48,990
But,

4294
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:52,140
but if you have a plan
before you go to sleep,

4295
02:05:52,141 --> 02:05:53,730
if you've mentally rehearsed,

4296
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:54,960
um,

4297
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,850
just take 30 seconds to do it.

4298
02:05:56,851 --> 02:05:57,990
Two or three times a day.

4299
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:59,250
If I have a lucid dream,

4300
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:00,210
this is what I want to do.

4301
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:02,910
You remember like I did with my mom?

4302
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:04,650
I remembered because at first I was like,

4303
02:06:04,651 --> 02:06:04,981
Oh shit.

4304
02:06:04,981 --> 02:06:05,311
Okay,

4305
02:06:05,311 --> 02:06:06,450
I'm in this mall and you know,

4306
02:06:06,451 --> 02:06:06,601
like,

4307
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:07,280
what am I going to have?

4308
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:07,390
Like,

4309
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:07,711
Oh yeah,

4310
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:08,450
that's right.

4311
02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:09,150
I,

4312
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:09,660
I can't,

4313
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:09,841
you know,

4314
02:06:09,841 --> 02:06:10,740
tonight I had a mission.

4315
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:11,910
I want to see my mother.

4316
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:12,360
Right?

4317
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:13,230
And so if you,

4318
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:14,640
if you train for that,

4319
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:15,723
you'll,

4320
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,520
you will be able to,

4321
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:18,020
um,

4322
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:18,260
what if,

4323
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:19,620
do you have nefarious intentions?

4324
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:20,730
Go for it.

4325
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:21,271
There's no,

4326
02:06:21,271 --> 02:06:21,811
you didn't know a lot.

4327
02:06:21,811 --> 02:06:22,770
Well go for it.

4328
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:24,420
But maybe not because
here's what's interesting,

4329
02:06:24,421 --> 02:06:25,254
right?

4330
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:26,730
There's no laws,

4331
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,091
right?

4332
02:06:27,091 --> 02:06:28,110
Societal laws,

4333
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:28,381
you know,

4334
02:06:28,381 --> 02:06:28,531
in,

4335
02:06:28,531 --> 02:06:29,280
in a dream,

4336
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:29,730
right?

4337
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:31,980
But you still have to deal
with yourself in the morning.

4338
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:33,600
And I know that sounds fucking funny,

4339
02:06:33,601 --> 02:06:35,760
but like I had a chance in one of my very,

4340
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:39,060
very early lucid dreams to bang
this dream hottie it was great.

4341
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:41,630
This is the first one
listed you my hat in Hawaii.

4342
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:44,370
Me that you feel guilty when
you woke up in the morning.

4343
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:45,960
I didn't even do it because here's,

4344
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:46,794
here's what happened.

4345
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,240
I ended up,

4346
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:48,930
um,

4347
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:53,930
so I climb up into this building
and I gained lucidity and um,

4348
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,210
there was this woman in
the room and I said to her,

4349
02:06:57,211 --> 02:06:58,050
and this happens a lot of times,

4350
02:06:58,051 --> 02:06:58,884
the dream characters,

4351
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:00,053
I said,

4352
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:01,470
I'm having a lucid dream.

4353
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:02,303
I'm dreaming.

4354
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:02,610
She's,

4355
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:02,731
no,

4356
02:07:02,731 --> 02:07:03,564
you're not.

4357
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:04,681
And they won't drink.

4358
02:07:04,681 --> 02:07:07,230
Characters will invariably
tell you if you say to them,

4359
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:08,460
this is not a dream,

4360
02:07:08,461 --> 02:07:09,510
they will invariably say to you,

4361
02:07:09,511 --> 02:07:10,344
no it's not.

4362
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:11,790
And this is where the weirdest,

4363
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:13,410
coolest parts of of lucid dreaming.

4364
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:14,520
Cause even Lubbers right.

4365
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:18,450
Eminent sort of scientist just
kind of shrugs his shoulders.

4366
02:07:18,451 --> 02:07:21,360
Like somehow the dream
world wants to maintain its,

4367
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:23,880
its status as,

4368
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:25,560
as real for you.

4369
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:26,161
Right.

4370
02:07:26,161 --> 02:07:27,780
So the dream characters will say,

4371
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:28,920
well this is not a dream.

4372
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:29,730
Yeah.

4373
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:30,780
And so I said to her,

4374
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:30,961
no,

4375
02:07:30,961 --> 02:07:31,770
I'll prove it to you.

4376
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:32,603
It's a dream.

4377
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,833
And so I,

4378
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:35,620
I turned and it was like,

4379
02:07:35,650 --> 02:07:35,900
you know,

4380
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:38,470
you were talking before about when
you have a subjective experience,

4381
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:40,510
you still had the experience.

4382
02:07:40,511 --> 02:07:41,050
Right.

4383
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:43,840
So I know totally what it's
like to be fucking x man.

4384
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:44,621
Because I said,

4385
02:07:44,621 --> 02:07:45,370
I'm gonna prove it to you.

4386
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:47,170
And I turned and there were
these big double doors,

4387
02:07:47,171 --> 02:07:49,630
like 30 feet away or something.

4388
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:52,960
And I just went like this with
a wave of my hand and the doors.

4389
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:53,141
I said,

4390
02:07:53,141 --> 02:07:54,460
I'm gonna close these stores from here.

4391
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,850
I went like this with my hand
and the doors slammed shut.

4392
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:58,181
And I was like,

4393
02:07:58,181 --> 02:07:59,140
Holy Shit at work.

4394
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,003
Cause it was like,

4395
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:00,211
well,

4396
02:08:00,211 --> 02:08:01,840
what am I first lucid dreams,

4397
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,890
which was awesome.

4398
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,060
And then I turned to her and I was like,

4399
02:08:04,061 --> 02:08:05,170
so now I'm going to have you.

4400
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:05,950
Right.

4401
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:08,670
And so I grabbed her and I went to kiss
her and then I remembered because at

4402
02:08:08,671 --> 02:08:10,090
that point I was engaged to my wife,

4403
02:08:10,120 --> 02:08:11,320
right when I was like,

4404
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:11,501
oh,

4405
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:12,101
but you know,

4406
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,620
I'm engaged in it felt so real again.

4407
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:17,090
Her skin or the smell of her,

4408
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:17,600
her,

4409
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:18,460
it just,

4410
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:19,201
I was a store.

4411
02:08:19,201 --> 02:08:20,340
He's got really good,

4412
02:08:20,370 --> 02:08:20,530
no,

4413
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:25,530
you got to fuck that girl was supposed
to [inaudible] you're getting dream

4414
02:08:27,011 --> 02:08:27,580
posey.

4415
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,610
I am who I am.

4416
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:28,811
Well,

4417
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:29,201
you know what?

4418
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:31,090
Maybe now even in your dreams,

4419
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:34,530
I want you to be faithful to do that.

4420
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:34,721
Wait,

4421
02:08:34,721 --> 02:08:35,890
let me tell you about my wife.

4422
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:38,380
I gotta I gotta get my wife's back on
this because when I told her about it

4423
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:38,591
later,

4424
02:08:38,591 --> 02:08:39,130
she's like,

4425
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:41,670
you could have done it immediately.

4426
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:45,100
Just fucking take some
Coleen and go right back in.

4427
02:08:45,101 --> 02:08:45,341
Well,

4428
02:08:45,341 --> 02:08:45,911
I'll just say this,

4429
02:08:45,911 --> 02:08:46,650
I've been doing,

4430
02:08:46,650 --> 02:08:46,790
uh,

4431
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:50,440
other lucid dreaming since
is that lots of good cover.

4432
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:53,280
But that experimental clouds,

4433
02:08:53,410 --> 02:08:53,801
wait though,

4434
02:08:53,801 --> 02:08:55,930
there's something to think about
here because one of the guys in the,

4435
02:08:55,931 --> 02:08:58,960
in the workshop who attended the
workshop before I brought this up,

4436
02:08:59,470 --> 02:09:00,303
um,

4437
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:01,090
in Hawaii,

4438
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:01,900
he said,

4439
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,560
you know,

4440
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:06,490
he went to have sex with a dream character
and the dream character refused him.

4441
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,100
And his first thought is,

4442
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,090
and this is just awful,

4443
02:09:10,091 --> 02:09:10,570
right,

4444
02:09:10,570 --> 02:09:11,950
was to commit dream rape.

4445
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:13,340
Right?

4446
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:17,140
And so he was going to force himself on
this dream character and as he started

4447
02:09:17,141 --> 02:09:17,711
to do it,

4448
02:09:17,711 --> 02:09:20,590
he realized that this is not
something he wanted because again,

4449
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:20,801
Joe,

4450
02:09:20,801 --> 02:09:24,480
remember it feels real afterward.

4451
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:27,190
It feels as real as
anything you've ever done.

4452
02:09:27,191 --> 02:09:27,311
I mean,

4453
02:09:27,311 --> 02:09:29,560
you sound like you're having these
very fragile dreams to begin with.

4454
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:30,791
That happens.

4455
02:09:30,791 --> 02:09:30,941
I mean,

4456
02:09:30,941 --> 02:09:33,160
sometimes it takes a while
to get it built up so that,

4457
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:36,910
so that you're lucid dreams
feel at least as real,

4458
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:37,240
right?

4459
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,073
Is this reality?

4460
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:40,720
Do you want to carry it around
the memory of raping somebody?

4461
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:41,440
No.

4462
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,960
Did I want to carry around the
memory of cheating on my wife?

4463
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:44,950
No.

4464
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:48,100
Well he's got shitty dreams
cause in my dream I'm a pimp.

4465
02:09:48,130 --> 02:09:49,420
I just get pussy left him

4466
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,180
this tech.

4467
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:54,070
My problem is I wake up
right before I put it in,

4468
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,850
I get alone like,

4469
02:09:55,851 --> 02:09:56,351
oh yeah,

4470
02:09:56,351 --> 02:09:57,184
let's do this.

4471
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:57,760
What?

4472
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,540
I'm awake.

4473
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:00,160
Fuck dammit.

4474
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:01,533
That's bad news.

4475
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:03,970
I have shot loads in my sleep
so I'm sure it's happened.

4476
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:05,050
I just haven't been lucid.

4477
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:07,060
I never get lucid sucks.

4478
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:08,530
But the girls are always nice to me.

4479
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,840
No one's every angry at me,

4480
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:11,351
you know?

4481
02:10:11,351 --> 02:10:14,260
And I never have like a lucid
dream pitchers like yeah,

4482
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,680
this is my dream.

4483
02:10:18,580 --> 02:10:23,110
Why are you so mean to me and my
dream that's never happened luckily.

4484
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:23,651
But yeah,

4485
02:10:23,651 --> 02:10:26,110
I mean I've never wanted to do
anything creepy in my dreams anyway.

4486
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:27,730
I've never wanted to do anything evil.

4487
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:28,210
Right.

4488
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:29,350
But I have fought crime.

4489
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:33,130
Really have fought dragons and
shit and my dream in a lucid dream.

4490
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,273
Yeah.

4491
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:35,353
Okay.

4492
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,590
I listed dreams are really boring.

4493
02:10:36,591 --> 02:10:39,540
I'm like getting shit done like
errands and like I remember this.

4494
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:40,533
Yeah,

4495
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:41,631
it's pretty cool.

4496
02:10:41,631 --> 02:10:44,690
Like knowing I've done a
few lucid dreams before.

4497
02:10:44,691 --> 02:10:45,391
It's usually when I,

4498
02:10:45,391 --> 02:10:45,800
I'm,

4499
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:49,160
I always feel it's like the level of your
sleep cause I know it seems to happen

4500
02:10:49,161 --> 02:10:50,180
or you're right.

4501
02:10:50,181 --> 02:10:50,280
Yeah,

4502
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:51,580
it's definitely the level your sleep.

4503
02:10:51,581 --> 02:10:52,720
If you're fucking exhausted,

4504
02:10:52,721 --> 02:10:54,340
you're not going to
really put out a good one.

4505
02:10:54,341 --> 02:10:56,350
But we should do an
experiment with the show.

4506
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,810
Well we should all of us try.

4507
02:10:59,110 --> 02:11:00,310
We should try to have like,

4508
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:00,670
you know,

4509
02:11:00,670 --> 02:11:02,770
have like someone who's going
to come on again like Ari,

4510
02:11:03,250 --> 02:11:03,671
someone,

4511
02:11:03,671 --> 02:11:05,560
all of us tried to have a lucid dream.

4512
02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:08,500
I just force it and then see,

4513
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:10,270
see what kind of progress we could make.

4514
02:11:10,330 --> 02:11:13,180
Because you have an m but you're not like
trying to how I use a dre number one,

4515
02:11:13,181 --> 02:11:15,010
I'm flattered that you
already know I won't be back.

4516
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:16,000
What?

4517
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,260
I said never let them
already flooded that,

4518
02:11:17,261 --> 02:11:18,094
you know I won't be back.

4519
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:18,611
No,

4520
02:11:18,611 --> 02:11:19,450
that's not what I meant.

4521
02:11:19,451 --> 02:11:20,650
I mean someone is here all the time.

4522
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,570
Like I'm fucking like
you live in Philadelphia,

4523
02:11:22,590 --> 02:11:22,870
sir.

4524
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:25,360
You want to come back to the
time you can come back to this.

4525
02:11:25,690 --> 02:11:28,260
That's not the spirit a little bit,

4526
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:30,340
Brian,

4527
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:30,880
real quick,

4528
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:31,271
honestly.

4529
02:11:31,271 --> 02:11:34,660
So you've been an Olympic dream and
if chosen to just carry out errands,

4530
02:11:34,690 --> 02:11:36,260
he just gives real everywhere.

4531
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:39,610
He goes outside and she gets tackled
and raped by big giant women that looked

4532
02:11:39,611 --> 02:11:41,320
like during our chrome comic books.

4533
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,380
Big giant thighs,

4534
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:45,161
giant acids.

4535
02:11:45,161 --> 02:11:46,750
They just hold them down and they just,

4536
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:50,650
or women like this chair up in Boston and
the fighter shoved his face into their

4537
02:11:50,651 --> 02:11:51,820
big meaty snatch.

4538
02:11:51,821 --> 02:11:53,770
Big fucking roast beef snatch,

4539
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:56,020
big gigantic or rump roast,

4540
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:59,860
big bullet wounds snatch and they just
shove it in his face and then so he

4541
02:11:59,861 --> 02:12:01,450
doesn't leave the house
much in his dreams.

4542
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:01,811
Right?

4543
02:12:01,811 --> 02:12:02,644
Is that what you told me?

4544
02:12:02,650 --> 02:12:03,160
Yeah,

4545
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:03,993
sure.

4546
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:05,690
I fuck,

4547
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:08,320
I have sex with a lot of ex
girlfriends in my dreams.

4548
02:12:08,321 --> 02:12:09,340
I notice like I'll be like,

4549
02:12:09,341 --> 02:12:09,731
okay,

4550
02:12:09,731 --> 02:12:10,450
next,

4551
02:12:10,450 --> 02:12:10,840
come in,

4552
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:11,673
come on in the room.

4553
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:13,150
Lucid.

4554
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:13,740
Yeah.

4555
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:14,220
Yeah,

4556
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:15,930
that'd be beautiful if
you could just call it up.

4557
02:12:15,931 --> 02:12:17,880
Like if you had like a girl
that likes to just do it,

4558
02:12:17,881 --> 02:12:18,840
not compatible with,

4559
02:12:18,841 --> 02:12:20,820
but God damn you guys
had some awesome sex.

4560
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:21,661
Like,

4561
02:12:21,661 --> 02:12:22,850
couldn't you just like,

4562
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,271
honestly,

4563
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:25,104
you can know

4564
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:28,500
if you train it this long enough.

4565
02:12:28,501 --> 02:12:29,580
I mean I was able to,

4566
02:12:29,581 --> 02:12:29,960
you know,

4567
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,530
quote manifest my mom,

4568
02:12:31,531 --> 02:12:31,860
right?

4569
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:36,110
I mean we can manifest Brittany Spears
or whoever it might bring me spears and

4570
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:38,010
not now don't,

4571
02:12:38,011 --> 02:12:38,844
you know,

4572
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:40,703
um,

4573
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:41,521
I think,

4574
02:12:41,521 --> 02:12:42,190
uh,

4575
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:45,120
I think that that idea
of being able to do that,

4576
02:12:45,121 --> 02:12:48,540
it's fascinating and it's even more
fascinating how few people pursue it.

4577
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:49,240
Like,

4578
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:49,760
you know,

4579
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:49,950
yeah.

4580
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:52,800
This is one of the sad parts of Steven
[inaudible] story is that he discovered

4581
02:12:52,801 --> 02:12:54,420
this thing that you can really use,

4582
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:55,593
um,

4583
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,090
to defeat nightmares.

4584
02:12:57,091 --> 02:12:59,790
If you are those people who has night
terrors where you wake up with like sleep,

4585
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:05,110
I suffer from sleep paralysis or you have
recurring nightmares or anxiety around

4586
02:13:05,551 --> 02:13:06,150
an event,

4587
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:06,540
right?

4588
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:06,751
You know,

4589
02:13:06,751 --> 02:13:09,090
you're going to be doing public speaking
or something and maybe that's not your

4590
02:13:09,091 --> 02:13:09,900
bag.

4591
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:11,010
You can rehearse.

4592
02:13:11,190 --> 02:13:11,540
Right?

4593
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:12,190
And in,

4594
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:12,631
in the dream.

4595
02:13:12,631 --> 02:13:15,630
So he's discovered and it's
enriched my daily life.

4596
02:13:15,631 --> 02:13:16,860
I mean today I was doing,

4597
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:19,530
I was just trying to train it again
cause now I'm finally getting some sleep.

4598
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:20,730
The boys are letting me sleep.

4599
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:21,170
Right.

4600
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:23,310
And so I'm starting to state
test again and stuff and,

4601
02:13:23,311 --> 02:13:24,510
and I just look,

4602
02:13:24,511 --> 02:13:24,870
man,

4603
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:25,021
I,

4604
02:13:25,021 --> 02:13:27,820
it just locks it locked
me into my environment in,

4605
02:13:27,821 --> 02:13:28,830
in such a cool way.

4606
02:13:28,831 --> 02:13:31,110
I could suddenly really
pick out the sound,

4607
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:33,090
the leaves blowing in the wind and the,

4608
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:33,590
you know,

4609
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:35,430
is really interesting.

4610
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:36,000
It was,

4611
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,910
it was fantastic and detail
how to do that in this.

4612
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,280
I do know someone can do it
if they want to follow it.

4613
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:42,120
Yup.

4614
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:42,480
Yup.

4615
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,260
And I use the,

4616
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:46,470
I use the rehearsing a dream
scenario and I use the state tests.

4617
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:47,940
I get both those methods.

4618
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,130
Don't forget the door knock folks.

4619
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:51,990
Cause that shit work for me to say,

4620
02:13:51,991 --> 02:13:52,824
am I in a dream?

4621
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:53,740
Well that's,

4622
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:56,640
we'll have to get that during
the day or the day time.

4623
02:13:56,641 --> 02:13:57,031
Also though,

4624
02:13:57,031 --> 02:13:58,440
don't you just do that during the day?

4625
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:01,470
That would be so hilarious to see you
walking around fucking knocking on doors

4626
02:14:01,471 --> 02:14:02,670
and every time you do it you go,

4627
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:03,813
am I dreaming?

4628
02:14:04,050 --> 02:14:04,560
Okay,

4629
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:05,393
then I'll do it.

4630
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,030
I'll do it.

4631
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:08,550
I just go [inaudible] then I'm dreaming.

4632
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:09,800
There's no reason why heard it.

4633
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:10,200
Good.

4634
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,220
That's a good one as well.

4635
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,590
Then also in trade pop
up or Chinese people,

4636
02:14:13,591 --> 02:14:13,800
right?

4637
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:14,700
Then you say Asians,

4638
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:15,720
if you're in your dreams,

4639
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:17,310
there's actually been
really good research that,

4640
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,030
um,

4641
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:21,360
what we dreamed tends to be stuff we've
been thinking about a lot in the last 24

4642
02:14:21,361 --> 02:14:22,200
to 48 hours.

4643
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:24,900
So the whole principle of state
testing and asking that question,

4644
02:14:24,901 --> 02:14:25,770
is this a dream?

4645
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:26,540
Right?

4646
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:26,850
Um,

4647
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:28,020
or you know,

4648
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:30,030
the way I always present
my awake or am I dreaming?

4649
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,200
Um,

4650
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,390
the whole point of that is that
when you do that regularly,

4651
02:14:33,391 --> 02:14:37,140
you're more likely to have that thought
that arise while you are fucking

4652
02:14:37,141 --> 02:14:37,690
dreaming,

4653
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:38,320
when you're really doing.

4654
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:38,880
Yeah.

4655
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:41,100
And it works.

4656
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:41,281
Yeah.

4657
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:44,520
That was the idea of the habit of
knocking on the door that you'll,

4658
02:14:44,580 --> 02:14:46,890
they'll transfer that
habit to your dreams.

4659
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:50,220
The idea of dreams are
so fucking fascinating.

4660
02:14:50,221 --> 02:14:53,430
There's so little we know about what the
fuck is really happening and what kind

4661
02:14:53,431 --> 02:14:56,400
of weird imaginary world you're
creating inside your mind.

4662
02:14:56,401 --> 02:14:58,260
And I love when people try to say,

4663
02:14:58,470 --> 02:14:58,621
well,

4664
02:14:58,621 --> 02:15:00,090
this means that you know,

4665
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:01,760
the dragon represents,

4666
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:02,370
you know,

4667
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:03,630
you don't know what the fuck is talk,

4668
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:06,480
I am in the Lord of the rings
and I'm fighting a dragon.

4669
02:15:06,481 --> 02:15:07,670
It doesn't represent shit.

4670
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:07,990
Yeah,

4671
02:15:07,990 --> 02:15:08,701
it represents,

4672
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:10,380
I like watching wacky movies,

4673
02:15:10,381 --> 02:15:10,800
right?

4674
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,660
So I got high and watched game of Thrones,

4675
02:15:12,810 --> 02:15:14,100
took five Alpha brains,

4676
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:16,530
went to sleep and had
a fucking dragon war.

4677
02:15:16,610 --> 02:15:19,200
Sometimes the cigar really
is just fucking scar.

4678
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,080
There are definitely times
when you can say to yourself,

4679
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:22,920
okay,

4680
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,600
why this content,

4681
02:15:24,601 --> 02:15:24,840
right?

4682
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:25,890
Why these images,

4683
02:15:25,891 --> 02:15:27,030
why these sounds?

4684
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:27,511
Is there,

4685
02:15:27,511 --> 02:15:28,890
is there some message for me here,

4686
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:29,250
something,

4687
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:33,630
something my subconscious is and knowing
on that I should be aware of and work

4688
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:34,464
with in some way?

4689
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:34,711
Well,

4690
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:39,711
I'm sure there's a lot of things that
occur in a dream or things that you're

4691
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:45,200
fixated on and things that are constantly
in your mind and that your imagination

4692
02:15:45,201 --> 02:15:48,670
will turn them into a dragon
or a witch or a demon or,

4693
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:49,410
or you know,

4694
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:50,520
a vampire,

4695
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:51,390
you know,

4696
02:15:51,390 --> 02:15:53,220
or a disease.

4697
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:53,540
You know,

4698
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:53,830
there's,

4699
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:55,740
there's all sorts of things
that you're terrified of.

4700
02:15:55,741 --> 02:15:59,220
And real life that you fixate on and
much like the knocking on the door,

4701
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,110
they just follow you and your dreams.

4702
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:02,103
Yup.

4703
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:04,260
And this gives you a
chance to deal with them.

4704
02:16:04,261 --> 02:16:04,441
I mean,

4705
02:16:04,441 --> 02:16:06,930
if you approach something
that's in a nightmare,

4706
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:07,560
um,

4707
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:09,210
more like a friend,

4708
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:10,260
and that's weird to say,

4709
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:10,850
but,

4710
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:11,130
uh,

4711
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:12,420
Lubbers did this with a,

4712
02:16:12,421 --> 02:16:15,210
this really ugly ogre that
showed up on one of his dreams,

4713
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:16,320
um,

4714
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,940
that he would always recoil from.

4715
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:18,870
Um,

4716
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:20,730
he decided to,

4717
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:21,630
uh,

4718
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:22,231
we'll confront,

4719
02:16:22,231 --> 02:16:23,910
it's the wrong word because
it sounds adversarial,

4720
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:28,140
but he decided to approach it in a spirit
of curiosity and compassion and like

4721
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:29,320
figure out what's going on with it.

4722
02:16:29,830 --> 02:16:32,170
And I can't remember what
exactly he said to it,

4723
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:33,340
but he ended up,

4724
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:34,300
he accepted it,

4725
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:34,720
right?

4726
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:34,951
He,

4727
02:16:34,951 --> 02:16:35,230
he,

4728
02:16:35,230 --> 02:16:37,930
he didn't recoil from it and it actually,

4729
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:38,853
um,

4730
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:39,611
if I remember correctly,

4731
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:40,750
it became a part of him,

4732
02:16:40,990 --> 02:16:41,650
right.

4733
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,610
He became a part of it.

4734
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:45,850
Just kind of blended into him and he any,

4735
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:47,470
any took that as a sign of,

4736
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:48,573
Eh,

4737
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,000
Eh,

4738
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:49,790
Mr Comedian,

4739
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,770
take this on for size.

4740
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:51,400
Right.

4741
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:52,600
Dreams are about integration.

4742
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:57,400
There are things we deny about ourselves
and about our experience and they come

4743
02:16:57,401 --> 02:17:00,580
up in your dream because this is something
you need to deal with and need to

4744
02:17:00,581 --> 02:17:01,360
look at.

4745
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:03,910
And so if you do accept it in that way,

4746
02:17:04,210 --> 02:17:08,020
you end up feeling more empowered
because instead of rejecting this thing,

4747
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:09,303
your,

4748
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:10,600
you're willing separately.

4749
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,280
While I always thought
that was fascinating,

4750
02:17:12,281 --> 02:17:14,770
when people give the very
good advice of sleep on it,

4751
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:17,170
you know something's bothering you,

4752
02:17:17,171 --> 02:17:18,004
sleep on it.

4753
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:22,990
He goes that that there is something that
happens to you during the dream state

4754
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:25,000
where you have a better
perspective in the morning.

4755
02:17:25,001 --> 02:17:25,900
I don't know what it is,

4756
02:17:25,901 --> 02:17:28,750
but I am a big proponent
and sleeping on it.

4757
02:17:28,751 --> 02:17:31,960
I'm also a big proponent and jerking
off before you make any decisions.

4758
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,240
That's also very important.

4759
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:34,991
I have to tell you,

4760
02:17:34,991 --> 02:17:35,350
man,

4761
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:38,830
I hadn't experienced writing the book
with a lucid dream where you can't imagine

4762
02:17:38,831 --> 02:17:40,390
the anxiety I had before writing it.

4763
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:41,350
It was my first book.

4764
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:42,160
Um,

4765
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:43,750
I'd been writing for
years and years and years,

4766
02:17:43,751 --> 02:17:44,051
but like,

4767
02:17:44,051 --> 02:17:44,231
you know,

4768
02:17:44,231 --> 02:17:45,460
5,000 word stories,

4769
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:46,960
maybe a 7,000 word story.

4770
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:51,670
Now I'm going to have to write
fucking legit book in hardcover form.

4771
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:52,700
I,

4772
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:56,410
I'm going to have to write
90,000 words in 10 weeks.

4773
02:17:56,710 --> 02:17:59,560
And it was right before I was
supposed to go get married.

4774
02:17:59,561 --> 02:18:02,890
And so there was no
fucking with that deadline,

4775
02:18:02,891 --> 02:18:03,071
right?

4776
02:18:03,071 --> 02:18:07,600
I was going to have to write this thing
and have a full good working draft of it

4777
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:08,950
done in a 10 week period.

4778
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:11,020
And I was having all
sorts of anxiety over it.

4779
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:12,340
And I ended up,

4780
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:12,450
uh,

4781
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:17,450
approaching a dream character
in a store and I said to them,

4782
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:18,750
I,

4783
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:19,660
I need help.

4784
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:19,991
And she's like,

4785
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:20,651
we need help with.

4786
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:20,981
And I said,

4787
02:18:20,981 --> 02:18:21,814
well,

4788
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:22,690
I'm writing a book.

4789
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:27,790
And she said to me with the utmost
sort of compassion and sincerity,

4790
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:28,983
she said,

4791
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:30,130
the book is already written.

4792
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:36,360
And I had from that the feeling of,

4793
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:37,151
you know,

4794
02:18:37,151 --> 02:18:37,601
there's just not,

4795
02:18:37,601 --> 02:18:37,751
well,

4796
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:38,170
you,

4797
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:40,000
you've worked on creative
projects at the time.

4798
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:43,210
There's nothing like having finished
and knowing it's right and it's good.

4799
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:47,450
And I had that feeling just
sort of flood into me when,

4800
02:18:47,451 --> 02:18:52,030
when she said this so real and so vividly
that when I woke up I started thinking

4801
02:18:52,031 --> 02:18:54,400
about all the vagaries of how time
works and all this sort of stuff.

4802
02:18:54,401 --> 02:18:55,040
And then you know,

4803
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:56,620
in a sense the book is already written.

4804
02:18:56,621 --> 02:19:00,430
I'm just going to live through the
period of writing it and it just totally

4805
02:19:00,431 --> 02:19:02,410
reframe the experience of
writing that book for me.

4806
02:19:02,411 --> 02:19:03,820
And in a strange sort of way,

4807
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:06,580
I mean to say that I wrote the
book and an altered states,

4808
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:09,160
it is a big powerful statement in a way.

4809
02:19:09,161 --> 02:19:09,850
I did.

4810
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:13,000
I never had less anxiety about
writing anything in my life.

4811
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,450
I would wake up seven seven 30 in the
morning and was completely on lean from

4812
02:19:16,451 --> 02:19:17,170
work.

4813
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:18,520
I would get a cup of coffee,

4814
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:22,540
I'd be writing within 15 minutes of waking
up instead of producing what my goal

4815
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:22,781
was,

4816
02:19:22,781 --> 02:19:24,550
which is around 1500 words a day.

4817
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:29,790
I was regularly writing 300050008000
there were days I wrote over 10,000 words

4818
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,390
in one day I would finish at two 30 or
three I would eclipse my fucking goal by

4819
02:19:35,391 --> 02:19:36,051
miles.

4820
02:19:36,051 --> 02:19:39,350
I would finish at two 30 or three I would
go out and buy fresh groceries and a

4821
02:19:39,351 --> 02:19:41,660
bottle of wine and when
my wife would get home,

4822
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:46,690
I'd beat as joyful friar standing there
making her this like a delicious dinner

4823
02:19:47,421 --> 02:19:49,370
and totally enjoying my life.

4824
02:19:49,371 --> 02:19:50,450
Like rocking balls.

4825
02:19:50,451 --> 02:19:50,631
Right.

4826
02:19:50,631 --> 02:19:50,990
It was,

4827
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,980
it was awesome.

4828
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,420
And um,

4829
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:56,690
and it was lucid dreaming that did that
and it was that experience of having

4830
02:19:56,691 --> 02:20:00,230
that anxiety taken away from
me in this really vivid,

4831
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:02,450
a real way.

4832
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:04,070
Having those really fascinating.

4833
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:04,970
It was awesome.

4834
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:08,030
I wonder if we could get
people are in on this one.

4835
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:13,100
If we get people to just start trying
to lucid dream there is the resources

4836
02:20:14,631 --> 02:20:15,141
online.

4837
02:20:15,141 --> 02:20:15,974
Besides your book,

4838
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:18,260
would you recommend people checking out?

4839
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:20,080
You can go to Steven [inaudible] website.

4840
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:21,080
Do you say his name?

4841
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:22,700
Laberge a l a,

4842
02:20:22,701 --> 02:20:23,390
B.

4843
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:23,691
E r.

4844
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:24,350
G.

4845
02:20:24,350 --> 02:20:24,860
E.

4846
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:26,090
And he has a website.

4847
02:20:26,091 --> 02:20:26,970
Steven laberge.

4848
02:20:26,971 --> 02:20:27,080
Yeah,

4849
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:27,681
just search.

4850
02:20:27,681 --> 02:20:29,680
I can't remember what
the addresses for it.

4851
02:20:29,970 --> 02:20:30,440
Um,

4852
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:31,370
his book is,

4853
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:33,080
is really phenomenal.

4854
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,863
It's,

4855
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:36,500
it's very scientific,

4856
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,600
but it's for the,

4857
02:20:38,650 --> 02:20:38,930
you know,

4858
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:40,310
anybody can read it and pick it up.

4859
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:41,203
So I mean there

4860
02:20:43,010 --> 02:20:48,010
it's become the Bible for what they call
themselves on iron odds for people who

4861
02:20:48,111 --> 02:20:49,850
lucid dream regularly.

4862
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:50,360
Um,

4863
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,100
I want to say some about
my book by the way.

4864
02:20:52,790 --> 02:20:54,050
It is right now.

4865
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:54,280
They,

4866
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:54,860
they,

4867
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:55,190
um,

4868
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,210
it's back listed,

4869
02:20:56,211 --> 02:20:57,060
which means they're no longer,

4870
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,400
they're not completely ignoring it,

4871
02:20:58,401 --> 02:20:59,570
but it's been out for a couple of years.

4872
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:00,650
So they're not pushing it.

4873
02:21:01,130 --> 02:21:02,300
And once they,

4874
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:04,700
one of the things they do
with a blacklisted book is
they'll price it down to a

4875
02:21:04,701 --> 02:21:09,701
dollar 99 on kindle for a couple of
weeks and jack up the sales figures.

4876
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:11,330
Right.

4877
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:13,070
And so I asked them in
advance of the show,

4878
02:21:13,071 --> 02:21:13,940
could you please leave it?

4879
02:21:13,941 --> 02:21:14,900
Cause they just did it recently.

4880
02:21:14,901 --> 02:21:15,171
I was like,

4881
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:17,870
please leave it at a
dollar 99 for the show.

4882
02:21:17,871 --> 02:21:18,704
And they said,

4883
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:19,783
no.

4884
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:21,740
But I woke up this morning and Brian,

4885
02:21:21,741 --> 02:21:22,610
I guess has got up now.

4886
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:24,050
It's still a dollar 99,

4887
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:24,800
please.

4888
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:26,030
I don't get fucked up.

4889
02:21:26,170 --> 02:21:26,930
What's it supposed to?

4890
02:21:26,930 --> 02:21:28,580
They fucked up but good because,

4891
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:29,000
eh,

4892
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:29,390
my,

4893
02:21:29,390 --> 02:21:29,781
my,

4894
02:21:29,781 --> 02:21:31,160
it's nine 99 normally,

4895
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:33,860
but my feeling is let's just
get it into people's hands.

4896
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,950
And so right now let's all
engage in an act of piracy.

4897
02:21:36,951 --> 02:21:38,120
Harper Collins fucked up.

4898
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:40,490
Get out there and get
the book for a buck 99.

4899
02:21:40,670 --> 02:21:41,121
I love it.

4900
02:21:41,121 --> 02:21:42,110
And I hope they look,

4901
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:43,160
I hope they change their minds.

4902
02:21:43,161 --> 02:21:46,380
It's possible that the person I talked
to ended up running up the flagpole and

4903
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:46,641
decided,

4904
02:21:46,641 --> 02:21:46,971
you know what,

4905
02:21:46,971 --> 02:21:47,990
we should leave it at this price.

4906
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:48,890
I don't really know,

4907
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,140
but I know what they told
me it was an unequivocal no,

4908
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:53,060
but here it is still a dollar 99,

4909
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:53,931
but he's found it.

4910
02:21:53,931 --> 02:21:55,280
I'll get it for 11 bucks.

4911
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:56,263
That's a hardcover.

4912
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:56,511
Oh,

4913
02:21:56,511 --> 02:21:57,240
the hardcover.

4914
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:57,570
Yeah.

4915
02:21:57,570 --> 02:21:58,403
Okay.

4916
02:21:58,460 --> 02:21:59,330
Well that's great man.

4917
02:21:59,331 --> 02:22:01,340
Don I know is very reasonable and I,

4918
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:02,660
I get all my books through.

4919
02:22:02,661 --> 02:22:03,190
Um,

4920
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:03,470
uh,

4921
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:04,071
I have one of those,

4922
02:22:04,071 --> 02:22:05,630
I have a kindle and I have a,

4923
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:06,980
um,

4924
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:07,490
I love it.

4925
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:10,040
The book to Barnes and
noble version of it.

4926
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:10,671
Any book,

4927
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:11,510
any magazine,

4928
02:22:11,511 --> 02:22:13,270
I suddenly feel the impulse to,

4929
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:13,791
to read.

4930
02:22:13,791 --> 02:22:14,271
It's there.

4931
02:22:14,271 --> 02:22:15,180
And when my tablet,

4932
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:15,720
instantly,

4933
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:16,550
you know,

4934
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:17,870
we live in strange times,

4935
02:22:17,871 --> 02:22:18,170
man.

4936
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:19,400
The ability to get those,

4937
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:23,390
you get a book like that off of Wifi
and some of them even have three g

4938
02:22:23,391 --> 02:22:24,051
connections.

4939
02:22:24,051 --> 02:22:27,240
It's like walkie fucking
times for publishing.

4940
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:27,990
Yeah.

4941
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,381
So,

4942
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:28,591
uh,

4943
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:29,101
I think,

4944
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:29,421
uh,

4945
02:22:29,421 --> 02:22:31,290
a lot of people are getting
their books that way now.

4946
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:31,591
Right.

4947
02:22:31,591 --> 02:22:32,131
What is your,

4948
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:34,950
do you know what the percentage
of Ebook to regular buckets,

4949
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:36,090
what you're selling?

4950
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:38,850
I know this book is outselling,

4951
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:39,540
um,

4952
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:40,860
from the time it was released,

4953
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:45,930
it's way more electronic and
more than the general industry.

4954
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:48,300
So when this first came
out in a year and a half,

4955
02:22:48,301 --> 02:22:49,470
two years ago or whatever it is,

4956
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:50,221
it was,

4957
02:22:50,221 --> 02:22:52,640
I think they told me the
figure was like 50 low,

4958
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:55,410
50% higher for electronic books.

4959
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:58,290
This book was over 60% electronic books.

4960
02:22:58,291 --> 02:22:59,380
And I'm answering what that says,

4961
02:22:59,400 --> 02:22:59,640
but,

4962
02:22:59,640 --> 02:22:59,941
well,

4963
02:22:59,941 --> 02:23:00,361
it's the,

4964
02:23:00,361 --> 02:23:03,240
the friends subjects are really
supported by the Internet,

4965
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:06,420
Internet websites and all the nuttiness.

4966
02:23:06,770 --> 02:23:07,260
Um,

4967
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:09,000
w there's a bent spoon on the cover.

4968
02:23:09,390 --> 02:23:11,040
Can people bend spoons with their brain.

4969
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:11,581
You know,

4970
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:14,580
I wanted to get to the bottom of that
and it's an immersion journalist.

4971
02:23:14,581 --> 02:23:18,750
I actually was waking up in the morning
and trying to bend a fucking spoon,

4972
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:18,971
right.

4973
02:23:18,971 --> 02:23:19,920
Really with my head.

4974
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:22,860
And I did it I think
three days in a row where,

4975
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,490
um,

4976
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:26,220
I think the first thing I wanted to go
15 minutes and I just started feeling so

4977
02:23:26,221 --> 02:23:27,810
silly after seven or eight that I stopped.

4978
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:29,250
And then on day two,

4979
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:29,460
you know,

4980
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:32,600
I think I did three or four minutes on
day three of like staring at the spirit

4981
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:34,620
for like 45 seconds.

4982
02:23:34,621 --> 02:23:34,981
And I was like,

4983
02:23:34,981 --> 02:23:36,000
I can't do this.

4984
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:37,350
I cannot do this.

4985
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:41,610
Maybe if you like one of those monks on
a mountain dude to stare at that spoon

4986
02:23:41,611 --> 02:23:44,340
for days and days and
days it goes like this.

4987
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:45,630
All right.

4988
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:47,220
Just imperceptibly,

4989
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:50,640
I've had some people that respect tell
me they think it's real and that I

4990
02:23:50,641 --> 02:23:52,890
couldn't do it because I couldn't
do it because I wasn't taking it.

4991
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:55,440
People leaving it hot water,

4992
02:23:55,441 --> 02:23:57,420
you respect them because
they can kick your ass.

4993
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:59,700
That's one reason to respect somebody.

4994
02:23:59,701 --> 02:24:01,440
That's where the intersection
of a lot of money,

4995
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:04,200
the met along the way,

4996
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:06,090
who haven't stuck their
neck out on this publicly,

4997
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:06,840
um,

4998
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:07,661
because it's,

4999
02:24:07,661 --> 02:24:08,401
it's really fraught,

5000
02:24:08,401 --> 02:24:08,551
man.

5001
02:24:08,551 --> 02:24:08,820
I mean,

5002
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:11,580
the guy who popularized
it or he'd Geller is,

5003
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:12,240
um,

5004
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:12,481
you know,

5005
02:24:12,481 --> 02:24:15,120
in my first amendment protected
opinion because he's fairly to just,

5006
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:15,800
um,

5007
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:16,633
a magician.

5008
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:18,373
So,

5009
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:20,730
and so it's a very controversial subject.

5010
02:24:20,731 --> 02:24:22,140
This is one of the places that James,

5011
02:24:22,141 --> 02:24:23,340
Randy kind of made his bones.

5012
02:24:23,341 --> 02:24:28,341
The skeptic in a debunker was going
after rate Gellar and so a lot of people

5013
02:24:28,861 --> 02:24:32,190
just don't want to be publicly
linked to this subject,

5014
02:24:32,191 --> 02:24:33,090
even if they believe in it.

5015
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:37,530
And so I met some people like that who
have never publicly spoken about it.

5016
02:24:37,970 --> 02:24:38,520
Um,

5017
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:39,211
but they're,

5018
02:24:39,211 --> 02:24:39,960
you know,

5019
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:42,300
they're doing incredible
stuff in the world and they,

5020
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:43,493
um,

5021
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:46,530
they claim that they were
able to do it or they,

5022
02:24:46,531 --> 02:24:46,771
you know,

5023
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:47,491
they were at a quote,

5024
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:48,510
spoon bending party.

5025
02:24:48,511 --> 02:24:50,280
There's some people that
the been throwing parties,

5026
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:50,821
grab it here.

5027
02:24:50,821 --> 02:24:52,770
I'm gonna have my spoon right up your ass.

5028
02:24:52,771 --> 02:24:54,330
Ain't no spoon bending party.

5029
02:24:54,890 --> 02:24:57,030
You know what [inaudible] Gardy,

5030
02:24:57,190 --> 02:25:02,190
I got to say all those guys would pass
on on the million dollar prize that he's

5031
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:03,444
offering.

5032
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:04,403
You know,

5033
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:07,110
the million dollar prize is
Randy's million dollar prize.

5034
02:25:07,111 --> 02:25:07,944
The bullshit.

5035
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:09,330
I'm not into it.

5036
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:09,601
I mean,

5037
02:25:09,601 --> 02:25:09,671
I,

5038
02:25:09,671 --> 02:25:13,830
I think that they did not end
up in his since idea prize.

5039
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:18,120
The people who are doing incredible Perez
psychology don't fit in to the way the

5040
02:25:18,121 --> 02:25:18,954
prize works.

5041
02:25:19,140 --> 02:25:22,890
So like people like Dean Raden and Rupert
Sheldrake and when Sam was on here,

5042
02:25:22,891 --> 02:25:26,590
he about Rupert and said there's something
very fishy about not going after the

5043
02:25:26,591 --> 02:25:27,220
million.

5044
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:27,490
Right?

5045
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:29,050
There's really not because,

5046
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:29,241
and,

5047
02:25:29,241 --> 02:25:29,471
and,

5048
02:25:29,471 --> 02:25:29,681
and,

5049
02:25:29,681 --> 02:25:30,431
and I love Sam,

5050
02:25:30,431 --> 02:25:32,260
but I just think that maybe he,

5051
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:32,831
again,

5052
02:25:32,831 --> 02:25:35,680
we all come at this with a worldview and
he's probably a little more predisposed

5053
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:37,510
to be on the material side of things.

5054
02:25:37,511 --> 02:25:37,900
Right?

5055
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:38,320
And,

5056
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:38,501
and,

5057
02:25:38,501 --> 02:25:39,220
um,

5058
02:25:39,220 --> 02:25:39,700
but,

5059
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:40,533
but um,

5060
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:44,770
Sheldrake or or Dean Raden
or any of these guys,

5061
02:25:44,771 --> 02:25:45,370
Daryl Bem,

5062
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:47,680
they're going to construct a
study that requires dozens,

5063
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:52,710
if not a hundred subjects that will
take an hour and a half for their each

5064
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:56,170
individual session conducted over weeks,

5065
02:25:56,170 --> 02:25:56,200
months,

5066
02:25:56,200 --> 02:26:01,200
or a year to get like this Ganzfeld
effect at 32% versus 25% right.

5067
02:26:01,270 --> 02:26:04,280
That we started this whole thing with
and James Randy is going to need,

5068
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:07,750
needs an event that will take place with
a very small sample size where you'll

5069
02:26:07,751 --> 02:26:09,070
get like 10 bites at the apple,

5070
02:26:09,071 --> 02:26:13,330
basically 10 chances to get something
or 12 in an afternoon or an evening.

5071
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:16,510
It is apples to oranges.

5072
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:21,540
It is completely in a clickable to what
credible Paris psychologists are doing.

5073
02:26:21,641 --> 02:26:26,641
So the idea that Rupert Sheldrake hasn't
taken it up is not only not very fishy,

5074
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:28,600
it tells you that he has some,

5075
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:29,740
some fucking sense.

5076
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:33,400
So in order to get Randy's money,

5077
02:26:33,401 --> 02:26:36,940
you have to do something like make
the empire state building disappear.

5078
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:37,923
You can do something.

5079
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:39,070
Yeah.

5080
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:40,450
And you have to do it in a small,

5081
02:26:40,451 --> 02:26:42,550
the big thing is you have to
do it in a small sample size.

5082
02:26:42,551 --> 02:26:42,940
I mean,

5083
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:45,970
statistical segment significance
is generated by sheer repetition,

5084
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:47,021
right?

5085
02:26:47,021 --> 02:26:48,190
And so when you're in a rand,

5086
02:26:48,191 --> 02:26:51,520
Randy requires a small
sample size to approve.

5087
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:54,040
He doesn't specifically
require a small sample size,

5088
02:26:54,041 --> 02:26:55,900
but whenever you look at any
of the studies they're doing,

5089
02:26:55,901 --> 02:26:56,350
they're doing,

5090
02:26:56,350 --> 02:26:57,670
they're doing stuff that takes,

5091
02:26:58,030 --> 02:26:58,540
again,

5092
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:58,721
you know,

5093
02:26:58,721 --> 02:27:00,490
an afternoon or an evening.

5094
02:27:00,491 --> 02:27:02,140
And it's a kind of a public event.

5095
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:02,801
And I,

5096
02:27:02,801 --> 02:27:03,191
and I,

5097
02:27:03,191 --> 02:27:03,551
again,

5098
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:05,170
I mean there are some
pair of psychologists,

5099
02:27:05,500 --> 02:27:06,020
um,

5100
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:08,590
think his name's Dick Biermann who said
he approached him and couldn't work.

5101
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:09,423
Anything else,

5102
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:10,410
super grateful,

5103
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:10,890
uh,

5104
02:27:10,890 --> 02:27:12,370
approached me and couldn't
work anything out.

5105
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:15,300
Daryl bem apparently thought about it and,

5106
02:27:15,301 --> 02:27:16,500
and realize that with the,

5107
02:27:16,501 --> 02:27:17,470
within these parameters,

5108
02:27:17,471 --> 02:27:19,060
the kind of research he's doing,

5109
02:27:19,330 --> 02:27:23,320
the kind of effect size he's trying to
take to get the time it would take him to

5110
02:27:23,321 --> 02:27:27,640
generate that just doesn't really fit
into what they're doing over there.

5111
02:27:27,670 --> 02:27:30,610
What seems to me that
that statistical 32% is,

5112
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:31,780
that's a real number.

5113
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:34,810
It's 7% difference is legit.

5114
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:38,380
I mean it would seems like that's
something that has to kind of be looked at

5115
02:27:38,381 --> 02:27:38,950
now.

5116
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:39,910
It should be,

5117
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:41,170
I would agree with you.

5118
02:27:41,171 --> 02:27:41,861
It should be.

5119
02:27:41,861 --> 02:27:43,780
But I think that this sort
of the professionals and,

5120
02:27:43,790 --> 02:27:44,120
and look,

5121
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:47,080
they're professional skeptics like
French and why has been the guys that I

5122
02:27:47,081 --> 02:27:49,300
mentioned before who will engage in a,

5123
02:27:49,301 --> 02:27:49,541
in a,

5124
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:51,730
in a reasonable conversation about this,

5125
02:27:51,731 --> 02:27:54,880
but then they're skeptics
to me like the j Raf,

5126
02:27:54,890 --> 02:27:56,590
the James Writing Educational Foundation,

5127
02:27:56,830 --> 02:27:59,860
those guys who are or are just
kind of rejecting it out of hand.

5128
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:01,630
But there's really something,

5129
02:28:01,631 --> 02:28:02,550
there is something to,

5130
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:03,671
to look at here.

5131
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:05,950
There's something to wonder
about and I find that,

5132
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:06,420
you know,

5133
02:28:06,420 --> 02:28:07,253
uh,

5134
02:28:07,930 --> 02:28:08,640
number one,

5135
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:08,711
uh,

5136
02:28:08,711 --> 02:28:11,590
more fucking accurate way of
looking at it and which is great.

5137
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:12,250
Right?

5138
02:28:12,250 --> 02:28:17,250
And it's also a far more interesting
world than the tiny percentage bump is

5139
02:28:19,211 --> 02:28:22,040
really fascinating because it really makes

5140
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:22,640
you go,

5141
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:23,300
oh,

5142
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:28,160
maybe it is an emerging skill or maybe
it is an emerging sense or as you said

5143
02:28:28,161 --> 02:28:28,820
before,

5144
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:30,470
declining one because we don't,

5145
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:31,580
we don't use it in the,

5146
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:32,520
the natural yeah.

5147
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:34,560
World anymore and don't
cultivate it at all.

5148
02:28:34,740 --> 02:28:35,060
And in,

5149
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:35,340
look,

5150
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:35,640
you know,

5151
02:28:35,640 --> 02:28:35,880
it's,

5152
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:37,230
it's a figure when you look at that,

5153
02:28:37,231 --> 02:28:39,660
like the canceled affect 32 versus 25,

5154
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:39,870
you know,

5155
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:41,670
or whatever an individual
study might show,

5156
02:28:41,671 --> 02:28:42,450
right?

5157
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:43,110
Um,

5158
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:44,910
one of the things that's
powerful about that figure,

5159
02:28:44,970 --> 02:28:47,790
and it speaks to one of the
things the skeptics do well,

5160
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:48,421
right,

5161
02:28:48,421 --> 02:28:51,970
is they warn you away from those
people who really are con artists,

5162
02:28:52,060 --> 02:28:52,530
right?

5163
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:54,840
The idea of the Super
Psychic John Edwards,

5164
02:28:54,841 --> 02:28:55,674
Sylvia Brown,

5165
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:57,550
there is threadbare,

5166
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:58,081
uh,

5167
02:28:58,081 --> 02:28:58,831
evidence for that.

5168
02:28:58,831 --> 02:29:03,780
It's not something that I would put
my name on and reputation on is saying

5169
02:29:03,781 --> 02:29:05,820
there's something we really
need to look at this,

5170
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,360
right?

5171
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:07,380
But the Ganzfeld effect,

5172
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:09,360
there's so many studies,

5173
02:29:09,361 --> 02:29:11,260
dozens and dozens of studies that,

5174
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:12,193
that go into these,

5175
02:29:12,300 --> 02:29:14,970
what they call these men analyses when
they crunch all the numbers together that

5176
02:29:14,971 --> 02:29:16,020
I will put my name on and say,

5177
02:29:16,030 --> 02:29:16,260
you know what?

5178
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:17,370
We should fucking look at that.

5179
02:29:17,730 --> 02:29:18,180
Right?

5180
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:18,720
And,

5181
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:20,570
and so it's not that the skeptics are,

5182
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:21,960
are all wrong or all wet,

5183
02:29:21,961 --> 02:29:22,231
right?

5184
02:29:22,231 --> 02:29:23,850
But they paint with far too broad a brush.

5185
02:29:23,851 --> 02:29:25,500
And I think at the end of the day,

5186
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:25,790
my,

5187
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:30,330
my own guests and their motivation is
the fact that that mechanism would be

5188
02:29:30,331 --> 02:29:31,021
unexplained.

5189
02:29:31,021 --> 02:29:35,610
The fact that that mechanism would suggest
there is more to us than meat is not

5190
02:29:35,611 --> 02:29:36,600
something that won't acknowledge.

5191
02:29:36,601 --> 02:29:38,100
Because when you really
look at these people,

5192
02:29:38,101 --> 02:29:38,701
when you look at Randy,

5193
02:29:38,701 --> 02:29:40,200
he's also a dogmatic atheist.

5194
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:43,740
The idea that we're more than meets
starts to introduce the idea of a soul,

5195
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:44,221
right?

5196
02:29:44,221 --> 02:29:46,050
Something that will
transcend this bodily death.

5197
02:29:46,380 --> 02:29:47,850
And the idea that we have to,

5198
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:48,440
uh,

5199
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:48,660
you know,

5200
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:51,980
worry about that to some degree and
govern our behavior based on what we're

5201
02:29:51,990 --> 02:29:54,090
going to become leader or what we're
going to have to deal with later

5202
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:55,043
potentially.

5203
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,080
And so I think that they're kind
of keeping the barn door shot,

5204
02:29:58,110 --> 02:29:58,351
right?

5205
02:29:58,351 --> 02:29:59,970
They've taken on this tack in life,

5206
02:30:00,350 --> 02:30:00,930
um,

5207
02:30:00,930 --> 02:30:04,290
that they're going to hold this shit down,

5208
02:30:04,890 --> 02:30:06,230
that fringe ideas,

5209
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,520
the unexplained anything,

5210
02:30:08,610 --> 02:30:09,443
a cult,

5211
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:10,230
what have you.

5212
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:10,440
Yeah.

5213
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:13,050
All those things are just,

5214
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:13,450
yeah.

5215
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:14,230
Not to be,

5216
02:30:14,230 --> 02:30:15,160
not to be given any,

5217
02:30:15,310 --> 02:30:16,120
any power,

5218
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:18,430
but it's kind of unscientific
to block out anything,

5219
02:30:18,431 --> 02:30:18,940
isn't it?

5220
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:19,460
Yes.

5221
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:19,910
The I,

5222
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:22,120
the idea of science is
to observe everything.

5223
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:22,360
Yeah.

5224
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:23,920
Even very infrequent,

5225
02:30:23,921 --> 02:30:25,330
but possibly real events.

5226
02:30:25,331 --> 02:30:26,164
Yes.

5227
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:26,640
Yeah.

5228
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:27,070
Yeah.

5229
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:28,960
And you're a fucking scientist evoke.

5230
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:30,100
You're a scientist.

5231
02:30:30,101 --> 02:30:30,934
God dammit.

5232
02:30:31,450 --> 02:30:35,410
And the book is a fringe Ologie
and it sounds fucking awesome man.

5233
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:35,791
I'm,

5234
02:30:35,791 --> 02:30:36,151
I'm,

5235
02:30:36,151 --> 02:30:37,360
I'm going to get into this dude,

5236
02:30:37,361 --> 02:30:39,820
thank you very much for
coming on the podcast.

5237
02:30:39,821 --> 02:30:43,000
Thanks for getting the book and thanks
for telling them to keep it at a dollar

5238
02:30:43,001 --> 02:30:44,890
99 which you can get it right now.

5239
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:46,540
I just want to say one more thing.

5240
02:30:46,541 --> 02:30:47,374
I just can see this.

5241
02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:49,090
All the interviews I've done now,

5242
02:30:49,091 --> 02:30:50,230
and I've done a ton of them.

5243
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,970
This was the biggest honor.

5244
02:30:51,971 --> 02:30:55,690
And the reason is because I've been
listening to this podcast for the last

5245
02:30:55,690 --> 02:30:55,901
couple of years now,

5246
02:30:55,901 --> 02:30:57,790
like year and a half or more.

5247
02:30:58,090 --> 02:30:58,871
And I find,

5248
02:30:58,871 --> 02:30:59,261
and it's so,

5249
02:30:59,261 --> 02:30:59,561
it's funny,

5250
02:30:59,561 --> 02:31:03,970
I'm not sure any guests you've had on in
this position where this show is become

5251
02:31:03,971 --> 02:31:05,920
part of the way I reinforce
my own good habits.

5252
02:31:05,921 --> 02:31:07,000
Like I find that it,

5253
02:31:07,270 --> 02:31:08,920
it just keeps me motivated.

5254
02:31:08,921 --> 02:31:10,150
It keeps me focused on,

5255
02:31:10,360 --> 02:31:11,740
I think of there's podcasts ultimately,

5256
02:31:11,741 --> 02:31:14,380
secretly it's kind of a cloak and dagger
enterprise to get people to live their

5257
02:31:14,381 --> 02:31:15,340
best possible life.

5258
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:18,010
And that's the function
it performs for me.

5259
02:31:18,011 --> 02:31:18,970
And so being on your show,

5260
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,250
fucking Jack

5261
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:20,701
to be here.

5262
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:21,570
So thank you brother.

5263
02:31:21,571 --> 02:31:22,440
I really appreciate it,

5264
02:31:22,441 --> 02:31:22,761

5265
02:31:22,761 --> 02:31:24,090
it means the world to me and uh,

5266

5267

to share your thoughts and have a cool
conversation with us and enhance the

5269
02:31:29,911 --> 02:31:32,940
podcast and become a
part of podcast history.

5270
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:33,840

you're not supposed to tell anybody.

5329

02:33:34,610 --> 02:33:34,961
Are you?

Or what's supposed to
tell people about this?

5338
02:33:36,331 --> 02:33:37,380
But I didn't tell you what it is.

5339
02:33:37,381 --> 02:33:37,561
