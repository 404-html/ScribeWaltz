1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,380
Does that new band,
he mails and uh,

2
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:10,750
I,
I,

3
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:15,751
I do a fucking really shitty beat box.
I'm feeling that money coming in 

4
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,030
already,
Brian.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,560
We got a winning combination.
We need to put this shit on wax ready.

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,070
The Joe Rogan experience is brought to 
you by [inaudible] dot com.

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,310
That's o n n I t,
makers of Alpha brain shroom,

8
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,670
tech sport.
And You keep doing them.

9
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,671
And I was kind of fun.
Just shroom tech immune to do what are 

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,640
you going to do?
New Mood.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Another favorite new mood is actually a 
five htp and l trip to fan a supplement 

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,250
that uh,
aids your body and its ability to 

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,980
produce serotonin.
So it actually can make you happy.

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,610
This is one that is a not to be taken by
people that are on antidepressants 

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,250
though.
If you're on antidepressants,

16
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,520
apparently there's an issue with a 
creating too much,

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,770
too much serotonin,
too much,

18
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:18,771
five htp.
So you should be careful if you're on a 

19
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:18,771
few on an Ssri,
don't,

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,090
uh,
don't take new load.

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,490
But if you are not a safe,
natural,

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,170
healthy,
you don't have to worry about it.

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,960
Nothing dangerous.
Um,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,040
all the supplements,
that new mood,

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
all of them have a,
the first 30 orders or the first 30 

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,260
pills,
the first order have a 100 percent money

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,870
back guarantee.
You don't have to return anything.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,930
You just say this shit didn't work and 
you get your money back.

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,020
The idea behind that is no one's trying 
to rip you off.

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,350
We're only trying to sell you the very 
best supplements possible.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,720
All supplements that I personally 
believe in,

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,610
all things that I took long before I 
ever got involved in on it.

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,890
Um,
I've been a vitamin junkie and a 

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:58,890
nutrition junkie for a long time because
there's a,

35
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,810
there's a difference.
There's an unquestionable difference in 

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,910
how your body responds when you feed it.
Good nutrients and you take care of it.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,730
And there's a lot of science behind all 
this stuff,

38
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:13,731
especially nootropics.
There's plenty of studies that show 

39
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:14,850
benefits of nootropics and we're working
on our own now.

40
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,670
I'm a double blind placebo study and 
we'll,

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,671
we'll let all the details.
It takes a long time to hook something 

42
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:22,671
like that.
Or is it because they're all blind?

43
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,960
No,
that's a scientific method.

44
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,700
Brian,
this is not for blind.

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,730
He seems like it takes a long time for 
those double blind blindfolds off 

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,430
project.
Be Faster.

47
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,550
Yeah.
I don't think you understand what the 

48
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,550
fuck it means,
son.

49
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,550
Anyway,
we also have kettle bells,

50
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,390
battle ropes.
If use a codename Rogan,

51
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:43,530
you get 10 percent off any supplements.
The battle ropes in the kettle bells,

52
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:48,531
whoever that code doesn't work because 
we sell them literally as cheap as we 

53
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:48,531
can.
Um,

54
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:48,900
so go to on it.
Use a code name,

55
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,310
Rogan,
buy yourself some supplements.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,360
You dirty bitches were also brought to 
you by desk squad dot TV.

57
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:59,361
If you go to [inaudible] dot tv,
see like the cat shirt that I had on 

58
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:01,330
yesterday or one of the ones that you'll
see all over this place,

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,260
the,
the logos,

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,230
but uh,
Brian has two versions of them for sale.

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,520
Um,
and uh,

62
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,640
all the money goes to support,
uh,

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,030
the,
uh,

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,050
the desk squad podcast network,
which is on the itunes or aren't you?

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
Dirty bitches,
which is the only place where you can 

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,060
see the ice house chronicles this 
weekend.

67
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,070
Oh,
this Wednesday rather.

68
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
Yeah.
This weekend would have be in Toronto 

69
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:23,071
Hollow,
but uh,

70
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,670
this Wednesday we have a fucking gnarly 
show here at the ice house.

71
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,500
We got Doug Benson,

72
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,510
we got Brian Red Band,
we got Joey Diaz,

73
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,790
we got dom irrera.
Is that it?

74
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,580
Greg Fitzsimmons to.
It's going to be fucking crazy.

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,150
And we also went Friday.
If you're in town in La.

76
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,410
Yeah.
Who's on Friday?

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,450
Well,
we got clown vis,

78
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:47,451
which is clown Elvis France.
I liked how you lead strong Gareth from 

79
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:53,181
this,
that new a MTV show and Francisco Ramos 

80
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:56,670
who is confused by a Francisco Kurth 
member.

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,820
We had him on a podcast and it was the 
wrong guy that's supposed to be part of 

82
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,160
those Pablo Francisco.
That's right.

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,570
Right now we're friends.
So

84
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,860
that's cool.
Do sometimes shit just works out.

85
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,730
Yeah.
Anyway,

86
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,740
uh,
go to desk squad pv and all the 

87
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:11,740
information is there,
right?

88
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,690
All the posters for shows and uh,
all the information for a tee shirt 

89
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,810
sales aren't you?
Fucking freaks.

90
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,860
Rich Roll is here.
We're going to get busy sending it

91
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,350
down to the bottom of this thing.

92
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,110
Experience my day podcasts by night

93
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,810
when I did a podcast with Robb Wolf,
who is the Paleo Diet Guy,

94
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,620
uh,
one of the first things that happened 

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,630
was that I got an immediate influx of,
of vegans who had to set Robb Wolf 

96
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,520
Straight because rob wolf said some 
crazy shit.

97
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:56,521
Like I told them,
I drank a Kale shake every morning and 

98
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:56,521
it makes me feel great.
Gives me a lot of energy.

99
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:56,530
He's like,
no,

100
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,531
you got to eat bacon and eggs cigarettes
and you gotta get your Dick Sucked by 

101
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:02,380
truckers.
He wasn't my superhero.

102
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,040
Yeah,
he,

103
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,190
he said some awesome shit that you 
should have bacon,

104
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:11,191
eggs and coffee in the morning.
And that's a good way to get your day 

105
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:14,401
started.
A lot of people didn't want to hear 

106
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:14,680
that.
A lot of people felt that it was silly.

107
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:19,681
And you were one of the people that 
contacted me and then I lift up your 

108
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,880
story and it's pretty fascinating,
man.

109
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,910
You were,
you were like around 40 and you were at 

110
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:26,910
a shape.

111
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:26,910
Yeah,
I mean,

112
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,280
I was,
uh,

113
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,260
I was,
I had been an athlete in college.

114
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,200
I was a swimmer in college,
but uh,

115
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,980
it Kinda got away from me after that,
you know,

116
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,170
when,
when colleges over,

117
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,940
that was kind of the end of that 
athletic chapter and,

118
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,250
you know,
life goes on and,

119
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,280
you know,
I went to law school and then it's just 

120
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,280
about the job and get married and having
kids and you know,

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,420
climbing the corporate ladder and all 
that kind of stuff and you know,

122
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,600
in the wake of that,
you know,

123
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,660
lost sight of being fit and being 
healthy and you know,

124
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,730
it was pretty much a couch potato,
depressed,

125
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,830
lethargic,
a little bit lost in life,

126
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,700
you know,
how it goes.

127
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,350
So,
uh,

128
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,730
I decided I had to uh,
take it back.

129
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,340
I had a little bit of a,
of a health scare that kind of triggered

130
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,610
me to take,
to do something about it.

131
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,180
And so what,
what action did you take specifically?

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,260
Well,
I mean,

133
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:13,420
I wish I could,
you know,

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,130
say ran off to the library and got a 
bunch of books and,

135
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:21,131
you know,
read all the Paleo books and read all 

136
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,070
the Vegan books and did a double blind 
study with people with double blindfolds

137
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,710
on and,
and,

138
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:24,830
you know,
figuring out the right way to do it.

139
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,230
And,
you know,

140
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,360
that's not what happened.
I mean,

141
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,900
I,
I fumbled around for awhile trying to 

142
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:31,900
figure out what would work for me,
but the first thing I did,

143
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,880
um,
my wife is like,

144
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:38,880
she's big into yoga and healing and 
meditation and she's like,

145
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,950
you know,
she's constantly reading like crazy 

146
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,631
spiritual texts and you know,
she's pretty well schooled in 

147
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,470
alternative thinking and lifestyle and 
all that kind of stuff.

148
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:53,471
And you know,
if you were to open the refrigerator is 

149
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:53,540
pretty clear like kind of food she was 
eating and what I was eating,

150
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,980
which was essentially crap.

151
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,110
So,
uh,

152
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,540
but she would do like a juice cleanse 
pretty much every year,

153
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,760
you know.
And that was fine for her.

154
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:05,090
But that was definitely not something 
that I was ever interested in doing.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,050
But,
you know,

156
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,420
it was kind of desperate and I thought,
you know,

157
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,230
maybe I'll,
uh,

158
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,810
maybe I'll try that.
And so I just sort of reached out to her

159
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:12,360
and I said,
you know,

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,230
I think I want to do that,
and she hooked me up with,

161
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,800
we got all these crazy herbs and you 
know,

162
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:21,560
we got a juicer and the whole thing and 
kind of dialed it in and you know,

163
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,450
I did that for like five days,
kind of a,

164
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,290
not like the,
you know,

165
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:30,291
in Hollywood,
a lot of people do like the Cayenne 

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:30,291
pepper thing or whatever.
Yeah.

167
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,090
I mean that's like a starvation thing.
So it wasn't like that.

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,120
It was like I kind of weaned myself off 
food for a couple of days and just did 

169
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,350
juice for a couple of days and then kind
of lean back into food.

170
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,650
But it was a pretty like,
eyeopening experience,

171
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:47,651
you know,
like the first couple of days I was 

172
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:47,651
like,
it was like I was in Rehab,

173
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,050
man.
It's like buckled over on the couch,

174
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,660
like detox.
I'm like,

175
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,080
shit,
I could barely move.

176
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,730
What was your diet like before that?
Like what was standard

177
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,210
cheeseburgers?
Yeah,

178
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,370
I mean she's,
you know,

179
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,140
fast food all the time,
man,

180
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,900
you know,
dominoes,

181
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,040
Pizza,
Pizza Hut,

182
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,020
Wendy's,
Jack in the box late at night,

183
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,190
coming home from work,
just it didn't matter.

184
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,850
And you know,
part of that was because when I was in,

185
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,500
when I was swimming in college,
you know,

186
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm training like four hours a day and 
you're,

187
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,620
you know,
you're 19,

188
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:16,621
20 years old or whatever.
And just it was just about how many 

189
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,490
calories can I put down the throat and 
trying to fill myself up,

190
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,590
you know,
it didn't really matter and you know,

191
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,660
you can get away with that stuff,
you know,

192
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,100
and I did for a long time,
but you know,

193
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,780
it catches up to you.
But those habits,

194
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,060
you form those habits that carry with 
you and they're,

195
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,130
you know,
they're hard to break.

196
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,400
Yeah.
We really are a creature of habit.

197
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:37,401
That's a,
it's a strange thing that even bad 

198
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,171
habits like gambling,
like people that become gambling 

199
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:39,171
addicts,
it really is some sort of like a,

200
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,010
uh,
like a,

201
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,850
like a hijacking of reward systems and 
giving you this,

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,880
this rush towards something that really 
doesn't make any sense and there's also 

203
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,200
the comfort factor that comes and 
repeating patterns.

204
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,750
It's like your brain knows how to do it.
It's done it before.

205
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,160
Let's fucking around just keep

206
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
doing the same shit you've been doing 
and just,

207
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:03,201
you know,
blow off the gym and take a nap and go 

208
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:03,201
beat off and you know,
just do,

209
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:06,950
do,
do the same stupid shit you've been 

210
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,781
doing.
It's really hard for people to like to 

211
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:08,781
move away from that.
Yeah.

212
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,490
You get these like cemented pathways in 
your brain and it's just your default.

213
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,160
Like I think you,
you know,

214
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,540
when you were certain behavior patterns 
after a while,

215
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,640
you don't even know you're doing it.
You're just like,

216
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,380
it's like your program,
like a computer.

217
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:22,290
You just follow that pattern every time.
Change is hard,

218
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,200
man.
It is hard and it's,

219
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,440
it's also,
it's hard to find a healthy meal at like

220
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,450
fucking Burger King or Jack in the box.
It's hard to go in there and really get 

221
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,310
some nutrients.
You can't happen.

222
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,720
I mean you like you look you like,
do you got a salad?

223
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,400
You've got to sell over there and he 
looked at the salad.

224
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,330
You're like,
oh Jesus.

225
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:44,331
It's all like iceberg lettuce,
assault wilderness and everything's 

226
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:47,391
closed early here in la.
So if you're working late and coming 

227
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:48,150
home like it's sometimes it's the only 
option.

228
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,130
Subways,
subways though,

229
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:53,080
that's,
you know,

230
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,550
all that stuff that they can keep on a 
shelf for that long.

231
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,270
None of that is good for you.
So much.

232
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,320
It's way better.
I would imagine if you just got a 

233
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,860
chicken sandwich or a on whole wheat or 
something like that.

234
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,040
You need to drive throughs and more 
drive through siblings if they even have

235
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,080
any at all.
But that would be perfect.

236
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,970
Just dudes talking to you about like 
some serious fucking festival nutrition.

237
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,010
You want to,
you want to find the healthier,

238
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,670
you know,
but I mean you gotta I mean I can't 

239
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,950
imagine the produce that like subway and
you're such a huge corporation.

240
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,950
You're getting the low rent.
You cannot fuck with in and out Burger 

241
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,551
man.
If you had like some like really sexy 

242
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:34,710
tofu lettuce wrap thing that you're 
selling,

243
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,510
but right next door was in and out 
burger.

244
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,370
You're doomed son.
It's tough,

245
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,230
man.
It goes back to those pathways.

246
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:42,030
You know,
you smell it.

247
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,450
It's like a fair amount.
Yeah,

248
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,630
it's powerful.
It also goes back to the fact that in 

249
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,920
and out it's fucking delicious.
That's a problem too.

250
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,100
You can't deny that shit's delicious,
man.

251
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,330
I did it for years and years and years,
especially in and out,

252
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,840
those fresh burgers so much better than 
burgers at like,

253
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,820
you know,
someplace where they nuke it.

254
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,030
Didn't they just have like a little bit 
of a scandal there though with some of 

255
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,130
their meat.
Did they screwed up?

256
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,190
Yeah.
I thought I remember reading something 

257
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,811
about that.
Maybe this might be vegan propaganda 

258
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,510
probably.
It wasn't like the Zan.

259
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Remember desk squad coming down on me 
like my twitter already exploded.

260
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,660
Your fans are fucking rabid,
tense,

261
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,830
intense following.
I don't know what happened.

262
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,820
Um,
yeah.

263
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,430
I to go to war.
You just rally the troops.

264
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,690
What?
We're trying to build armies.

265
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:38,691
That's what we're selling kettlebells.
We're selling kettle bells and battle 

266
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:41,610
ropes and selling vitamins and brain 
pills and subscribing to youtube videos.

267
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,980
The uh,
yeah,

268
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:47,460
you were right there in and out burger.
I'm a plant.

269
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:52,461
Got closed by US da.
A supplied a or a rather than.

270
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,800
Yeah,

271
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,680
the,
the,

272
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,770
the inspectors.
Temporary shut down.

273
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,070
California Meat Company that provided 
the beef or the popular in and out 

274
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,070
burger chain.
Iu.

275
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,430
That's not good.
No propaganda here,

276
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,020
man.
And also the I of course,

277
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm just,
it's always good to have the information

278
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,420
if you say things all the time and I 
need to check them so I'd do it with 

279
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,630
anybody else has something to.
But the US school lunch program,

280
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,180
they also provided food for them.
Who?

281
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,650
Who fucking.

282
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,400
If you're sourcing that much beef,
you know,

283
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,290
you're a huge company like that.
You're going to have a problem like that

284
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,100
from time to time.

285
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,280
Yeah.
There's a lot of cows involved in that,

286
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,910
huh?
What is.

287
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,650
What are the numbers and something like 
that.

288
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,560
Now it's got to be enormous.
Diane Sawyer looks pissed as fuck.

289
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,530
That was the last person you want on TV.
No,

290
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,900
Nancy grace is the last person you want 
to talk shit about you angry faced,

291
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
but I'm like,
how many cows do you think they use?

292
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,270
Like just in and out a small chain like 
in and out.

293
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,730
How many do they use in his day?
Got To be mind blowing.

294
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,020
Yeah.
Whoa.

295
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,580
Really?
Stop and think about that.

296
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,700
It's like the holocaust of cows over 
there.

297
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,690
Well,
you know what it is,

298
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:59,691
man.
We figured out how to make this society 

299
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:02,031
work without people hunting.
It feel like this weird notion that we 

300
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:05,340
have zero connection with how the food 
is gathered.

301
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,460
Like that's a really fucking crazy way 
to live.

302
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,600
So everybody's like,
yeah,

303
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:14,601
I'd like meat like meat,
but you don't have to do any of the 

304
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,780
stuff that makes you respect the animal.
You don't have to hunt it down.

305
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:19,080
You don't have to kill it enough to like
be thankful that you got it and bring it

306
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,310
back.
There's none of that anymore.

307
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:20,670
The system

308
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,600
stem is set up to prevent you from 
thinking about it.

309
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,630
You know,
it's almost like grocery stores in a 

310
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,521
certain way.
It's analogous to like a Vegas casino 

311
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:30,521
where,
you know,

312
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:33,640
the casinos,
I don't know if they're pumping the air 

313
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:33,640
conditioning and there's no clocks.
You can't find the exit door.

314
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,960
It's disorienting and the same way like 
a grocery store,

315
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,540
everything's perfectly packaged.
It looks clean or what,

316
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:38,920
whatever,
you know,

317
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,180
you're not,
you're not supposed to think about that.

318
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,250
I was at a grocery store that has a 
butcher shop in the back and uh,

319
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,050
they were sawing through a side of beef 
and you don't really see that,

320
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,450
you know,
you really rarely see that.

321
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:55,240
You know,
you would usually get is you get like,

322
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,390
you know,
they have these packages and the state 

323
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:00,390
because already nice and wrapped up and 
you go,

324
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,070
this one is a full pound.
That's a good size state.

325
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,190
I'll take that home.
No,

326
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:04,390
no,
no.

327
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:07,250
This dude had saw and he was running 
meet through the,

328
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,060
so I was like,
yeah,

329
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:10,030
that's real life son.
That's,

330
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,520
that's our body.
It's not like a steak.

331
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,730
Now there's a body that has to get 
chopped up and become sex when we're so 

332
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,271
separated from that.
That actual experience of seeing the 

333
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,310
animal lose its life and understanding 
what it means to eat it.

334
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,100
We're completely separated from really 
strange.

335
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,470
Imagine if your job was the guy in the 
slaughterhouse,

336
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,410
like doing that cutting throats or 
whatever.

337
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:34,240
I mean,
that's got a tad emotional gotta be mad.

338
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,430
Yes.
It's got to be madness all day.

339
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:41,431
You're seeing terrified animals and 
you're giving them the very thing that 

340
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:43,030
they're terrified of it.
Terrified of losing their lives.

341
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,840
Fucking horrifying.
Yeah.

342
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,560
It's weird man.
And I think you know,

343
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,390
you

344
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,610
know I think you can appreciate is a 
deep thinker,

345
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:54,440
but you know,
food is energy,

346
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:54,960
man.
It,

347
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,640
it carries a vibration and so when you 
put something in your mouth and you know

348
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:02,580
you're making a decision to take that 
vibration into you and so you know what,

349
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,250
what is that vibration?
You know,

350
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,860
when you're taking in a terrorized 
animal,

351
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,210
does that affect you?
Is that.

352
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:11,670
Does that change your perception,
your decision making,

353
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,280
your outlook,
does it not?

354
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,850
I don't know.

355
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,240
It's very good question.
The,

356
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,410
you know the solution though,
it seems to be it's not as simple as 

357
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,900
don't eat meat because even if you don't
eat meat,

358
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,640
what are you gonna do with all these 
fucking cows?

359
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
Are you going to stop them from 
breeding?

360
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,210
Are you going to let them starve to 
death and die off?

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Or they're going to go extinct?
Like how are we going to regulate these 

362
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,701
cows?
You're either going to shoot them or 

363
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:35,701
you're going to castrate a bunch of 
them.

364
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,720
You're going to have to shoot some of 
them because otherwise you're going to 

365
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:39,720
have cows wandering through the streets 
everywhere.

366
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,340
Like you got to deal with the fact that 
we have to deal with the fact that 

367
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,340
you've created a species.
You know,

368
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,281
essentially we've bred cows to this 
domestic form from wild cows and you 

369
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,690
know,
it's,

370
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,540
we've done it for so long that they're 
pretty much helpless.

371
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,220
Without us,
it'd be bad cows.

372
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,300
There's no predators out there.
It's not like we live in fucking Africa 

373
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,730
and there's lions running around the 
could take care of the cow problem.

374
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not going to happen.
You would have a real problem with cows 

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,020
if we stopped eating them.
Just the fucking sheer numbers that 

376
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,020
exist now.
I mean,

377
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,420
unless you could absolutely keep them 
from breeding and then you would have to

378
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:21,421
figure out what we're going to do.
You're going to just let the old ones 

379
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:21,421
die.
You're going to let some of them breed,

380
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,290
you know,
what are you going to do?

381
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:22,860
No,
it's not.

382
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,690
Absolutely.
Yeah.

383
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,840
There's no easy solution,
but the Vegan solution of not eating the

384
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,650
meat at least removes Karma from your 
position.

385
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:36,820
It moves.
It removes you from interacting with the

386
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,910
terrified animals last moments into for 
you to be.

387
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,490
I don't want to say profiting,
benefiting from that.

388
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,890
Well,
I don't know.

389
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,440
I just

390
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,010
speak to my own experience.
You know,

391
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:49,280
and I know I feel better.
I feel more energized.

392
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:52,160
I feel like my energy is even in good.
My,

393
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,190
my mood and my outlook is positive and I
think that,

394
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,500
you know,
when you,

395
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,260
when you talk about Vegan and the word 
Vegan and what that means,

396
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,350
I mean that means different things to 
different people.

397
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,490
You know,
it's a tricky word.

398
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:04,730
It's

399
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,210
no what it means for a lot of people.

400
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,320
Well,
what it means,

401
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:08,800
fuck you.

402
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,140
No,
it means it means,

403
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,360
uh,
you,

404
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,620
you run a high risk of them being 
annoying.

405
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,120
It doesn't mean that they're ignoring a 
lot of friends that are awesome.

406
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,430
Mac Danzig is a Vegan and he's a great 
guy,

407
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:28,431
great guy,
and he's going to be on the podcast 

408
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:30,731
tomorrow again.
We fucked up and the big disaster for 

409
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:34,070
this park and I just sit.
My twitter feed won't still being a lazy

410
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:36,650
fuck.
People are so silly.

411
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:37,490
You know,
Max,

412
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,900
a great guy,
awesome guy,

413
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:40,170
and he's,
you know,

414
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,250
he's got his reasons and they're 
intelligent or reasons for being a 

415
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,250
Vegan.
However,

416
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,800
there are a few people that do it as 
like a sanctimonious starting point.

417
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,240
They do it as like,

418
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,250
you like a,
they are claiming a moral high ground 

419
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,710
with this new position and they flaunt 
it and it's like,

420
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,360
you know,
really annoying self satisfying kind of 

421
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:01,360
in your face way.

422
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,440
It's,
it's defeatist for what they're trying 

423
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,440
to say as well.
And I think that,

424
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,850
that uh,
yeah,

425
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,160
it's a very emotionally

426
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,100
recharge work.
Food in general as well be religious,

427
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,730
talking about food in general is 
emotionally charged.

428
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:18,731
I mean just look at the twitter feed is 
going to explode over this and that's 

429
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,080
your barometer of that.
But you know,

430
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,250
it's,
it's right up there with religion and 

431
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,250
politics.
It really is.

432
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,390
And when you say Vegan,
it immediately,

433
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:31,391
you know,
people snap into a preconceived idea of 

434
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,450
what that is and what that means.
And they have a visual image of a person

435
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:33,260
in their mind,
you know,

436
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:36,980
it's a guy with dreadlocks kicking a 
hacky sack up in Humboldt.

437
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,550
Always blowing a guy.
Yeah,

438
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,320
I mean,
whatever it is,

439
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,090
somebody has that imagery.
So the,

440
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,160
so that word,
you know,

441
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,940
and,
and people have different reasons for 

442
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:51,940
getting into it,
you know,

443
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,641
you have the people who are into it for 
the compassion and the saving the 

444
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:58,511
animals.
That's a very different crowd and 

445
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,331
attitude from the people that get into 
it for health reasons or because they 

446
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:01,331
don't want to have a heart attack or 
whatever.

447
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,790
And uh,
and you know,

448
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,620
they both are I guess are technically 
vegans but they're also,

449
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:08,060
you know,
very different.

450
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:11,240
And just because you choose to not eat 
meat or whatever it doesn't,

451
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,300
does that mean that you're automatically
a democrat or what is your political 

452
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,000
point of view and all of these things 
get woven together and it.

453
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,080
And it makes it,
it makes it challenging to even talk 

454
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,360
about it with an open mind.

455
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,850
Yeah.
It is a quite interesting situation and 

456
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,740
there is the very real issue of the fact
that we are at the top of the food chain

457
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,200
and when you're at the top of the food 
chain of bear,

458
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,210
some responsibility and you can,
you know,

459
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:41,211
we're the only animals that can really 
decide and choose how to alter other 

460
00:19:41,211 --> 00:19:44,070
animals' lives,
like on purpose and figure out how to do

461
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,830
it.
And when you look at how we choose to do

462
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:48,570
it,
if you look at like food inc and you see

463
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:52,230
factory farming and stuff like that,
it really is a,

464
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:57,231
is a,
it's a damning statement about like 

465
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,770
where we're at like spiritually,
like as a race,

466
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,980
like we're getting away with this really
heinous shit because we can because it's

467
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,440
easy to just not pay attention to it.
And that's uh,

468
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,830
that's,
that's the worst case scenario.

469
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,580
The best case scenario you would think 
they have it set up.

470
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:19,410
So these animals live like they're on a,
an open prairie and they all just live a

471
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,620
natural life.
And then you call them from the herd and

472
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,520
you do it.
You do it,

473
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,240
you know,
easily.

474
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:29,241
So they live a natural life,
no different than any other cow in a 

475
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,151
large environment where they get to roam
around and eat grass instead of being 

476
00:20:32,151 --> 00:20:33,030
forced fed corn and then you just kill 
them.

477
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,850
I mean that's like the best case 
scenario if you're going to eat cows.

478
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,390
But the way we do it is it's pretty 
damning that human beings in the idea of

479
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,520
maximizing profit have decided to run 
these ridiculous places where you're 

480
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,430
packing pigs

481
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,330
right next to each other in these little
boxes and you,

482
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:54,620
you see the chickens all stuffed in 
together with each other and pecking and

483
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,410
each other.
It's fucking gnarly,

484
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:56,800
man.

485
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,320
We,
yeah.

486
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,480
When you see food inc and you see the 
chicken coop,

487
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,380
it's pretty tough.
It's pretty disturbing

488
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,430
connection because you know,
it's easy to go,

489
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,810
well chickens,
chickens,

490
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:09,540
the healthier option or whatever.
And then you see that it makes you,

491
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,460
it makes you think twice.
But I also think,

492
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you know,
we've created this system that 

493
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ultimately is not sustainable.
I mean,

494
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,871
like an insane amount of our agriculture
goes to produce grain to feed these to 

495
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,580
feed livestock like something like 90 
percent or something like that.

496
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,860
It's crazy.
High,

497
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,050
crazy high.
And,

498
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,060
and you know,
with the,

499
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,660
and then it,
it,

500
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,870
you know,
brings up all the ecological arguments 

501
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:35,870
about greenhouse gasses.

502
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,470
Oh,
they fill up a fucking storm.

503
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,910
Those goddamn animals ruined India.
Do you know they do.

504
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,070
They fucking,
they caused global warming.

505
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:44,270
No.
Bullshit and farting.

506
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,350
Yes.
Do it.

507
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,660
It's not bullshit.
It sounds silly,

508
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,330
but they fought so much.
You're dealing with in India,

509
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:55,331
you have so many fucking cows that they 
really have pollution issues because of 

510
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:59,801
cows farting in the air.
I heard the grass fed beef parks even 

511
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,150
more.
Really.

512
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,080
I don't know where I wrote.
That's hilarious.

513
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:05,510
Well that makes sense because envy,
it would be much more grass fed.

514
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:06,770
Right.
And they're the ones who have the,

515
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,830
the big issue,
but they also have the issue in that 

516
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,830
they don't kill cows or at least the 
Hindus.

517
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,370
Do you?
Apparently Ken buy beef in India.

518
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:18,371
It's not uncommon.
It's just there's a huge group of them 

519
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,640
that won't fuck with the cows.
Is that why they don't wear deodorant?

520
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,660
So it smells like deodorant or armpits 
more than poop and Fart.

521
00:22:23,661 --> 00:22:26,540
So you know,
it's like you're building your field.

522
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,230
Maybe your own body smell cancel out the
shit.

523
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:31,070
Smell in the air.
Yeah.

524
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:32,840
That's like way better than fucking 
shit.

525
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:37,841
Yeah man.
That's like the worst case scenario is 

526
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,721
like you're living around animals who 
stink up the air constantly with their 

527
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:44,720
fart gas and you can't kill them because
dog fart are fucking nasty.

528
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,490
Big Cow Farts.
That's way be sniffing our pits all day 

529
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,561
long.
You're hungry and you know there's 

530
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:56,261
people starving and they're just letting
these delicious cows just wander around 

531
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:56,990
the fuck.
Did that ever happen?

532
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,480
I don't know.
I think it goes back to religion.

533
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,880
What a bunch of silly bitches they are 
in India.

534
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,220
That is the one of the silliest choices 
ever.

535
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,550
What do you want to do?
You want to starve to death or what you 

536
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:09,550
eat these fucking delicious cows.

537
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,630
Let's just sit around some other farts 
and complain and have more people's 

538
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,030
cultural mores though.
I mean,

539
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
there are,
there are cultures that think that we're

540
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,860
insane for having dogs in our houses.
It's true.

541
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,210
Yeah.
It's interesting how,

542
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:25,211
um,
we just sort of adopt a pattern of 

543
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,941
behavior based on our surroundings and 
what's existed in that area for the 

544
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,320
Indians,
I guess what it is the cow is sacred and

545
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:35,321
the Hindu culture.
So it is God or something like that or 

546
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:35,321
relatives come back to life or 
something.

547
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,600
Yeah.
Well,

548
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,040
when I worked at an Indian company,
I had a steering wheel.

549
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,110
My,
me and my ex girlfriend used to share a 

550
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,110
cart and her steering wheel cover.
It was a cow,

551
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,890
a

552
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,430
print and they saw me drive up tonight 
and I had a meeting and they told me to 

553
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,210
please remove that from their steering 
wheel because uh,

554
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
they,
they respect cows.

555
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,850
Why real Indian company was called the 
software people.

556
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Oh Wow.
Well you showed up with like murdered 

557
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,140
scanning vote piece.
So just filled with,

558
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,770
you know,
just be nice and God's got to be a weird

559
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:17,030
thing.
What a strange thing to just choose to 

560
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,080
really worship and lock onto it just 
shows you.

561
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,300
I mean that's what they did in India,
you know,

562
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,640
he someplace else.
It was Buddha someplace else.

563
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:26,641
It was Jesus.
It's were so fascinating when it comes 

564
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:26,641
to that.
Human beings are really,

565
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:28,750
really bizarre animals.
So your,

566
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:33,751
your story was that you were an athlete 
and then you got unhealthy and then you 

567
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:38,200
had a little bit of a health scare.
So that's when you decided to go vegan.

568
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,520
Yeah.
So I did.

569
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,460
So I did that juice cleanse and then you
know,

570
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,270
by the,
by the fifth day of that,

571
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:45,220
I just felt unbelievable,
you know,

572
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:50,221
like my energy level was through the 
roof and all I had been doing it was 

573
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:53,041
drinking like fruit and vegetable juice 
and drinking this like beet root broth 

574
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,760
and some teas and stuff like that.

575
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,110
And,
and it was,

576
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,920
it was amazing because I had,
I had abused my body for so long with 

577
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:06,970
terrible food and terrible lifestyle and
I'm also a recovering alcoholic.

578
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:10,450
So I used to drink like a shitload.
You hit it on both ends.

579
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:11,180
Yeah,
I was hitting,

580
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,570
I was hitting it hard,
like I just,

581
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:15,220
you know,
I did not treat myself well and the idea

582
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,830
that like within five days I could feel 
that good.

583
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:22,831
Like I didn't know that I could feel 
that good or I hadn't felt that good in 

584
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:22,831
15,
20 years.

585
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:26,770
It's pretty amazing.
The body is incredibly resilient,

586
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,450
you know,
when you treat it right.

587
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,640
So when I was done with that I thought 
well,

588
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:32,030
what am I going to do?
You know,

589
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,280
like I want to,
I want to keep feeling this good like,

590
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,390
but I don't know,
I don't know what to do next.

591
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,720
And you know,
again,

592
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,170
I wish I'd gone out and read a bunch of 
books or something,

593
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,570
but I just thought,
uh,

594
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,660
maybe I'll try a vegetarian diet.
Like I didn't do any education or 

595
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:48,660
research,
but I just,

596
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,630
it just seemed like,
well that sounds,

597
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,650
you know,
healthy or healthier than what I'm 

598
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,491
doing.
But kind of coming from an addiction 

599
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:59,191
perspective and a recovery perspective.
Like I went to rehab 14 years ago and so

600
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:04,321
a lot of like the way,
like I sort of rewired my brain and the 

601
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:06,790
way I think is kind of in the context of
addiction and recovery.

602
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,180
It just seemed like something I could 
wrap my brain around because you're 

603
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,540
either eating meat or you're not,
you know,

604
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:18,541
it's very,
it's very black and white just like 

605
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:18,541
you're using drugs and you're drinking 
or you're not,

606
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,290
you know,
you're either sober or you're using,

607
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:20,590
you know.

608
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,160
And so that made more sense to me then 
hey I'm going to eat better.

609
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,890
Like I'm just going to eat healthy and 
go to the gym because it's so vague,

610
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,510
you know,
like I don't know what that means,

611
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,460
you know,
maybe I would for like a week or two,

612
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:35,350
but I would definitely fall back into my
regular old behavior patterns.

613
00:26:35,351 --> 00:26:40,351
So.
So I started doing that but it wasn't 

614
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:40,390
long before,
you know,

615
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:45,391
I'm looking for the loopholes or 
whatever because you can eat like shit 

616
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:45,600
on a vegetarian diet.
You can eat like shit on a Vegan Diet.

617
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:46,890
So you know,
I could,

618
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,450
I could eat pizza hut cheese pizza and 
get Nachos in,

619
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,550
you know,
eat McDonald's French fries and I'm a 

620
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:55,550
vegetarian,
right.

621
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:55,550
So certainly,
you know,

622
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,230
that wasn't working,
but I did that for like six months and 

623
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,631
of course I didn't lose any weight about
50 pounds heavier than I have now and 

624
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:08,271
you know,
it was kind of back on the couch and 

625
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:08,271
lethargic and I was ready to just bag 
it.

626
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:08,271
But I thought,
you know,

627
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,310
I wonder what would happen if I just 
kind of went that extra step and got rid

628
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:15,630
of the dairy and cut out the processed 
foods and I didn't really think it would

629
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:20,631
make a difference.
Like I almost did it to prove that it 

630
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:20,631
wouldn't or to like,
you know,

631
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:22,170
proven my wife that it wouldn't work,
you know,

632
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,560
so I could kind of keep doing what I was
doing and,

633
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,220
and,
and feel free about it.

634
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:28,890
But.
So I tried that and within a week,

635
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:32,220
like I was back to that energy level 
that I felt when I did the cleanse,

636
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,890
like my energy level was through the 
roof.

637
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:39,891
Like it was so high that I could only 
sleep like a couple hours a night and I 

638
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:42,300
was like bouncing off the walls and it 
really did.

639
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:44,950
It did,
it made a huge debt.

640
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:50,030
It made a huge difference.
And I think getting rid of the dairy 

641
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,331
made a much bigger,
like not eating the meat wasn't that 

642
00:27:53,331 --> 00:27:53,940
hard for me,
but getting rid of the dairy in my diet,

643
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,970
that was a lot harder.
That was almost like another detox 

644
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,010
because dairies in so many foods so.
And I crave it man,

645
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,060
you know,
I love it.

646
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,790
So it was very difficult to kind of 
break that.

647
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,460
Do you have cheat days?
I don't have cheat days.

648
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,830
So your,
your attitude is essentially the same 

649
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,420
attitude that you have about like 
recovery because.

650
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,820
Well that's the thing like I know

651
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,850
you know like Tim Ferris is big on the 
cheat day with his slow car up and all 

652
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,990
of that and it seems to work for a lot 
of people and it makes sense for me.

653
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:29,760
Like for me it's about,
it goes back to like the addiction model

654
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,761
because I do crave this stuff man.
And I know if I had a cheeseburger like 

655
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:38,541
once a week,
like I'd start eating cheeseburgers all 

656
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:38,541
the time because it would,
you know,

657
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,350
you break the cycle and now I don't 
think about it that much.

658
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,570
Like every once in a while I'll smell it
and it smells good to me,

659
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,420
but I don't go around like creating it 
all the time.

660
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,730
But if I was to have it every once in 
awhile then you're kind of,

661
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,490
you keep your,
you're still kinda like fertilizing that

662
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:51,270
little seed.

663
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,390
I respect that.
Anthony Bourdain loves pork so much.

664
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,750
He loves pork so much that they gave him
the option of quit eating pork or take 

665
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:04,690
medicine to lower your blood pressure 
and your cholesterol rather.

666
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,680
And he took the medicine so they'll take
the fucking medicine.

667
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:11,530
I need pork.
Talked about it on the show,

668
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,650
like being addicted to food.
And for him it's work.

669
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,510
Fatty pork.
He's willing to sacrifice health because

670
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,020
he likes to eat pork.
I mean that's,

671
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,930
that's pretty heavy man.
Fucking intense.

672
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Yeah.
And I don't know how good that anti 

673
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,550
cholesterol medication is for you.
Is that okay for you?

674
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,050
I mean,
you know,

675
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:31,860
there's a lot,
there's,

676
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,900
there's plenty of side effects from 
that.

677
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,040
I mean,
uh,

678
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I would imagine there are a crazy number
of people that are on these drugs and 

679
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,560
it's amazing the extent to which the,
the,

680
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,390
the healthcare system,
you know,

681
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,160
the doctors just,
you know,

682
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:53,161
they just need your prescribed this 
stuff and they're not that educated 

683
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:54,280
about nutrition,
whether it's Paleo or Vegan or whatever.

684
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,190
It's not really part of the medical 
school curriculum.

685
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,560
I'm shocked talking to doctors about 
nutrition.

686
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:03,150
I've been shocked to having 
conversations.

687
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:03,220
Right?

688
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,860
Very few are.
And it's not their fault.

689
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,580
Like,
you know,

690
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:08,470
they're studying all sorts of stuff and 
you know,

691
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:13,471
maybe there's an elective here or there 
like one required course that they have 

692
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:14,200
to take,
but they're not really that school.

693
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,430
And in our system where we're sort of 
grown and raised to believe that,

694
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:23,431
you know,
doctor knows best and you go to the 

695
00:30:23,431 --> 00:30:24,480
doctor and the doctor knows everything 
and it's kind of alarming and eyeopening

696
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,980
to realize that that's not necessarily 
the case.

697
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,420
At least with respect to nutrition,

698
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,080
there should most certainly be a,
uh,

699
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,040
a doctor of nutrition that you go to,
a doctor who is a,

700
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,610
a,
a full fledge Dr at the top of,

701
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,670
you know,
all the information that's available 

702
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,071
today.
He's on top of all of it and his job is 

703
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:49,251
just to check your blood and,
and give you a detailed writeup of 

704
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:51,140
what's wrong with you nutritionally.
You know what?

705
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,920
So you don't have any [inaudible] in 
your body.

706
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,360
You don't have this in your body,
you don't have,

707
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,140
you're missing nice.
And you know what,

708
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,490
whatever it is that he could show you 
what your optimum levels of your various

709
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,870
nutrients should be.
Very,

710
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:03,900
very,
very few people you know,

711
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,430
ever get that done.
No.

712
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,490
And they do exist.
But that should be part of your 

713
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,490
physical.

714
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,490
Yeah,
it shouldn't be.

715
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,860
It should be a regular thing because 
for,

716
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,990
you know,
I talk about on the show all the time,

717
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:18,991
how much it changed me when I,
when I started drinking Kale shakes in 

718
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:21,220
the morning and I'm not Vegan.
I still a,

719
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:23,680
I drink milk,
I still eat meat,

720
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,610
but in a massively increasing the amount
of plant nutrients I get into my body 

721
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,710
and especially it seems like starting my
day with them that I,

722
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:40,711
I usually I don't eat like right when I 
wake up I like to exercise sometimes or 

723
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:42,730
just get up and do some stuff and then 
I'll eat.

724
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,760
And uh,
my first meal is always really light.

725
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,600
It's always either some sort of a hemp 
protein shake or it's this,

726
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:52,060
um,
this a Kale shake thing that I have.

727
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,360
But the difference is the Kale shake 
gives me this fucking steady energy.

728
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,500
Like I can feel my body responding to 
the nutrients.

729
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:05,320
Like you can literally feel it and 
there's no.

730
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,490
The only negative about it at all is 
that you have to ship more,

731
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,760
but that's just like cleaning out your 
pipes and you actually look forward to 

732
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,320
it because they're there are wonderful.
These poops or like a ride,

733
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,980
like you can feel it,
you can feel it in the way that you 

734
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,771
know,
like when you have that First Cup of 

735
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:26,800
coffee and you can feel your spine 
getting tickled by the caffeine.

736
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,300
It's a similar.
It's a similar thing.

737
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:30,260
I mean,
it jacks you up.

738
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:35,261
I could not live without the vitamix.
I mean that's an amazing creation.

739
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,100
We got to town,
we bring it with.

740
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,930
We'd like travel with it.
You're an animal which

741
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
are part of your life.
I mean,

742
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,260
it's amazing.
It's a heavy thing because it's 

743
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,260
expensive.
Right?

744
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,550
And things like 500 bucks,
450 bucks or whatever.

745
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,551
It's a.
it's a tough pill to swallow for a lot 

746
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:54,551
of people to tell them they ought to get
one,

747
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:54,860
but it's a motherfucker.
Once you have it,

748
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,600
you're right.
I can't imagine not having it.

749
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,970
It's a motherfucker.
It's a beast.

750
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,270
That thing's amazing.
It's such a great thing to stuff 

751
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,320
everything in there and plunge it and 
then just turn that bitch on.

752
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,730
Okay.
I,

753
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,330
uh,
blended in avocado pit wants,

754
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,810
drank it.
Whoa.

755
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,230
What was that?
While I had a bunch of other stuff.

756
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,990
Is that good for you?
But just wanted to see if I could do it.

757
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,780
That's how the condo.
Even the pip,

758
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,790
but that's what I'm talking about.
Isn't that the poison that's got like a 

759
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,080
night traits in it or something crazy 
like.

760
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,830
No,
it has,

761
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,630
it has a front back to the future.
It's fucking nuclear.

762
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:34,790
It's like those sneakers that light up 
when you step on them so that stuff.

763
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,820
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,

764
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,680
I wouldn't recommend doing it all the 
time.

765
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,350
I just wanted to see that.
The point is that I couldn't believe 

766
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,850
that it was so powerful that it could 
get actually blend that into.

767
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,800
For folks who don't know what a vitamix 
is,

768
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:52,801
it's essentially a really high powered 
blender that's designed to make like 

769
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:56,761
vegetable smoothies,
but it also has like a top with a hole 

770
00:33:56,761 --> 00:34:00,271
in it and you have like a plunger and 
the plunger drops down to like right 

771
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:04,471
above the blade.
So it shoves everything into the blades 

772
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:04,471
and matches.

773
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:05,800
It's incredible.
It never breaks the fucking thing.

774
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,260
Oh,
indestructible.

775
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,730
It's like a World War II relic kind of 
thing.

776
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:13,180
Even the design of it looks like it's 
been around forever.

777
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Have you?
Um,

778
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,920
I think I tweeted you this.
Did you,

779
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,090
have you tried putting beets in there?
No,

780
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,420
no,
I have.

781
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,040
My recipe is so fucking good.
I don't want to mess with it too much.

782
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,460
I meshed with it by chain beat stuff.
Sound good.

783
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:32,470
But I changed the pairs to a pineapple,
put like a half of Eden and the Beet 

784
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,900
Greens because the,
the,

785
00:34:33,901 --> 00:34:38,390
the nitrites nitrites and nitrates.
I always get that wrong or whatever.

786
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,530
It's been shown to have significant 
impact on,

787
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,610
uh,
the efficiency of your oxygen 

788
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:47,610
utilization.
Like it really,

789
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:47,610
it's,
it's an,

790
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,060
it's a pretty significant like energy 
booster.

791
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,870
Wow,
okay.

792
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:55,871
So the Greens as well,
but the Greens in and then it'll turn 

793
00:34:55,871 --> 00:35:00,221
everything read like even if you put a 
tiny amount of bed and the whole shake 

794
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:00,221
will be read and it's,
you know,

795
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:04,781
you want to put some other stuff in 
there because it has kind of a heavy 

796
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:05,060
taste but,
but you'll notice a difference.

797
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:05,870
Oh,
right.

798
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,100
Definitely.
I would definitely do that.

799
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,330
I'll try that shit tonight.
The same way that um,

800
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,380
the quarter's eps work because you know,
the quarter steps are so good at 

801
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,260
boosting your oxygen uptake and the 
efficiency of your oxygen utilization as

802
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,240
a similar effect.
I mean the quarter steps are crazy.

803
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,020
Awesome,
amazing.

804
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:21,830
You know?
Yeah.

805
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:24,560
Well that's what the main ingredient of 
shroom tech sport is.

806
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,910
I take four of those before Jujitsu 
glass and even if I'm,

807
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,690
you know,
I haven't been training recently like,

808
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,390
so it's amazing how much more energy you
have to make significant feeling of like

809
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:37,980
an extra little boost that you have.
It's like you've

810
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,980
been training at altitude and then you 
come down to sea level like you feel 

811
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:42,980
like you don't get winded,

812
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,850
you don't go into the same way,
that's for sure.

813
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:49,851
And people who have gone to altitudes 
like you've had to change attitudes 

814
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:51,000
rapidly,
like move up to boulder,

815
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,730
like real quick and that normally would 
have issues with that.

816
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:58,731
They've found that if they take 
cordyceps mushrooms it can can settle 

817
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,570
them in,
settle them in quicker because for a lot

818
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:02,790
of people that altitude sickness is no 
fucking joke.

819
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,970
I read this thing about babies being 
born in Colorado that like a record 

820
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,080
number of babies are born prematurely 
like uh,

821
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,360
in Colorado because the,
the high altitude,

822
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,390
but it totally makes sense.
That's a harder way to live.

823
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,890
The whole thing is tougher.
Oxygen Utilization is fucking 

824
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,950
everything,
man.

825
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,280
It's everything.
It's everything and it's in beats.

826
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,100
Beats Man.
Check it out.

827
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,770
She got some rhubarb while you're at it,
Joe also.

828
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,250
So you don't,
you do you miss meat at all?

829
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Do you miss the smell?
Like if you have a neighbor who's 

830
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,760
barbecuing and you had nightmares about 
Fogo de Chao.

831
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,640
Oh,
I'm a human being,

832
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,610
man,
you know,

833
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:45,870
like I,
you know,

834
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,830
I ate that stuff for a long time.
I like it.

835
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:53,010
I like the smell of it.
I mean there are certain you can people 

836
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,990
that will say discuss them or whatever 
and that's,

837
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,310
you know,
I'm sure it does or whatever.

838
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,660
But for me I smell it.
It smell.

839
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,250
That's my problem.
Smells good.

840
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,630
I drive by Jack in the box.
I think that smells good and it's.

841
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,190
Yeah,
see that's,

842
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,220
that's like my problem.
That's why I can't have a cheat day for 

843
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,220
me.
I understand.

844
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,440
So how did you get involved in endurance
athletics?

845
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:13,160
What happened there?

846
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,450
It was another kind of weird,
like organic thing that just evolved 

847
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:18,850
over time.
I mean when I,

848
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,290
when I got on the plant based Diet,
I started exercising again,

849
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:29,110
you know,
mainly because I just had all this 

850
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,110
energy I had to burn off.
Like I didn't,

851
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,320
I didn't have any designs on going back 
to being an athlete or being competitive

852
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:37,321
in anything.
I just wanted to lose a little weight 

853
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,260
and I want it to be able to enjoy my 
kids at their energy level,

854
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:39,430
you know,
I have four kids now,

855
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,930
so it was really just about,
you know,

856
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,870
connecting with that part of myself that
I kind of lost touch with,

857
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:48,220
but nothing crazy,
you know,

858
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:51,610
I would go to the pool and swim a couple
times a week and you know,

859
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,640
do a light jog here and there.
My wife bought me a bike for my 

860
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:56,640
birthday.

861
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,900
I'd never really ridden a bike before 
and this was when I turned 40,

862
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,710
but then I had like a inexperience after
I'd been doing this for maybe four 

863
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,820
months or something like that.
It's really moderate exercise.

864
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,110
I went out for a morning run out at,
uh,

865
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,530
you know,
where a mulholland drive,

866
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:19,531
the dirt road part of it that dumps out 
at the bottom of Topanga on the valley 

867
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:19,531
side.
So there,

868
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,310
there's a trail that you can,
you can literally go like all the way to

869
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:22,150
Brentwood,
right?

870
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:25,450
Goes forever.
And I just went out there one morning on

871
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:27,790
a weekday for a morning run and just,
you know,

872
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:32,791
you have those days and I'm sure you 
have it in Jujitsu where you just feel 

873
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,370
unstoppable.
Like you can just keep going forever.

874
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,220
I just started running and I just felt 
amazing,

875
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:41,221
you know,
and I just kept going and going and say 

876
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:41,221
I don't have to be back,
you know,

877
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:41,221
I'm going to keep going,
going.

878
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:43,180
I ended up running like the better part 
of a marathon,

879
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:50,330
you know,
like I think 24 miles or something like 

880
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,330
that,
that morning,

881
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,470
excuse me.
And I got back and I was like,

882
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,960
what is going on?
Some forest gumption.

883
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,980
Yeah,
it was,

884
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:58,980
it was okay.
I mean I'd never been a runner,

885
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,010
you know,
it's not like I had a background in 

886
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,010
running or had any proficiency in it 
really.

887
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,340
And it wasn't like I was going fast that
day either,

888
00:39:05,341 --> 00:39:10,341
but it was just the idea that I could 
keep going and I thought something's 

889
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:10,341
going on here,
you know?

890
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:14,690
I don't know whether it's the nutrition 
change or I've just unlocked some 

891
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,120
dormant gene inside me.
But,

892
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,500
you know,
this felt good,

893
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,400
you know,
and then I was like,

894
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,460
I'd like to challenge myself and then I 
started looking for something to do and 

895
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,700
you know,
when you're 40 it's like,

896
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,370
you know,
a bucket list item or what's the midlife

897
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:27,720
crisis thing you want to do?

898
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,720
And started thinking about doing an 
ironman because that's pretty typical 

899
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,960
goal for a 40 year old guy who wants to,
you know,

900
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,340
conquer a mountain or whatever.
And uh,

901
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,410
and started trading a little bit more 
and more.

902
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,540
And I didn't know anything about 
triathlon.

903
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:45,030
I didn't know anything about ironman or 
anything like that.

904
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,540
But I figured it seems like there's,
those ironman races are like every 

905
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:50,820
weekend somewhere,
like tons of people are doing it.

906
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:53,670
It can't be that hard to get in one.
I'll just pick a city and you know,

907
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,380
a ways out and trained for it.
Myself and I went on the website one day

908
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,910
and realize that,
that uh,

909
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,860
they all sell out like a year ahead of 
time.

910
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,530
Like they're like youtube tickets like 
the,

911
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,970
after the day,
after one of those races the next day.

912
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,220
And they just sell out like in a couple 
of hours.

913
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,740
So I couldn't get into any of those.

914
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,310
And,
and,

915
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,480
uh,
it was like,

916
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,180
well,
you know,

917
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:19,181
what am I going to do?
And nothing seemed to excite me and I 

918
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:19,510
kind of lost my Mojo for a little bit.
But,

919
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:22,690
uh,
I was at Jamba juice one morning,

920
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,310
like maybe a month after that experience
getting a juice and you know,

921
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:28,250
how they have those,
um,

922
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,630
like competitor magazines that you see 
in like running shoe stores or whatever,

923
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,290
like running shoe reviews or whatever.
Just laying around.

924
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,790
And I picked it up and started looking 
at it.

925
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,960
And there was an article about this dude
named,

926
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,290
uh,
David Goggins,

927
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,760
who is this bad ass navy seal guy.
Like guy had been like a football player

928
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,340
and a power lifter.
Like big strapping guy.

929
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:53,370
I think he was up.
He had weighed like 275 pounds at one 

930
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,560
point and had seen some shit,
you know,

931
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:56,200
as a,
as a navy seal.

932
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,480
And had lost a lot of friends in 
inaction.

933
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,200
And he decided that he was going to go.
He was going to find the 10 most 

934
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,330
difficult endurance races in the world 
and do them all to raise money for.

935
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,670
It wasn't the wounded warriors 
foundation,

936
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:10,950
but it was something like that,
like a,

937
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,800
like a,
you know,

938
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,940
so that he could raise money for the 
families of these,

939
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,420
these friends of his that had fallen and
he had.

940
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,690
He had just done this race called 
Badwater,

941
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:25,050
which is 135 mile run through death 
valley that goes up like Mount Whitney 

942
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,730
at the end like this and it's like crazy
hot,

943
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:31,210
like 110,
120 degrees out in the desert and he had

944
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:36,211
just done really well in that and he had
never really done much endurance sports 

945
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:40,901
before that.
Like you literally had fallen into it 

946
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:41,120
and he had just put in an incredible 
performance.

947
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,450
And then like a month later he did this 
race called ultra man,

948
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,320
which is this insane double ironman 
distance race in Hawaii where over the 

949
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:54,590
course of three days you circumnavigate 
the entire big island of Hawaii,

950
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,320
which is like a big island.
It's like the size of Connecticut.

951
00:41:57,321 --> 00:42:02,321
Right?
So I was reading about this and it just 

952
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:03,860
seemed like such a cool event.
Like it.

953
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,090
Not only was it longer than iron man,
which I didn't think was possible.

954
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,990
Um,
it was a broken up into stages.

955
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:17,050
So the first day is six point two mile 
ocean swim followed by a 90 mile bike 

956
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,570
and the last part,
the last 20 miles of that bike,

957
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,750
you go up to volcano national park.
So it's like a 40,000

958
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:28,751
foot gain and the second day you ride 
170 miles around the eastern side of the

959
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:34,091
island,
like up through Hilo and you end up in 

960
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:34,091
this little town called Havi.

961
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:37,520
On the third day you run 52 point four 
miles,

962
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,120
double marathon from Havi back into Kona
where the race started.

963
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,090
And I was like,
what is this?

964
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,130
And it was cool because they limited it 
to just 35,

965
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:53,180
like invitation only competitors like 
you had to apply to get into this race.

966
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,630
They don't close any of the roads and it
was almost like this family affair.

967
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:00,470
We have to bring your own crew and they 
kind of take care of you.

968
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:05,471
And feed you out of a van while you're 
doing this race and the crews kind of 

969
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,010
help each other out and the competitors 
help each other out.

970
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:08,000
So it's a race,
but it,

971
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,660
it seemed almost like this crazy 
spiritual odyssey,

972
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,320
you know,
like this experiment in expansion,

973
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,700
you know,
much more than a race.

974
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,800
And I was like,
that was what I was looking for,

975
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,840
you know,
it wasn't like I was looking for a race 

976
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,801
to go see how fast I could go or how 
many guys I could be like it resonated 

977
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,560
with me because it seemed more like an 
opportunity to learn more about myself 

978
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,090
in a way that was unique.

979
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,150
You know what I mean?
Like it was a like this crazy down the 

980
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,120
rabbit hole,
like spiritual adventure.

981
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,920
And so it just captivated me and I,
I was like,

982
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,110
it was one of those things where,
you know,

983
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:51,200
when you come across something and 
something just clicks inside you and you

984
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:56,201
know,
like that's the direction you're 

985
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:56,201
supposed to go in or you're on the right
path.

986
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:56,201
Or,
you know,

987
00:43:56,201 --> 00:44:00,580
maybe you've had that in stand up or at 
some point in your life where you just 

988
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,370
feel like you're directed in a certain 
way,

989
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,060
you know,
where everything just kind of seems in 

990
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,060
alignment.
It was like,

991
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,370
I just knew I wasn't going to do that 
race.

992
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:12,371
Like I just,
I didn't know how and I hadn't done 

993
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:13,700
anything of note to Merritt getting into
it or anything like that.

994
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:16,160
But I was like,
I'm going to find a way to do that.

995
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,590
Like I've got to do that and I couldn't 
stop thinking about it.

996
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,650
And I ended up calling up the,
a race director and it was some months 

997
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:27,860
before you could even send in your 
application because I was like,

998
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:31,560
I couldn't stop thinking about it and I 
needed to like just if she going to tell

999
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:35,070
me like there's no way I was getting in,
then I could at least put that to bed.

1000
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,880
So I just call her up and said,
you know,

1001
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,860
I read about this race and I can't stop 
thinking about it and I'd really like to

1002
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:41,430
do it,
but,

1003
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:42,870
you know,
maybe I'm crazy because,

1004
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,900
you know,
I don't know why I'm even calling you 

1005
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:47,900
because I haven't really done very much.
Um,

1006
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:48,570
you know,
and she said,

1007
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,610
well,
what have you done?

1008
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:52,080
And I was like,
done anything barely,

1009
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,770
barely,
you know,

1010
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm just getting back into being fit 
again.

1011
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,330
And she had every reason to just say,
well,

1012
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:02,331
you know,
why don't you call me in a couple of 

1013
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:02,331
years and,
you know,

1014
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:02,331
we'll see what you've done that and 
maybe I'll let you into this race.

1015
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:03,330
But she was like,
well,

1016
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,050
listen,
you know,

1017
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,110
it means a lot that you called early and
uh,

1018
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:12,350
why don't you just touch base with me in
a couple of months and we'll evaluate 

1019
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,351
your training and we'll go from there.
So she kinda like left the cracking the 

1020
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:15,351
door open,
you know?

1021
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,240
So it was enough to like give me a 
little bit of hope.

1022
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,390
Like the pilot light was lit a little 
bit and I was like,

1023
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,040
I'm going to get into that race,
you know,

1024
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:24,510
I'm going to find a way to get into that
race.

1025
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:27,150
And I hired a coach and I started 
training as if I was already in.

1026
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,420
This was back in early 2008 and uh,
I mean it's a long story,

1027
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:37,761
but ultimately she ended up relenting 
and letting me in and I ended up doing 

1028
00:45:37,761 --> 00:45:39,810
that race in 2008 and I hadn't done an 
ironman before that.

1029
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:43,530
I tried to do a half ironman the year 
before and I didn't even finish.

1030
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,760
So,
you know,

1031
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,760
I wasn't going in with some crazy like 
endurance pedigree.

1032
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,260
So it was,
it was,

1033
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,080
it was a cool experience though.
And I ended up doing pretty well in that

1034
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:52,470
race.

1035
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,490
How well did you do?
I got 11th that year.

1036
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,460
Wow.
That's amazing.

1037
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,740
It's crazy.
You couldn't finish and then a year 

1038
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,630
later you get 11th,
11th in 2008.

1039
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,360
And then [inaudible] at that time really
like,

1040
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,810
we were like,
yeah,

1041
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,080
bad news bears.
Like I had no idea what I was doing.

1042
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:13,081
Like my dad came out to like help me 
crew and a couple buddies from out here 

1043
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:15,610
and none of us knew anything about 
anything and I just wanted to finish,

1044
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,620
you know,
and I just wanted to like not die.

1045
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,650
So I,
I approached it like very 

1046
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,241
conservatively,
but I ended up exceeding my 

1047
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:27,541
expectations.
So I thought I wonder what would happen 

1048
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,110
if I spent a year like preparing to go 
back and actually race it,

1049
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,190
you know,
rather than just trying to finish and 

1050
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:36,481
kind of being timid about it.
So for 2009 I trained my ass off and I 

1051
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:41,320
went back and uh,
and I ended up getting out.

1052
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:46,321
I got out of the swim with a 10 minute 
lead on the next guy and then I held 

1053
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:48,790
that lead for the rest of that day 
through that 90 mile bike.

1054
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:51,020
So I finished the first day with a 10 
minute lead on,

1055
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,790
on the field.

1056
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:52,920
Ten minutes?
Yeah.

1057
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,710
Hugely going into detail.
But that was a race car though.

1058
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,310
Ridiculous.
He must have thought I was crazy because

1059
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,560
I didn't see anyone else all day,
you know,

1060
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:03,850
like as I was out in front

1061
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,420
and uh,
my wife and my kids were crewing me 

1062
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,781
actually,
so I was having to kind of like tell 

1063
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,301
them what to do.
And they were great but it wasn't like 

1064
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:15,301
they had experienced

1065
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,120
anything like this,
which made me very nervous.

1066
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,770
So what is a crew person that I do well 
there in,

1067
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,180
each competitor has to bring a van and 
that van is filled with like all your 

1068
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,711
shit man.
So you gotta have all your food that 

1069
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:28,711
you're gonna eat,
like while you're racing and then,

1070
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,060
and then afterwards,
you

1071
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,160
know,
ice for ice baths afterwards and they're

1072
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:35,400
filling your bottles and feeding them,
feeding,

1073
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,590
bu they kind of leapfrog you in park and
then you do bottle handoff.

1074
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,560
So you always have nutrition on the bike
and uh,

1075
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:43,450
and they keep you,
make sure you don't take any wrong.

1076
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:48,451
Turns like they,
they're in charge of navigating and 

1077
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:48,451
just,
you know,

1078
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:49,360
and if you have anything mechanically 
goes wrong with your bike or whatever,

1079
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,830
extra parts.
So,

1080
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:53,410
and it's filled with all your clothes 
because you're going around the island,

1081
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,780
you're not going back to where you 
started that day.

1082
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,520
You're going to stay in a different 
place each night,

1083
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,500
so you have to have all your stuff with 
you.

1084
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,040
So these vans are like packed from 
Florida ceiling with stuff.

1085
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Wow.
I would've never thought that much 

1086
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,460
involved in racing.
Yeah.

1087
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,460
Logistically it's very,
it's,

1088
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,070
it's,
it's,

1089
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,830
there's a lot that goes into it to pull 
it off and everything.

1090
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,980
Now is there,
does everybody know how to apply 

1091
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,330
nutrition to these races?
Is it like a consensus or do some people

1092
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:24,331
try to do them without eating?
There's no way you can do it without 

1093
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:24,331
eating.
I mean you got along the way.

1094
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:28,920
You got to be taking in.
I mean the consensus is you got to take 

1095
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,501
in about two to 300 calories an hour and
everybody's stomachs different and the 

1096
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:36,601
intensity with which you're,
you're going will depend upon how well 

1097
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:40,741
you can digest the food.
Like if you're on the rivet and going 

1098
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:43,681
hard,
it's gonna be harder to digest calories 

1099
00:48:43,681 --> 00:48:45,880
and the kind of calories become more 
important because you can't,

1100
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,280
you're not gonna be able to eat solid 
food if you're hammering,

1101
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,600
you know what I mean?
What do you,

1102
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:51,490
what do you eat,
do eat fruits.

1103
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,570
So I eat what I eat is probably 
different than,

1104
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,320
than certain other.

1105
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,120
Everybody has their own thing.
Um,

1106
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:04,020
I like to stay away from the shirt,
like a lot of endurance athletes run or 

1107
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,020
whatever,
you know,

1108
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,860
usually kind of Gatorade,
econ of stuff like cytomax and the,

1109
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,250
that kind of stuff,
that real high sugar stuff.

1110
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,640
But when you're going all day,
like you're going to be out on a 

1111
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,340
racecourse for eight or nine hours and 
then you've got to do it the next day.

1112
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,380
Your,
your system can't handle that.

1113
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:22,381
So I try to eat a more like a lower 
glycaemic higher carbohydrate,

1114
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,170
a fuel source.
So they have this stuff called par carbo

1115
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:30,430
pro or something called perpetuum.
They're like Maltodextrin powders.

1116
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:35,730
So it's,
it's a like a low-glycemic kind of 

1117
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:35,730
carpet,
complex carbohydrate fuel source.

1118
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,860
And you can put like 900 calories in one
bottle and you can kind of sip off that.

1119
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,670
It's like pancake batter,
taste terrible.

1120
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,650
But I'll eat,
I'll eat bananas.

1121
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,680
I'll put like a lightly baked.
Yams are good.

1122
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,310
Dates are good.
And then how come only lightly baked.

1123
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,510
Um,
because if they're overcooked that like 

1124
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:56,510
fries,
a lot of the nutrition out of them.

1125
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,530
But you want a soft enough like there's,
they're almost like you can squeeze them

1126
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:04,531
into your mouth,
are easy to digest when you're riding a 

1127
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:04,531
bike,
you know?

1128
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:04,531
And they have most of the nutrition in 
them.

1129
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,040
Yeah.
They're great for nutrition.

1130
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah.
Sorry,

1131
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,970
what is it the kills in determining if 
it breaks down the tissue like that?

1132
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:12,940
How come it doesn't kill the nutrition 
of it makes it all soft and mushy?

1133
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,210
Well you just don't.
If you,

1134
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:19,230
if you,
if you like completely fry it and 

1135
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:19,360
overcook it,
then it becomes like a dead thing.

1136
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,650
Right?
Do they know exactly what temperature it

1137
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,420
down?
Yeah,

1138
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:27,890
I mean somebody probably does so don't.
I've always wondered about like cooking,

1139
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:28,070
like

1140
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,450
killing vitamins,
like at when,

1141
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:31,790
like they say if you lightly sauteed,
you're okay.

1142
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:33,200
Like,
are you sure you know?

1143
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,760
At what level does it,
is it really that bad to eat them raw 

1144
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,740
that we have to fucking jazz everything 
up with,

1145
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,130
with fire and hot metal?
Yeah,

1146
00:50:42,131 --> 00:50:42,970
I know.
Well,

1147
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,630
we're the only animals that cook our 
food,

1148
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:47,230
right?
We're also the only animals with tvs are

1149
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,240
the only animals that drive cars were 
the only owls that talk to each other.

1150
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,510
Disagree with how good shit tastes when 
you cook it.

1151
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,040
We talked to each other dude,
fucking shit.

1152
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:06,041
Taste good.
When he could have hit that is the 

1153
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:06,041
problem.
It does taste better.

1154
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:06,041
Like,
like um,

1155
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:10,510
you know,
there's even vegetable dishes that are 

1156
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:10,510
absolutely delicious because they're 
cooked,

1157
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,620
you know,
but that's just not as good for your 

1158
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:14,620
body.
Well,

1159
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:19,241
I don't know.
It seems like there's differing schools 

1160
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:19,241
of thought on that.

1161
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:19,460
I mean,
I think that,

1162
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,620
you know,
you have the really hardcore raw is they

1163
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:23,930
would just eat everything raw and 
certainly I think it's,

1164
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,110
it's,
it's great to eat lots of raw foods.

1165
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,070
You know what I mean,
like the raw foods you put in your,

1166
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:30,710
in your vitamix or whatever,
and I eat a lot of raw foods,

1167
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,420
but I still eat cooked foods,
you know,

1168
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:34,710
I got,
I got to have me a little cook food just

1169
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,950
for the,
like the feeling of it.

1170
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:37,970
Right.
Comfort food.

1171
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,880
No.
Do you eat pastas at all?

1172
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,570
I'll eat brown rice.
Pasta,

1173
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,000
like the gluten free kind.
The cql u of M is eat Kale.

1174
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,760
Zucchini bread too.
Yeah.

1175
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1176
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,730
I mean I try not to overdo it on the 
pasta.

1177
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,140
I'm usually have more like brown rice 
stuff instead.

1178
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,250
Brown rice,
steamed veggies,

1179
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:02,000
sauteed and top it off with the Coca 
Cola or perhaps a Pepsi Cola.

1180
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,740
Red Bull.
Red Bull.

1181
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,010
Do you take any caffeine?
What do,

1182
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,000
what are you thoughts on that?

1183
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,920
I've gone back and forth on caffeine.
I've,

1184
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,180
I've gone periods without it and then 
I've used it as well.

1185
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,830
Um,
I think that,

1186
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:16,930
uh,
you know,

1187
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,940
when you're using it compulsively and 
addictively it's not a good thing and 

1188
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,940
fries your adrenals and makes you tired 
ultimately.

1189
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:28,240
Um,
I think a cup of coffee in the morning 

1190
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:28,240
is not the worst thing is particularly 
for an athlete.

1191
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,320
I mean it's definitely a performance 
enhancer,

1192
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,540
like if I'm going out for a long bike 
ride,

1193
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:38,020
you know,
a nice little strong cup of coffee 

1194
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,901
before my ride.
Definitely I can definitely feel the 

1195
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:40,901
difference.
But yeah,

1196
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:40,901
I think it,
you know,

1197
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:42,920
you can't be just hammering coffee all 
day long.

1198
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:48,230
I like a Nice Cup of coffee before a 
podcast and a Nice Cup of coffee before 

1199
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,790
Jujitsu,
like to get a little bit.

1200
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,650
It's really a crutch.
It is,

1201
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,710
it is this week,
but I've gone periods when I,

1202
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,400
when I don't drink coffee at all and I 
feel fine and you know,

1203
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:00,680
mental lapse back into drinking it from 
time to time.

1204
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,700
Well I,
uh,

1205
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,340
during periods of heavy writing,
uh,

1206
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:07,220
I will drink a lot of fucking coughing 
and uh,

1207
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,990
I had one day where I was working on 
this,

1208
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,050
this piece and I was up til like 5:00
in the morning just just wired with 

1209
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:21,311
coffee and then the next day I tried no 
coffee and boy was that a trip?

1210
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,200
Like I had a headache all day,
like my body was like,

1211
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,130
dude,
let's just a cup of coffee.

1212
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:29,940
Let's just feed the demon.
The demon given a little.

1213
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:31,480
It's like I was like,
I got to be careful.

1214
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:33,730
Like this is how you get addicted to 
powerful drug.

1215
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,900
And I was setting,
I was setting the stage for addiction.

1216
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,600
I was like also I had a headache.
Like I didn't,

1217
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,720
I didn't want to not have the caffeine,
you know,

1218
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:47,950
so just was taking too much and it was 
over a course of a few days where I was 

1219
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,780
like really hitting it hard writing.
You have to be careful because fucking I

1220
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:53,430
had headaches,
I had withdrawals,

1221
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,990
but I found that a really strenuous 
exercise.

1222
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,310
Like if I have anything wrong with me,
if I have a jet lag,

1223
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,460
if I'm a little out of it from landing 
somewhere and I can't shake the cobwebs 

1224
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,100
loose,
just really intense,

1225
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,290
strenuous exercise just seems to reset 
the whole thing.

1226
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,560
Snaps.
You wrote back snaps you right back.

1227
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:18,561
I really,
I really feel bad for people who don't 

1228
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:19,710
exercise,
who tried to travel a lot because I hear

1229
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:23,220
people tell me that they're fucked up 
for like two weeks and they're like,

1230
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,840
that's crazy.
I've been traveling

1231
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,690
a lot lately and that's the only thing 
I,

1232
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,060
I don't sleep great.
And hotel rooms and just,

1233
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,060
you know,
that first night in a new environment or

1234
00:54:31,061 --> 00:54:33,280
whatever,
it's always a little off and you know,

1235
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:36,450
the first thing when I get there just 
I've got to work out or whatever.

1236
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,350
It's,
it's exactly what it is.

1237
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:40,360
You got to wipe the slate clean and then
it just,

1238
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,050
it really helps with the jet lag and the
sleep and acclimating and everything.

1239
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,560
Yeah.
It's.

1240
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,830
And it's one of those things we just got
to start it,

1241
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,950
just get it going and then once you get 
it going,

1242
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,920
it's sort of takes care of itself and 
you're in the middle of it.

1243
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:55,921
It feels great,
but it's like that first step of doing 

1244
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:56,710
that first squat during that first 
anything.

1245
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,160
It's like,
oh,

1246
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,310
come on now,
but if you can overcome that,

1247
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:05,311
it gives you that feeling like,
like lately I've got a lot of shit done 

1248
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:07,660
that I wanted to get done and I got this
great feeling because of that,

1249
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:09,610
you know,
it's got a lot like momentum,

1250
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:14,611
you know,
whenever I feel like that I'm 

1251
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:14,740
accomplishing things that I wanted to do
and you know,

1252
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:15,640
do like a I,
you know,

1253
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,190
I set out to do x today and I got it all
done.

1254
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,090
It's like,
yes.

1255
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:24,310
I'm like,
the next day I feel like a little more 

1256
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:24,310
charged up.
I feel like I've gotten,

1257
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:25,330
well look,
I'm doing what I'm trying to get done.

1258
00:55:25,331 --> 00:55:26,980
I'm getting it done.
I'm feeling great about it.

1259
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,850
And a lot of people I think don't have 
that.

1260
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,580
They don't build that momentum enough in
their life.

1261
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,500
They don't know.
Pick a few goals,

1262
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:37,600
lock onto them,
go with it,

1263
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,850
and then let it build up to something 
else.

1264
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:42,130
Let it build up to more,
let it build up to the next thing.

1265
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,620
And also I think that there's this weird
thing

1266
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,630
equation with exercise because it's so 
easy to say you don't have time or busy 

1267
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:50,750
or whatever and you know,
I go through that a lot and,

1268
00:55:50,751 --> 00:55:54,050
and,
and it's easy to justify not doing it,

1269
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,670
but ultimately when I just quiet that 
thought and do it anyway,

1270
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:03,910
I ended up getting more done and 
everything that I needed to get done 

1271
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
ends up getting done.
And if I don't do it,

1272
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,520
I ended up wasting time and I'm less 
productive and I'm not thinking clearly.

1273
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:10,340
And there's a lot of like down wasted 
time.

1274
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,120
I think everybody has a different sort 
of biology and uh,

1275
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,990
I know,
I know this for sure.

1276
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:20,830
People have different needs so I don't 
say that everybody needs it,

1277
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,870
you know,
I mean I think it benefits,

1278
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,970
but I don't know that everybody needs 
it,

1279
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:27,400
but I certainly know that I need it when
I don't have it.

1280
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,950
It makes a big difference.
I don't like the way I feel.

1281
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:35,370
I don't like to.
I don't like getting annoyed at things 

1282
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,201
too easily.
I don't like this weird testosterone 

1283
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:38,530
buildup that happens after a few days of
not exploding on something,

1284
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,820
you know,
it's like my body's become most 

1285
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,871
certainly addicted to that release and 
it knows that it can navigate social 

1286
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:50,791
water's better when it's just totally 
drained of all the Monkey Dna,

1287
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,230
you know,
if I don't get that out at the gym,

1288
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,100
I don't feel like I'm as nice a person.

1289
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,100
I don't feel like I'm as balanced.
My wife will just kick me out of the 

1290
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,451
house.
He needed to go ride your bike or do 

1291
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:03,451
something.
Don't come back until you do.

1292
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,970
I have a,
a crazy gym in my house.

1293
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:11,971
It's in the garage.
Like half of the garage was done for a 

1294
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:12,770
company called Garage Mahal.
Wow.

1295
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,010
So my garage has set up.
It's got mats.

1296
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,050
I've got a grappling dummy that I 
strangle.

1297
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:22,100
I like to Jujitsu on a dummy and I have 
a kickboxing bags and ropes to climb so 

1298
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,220
I never have to go anywhere.
It's always right there.

1299
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:29,221
So there.
That cuts out a lot of the fucking 

1300
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:30,430
bullshit and procrastination with a 20 
minute ride to the gym.

1301
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:35,431
And then I only have 40 minutes to work 
out because if I just took a nap right 

1302
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:36,790
now,
maybe I would perform better tonight and

1303
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,130
they can just do some working out at 
home tonight.

1304
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,350
I haven't been in my house.
For me,

1305
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:43,570
it's huge.
The ability to just go outside.

1306
00:57:43,571 --> 00:57:46,090
And even when I was broke,
I always had a heavy bag,

1307
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,120
you know,
tied something to the rafters in the 

1308
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,120
garage.
You know,

1309
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,990
having something like that is to me 
having just a place where you can lease,

1310
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,020
release it's some way.
Know,

1311
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:02,070
get that fucking blow out in some way.
So important for maximizing sanity.

1312
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,330
I need it.
I don't know.

1313
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:05,890
Some people,
some people don't need it.

1314
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,740
I just sneezed a lot.
Yeah,

1315
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,130
Brian's fine without it.
I'm telling you,

1316
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:14,380
it's not even an angry guy.
Um,

1317
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:15,250
I think,
uh,

1318
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,500
it's,
it's a,

1319
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,390
it's a great benefit to everybody.
People can get through life without that

1320
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:20,860
benefit,
but just silly,

1321
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,420
silly to do it.
That's what I tell him.

1322
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,500
I'm like,
you're silly.

1323
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:29,010
He got,
he got really skinny at one point in 

1324
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,781
time though.
Brian was like way fat at one point in 

1325
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:33,661
time and then he went crazy 
weightwatchers and he shrunk down to 

1326
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:36,190
like a tiny man.
Strange.

1327
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,610
Yeah.
Where are you at now?

1328
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:43,260
Uh,
I'm about halfway back to what I used 

1329
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,380
to,
but now it's more just a.

1330
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,680
I eat barely little,
like I eat only at like nine or 10:00

1331
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:55,021
at night until I go to bed.
But it's not like I eat crazy bad.

1332
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,300
It's more like I'll go home and eat lean
pockets in a salad or something and they

1333
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:05,290
don't eat until nine at night.
You literally known any food all day and

1334
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,240
it's mostly because of starbucks.

1335
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,150
That's double shot.
He gets Trenta double shots,

1336
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,050
which is basically cancer.
It's just cancer in a liquid form.

1337
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,310
Go

1338
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,630
all day,
all day.

1339
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,020
And then you hit the lean pockets at and
it

1340
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,440
out.
Yeah.

1341
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,140
It's fucking super good for you.
You're on the right track.

1342
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:30,800
So here's a,
here's a,

1343
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,660
here's a video of me,
uh,

1344
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,190
when you were super skinny,
super skinny,

1345
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,060
you got really what,
what is the lightest you got?

1346
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:39,590
You got below one 70,
right?

1347
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:48,450
You don't think this mother fucker 
doesn't want to hear about Rick Rolling 

1348
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,420
when you name is rich roll.
How annoying is that everyday,

1349
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,850
man.
So fucking day.

1350
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,950
That's so rude.
And it came out of nowhere too.

1351
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:57,920
You lived most of your life without a,
without a rick roll.

1352
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,830
And then all the sudden this one fucking
song.

1353
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,830
The Internet is so bizarre.
The Bane of my existence,

1354
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:04,640
you know,
it's funny too.

1355
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:05,510
There's a,
uh,

1356
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,940
you know,
this rapper Nipsey Hussle,

1357
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,230
Nipsey Hussle and he has a song called 
rich roll,

1358
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,220
right?
So it's,

1359
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,160
so,
it's,

1360
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:18,500
it's all about the rich roll and the.
And so my twitter feed fills up with all

1361
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:23,501
this crazy insanity from people re 
tweeting the song that I guess it's a 

1362
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:23,501
pretty popular song.

1363
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:24,930
And so I have to do,
you know,

1364
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,460
like I'm getting confused with this guy.
You should embrace it.

1365
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,970
You should go like the opposite of what 
Rick Ross did.

1366
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,810
You should do a music video,
you should claim the real rich roll son,

1367
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,180
right?
You know,

1368
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,660
and then maybe you can like hip hop 
people into being vegans.

1369
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,390
It's so close to being to,
to Rick Ross too,

1370
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,270
so it's all confused.
It is,

1371
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:46,910
right?
You know,

1372
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,320
it's right there.
It's right next door.

1373
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:50,810
Neighbors just by a lot of trench coats 
or you'll be good.

1374
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:51,680
Do you,
um,

1375
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,990
fuck around with probiotics,
do you?

1376
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:54,730
Um,
yeah,

1377
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:55,940
a little bit.
Yeah.

1378
01:00:55,941 --> 01:01:00,941
Yeah.
There's some pretty good like plant 

1379
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:00,941
based ones.
I have this,

1380
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:04,730
a nutrition guru,
my buddy compton rom,

1381
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,220
he's got a name,
his name is Compton Rom.

1382
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:12,250
You should actually playing on,
he would make an incredible guest like 

1383
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,040
blow your mind.

1384
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,140
You can come watch videos of him on 
Youtube.

1385
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,530
You've talked about some crazy stuff 
like that.

1386
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,910
Just like the energy of food and he's 
super into like he said,

1387
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:26,911
he has a phd in microbiology and so he's
helped me a lot with like my nutrition 

1388
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,460
and spent a little bit of a mentor and 
he's got a startup company called 

1389
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:34,481
ascended health and he's all about 
trying to find the best superfoods all 

1390
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:37,460
over the world and provide them to uh,
to customers.

1391
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,750
And he's traveling all the time.
He's going to like Thailand,

1392
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:45,770
all these crazy places.
Trying to find places where he can grow 

1393
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:48,641
this stuff and so I would go to his 
house and his house look like in his 

1394
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:49,310
kitchen.
It looked like a,

1395
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:54,340
it looks like a giant meth labs.
It's got all these tubes everywhere and 

1396
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:54,340
all this crazy stuff.
He's like,

1397
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:54,380
oh,
you gotta try this.

1398
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,280
I just got this reservoir trollin from.
It's from the finest Bordeaux grapes,

1399
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,840
Scans.
Stuff's amazing.

1400
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,310
I'm gonna,
I'm going to make up A.

1401
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,750
I'm going to make some powder for you.
And he's,

1402
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,860
he's always trying to like help me with 
my like training and racing nutrition by

1403
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:11,180
giving me some of this crazy stuff.
And so his whole thing is,

1404
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:16,181
um,
he's super knowledgeable about 

1405
01:02:16,181 --> 01:02:17,470
probiotics and microbes because he 
studied microbes and like,

1406
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,930
um,
like the Gi tract microbial activity 

1407
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:23,790
forever and ever and knows more about it
than anyone I've ever met.

1408
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:29,280
And it's fascinating because I talk a 
little bit about this in my book too,

1409
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,600
that we think we're,
you know,

1410
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,660
we're made up of trillions of cells,
right?

1411
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:38,661
And we think we're these sentient beings
and we have control over what we think 

1412
01:02:38,661 --> 01:02:39,270
and our decisions.
And all of that,

1413
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,260
but at the same time we have to realize 
that we're,

1414
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,320
we have like 10 times the number of our 
cells and microbes in our gut alone,

1415
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,540
like our microbial ecology in our Gi 
tract has like,

1416
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,750
you know,
10 times the number of microorganisms 

1417
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,850
compared to all of our cells in our 
entire body and there's been these 

1418
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:05,211
studies that have come out and they're 
starting to come out where they're 

1419
01:03:05,211 --> 01:03:05,340
studying,
um,

1420
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:10,790
the extent to which your microbial 
ecology in your gut can trigger your 

1421
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:15,240
nervous system and actually impulse you 
in a decision making way.

1422
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:20,570
And they've discovered like links 
between what kind of microbial ecology 

1423
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:23,070
do you have in your gut and the and the 
foods that you crave.

1424
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,930
So yeah.
Yeah.

1425
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:25,470
And,
and,

1426
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:30,550
and so like having like probiotics are 
all about improving the health of your,

1427
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,280
your flora in your gut.
Right?

1428
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:37,650
And if you have healthy flora it,
it craves and feeds on healthy foods.

1429
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:42,651
Right?
But if you go to Jack in the box every 

1430
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:43,410
day or you eat lean pockets every night,
then you're going to have,

1431
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,010
you're gonna have like a different kind 
of microbial ecology,

1432
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:50,610
like the microbes that are in that food 
starts to propagate in your gut and that

1433
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:55,611
takes over and that becomes the ecology 
and they're realizing that that ecology 

1434
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:58,410
then sends signals to your brain that 
makes you crave more of those foods.

1435
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:01,050
So it's that craving cycle that I was 
talking about earlier.

1436
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,170
It's so easy and it sounds insane.
But then I was thinking about that.

1437
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,050
Um,
you saw,

1438
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,690
remember I'm the documentary super size 
me.

1439
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,950
Yes.
So,

1440
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,890
so Morgan spurlock,
when he first starts out,

1441
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,530
remember he's like getting sick when 
he's eating McDonald's.

1442
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:21,531
Like you can't handle it.
Like he barfs out the window one day 

1443
01:04:21,531 --> 01:04:21,930
when he's a couple of days in like 
cannot manage.

1444
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:24,240
He's like a can't imagine going back to 
Mcdonald's.

1445
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,240
He's only like three days in.
He's getting sick all the time.

1446
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:32,100
And then fast forward like a couple days
later and he wakes up with headaches and

1447
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:37,101
he's like creating the food and he and 
his headaches won't go away until he 

1448
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:41,301
goes to Mcdonald's.
So it's like you can make the argument 

1449
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:44,910
that that could be attributable to a 
change in his microbial ecology,

1450
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:50,060
you know,
like now he's replaced as healthy 

1451
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:50,060
because I think his wife or his 
girlfriend at the time,

1452
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:54,321
it was like a Vegan chef.
He was eating really clean and then he 

1453
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:57,171
just starts eating this Mcdonald's and 
he replaced is that microbial ecology 

1454
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:59,880
and his gut with the kind that feeds on 
Mcdonald's and suddenly it's creating it

1455
01:04:59,881 --> 01:04:59,960
all.

1456
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:05,190
Did you imagine if they found out that 
Mcdonald's actually had implanted 

1457
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,680
microbial biology,
that they,

1458
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:10,900
that they created in a lab that 
specifically makes you want their shitty

1459
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:15,901
cheeseburgers?
He just just fucking crave that 

1460
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:16,480
cheeseburger.
Oh,

1461
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,130
Mcdonald's that

1462
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:23,130
I.
I saw a thing online where it dude left 

1463
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,860
one out for six months and it never rot.
It saw that and I was like,

1464
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,110
check please.
That's it.

1465
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:31,170
I'm done no more.
It's only filet of fishes which are 

1466
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:34,321
nutritious and delicious.
And he let out that it was the burger 

1467
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,220
and the fries too.
Maybe even.

1468
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,980
I saw that though.
I don't think the fries rod either.

1469
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,690
It's fucking crazy.
It's a,

1470
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,470
it's not food.
It's like it's just filler.

1471
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:46,540
It's weird.
I mean it's like gut filler.

1472
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,720
I mean you can live on it for short 
periods of time.

1473
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,450
It's better than starving to death,
man.

1474
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:54,940
That stuff is fucking bad for you.
So

1475
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,290
calm and it's everywhere.
And his numbers from that movie,

1476
01:05:59,291 --> 01:06:01,660
like just after 30 days,
it's doctor was like,

1477
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,400
yeah,
this is bad.

1478
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:09,270
Crazy bat.
And it took him like a couple of years 

1479
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,550
to like lose the weight and get back to 
his baseline.

1480
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Did it really?
Yeah.

1481
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,520
I mean it said it took them a really 
long time.

1482
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:17,610
Well that sounds like he's a lazy bitch.
Lost weight curriculum a couple of 

1483
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:21,561
years.
But I think if it wasn't just his 

1484
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,131
weight,
it was like as cholesterol levels and 

1485
01:06:23,131 --> 01:06:23,131
all that kind of really.
Did he try to go Vegan after that?

1486
01:06:23,131 --> 01:06:25,240
Or heavy vegetable dye?
I don't know.

1487
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:30,241
I mean,
I know his girlfriend who was a Vegan 

1488
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:31,831
chef,
so I would imagine he returned to 

1489
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:31,831
something along that lines,
but I don't know.

1490
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:35,690
Well,
what do you think of when you hear guys 

1491
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:35,800
like Rob Wolf say eat bacon and eggs for
breakfast?

1492
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:41,220
Well,
I mean the first thing I would say is 

1493
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:41,220
that,
that,

1494
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:41,220
you know,
have a lot of respect for rob.

1495
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:41,710
I think rob,
great guy.

1496
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,400
Yeah.
And I love the interview and you know,

1497
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,320
Robin,
I have the same goal.

1498
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,330
You know what I mean?
Like we're both working towards the same

1499
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:52,780
thing which is trying to get people 
healthier and more fit.

1500
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:57,781
You know,
we differ on a couple subcategories of 

1501
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:57,781
that.
But like I think rob is,

1502
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,190
is doing good stuff.
I mean I,

1503
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:04,480
I definitely disagree when he says you 
should eat bacon and eggs for breakfast 

1504
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,340
and I think that,
you know,

1505
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,400
and I remember your reaction to that 
even you were like surprised that that 

1506
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:11,780
was,
that I'd never heard.

1507
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,320
I never heard.
I've never heard anyone say that myself.

1508
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,580
I've never heard anyone say that Kale 
shakes.

1509
01:07:16,581 --> 01:07:18,490
Like don't eat kale shakes.
You don't need.

1510
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,150
Right.
So,

1511
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:20,770
so

1512
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:24,550
a lot about Paleo that I think is 
fantastic,

1513
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:25,070
you know,
they,

1514
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:30,390
they issued dairy,
they shoe process foods and the oil that

1515
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,670
they say is okay.
Is Olive oil in moderation?

1516
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,130
Um,
you know,

1517
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,670
we disagree.
It's a very,

1518
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,180
like the idea is low carb,
right?

1519
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:45,160
Like it's low carb,
high protein and I think that that works

1520
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,640
really well for losing weight and maybe 
works for some people in terms of energy

1521
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:52,210
levels.
But my perspective on the whole thing is

1522
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,840
I'm coming from looking at the 
healthcare crisis in America where like 

1523
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,130
people are just keeling over with heart 
attacks constantly.

1524
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,410
You know what I mean?
Heart disease is rampant,

1525
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:07,560
you know,
and people are getting diabetes like 

1526
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:07,690
crazy and you know,
even children are getting diabetes.

1527
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:12,691
I mean when we were kids,
diabetes wasn't really a thing right 

1528
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:12,691
now.
Like diabetes is a huge thing.

1529
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:15,470
Like obesity and obesity figures are 
insane.

1530
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:16,250
Like 40 percent

1531
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:21,250
of Americans are going to be obese by 
2014 and childhood obesity rates are 

1532
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,970
crazy and school lunches are terrible.
And,

1533
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,060
and when I look at it like that,
like I think that,

1534
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,220
um,
you know,

1535
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:33,700
I can't get around the fact that when I 
read the studies on plant based 

1536
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:34,220
nutrition,
you know,

1537
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:39,221
when you read the China study or you 
read Dr Russell Austin's book prevent 

1538
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:44,501
and reverse heart disease,
there's a pretty clear correlation 

1539
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:45,680
between getting rid of the meat and 
dairy and eating a whole food,

1540
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:50,681
plant based diet and your ability to 
repair your body from these conditions 

1541
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:53,650
that are plaguing us unnecessarily.
I mean,

1542
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,550
heart disease,
a foodborne illness,

1543
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:57,800
you know,
you can not only prevent it,

1544
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,230
you can actually reverse it.
And this,

1545
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:00,580
this guy,
Dr Nelson,

1546
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,970
have you ever heard of this guy?
Yes.

1547
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:07,330
Okay.
So for maybe your listeners who don't 

1548
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:07,330
know,
he is a,

1549
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:07,430
he's a bad ass.

1550
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,400
First of all,
the guy was,

1551
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:13,530
he's Yale educated in these Olympic gold
medalist in rowing and like 1968 and I 

1552
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:15,050
think it was a,
I think he's uh,

1553
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,900
uh,
I think he was a Vietnam.

1554
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,160
Uh,
I think he's a Vietnam veteran also.

1555
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:22,430
I'm not sure about that.
But then he became a surgeon and he was,

1556
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:23,250
uh,
you know,

1557
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,160
the head surgeon at the Cleveland 
Clinic,

1558
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,920
which is if you have heart disease or 
heart problems,

1559
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,630
like that's where you want to go,
like those.

1560
01:09:29,631 --> 01:09:31,070
But Cleveland Clinic,
Cleveland Clinic,

1561
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:32,570
yeah.
Those ones you're feeling like shit,

1562
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,460
right.
Go to Cleveland.

1563
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:34,970
He's,
yeah.

1564
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,610
They know what's up there.
And like back in the seventies,

1565
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:40,440
he started to realize that when he 
treated his patients with,

1566
01:09:40,441 --> 01:09:42,260
uh,
with a plant based whole food diet,

1567
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:46,220
that they were able to reverse their 
heart disease without surgery.

1568
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:48,500
And He,
and he was starting to look at the,

1569
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,140
the um,
what are you?

1570
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,890
I'm having a brain fart.
The uh,

1571
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,770
what are those pictures of the heart 
called the angiograms.

1572
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,370
So you'd see these before and after 
angiograms and you could clearly see,

1573
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:03,730
you know,
the clogged arteries becoming clear 

1574
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:03,730
again and,
and,

1575
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,330
and it working.
And that was not a popular thing like in

1576
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:07,700
the 19 seventies,
in the 19 eighties.

1577
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,620
And you know,
to a large degree,

1578
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:11,220
it's still not popular,
but you know,

1579
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,420
it didn't make him a popular surgeon 
there because.

1580
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,820
Well,
because they make money off of surgery,

1581
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:21,940
you know,
and you're saying the putting that 

1582
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,401
information out that you can heal 
yourself through vegetables was not 

1583
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:25,220
popular because they literally wanted 
people to be sicker.

1584
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,290
It's not that they will make money,
it's not.

1585
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,250
It's not that they wanted people to be 
sicker,

1586
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,470
it's just that the system is set up,
you know,

1587
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,540
the way that you profit is by performing
expensive surgery.

1588
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:43,270
That is the way they profit,
but it's a big leap between that and 

1589
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,510
being upset at something that heals 
people.

1590
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:45,230
It's not,
it's not.

1591
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:47,510
I don't think that it was that they were
upset.

1592
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:52,690
It was that it was new and there wasn't 
enough evidence at that time to fully 

1593
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:56,660
substantiate what he was doing and they 
had their sort of,

1594
01:10:56,690 --> 01:11:01,690
this is what we do here and when 
somebody comes in and they're in this 

1595
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,691
condition,
we prescribe this procedure and he was 

1596
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:04,691
saying,
I don't want to do that.

1597
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:07,640
I want to do this like intensive diet 
thing with them and counsel them and see

1598
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,010
if I can avoid that.
And that was not.

1599
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:13,100
That was not a popular option.
Okay.

1600
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,980
That that makes

1601
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,120
more sense.
So the,

1602
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,290
uh,
essentially the,

1603
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:21,291
the doctors had a very specific path 
that they would follow when you had x 

1604
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:27,261
wrong with you and that that path 
usually lead to some sort of surgery and

1605
01:11:27,811 --> 01:11:29,850
he was trying to avoid that with 
festivals.

1606
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

1607
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,140
And I think that's still true today.
And we were talking about statens you go

1608
01:11:33,141 --> 01:11:36,260
in with high cholesterol or whatever 
your doctor is,

1609
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:39,260
most likely you're going to prescribe 
you statens he may say,

1610
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:44,530
you know,
change your diet or do this and then 

1611
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:44,530
you'll come back and,
and it doesn't change.

1612
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:44,600
And then he'll say,
well,

1613
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:47,900
it's genetic and you need to take this 
medicine when in fact,

1614
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:48,440
you know,
I,

1615
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,330
I,
I believe that it actually,

1616
01:11:50,331 --> 01:11:53,480
you can lower your cholesterol if you 
change your diet properly,

1617
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:58,481
but,
but the point getting back to Dr 

1618
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:58,481
Esselstyn is that,
you know,

1619
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,810
he was sort of blazing this trail a long
time ago back when,

1620
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,920
you know,
not too many people were listening and 

1621
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,241
it's taken many,
many years to kind of get traction with 

1622
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:07,241
this.
And it's taken,

1623
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:07,980
you know,
the China study and,

1624
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,880
and his book.
And the documentary forks over knives to

1625
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:15,881
get people sort of paying attention and 
listening now and now there's kind of 

1626
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:18,731
like an awareness that didn't exist 
before and that the scientific studies 

1627
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:21,510
are,
are pretty compelling that when you,

1628
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,600
you know,
you remove the animal proteins,

1629
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:28,601
you remove the processed foods and you 
remove the dairy that you can really 

1630
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:28,601
heal yourself.

1631
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:29,800
And so if you,
um,

1632
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,580
cut,
I mean it is what it has.

1633
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:34,070
Has it been proven that that is the 
order that works,

1634
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:37,880
hasn't been proven that if you cut out 
the dairy,

1635
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:43,270
cut out the processed food,
cut out the meat specifically on 

1636
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,360
vegetable live,
off of vegetables,

1637
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,790
vegetable nutrition,
that that is the only way to go.

1638
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:50,960
Or have they done vegetable nutrition 
and grass fed meat and natural meat?

1639
01:12:50,990 --> 01:12:52,550
Yeah.
There's plenty of studies out there.

1640
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:54,320
And what do they show?
What are the differences between

1641
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,400
that?
It's the,

1642
01:12:55,401 --> 01:12:58,050
the,
the actual animal protein is the,

1643
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:03,080
is the activator of have a lot of the 
congenital diseases really?

1644
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:03,900
Yeah.

1645
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,820
And what do they attribute that to?
Just even,

1646
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:10,630
uh,
even game or is it fatty meats

1647
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,820
even even game?
Well,

1648
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,900
certainly the saturated fat doesn't 
help,

1649
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:18,901
but there's something about the animal 
proteins themselves and in particular 

1650
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:18,901
the Casein,
which is the,

1651
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:22,040
the,
the protein in the dairy that,

1652
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,900
that proves problematic and what does it
do specifically to the human body?

1653
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:27,210
That's a good question.
I have,

1654
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:31,540
which I wish Dr Esselstyn was here to 
answer that are starting to get a little

1655
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,040
too technical.
I don't want,

1656
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,380
I don't want to speak out of school or 
say the wrong or or

1657
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:40,610
so.
What they found though essentially was 

1658
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:42,531
that a lot of ailments are started and 
in the activator for starting these 

1659
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:46,140
ailments and diseases is animals to see 
eat animals,

1660
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:51,350
you're going to get certain diseases 
that you would avoid if you just ate 

1661
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,350
vegetables.
Right?

1662
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,350
Right.

1663
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,490
And the China study originated around 
studying cultures where there really 

1664
01:13:55,131 --> 01:14:00,131
wasn't any animal products or animal 
proteins in their diet and looking at 

1665
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:02,210
the,
at the extent of cardiovascular disease.

1666
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,920
So there was a certain,
um,

1667
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:09,430
area in China where a,
it had a huge population of 260,000

1668
01:14:10,671 --> 01:14:11,890
people or something like that.

1669
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,830
The incidence of heart disease was 
almost zero.

1670
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,960
Wow,
that's crazy.

1671
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:22,110
And so here again,
this long epidemiological study where 

1672
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,020
they really took a hard look at it and 
it's interesting.

1673
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:23,650
It's really interesting.

1674
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,800
That's incredible.
The number zero,

1675
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:28,200
that's ridiculous.
I don't know if it was zero,

1676
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:29,760
but it was close as you're always very,
very,

1677
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,080
very low.
Do,

1678
01:14:31,081 --> 01:14:31,880
um,
that,

1679
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,420
that's incredible.
What,

1680
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:38,540
how do they make sure that they get the 
proper amount of protein and the proper 

1681
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,440
amount of amino acids.
But from what I understand,

1682
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:45,441
the real issue with the Vegan Diet is 
you have to be really diligent about 

1683
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:45,441
the,
uh,

1684
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:49,890
the proper proteins that you get because
I'm all the various pr,

1685
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,920
like even Broccoli has protein in it,
but it doesn't have like a complete 

1686
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:54,920
protein like,
like say meat does,

1687
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:58,740
but there's keenwah and hemp is a very 
complete protein.

1688
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,260
But how do you make sure that you get 
the right amount?

1689
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:06,750
Well,
I think there's a lot of misconceptions 

1690
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,091
about that and there's been a lot of 
sort of deepened king of the complete 

1691
01:15:09,091 --> 01:15:11,050
versus incomplete argument that gets 
pretty technical.

1692
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:14,320
But I think that if you're eating a well
rounded,

1693
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,090
balanced plant based diet with lots of 
different,

1694
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,380
you know,
if you're essentially,

1695
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,870
if you're eating grains,
legumes,

1696
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,520
fruits and vegetables and all the 
different colors and you know,

1697
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,370
you're rotating them through or 
whatever,

1698
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,030
then you're not going to have a problem.
It's almost like nature is rigged.

1699
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:36,031
It,
you're not going to have a protein 

1700
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:36,031
deficiency.
And you know,

1701
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:36,670
just speaking from my own experience 
with this,

1702
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:40,150
when I first started on the Vegan Diet,
you know,

1703
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:41,530
I was nervous about that.
I was scared about,

1704
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:45,100
especially as I was starting to train 
more and more and uh,

1705
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:49,330
my cabinet was full of all kinds of 
crazy supplements,

1706
01:15:49,331 --> 01:15:52,420
just tons.
And I was like just mounds and mounds of

1707
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:57,421
plant based proteins in my shakes 
because I was nervous that I was going 

1708
01:15:57,421 --> 01:16:01,961
to injure myself or you know,
it was going to get sick or something 

1709
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:04,861
like that.
And over the last couple of years I've 

1710
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:07,180
slowly started weaning myself off of a 
lot of that stuff where I use very,

1711
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:10,840
very little now.
And I haven't noticed a difference in my

1712
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:15,841
ability to one recover in between 
workouts or build lean muscle mass or 

1713
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:22,570
endurance.
And my endurance is continuing to 

1714
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:22,570
improve.
So I do use,

1715
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,110
you know,
I use hemp protein,

1716
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,700
I love him protein.
Um,

1717
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,360
I usually combine it with like pea 
protein or,

1718
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:29,440
or sprouted brown rice protein.

1719
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,830
Wait,
what protein?

1720
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:36,060
Protein.
I had some today in honor of this 

1721
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:36,060
podcast that's different from urine 
therapy.

1722
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:38,850
Yeah.
Ps,

1723
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,330
man,
it's very high in protein.

1724
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:43,220
So what is the fucking do it?
I don't know.

1725
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:48,260
I don't even do it every day.
Like I only do it when I'm training 

1726
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:48,260
really hard or I feel like,
you know what,

1727
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:48,260
I'm not gonna,
you know,

1728
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:53,180
I don't have any lines,
holes in the house or something like 

1729
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,981
that.
I'm always trying to source my proteins 

1730
01:16:54,981 --> 01:16:55,500
from whole foods.
So the misconception is that you gotta,

1731
01:16:55,501 --> 01:16:59,220
you gotta eat tons and tons of protein 
and you can only get,

1732
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,280
you know,
real good protein quality protein from 

1733
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,071
animal products.
Like I just don't believe that to be 

1734
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:07,071
true.

1735
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:09,500
You remember when that dude wasn't 
Travis Barker got into a,

1736
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:09,950
a

1737
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:15,160
plane crash.
And he got burned and he needed a 

1738
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:15,160
drummer.
Yes.

1739
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:15,360
He needed a,
um,

1740
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,950
a skin graft and when he had a skin 
graft,

1741
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,890
his body was not healing until he 
started eating meat again.

1742
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,530
And we started eating meat again.
It started healing rapidly.

1743
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:27,040
Interesting.
He said that was a,

1744
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,450
he was a vegan before that,
but he had to stop being a Vegan.

1745
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:34,451
I'm pretty sure.
I don't want to paraphrase this guy's 

1746
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:34,451
story,
but,

1747
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:35,350
uh,
I'm pretty sure that is a,

1748
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:40,480
how he said it.
Is there any possible benefit in your 

1749
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,000
eyes to eating animal protein for as far
as performance,

1750
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:49,120
physical performance as far as a mean 
even though it may be the catalyst to a,

1751
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:53,780
triggering certain ailments in certain 
individuals and that can be documented.

1752
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:56,320
Is it also possible that there's a 
benefit to it too?

1753
01:17:56,650 --> 01:17:59,390
And from a performance perspective?
Yes.

1754
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,670
It's certainly,
it's certainly possible.

1755
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:04,220
I don't know.
Especially in the fast twitch sports.

1756
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,330
Yeah.
I mean,

1757
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:10,331
you know,
what I do is so long it's a very 

1758
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:11,450
specific kind of sport that's very 
different from Jujitsu or sprint running

1759
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:16,480
or anything like that.
But there are plenty of athletes out 

1760
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:16,520
there in various disciplines that seem 
to be,

1761
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:18,170
that seemed to be doing well,
but,

1762
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:20,180
you know,
has there been a double blind,

1763
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:22,870
you know,
sort of case study on the difference.

1764
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,550
I don't know the answer to that.
Um,

1765
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:26,300
and I think that,
that,

1766
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,430
uh,
you know,

1767
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,170
for me,
it goes back to um,

1768
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,150
the reason that I started doing this to 
begin with,

1769
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:32,990
which was,
you know,

1770
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,240
really longterm wellness and,
and,

1771
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:40,290
you know,
not having a heart attack like heart 

1772
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,951
disease runs in my family.
My grandfather who was a champion 

1773
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:42,200
swimmer died of a heart attack in his 
early fifties.

1774
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:43,020
And,
you know,

1775
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:46,610
I have to constantly remind myself that 
that was what motivated me to do this,

1776
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,710
to begin with.
It wasn't performance reasons.

1777
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,360
Um,
at the same time,

1778
01:18:50,361 --> 01:18:55,361
if I felt like I was missing something,
like if I started to feel like I wasn't 

1779
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:57,620
recovering or it wasn't improving or I 
wasn't,

1780
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:01,250
I wasn't able to get stronger or I 
wasn't feeling good,

1781
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:06,340
I would,
I would certainly entertain the 

1782
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,901
possibility of eating,
of eating meat if I thought my health 

1783
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:11,111
was suffering.
But I just haven't had that experience 

1784
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:11,111
yet,
so,

1785
01:19:11,111 --> 01:19:11,111
you know,
I just try to stick to,

1786
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,610
you know,
I,

1787
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:15,410
I don't want to speak for anyone else or
whatever.

1788
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:15,740
So

1789
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:21,060
how do you feel about that idea that 
everybody's got a different sort of 

1790
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,310
nutritional requirement and that some 
people really shouldn't eat red meat and

1791
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:26,470
some people really should be 
vegetarians.

1792
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:27,750
It's like that.
It's uh,

1793
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:32,770
you know,
based on your blood or where your 

1794
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:35,101
families origins are geographically and 
that's the kind of genes that you're 

1795
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:35,101
carrying around.

1796
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:38,850
I Dunno,
I don't really buy into any of that.

1797
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,940
No,
no.

1798
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:46,740
But has there been evidence that 
different people that grow up in 

1799
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,280
different parts of the world have 
different nutritional requirements?

1800
01:19:48,281 --> 01:19:53,281
Like for instance,
people that live in like Eskimos are 

1801
01:19:53,281 --> 01:19:56,551
inuits,
they don't like to be called escalade 

1802
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:56,551
apparently.
Um,

1803
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:56,551
inuits,
they,

1804
01:19:56,551 --> 01:19:59,230
they have no issues as far as like 
scurvy or anything,

1805
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,030
but they're not getting any vitamin C 
than samples.

1806
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:02,370
I have

1807
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:05,040
like a,
they have a relatively high incidence of

1808
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:05,820
heart disease.
Oh,

1809
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:07,150
do they really do.
Yeah.

1810
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,020
Um,

1811
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,000
they,
um,

1812
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:12,180
I thought the whole deal I was,
is it cancer that they,

1813
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:14,130
the,
that you almost never see?

1814
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:16,560
Yeah.
And annually population.

1815
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,930
And they were attributing that to uh,
the uh,

1816
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,050
nutrition that they got from fish oil.
Do you,

1817
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:24,710
uh,
do substitute with any animal?

1818
01:20:24,711 --> 01:20:26,550
I'm like fish oil or anything like that.

1819
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:27,740
No,
I mean,

1820
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:30,250
you know,
I think getting your Omega threes is,

1821
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:31,850
is really important.
Um,

1822
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,160
you know,
fish oil is really popular with a lot of

1823
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:39,161
people,
but you can essentially do the same 

1824
01:20:39,161 --> 01:20:39,470
thing with flax seeds,
ground flax seeds.

1825
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,330
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't use flax oil,

1826
01:20:41,331 --> 01:20:44,300
but like ground flax seeds or something.
I put in a vitamix all the time.

1827
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,170
Why wouldn't choose the,
uh,

1828
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:48,920
actual oil?
The oil has been linked to.

1829
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:53,950
There's some evidence that suggests that
it's linked to incidents of prostate 

1830
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:54,890
cancer,
but for some reason the seeds aren't,

1831
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:57,620
took the seeds,
the seeds have like the case,

1832
01:20:57,621 --> 01:21:02,621
you know,
like they have that casing on them or 

1833
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:04,391
whatever.
So you have to grind them up because 

1834
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:04,391
otherwise they'll just pass right 
through you.

1835
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:07,380
So I'm a kind of like a vitamix.
Yeah.

1836
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:07,950
Yeah.
Or You can,

1837
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,260
you can buy them ground or you can put 
them in like a,

1838
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,500
a coffee grinder or like a cuisinart or 
something like that.

1839
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:18,710
What about hemp oil?
It's supposed to be pretty neutral oil 

1840
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:19,690
and all that stuff has the same benefits
as fish oil and.

1841
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:24,980
Well,
flax seeds are the closest from my 

1842
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,100
understanding.
Does it have the same benefits as far as

1843
01:21:26,101 --> 01:21:31,101
like a joint inflammation relief?
Because fish oil is incredible for,

1844
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:31,890
for that.

1845
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,840
I mean,
I think,

1846
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:36,050
I think it's important when it comes to 
joint relief and,

1847
01:21:36,051 --> 01:21:41,051
and looking at inflammation is looking 
at the acidic or alkaline nature of the 

1848
01:21:41,051 --> 01:21:41,720
foods that you're eating,
you know,

1849
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:42,980
and,
and,

1850
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:44,210
uh,
animal products,

1851
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:44,860
dairy,
dairy,

1852
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:48,140
meat tend to be very acid forming.
Like your body has a certain Ph,

1853
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:48,770
right?
It's trying to,

1854
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:51,890
it's trying to maintain that sort of Ph 
right in the middle.

1855
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,710
Um,
but you know,

1856
01:21:54,711 --> 01:21:59,711
the foods we eat and the toxins we 
breathe in the air and stress of our 

1857
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:00,900
lives or whatever can all put,
you know,

1858
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,890
try to push that one way or the other 
and that our body has to kind of go into

1859
01:22:03,891 --> 01:22:06,440
hyperdrive to bring it back to its 
normal state.

1860
01:22:06,441 --> 01:22:11,441
So the truth is,
is that most people that are eating a 

1861
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:12,740
standard American diet and you know,
living in North American way of life,

1862
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:18,070
um,
are eating a predominantly acidic acid 

1863
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:20,900
forming diet and they're in a state of 
what's called chronic acidosis.

1864
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:24,080
And that's a,
that's a state in which you know,

1865
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:29,150
you're constantly bombarding your body 
with a very asset based diet and your 

1866
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,050
body has to kind of go into hyperdrive 
to bring it,

1867
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:35,140
to bring it back.
And that's an environment where you 

1868
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:35,750
become very rife for getting injured,
for getting sick.

1869
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,070
And it's also,
you know,

1870
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:40,640
an environment that is,
makes you more prone to those congenital

1871
01:22:40,641 --> 01:22:43,400
diseases.
So when you're eating a more plant based

1872
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:44,150
diet,
those are,

1873
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:47,090
those tend to be not every plant food or
whatever,

1874
01:22:47,091 --> 01:22:49,240
but it tends,
it tends to be in balance,

1875
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:53,870
more alkaline forming and when you're,
when you're in a more alkaline state,

1876
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,880
you're not getting sick,
you're recovering more quickly because 

1877
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,950
inflammation is,
is sort of the root cause for a zillion 

1878
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:03,890
diseases and it's like the enemy of the 
athlete,

1879
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,170
right?
You're always trying to like,

1880
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:10,410
if you can reduce your inflammation,
your muscles are going to repair 

1881
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:13,111
themselves more quickly,
you're gonna be able to bounce back 

1882
01:23:13,111 --> 01:23:13,111
quicker,
you'll be able to train harder.

1883
01:23:13,111 --> 01:23:14,440
It doesn't necessarily make you a better
athlete,

1884
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,550
right?
You know,

1885
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:20,551
in a short period of time.
But protracted over the course of the 

1886
01:23:20,551 --> 01:23:23,011
season,
you're going to have a much more 

1887
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:24,451
efficient and effective training period.
And that's gonna result in performance 

1888
01:23:24,451 --> 01:23:25,480
gains in the long run.

1889
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:31,010
So you're essentially saying that all 
the benefits of taking fish oil,

1890
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:36,580
you could get those same benefits.
It would just changing your diet to a 

1891
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,220
vegetarian diet that you don't need fish
oil with respect

1892
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,170
fish oil.
I mean,

1893
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:42,410
the purpose of fish oil is to get those 
omega threes,

1894
01:23:42,411 --> 01:23:44,290
those essential fatty acids,
right?

1895
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,410
That are,
that are important.

1896
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:46,640
I mean,
you know,

1897
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,170
we,
you know,

1898
01:23:48,171 --> 01:23:51,740
there's a lot of talk about the fas and 
the Omega six and the Omega three and we

1899
01:23:51,741 --> 01:23:54,500
get plenty of Omega six and all the 
foods we eat or whatever,

1900
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:58,430
but the problem comes when the ratio of 
six to three is kind of off.

1901
01:23:58,431 --> 01:24:03,431
And most people don't get enough Omega 
three in their diets and fish oil is 

1902
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:05,070
great for kind of rectifying that,
but it's just the,

1903
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:10,200
you know,
my point is only that it's not the only 

1904
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:10,200
way of dealing with that.

1905
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,920
What are the other vegetarian options 
besides a hemp oil,

1906
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,050
flax seed

1907
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,490
oil and um,
uh,

1908
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,690
walnuts.
I believe there's some nuts that are,

1909
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,370
that are pretty high in how many do you 
have to eat?

1910
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:22,380
Hemp seeds?
Not that many.

1911
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:22,980
Really.
You don't,

1912
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,720
you don't need like a ton of this stuff

1913
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,280
with fish oil.
Um,

1914
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:31,450
I've been on like a really high fish oil
diet for a long time now.

1915
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:35,500
I'd take like five,
5,000,

1916
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,170
500 milligrams mill,
thousand milligram pill.

1917
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:40,150
I take five of those in the morning and 
five of those at night.

1918
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:45,630
And when I don't do it,
I noticed a difference in how my joints 

1919
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,110
feel like from doing a lot of Jujitsu,
especially

1920
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,250
I think interested in if you,
if you switched it up to um,

1921
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,400
ground flax seeds if you felt a 
difference or not.

1922
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,170
Yeah,
I would be willing to try it.

1923
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:57,960
But I always thought that it was like a,
almost like there was like lubricating.

1924
01:24:57,961 --> 01:25:02,961
It doesn't make sense really,
but that it was like deputy for doing 

1925
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:02,961
so.
Yeah,

1926
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:02,961
it doesn't make sense.
We'd be like,

1927
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:04,350
how much oil would you need to move up 
the fucking.

1928
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,800
And that's how I thought it in my head 
because there was such a correlation 

1929
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,611
between taking these pills and joint 
pain relief that I've found that a lot.

1930
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:19,730
I read a lot of great things about fish 
oil and studies on fish oil and there's 

1931
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,960
absolutely some nutritional benefit to 
taking it.

1932
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,680
I don't know why you wouldn't take it 
unless it was because of the fact that 

1933
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:27,680
you wanted to,
um,

1934
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,920
not have anything animal in your body,
like to just subscribe to.

1935
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:31,340
Well,
I think

1936
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,560
you,
you have to be careful with the toxins 

1937
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:36,560
that are in marine life too,
right?

1938
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,090
Well,
it's all filtered by Ebola,

1939
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,500
Carlson's fish oil,
that's all they,

1940
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:43,440
they test that stuff and it's all 
filtered out and there's nothing.

1941
01:25:43,441 --> 01:25:48,441
You don't have to worry about that.
And those are the very high end 

1942
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:48,441
companies.
They,

1943
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:48,441
um,
they,

1944
01:25:48,441 --> 01:25:51,420
they test all their stuff,
but I just don't see why there would be,

1945
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:56,480
um,
unless you were into it strictly from 

1946
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,870
the point of view of staying Vegan or 
introducing no animal into your body at 

1947
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:03,921
all.
It doesn't seem like there's any thing 

1948
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:03,921
that you lose from taking fish oil.
There's um,

1949
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:04,130
I mean,

1950
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:07,970
it's interesting because anytime you say
this food is good,

1951
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
then you can immediately go on the 
Internet and find some reason why shot 

1952
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,400
or something.
You can fall into any category that.

1953
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,150
And,
and uh,

1954
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:19,540
there are,
there are some studies out there that 

1955
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,221
show that,
that the fish oil thing is a little 

1956
01:26:21,221 --> 01:26:21,221
overhyped and you know,
I,

1957
01:26:21,221 --> 01:26:25,060
it's,
it's hard to quantify like who's right 

1958
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,060
and who's wrong and all that kind of 
stuff.

1959
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,060
Have you ever,
have you been to a,

1960
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,030
a,
um,

1961
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:29,210
there's a,
there's a guy named Dr Michael Greger.

1962
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,730
He's got a site called nutrition 
facts.org

1963
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,580
and it's amazing.
It's good.

1964
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:38,630
The guy has like a zillion,
he puts up videos like almost every day 

1965
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,921
and they're short.
They're like two to five minutes at Max 

1966
01:26:41,921 --> 01:26:43,880
and you can look at,
you can enter in any food or any disease

1967
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:48,881
or whatever and most likely as a short 
video on it and it's all based on peer 

1968
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:50,630
reviewed scientific studies or whatever.
But I always go to that one.

1969
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:52,390
I have a question about this food or 
that.

1970
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:53,810
It's a really good resource.

1971
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:59,570
I went to a nutrition for the first time
when I was like 17 and I was losing 

1972
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:04,491
weight for martial arts competitions and
those fucking my body up and I was 

1973
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:06,150
trying to figure out how to monitor my 
nutrition,

1974
01:27:06,151 --> 01:27:06,810
how to,
you know,

1975
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,940
ilene myself out in the healthiest way 
possible,

1976
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:11,490
but drop the most weight before I had to
dehydrate myself.

1977
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:17,360
But uh,
that was Nancy Clark who is pretty 

1978
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:17,360
famous for working with athletes.
She was in Boston at the time.

1979
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,550
She's got a bunch of books on that stuff
and I think she's worked with,

1980
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:25,580
uh,
other mma athletes to now this is way 

1981
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:25,580
after.
I mean,

1982
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,240
I,
I must've done it,

1983
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,770
did it with her and 85 or something like
that.

1984
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:34,100
But that's when I first became,
it was from martial arts competition 

1985
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,490
before I had to worry about my diet.
I didn't,

1986
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,260
I didn't watch what I ate at all.

1987
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:39,810
I just ate what I felt like eating.
Even when I was competing,

1988
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:44,820
I had no emphasis or focus on nutrition.
It wasn't until I got older that I do,

1989
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,580
I just through trial and error and you 
know,

1990
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:53,120
just going on a whim and saying,
you don't want this.

1991
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:58,220
I'm going to juice all day.
I'm just going to have beet juice and 

1992
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:58,220
carrot juice,
celery juice,

1993
01:27:58,220 --> 01:27:59,870
and I've done that a few times and you,
you,

1994
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,900
you get.
This is a weird kind of energy that you 

1995
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,530
get from that intense plant nutrition 
that you don't get from anything else.

1996
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:12,650
You really don't.
It's not the same feeling that you get 

1997
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:15,261
when you have the satisfaction of a fat 
rib eye and it's just perfectly cooked 

1998
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:16,720
and sliced into that medium.
Rare,

1999
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:21,570
so good.
It's not that satisfaction,

2000
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:26,780
but it is this weird sort of a vibrancy 
that you get like you're injecting.

2001
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:32,120
You're ingesting live live plants.
I mean essentially they've just died a 

2002
01:28:32,881 --> 01:28:37,881
short period of time ago.
They're still vibrant with energy and 

2003
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:42,170
you don't get that from anything 
processed and there's a lot of people 

2004
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:44,730
out there that are miserable,
that are depressed,

2005
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:49,760
that are.
And I have friends that shit fucking 

2006
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,151
diets and their.
Their way of dealing with is take 

2007
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:53,151
antidepressants and it's like there's 
no.

2008
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:54,480
You've got to know exercise.
Terrible sleep shit.

2009
01:28:54,481 --> 01:28:56,190
Di You feel terrible.
Take a pill.

2010
01:28:56,191 --> 01:28:57,420
You feel better.
Really.

2011
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,190
You've got to clean up all that other 
stuff,

2012
01:28:59,191 --> 01:29:04,191
man.
And then see how you feel if you have 

2013
01:29:04,191 --> 01:29:04,191
all these goddamn issues as far as your 
diet,

2014
01:29:04,191 --> 01:29:05,550
as far as your sleep,
as far as,

2015
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:08,640
you know,
stress levels get cleaned up.

2016
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:12,060
That shit first before you go take a gun
damn pill.

2017
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:13,850
I mean,
we're a nation of,

2018
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,780
of crazy people who are addicted to all 
these weird new,

2019
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:23,010
not natural non native chemicals that 
we're introducing into our body.

2020
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,150
And that would become addicted to it.
I mean,

2021
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,600
if we could just look,
if you could have a,

2022
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,270
a,
a,

2023
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:33,290
an overlay of the United States and 
who's on the influence of any sort of a 

2024
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,010
pharmaceutical drug right now.

2025
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,570
It's like the Matrix.
I mean,

2026
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:39,690
it really is.
And,

2027
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,450
and,
uh,

2028
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:45,500
you know,
not to spend too much of a new age 

2029
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:45,500
thing,
but you know,

2030
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:50,500
you're,
you're right at the food carries a 

2031
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,180
vibrancy and an energy to it.
It's very specific.

2032
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:56,280
And in my case,
I've been on this crazy amazing journey 

2033
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:00,441
that I would've never predicted and it 
honestly started with changing my diet 

2034
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:03,270
and so I look at it with like a respect 
and a reverence and I go,

2035
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:05,670
this is,
this is what catalyzed this path.

2036
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:09,300
And it opened me like,
it opened my heart to the possibility of

2037
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:12,840
living differently and to doing 
different things than I was doing.

2038
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,250
And Look,
you know,

2039
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:16,110
people are sicker than they've ever 
been.

2040
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:21,111
We're the,
we're such a prosperous nation and 

2041
01:30:21,111 --> 01:30:21,150
people are just overmedicated.
They're fat,

2042
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:24,590
they're unhealthy.
And for the most part they're people.

2043
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,530
You know,
there's the,

2044
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:30,590
what do you think the level of happiness
is now compared to what it was like 100 

2045
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:30,590
years ago?
Do you think we're happier?

2046
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:32,700
Do you think we're more unhappy?
Well,

2047
01:30:32,701 --> 01:30:35,700
I think obviously it's an individual's.
I'm happy as fuck.

2048
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,710
Yeah.
I mean,

2049
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,810
the thing is you're doing what you're 
meant to be doing.

2050
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:40,890
You know what I mean?
You're on,

2051
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,640
you're on a path that you know,
you've been blazing for a long time,

2052
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:45,360
but you're,
you know,

2053
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:48,060
you've made something happen that you're
passionate about.

2054
01:30:48,061 --> 01:30:52,170
But most people unfortunately don't live
that kind of life.

2055
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:57,550
That's true.
But I think they could live their own 

2056
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:57,550
version of it

2057
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:58,940
but,
but,

2058
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:03,970
but a lot of people don't.
And I know this because I was a 

2059
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:03,970
corporate lawyer.
I was miserable.

2060
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:08,341
I was doing the 80 hour weeks and I had 
done everything right my whole life 

2061
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:09,670
makes sense to do spine chill,
you know,

2062
01:31:09,671 --> 01:31:12,270
I studied hard,
I got into the good schools and I,

2063
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:13,930
you know,
I played the game,

2064
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,100
you know what I mean?
And I,

2065
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:18,970
and I got to the place that was supposed
to be the brass ring,

2066
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:20,170
you know,
and I was like,

2067
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:24,670
what the fuck?
I was like not happy and I felt lost and

2068
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:28,030
it's like a feeling of being in free 
fall and you have a choice,

2069
01:31:28,031 --> 01:31:29,350
you can,
you know,

2070
01:31:29,351 --> 01:31:31,720
I was making a decent amount of money.
So you know,

2071
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,700
a lot of people in that situation and 
they'll just,

2072
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:36,610
they'll just killed themselves with 
stuff they can't afford.

2073
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:37,600
Like,
well I'll,

2074
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,210
I'll lease that car.
That's a little bit out of my reach.

2075
01:31:40,211 --> 01:31:41,800
And rewarding.
Yeah,

2076
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:44,020
exactly.
Because when you're unhappy,

2077
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:45,890
you know,
you need something to solve that,

2078
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:50,940
that wound,
and then you do that long enough and 

2079
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,420
then you're stuck and you can't make a 
change or it becomes too difficult.

2080
01:31:52,421 --> 01:31:54,310
And you know,
I think it was,

2081
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:59,430
it was Henry David Thoreau that said,
the mass of men lead lives of quiet 

2082
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:00,100
desperation.
I think that's very,

2083
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,870
very true.
One of my favorite quotes ever.

2084
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,300
And it's,
it's sad,

2085
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:05,320
man.
It's sad.

2086
01:32:05,321 --> 01:32:07,000
And you know,
I look at you,

2087
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:09,130
you've built this thing here,
you're doing what you love.

2088
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,860
You spend your day last Brian below.
But I mean,

2089
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:12,940
you're,
you're like,

2090
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,350
you're,
you're like,

2091
01:32:14,351 --> 01:32:15,700
you know,
in your Juju.

2092
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:16,780
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2093
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,460
And most people,
most people aren't.

2094
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,780
I think that's okay.
So He's,

2095
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:20,760
he's,
he knows Jews.

2096
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:23,220
Yeah.
No,

2097
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,850
most people aren't.
But they could be,

2098
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:27,070
you know,
but I think one of those heart,

2099
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:27,690
it's hard.
I mean,

2100
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:30,640
you think it's hard to change your diet.
I mean,

2101
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:33,370
try overhauling your entire lifestyle.
Yeah.

2102
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:34,120
Oh,
believe me.

2103
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:37,180
Very,
very difficult and scary.

2104
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,380
It's terrifying,
you know,

2105
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:40,600
and we live in a fear based culture,
you know?

2106
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:42,940
Um,
but I did it,

2107
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:48,260
you know,
I went from being a martial arts 

2108
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:48,260
instructor to being a standup comedian 
and got my car repossessed,

2109
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,510
went broke,
lost all my critical.

2110
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:50,370
I mean,
it was a,

2111
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:54,460
a loser for like years that you were 
willing to double down to do that.

2112
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:59,770
I just didn't want to get brain damage.
I saw a future in kickboxing and I was 

2113
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,340
like,
you know what,

2114
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,260
this is,
uh,

2115
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:06,300
this,
this stuff is not good for your fucking 

2116
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:06,300
head.
And I was meeting guys that Jim,

2117
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,980
the newer were punchy and uh,
I just was too one.

2118
01:33:09,210 --> 01:33:14,210
I did too many hard sparring sessions 
where I never got knocked out in 

2119
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:18,521
sparring.
But I definitely got my bell rung 

2120
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:18,521
before.
Um,

2121
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:22,050
and uh,
I got hit with hard shots before we 

2122
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:22,050
would,
we would trade,

2123
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:25,801
you know,
I worked out at a particularly heavy 

2124
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:25,801
duty.

2125
01:33:25,801 --> 01:33:29,610
Jim and these,
the different gyms have different 

2126
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:29,710
philosophies as far as borrowing.
And our,

2127
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:32,800
Jim's philosophy was he put on big 
gloves and you fucking go at it.

2128
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:33,430
There was,
there was,

2129
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:38,470
it was basically kickboxing bouts with 
big giant gloves on and headgear and 

2130
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:39,250
Shin Pads.
And stuff like that.

2131
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,370
And uh,
I knew that it was not good for you.

2132
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,970
So for me it was like I had this crazy 
like I got to jump ship,

2133
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:50,080
I got a job because this is a path of 
deteriorating brain function.

2134
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,560
Like I would have moments where I'd be 
lying in bed and it wasn't even like 

2135
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,770
there was a,
like a goal,

2136
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,900
like it wasn't,
there was no ufc back then.

2137
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:02,170
So it was just kickboxing and in my 
opinion,

2138
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:07,230
like mixed martial arts is a,
first of all it's just way more options 

2139
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,560
and just because there's more options 
you could protect yourself,

2140
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:09,040
period.

2141
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:14,070
There's no,
I mean you could say that mixed martial 

2142
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,340
arts fighters have damaged too,
and I'll tell you some do,

2143
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:20,370
but there's some that don't have any.
There's some that rarely get hit and 

2144
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:20,400
that is possible as well.
And the,

2145
01:34:20,401 --> 01:34:25,401
the ability to mix up between the 
striking and the grappling and the fact 

2146
01:34:25,401 --> 01:34:29,371
that you have so many different options 
if you have a creative and spontaneous 

2147
01:34:29,371 --> 01:34:34,320
approach as well as being able to drill 
things over and over again until they 

2148
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,410
become zen.
When you reach a certain level,

2149
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:39,280
you can get away with way less damaged 
than any boxer does.

2150
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,520
Like you'll see a certain guys fight in 
a five round UFC fight and take very 

2151
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:49,741
little damage like a George St Pierre 
because he's so fucking good and his 

2152
01:34:49,741 --> 01:34:53,530
plan is so good.
But with boxing and kickboxing,

2153
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,410
you're standing in front of each other 
and you're hitting each other period and

2154
01:34:56,411 --> 01:34:58,010
there's no downs and there's no.

2155
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:03,010
There's no rear naked choke for the 
finish and the first round does none of 

2156
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:03,010
that.
There's,

2157
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:06,020
there's slamming bones into your head 
trying to shut that Mellon off,

2158
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,030
you know?
And ultimately for me,

2159
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:11,420
I knew that I had to do something 
differently as I was terrified and there

2160
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:12,970
was no future in it,
you know,

2161
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:18,310
but I.
But because of that I developed a real 

2162
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:19,370
compassion for understanding like how 
difficult it is.

2163
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:23,330
I was 21,
I had no children.

2164
01:35:23,331 --> 01:35:28,331
I had no.
I mean they'd repossessed my car so I 

2165
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:28,331
had no car anymore.
It was like,

2166
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:30,440
it was really like I could live on the 
cheap,

2167
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:35,650
I could scratch by.
But if you're a person who is trying to 

2168
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:39,221
change careers and you have a family and
your mortgage and you have a car that 

2169
01:35:39,221 --> 01:35:43,670
you lease and you've got to pay for your
kids' afterschool activities and that is

2170
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:45,500
unbelievably hard,
very hard.

2171
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,830
So then at the same time it's like,

2172
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,160
you know,
life's short man,

2173
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:50,710
and it's true,
most people are not,

2174
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:53,090
are not doing what they,
what they want to be doing,

2175
01:35:53,091 --> 01:35:55,010
or maybe even what they're supposed to 
be doing.

2176
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,520
So what did you do?
How did you,

2177
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,030
how did you just exit yourself out from 
the machine?

2178
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:01,050
Well,
I,

2179
01:36:01,051 --> 01:36:02,100
I had,
uh,

2180
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:07,340
you know,
I left corporate law firm life and 

2181
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:07,340
started my own,
my own little thing and you know,

2182
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,130
because I just couldn't,
I couldn't live that way anymore.

2183
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,420
What little thing that you're talking 
about?

2184
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:13,620
Just a solo entertainment law practice.
Um,

2185
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:18,690
and you know,
made a lot less money but was able to 

2186
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,350
control my time.
And that was just a little bit before,

2187
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:25,370
you know,
I changed the Diet and started getting 

2188
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:27,181
back into fitness.
But because I had control over my day 

2189
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:30,841
because I didn't have a boss anymore,
I could set up my work schedule the way 

2190
01:36:30,841 --> 01:36:30,841
that I want,
like Tim ferriss style.

2191
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:33,730
Then it allowed me to be able to,
to,

2192
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:38,731
um,
train at odd hours that wouldn't 

2193
01:36:38,731 --> 01:36:38,980
necessarily flow with somebody,
you know,

2194
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:44,070
nine to five job.
But I was able to structure my life so 

2195
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,830
that I could make that possible.
And again,

2196
01:36:44,831 --> 01:36:46,270
it was just feeling like,
you know,

2197
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:51,570
when you feel like you're guided to move
in a certain direction in a certain 

2198
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:51,570
path,
you know,

2199
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:53,470
when your car was repossessed and you 
were starting to,

2200
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:56,650
you know,
do stand up and move into that world.

2201
01:36:56,651 --> 01:37:01,651
I mean,
I'm sure you felt like this is what you 

2202
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:01,651
want it to be doing what you're supposed
to be doing.

2203
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:04,390
Even if there was no kind of real world 
material affirmation of that.

2204
01:37:04,391 --> 01:37:04,990
Initially

2205
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,260
it was,
there was a lot of apprehension.

2206
01:37:08,261 --> 01:37:10,150
There was a lot of thinking that I was 
fucking up,

2207
01:37:10,151 --> 01:37:11,480
but I was doing the wrong thing.
I mean,

2208
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:13,300
there was a,
there was not much confidence.

2209
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,600
It's certainly not like a,
I knew this was my path,

2210
01:37:16,601 --> 01:37:19,420
like I had an idea that this was 
something that I could do,

2211
01:37:19,421 --> 01:37:21,940
but I was terrified because I sucked at 
it too.

2212
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,520
There was no evidence that I could ever 
be really good at it.

2213
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:29,850
When I quit teaching martial arts,
I mean I was teaching at Boston 

2214
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:31,950
University.
I had my own school and um,

2215
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:32,650
I was,
uh,

2216
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:37,670
it was making a living,
teaching taekwondo and then delivered 

2217
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,760
newspapers sometimes in the morning,
occasionally take newspaper routes.

2218
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:43,660
Um,
I took to switch from that,

2219
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:47,640
give up training and teaching entirely 
altogether to,

2220
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:52,810
to,
to do something that I wasn't very good 

2221
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:52,810
at.
It was fucking terrible.

2222
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:54,430
That was a terrifying movie that I would
only make when I was 21.

2223
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,040
And you know,
when you're 21

2224
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,760
year old fucking cocky with.
But you know this like if I was going to

2225
01:37:59,761 --> 01:38:04,761
do that in this day and age,
is that really one of those old school 

2226
01:38:04,761 --> 01:38:04,761
alarms right outside

2227
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:07,230
you?
Dumb motherfucker.

2228
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:10,710
But it'd be very hard for me to do 
something like that today.

2229
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:11,670
Well,
yeah,

2230
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:13,650
it's different when you're 21,
but I mean is,

2231
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:16,560
does anybody pay attention to car alarms
ever?

2232
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:17,940
I don't know.
Open the door,

2233
01:38:17,941 --> 01:38:19,530
Brian and make it louder.
That's a good move.

2234
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:21,380
Yeah.
Your instinct is never.

2235
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,160
Oh my God.
Somebody stealing a car.

2236
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,530
No fucking alarm is ruining our 
conversation.

2237
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:33,330
Is anybody anybody in,
in standup good in the beginning?

2238
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:35,820
No,
because I heard that everybody says they

2239
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:36,180
were,
you know,

2240
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:37,980
they were awful when they can think that
they're good.

2241
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,540
What are you doing,
man?

2242
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,950
Shut up my microphone off.

2243
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,140
There you go.
Um,

2244
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:45,710
you,
you might think you're good.

2245
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:50,711
I mean,
I've heard people say that they were 

2246
01:38:50,711 --> 01:38:50,711
good right from the very beginning,
but they are either full of shit or they

2247
01:38:50,711 --> 01:38:51,950
were stealing jokes.
It just doesn't make sense that you were

2248
01:38:51,951 --> 01:38:56,951
good right from the beginning unless you
had some experience as something else 

2249
01:38:56,951 --> 01:38:56,951
before.
One,

2250
01:38:56,951 --> 01:38:59,300
one group of people that were actually 
pretty decent,

2251
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,200
not bad for beginners was a alcoholics 
anonymous people,

2252
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:06,020
because this is driving people in 
itunes.

2253
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:08,250
Fucking crazy.
I guarantee you,

2254
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,700
you want to take a quick five minute 
break.

2255
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:13,310
You might keep going right.
How long do these things keep going?

2256
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:19,390
We'll just pause this folks.
We're going to pause this for a couple 

2257
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:19,390
minutes and let this shit stop.
Thank you.

2258
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:37,260
This ladies and gentlemen,
we're very vulnerable folks technically.

2259
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:51,900
Uh,
but we were in the middle of talking 

2260
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:51,900
about this shows off air.
There it goes.

2261
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:56,340
Um,
we were in the middle of talking about 

2262
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:56,360
changing your life and changing,
you know,

2263
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:01,390
changing your diet,
changing your path into something that 

2264
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:03,791
you love.
That's something that we stress on this 

2265
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:03,791
show,
like,

2266
01:40:03,791 --> 01:40:07,820
like as much as possible because it's 
something that someone doesn't tell you 

2267
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,380
when you're growing up and the most 
formative period of your life.

2268
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,930
They don't say you.
You're different than me.

2269
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,450
Everyone's different.
You have to find what you're drawn to.

2270
01:40:14,451 --> 01:40:17,000
Find what you love and then go chase.
That.

2271
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:22,330
I love when I see is this mic on Brian?
It's working because I don't hear the 

2272
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:27,490
young people that like latch onto 
something that they love doing when 

2273
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:27,490
they're,
when they're young,

2274
01:40:27,490 --> 01:40:31,360
you know,
whether it's playing the guitar or 

2275
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,360
whatever it is that they're just 
passionate about.

2276
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,621
And then they just become very self 
directed about it and I'm like so 

2277
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:35,621
jealous.
I wish I had when I was a kid.

2278
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:36,580
I wish I had that,
you know,

2279
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:40,370
I'd never,
I spent my whole life kind of doing what

2280
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:43,340
I was supposed to and didn't never 
really stopped to think like,

2281
01:40:43,341 --> 01:40:43,940
well,
what do I,

2282
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,790
what do I want or what makes me happy or
what am I passionate about?

2283
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,270
It wasn't really,
just wasn't really part of my equation,

2284
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,120
you know?
And that just seems so wrong.

2285
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:53,830
So it's like,

2286
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:55,420
yeah,
it's terrible.

2287
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:56,100
And,
and,

2288
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,170
and it,
it,

2289
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,530
it almost like it doesn't even matter 
what it is,

2290
01:40:59,531 --> 01:41:02,050
you know,
everybody has something inside them that

2291
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:03,190
they probably,
you know,

2292
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:07,160
love doing or could be passionate about 
or could be good at or whatever.

2293
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:07,470
And

2294
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:10,370
for everyone,
do you think there's some people

2295
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,250
stickers?
Not Listen,

2296
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:17,280
I think that not look,
not everyone can be an nba basketball 

2297
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,180
player or whatever.
So not everyone is innately gifted,

2298
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:24,300
but I think everybody in signed the 
inside of themselves has something that 

2299
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,511
makes them happy.
And I think that if you pursue what 

2300
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:28,390
makes you happy without getting so 
caught up in,

2301
01:41:28,391 --> 01:41:30,860
how am I going to make money doing this 
or there's no career in it,

2302
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,600
whatever,
and living a little bit more faith based

2303
01:41:34,601 --> 01:41:38,570
with what you're doing and focusing more
on the passion that you know,

2304
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:40,690
we'd probably be,
we'd probably be better off.

2305
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:43,740
I think people would be happier if that 
was a priority.

2306
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,350
There will also be cultural people 
already trying to borrow money.

2307
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:52,410
There'll be a lot more people.
Well Hollywood's full of these kinds of 

2308
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:57,061
people.
Of course there'll be a lot more people 

2309
01:41:57,061 --> 01:41:59,881
that need a loan to try to get through 
this next thing that they're trying to 

2310
01:41:59,881 --> 01:42:02,281
fucking get launch.
Kickstarter would have got it done in a 

2311
01:42:02,281 --> 01:42:02,281
long time ago.
Yeah.

2312
01:42:02,281 --> 01:42:02,890
King started changed the whole game of 
begging.

2313
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:08,970
Made it kind of cool.
So you've figured out a way to put a 

2314
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:09,570
name to it that makes it seem,
oh,

2315
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,320
it's Kevin just kickstart and my 
business.

2316
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,500
Did you see,
I just saw,

2317
01:42:12,501 --> 01:42:13,580
I tweeted this yesterday,
right?

2318
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,840
That this,
this company came up with this New Light

2319
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,180
Bulb that you can control your,
your iphone app,

2320
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:20,420
you can,
you can,

2321
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:25,460
you put all these light bulbs in your 
house and you can do all this crazy 

2322
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:25,720
stuff with them.
Like change all their colors.

2323
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:26,260
Yeah.
Like that,

2324
01:42:26,261 --> 01:42:28,570
like changed the cars,
have them turn on,

2325
01:42:28,571 --> 01:42:29,440
have them like,
you know,

2326
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:32,500
on timers that go off and,
and it was pretty cool.

2327
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,690
But they raised a ton of money on 
kickstarter.

2328
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,240
No Shit.
Yeah,

2329
01:42:36,241 --> 01:42:37,200
I'm sure.
Yeah.

2330
01:42:37,201 --> 01:42:38,340
It's a brilliant idea.
And you,

2331
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:38,870
you know,
you,

2332
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:43,970
there's all sorts of different offers 
that companies give to people that you 

2333
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:45,420
can actually become a part of.
Like cocaine cowboys.

2334
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,840
I thin he do something like that where 
he.

2335
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:48,180
No,
no,

2336
01:42:48,181 --> 01:42:48,660
no,
that wasn't,

2337
01:42:48,661 --> 01:42:50,760
that was the union.
The guys who did the union,

2338
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:53,520
his next film that he's doing,
he,

2339
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:59,030
he got people to buy it in advance on 
kickstarter instead of just like asking 

2340
01:42:59,311 --> 01:43:00,030
for money.
He said,

2341
01:43:00,031 --> 01:43:01,770
listen,
I'm giving you your,

2342
01:43:01,771 --> 01:43:03,630
you'll get the first copies of this 
film.

2343
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,760
A successful product

2344
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:07,800
ones are all,
they're almost preorders.

2345
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:12,860
So there was a lot of money because 
you're going to actually get the 

2346
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:12,860
product.

2347
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:12,860
Yeah,
I mean it sounds like it's such a.

2348
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,110
it's like the people that enjoyed the 
first film can actually fund and finance

2349
01:43:16,111 --> 01:43:16,950
the second one.
I mean,

2350
01:43:16,951 --> 01:43:18,930
it's just,
it's really cool,

2351
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:20,280
you know,
if you look at it that way,

2352
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:21,270
it's really cool.
I mean,

2353
01:43:21,271 --> 01:43:24,540
we live in,
we live in the most strange times.

2354
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,050
This is a really.
Things like that,

2355
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:28,690
you know,
are just like,

2356
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:29,730
you can do that.
Yeah,

2357
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:31,260
you could do that and you can make a lot
of money.

2358
01:43:31,261 --> 01:43:36,261
Let's look at these fucking guys that 
made millions of dollars of this.

2359
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,310
Where did that go?
By the way?

2360
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:43,520
That fucking was the quickest out fad 
that coney fad man,

2361
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:47,460
that's almost like an alien blip.
They just tested us for retardation,

2362
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:51,770
like a Ph test from the,
from the heavens in the same way that is

2363
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:52,550
accelerating.

2364
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,640
Our attention spans are shrinking.
You know?

2365
01:43:55,670 --> 01:44:00,670
It's amazing.
The rapidity with which stuff comes and 

2366
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:01,450
goes now,
like it's immediate like it be.

2367
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,920
It can be the biggest thing ever.
And then it's immediately.

2368
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:07,090
Could you imagine though Joseph,
his email box?

2369
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:09,850
It's like nothing thin,
thin,

2370
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:16,770
millions of emails stop.
It was just nothing,

2371
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:19,030
nothing.
He's not getting the emails today.

2372
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,210
Joseph Kony doesn't even get Nigerian 
scammer emails today.

2373
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,640
That was just viral marketing for Peter 
Pan on Blu Ray.

2374
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,610
Yeah,
totally.

2375
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,800
And yet at the same time you do this 
podcast and you hold people's attention 

2376
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:31,800
for three hours a day.
Man,

2377
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:34,720
that's ridiculous.
These people need to get outside,

2378
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,860
stop listening to this fucking show,
go mow your lawn sign.

2379
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:42,870
But they're probably willing to ask a 
lot of people do it while they're 

2380
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:46,560
working,
which is cool as fuck because then they 

2381
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,260
get to be a part of a conversation 
instead of just be sitting there,

2382
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,450
you know,
screwing widgets together.

2383
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:54,700
I got on my long training rides.
I just stack it with podcasts because I 

2384
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:55,490
cannot,
I can't if I'm going out to ride my bike

2385
01:44:55,650 --> 01:45:00,650
for a long day,
eight hour training ride or something 

2386
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:00,650
like that.
I can't listen to music the whole time,

2387
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:01,490
you know?
I'd go insane.

2388
01:45:01,491 --> 01:45:02,070
So I,
I,

2389
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:07,540
I'll listen to your podcast,
a couple other podcasts and I just 

2390
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:07,540
stopped and I just lose myself in the 
conversation.

2391
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:08,930
So for me it's like the longer the 
better man.

2392
01:45:08,931 --> 01:45:09,350
I love it.

2393
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,240
Yeah,
we will.

2394
01:45:10,241 --> 01:45:15,241
When we first started out,
everybody was telling him we were crazy 

2395
01:45:15,241 --> 01:45:15,241
for doing an hour.
Our Ari Shapiro was constantly go,

2396
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,530
go,
go to a job.

2397
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:18,940
More than older people are not going to 
listen.

2398
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:19,800
I go,
well,

2399
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,610
how about this?
This don't listen to the rest.

2400
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:23,290
They just shut it off at any point in 
time.

2401
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,900
Like what fucking difference.
Does that make sense?

2402
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:26,710
This is ridiculous.
It's two hours,

2403
01:45:26,711 --> 01:45:27,970
three hours.
You don't have to listen.

2404
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:33,120
Like,
do I get bummed out that a radio shows 

2405
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:33,120
in four hours long?
I only was in my car for an hour.

2406
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,450
No,
you listen to whatever the fuck you want

2407
01:45:34,451 --> 01:45:39,451
to listen to it.
I think the key is just giving people 

2408
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:39,670
content.
Just keep keeping it coming.

2409
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,100
That's the most important thing is the 
momentum,

2410
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:47,340
keeping it coming and then you become a 
part of people's sort of daily routine.

2411
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,280
And when you become a part of people's 
daily routine,

2412
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:54,010
then you have an obligation and a 
responsibility to keep it coming,

2413
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:59,390
you know,
because like now you're bombing a bunch 

2414
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:01,741
of people out.
It's not as simple as you put something 

2415
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:01,741
out and they enjoy it.
It's,

2416
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:02,470
you don't put it out and you bummed them
out.

2417
01:46:02,471 --> 01:46:03,290
Like,
what the fuck?

2418
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:06,880
Fucking angry with you.
Fucking jewelry expectation.

2419
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:07,780
Yeah.
But it's,

2420
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:08,350
you're,
you're,

2421
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:10,080
uh,
you're making junkies and you,

2422
01:46:10,081 --> 01:46:11,770
you have to feed those junkies.
I mean,

2423
01:46:11,771 --> 01:46:14,860
it seems like you're keeping the quality
really high.

2424
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:18,080
That David Seaman interview was amazing.
I'd never,

2425
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,700
I'd never even heard of that guy.
I was like,

2426
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,580
why is he having like a guy's running 
for Congress on his show?

2427
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:23,720
I just thought,
and I listened to it.

2428
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:24,920
I was like,
that is amazing.

2429
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:27,590
I immediately started following him.
He's coming back,

2430
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:32,090
he's doing it to gas and dating guy.
And it's a real interesting.

2431
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:37,180
I was thinking about it the other day 
because he's the first guy from like 

2432
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:40,170
that generation to be in this sort of,
you know,

2433
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:42,420
a political candidate.
Yeah.

2434
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:47,470
And uh,
and the generation gap is very palpable 

2435
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:51,840
president,
a very different place and his 

2436
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:51,840
priorities

2437
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,040
and perspectives and all of that or so 
just in the way he speaks or so 

2438
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,460
different from what we're used to,
you know what I mean?

2439
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:57,900
But he's smart.
He's a smart kid.

2440
01:46:58,110 --> 01:47:01,080
He's like 26 years old.
It's beyond my shit he is.

2441
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:03,990
But it's beyond that too because,
you know,

2442
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,530
he is interested in things and is 
talking about things that no one in,

2443
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:13,550
you know,
the traditional political stratosphere 

2444
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:13,680
want to get anywhere near,
right wild.

2445
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:17,550
It could either he'll wind up being 
killed or he'll be the new king.

2446
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:18,420
Right?
Either way,

2447
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:20,050
we got your backs on,
uh,

2448
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:20,870
you know,
I,

2449
01:47:20,871 --> 01:47:21,530
I think it's,
uh,

2450
01:47:21,531 --> 01:47:26,531
it's,
it's very important that the only way 

2451
01:47:26,531 --> 01:47:29,301
this future is going to be any brighter 
is if it's very important that we 

2452
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:33,240
enlightened young people coming up to 
alternative paths of thinking.

2453
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:38,340
But you telling your story that you had 
gone down the exact correct path,

2454
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:39,140
you know,
in,

2455
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:42,300
in some sort of a predetermined pattern 
to success,

2456
01:47:42,301 --> 01:47:44,730
which would equal happiness supposedly 
for you.

2457
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,880
And then reaching that point of success,
you,

2458
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:53,090
you're not speculating ema,
you were one of the rare people that 

2459
01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:55,200
actually made it to the end of the game 
and went,

2460
01:47:55,201 --> 01:47:57,150
this is horseshit.
Okay,

2461
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:59,730
let's get outta here and you can't get 
trapped here.

2462
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:02,160
Let's get the fuck out of here and try 
something different.

2463
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:07,161
It has to be done.
That message when that message is in 

2464
01:48:07,161 --> 01:48:09,270
some kid's ear bud,
when he's on the train headed to his job

2465
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:14,271
or or headed to school or whatever.
That that message can resonate and 

2466
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:18,291
change thousands of people's lives.
I have had more fucking people come up 

2467
01:48:18,961 --> 01:48:23,961
to me in the past two years and say,
your podcast changed my life then than 

2468
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:29,900
any than any one thing that people have 
said to me other than fear is not a 

2469
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:30,870
factor.
They probably said that anything else,

2470
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:32,070
but that,
that key,

2471
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:34,020
that fucking theme keeps happening.

2472
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:37,590
And a lot of it is nutrition and a lot 
of it is exercise,

2473
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:42,591
but a lot of it also is just this 
understanding that you're not alone in 

2474
01:48:42,591 --> 01:48:45,330
thinking like that.
That the standard path seems like shit.

2475
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:47,610
You're not alone in that,
it's your,

2476
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:52,750
there's a lot of other people like us 
out there and we could all get pigeon 

2477
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:56,561
holed into some ridiculous patterns that
were created without individual 

2478
01:48:56,561 --> 01:49:00,951
personalities and unique traits and 
artistic intentions and qualities in 

2479
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:01,710
mind of that stuff in mind.
They were just,

2480
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:04,680
this is a plumber,
this is a vacuum salesman.

2481
01:49:04,681 --> 01:49:06,510
This is go down that path.
So I'm,

2482
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:09,050
you'll be an electrician and you know,
we're,

2483
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:11,640
we're disconnected from our own 
heartbeat.

2484
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,620
You know what I mean?
It's like you could say,

2485
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:14,040
well,
you know,

2486
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:14,970
most people are like,
well,

2487
01:49:14,971 --> 01:49:16,370
I don't even know what I like.
You know,

2488
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:21,410
it's like we're not,
we're disassociated from like a higher 

2489
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:21,410
version of ourself.

2490
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:26,330
More authentic version that wants to 
come out is locked down so deep that 

2491
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:28,420
it's almost like the key is,
you know,

2492
01:49:28,740 --> 01:49:30,660
unfindable well,
we've become a.

2493
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:34,320
We become a victim of our own culture,
our own creation,

2494
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:39,321
the culture of our own creation as a 
culture of predetermined patterns and 

2495
01:49:39,321 --> 01:49:43,140
obligations and things that you just 
must do that a lot of them suck and we 

2496
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:47,941
become a prisoner to that and this idea 
that if you do those things somehow or 

2497
01:49:47,941 --> 01:49:48,910
another,
you will be happier.

2498
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:50,830
It's ludicrous.
It's ridiculous.

2499
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:52,570
Yeah.
But then there's also,

2500
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,030
you have to pay your fucking rent and 
you know you want to drive.

2501
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:57,760
Cars is expensive.
Gas is expensive.

2502
01:49:58,070 --> 01:50:03,070
Well,
what are you gonna do you gotta you 

2503
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,070
gotta get a job,
son.

2504
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,490
It's finding the,
the ability to pay yourself,

2505
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,200
feed yourself and on top of that still 
pursue a dream.

2506
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:13,590
That's the hardest thing.
You going to do it before you develop 

2507
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:14,580
any fucking baggage.
Live lean.

2508
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:15,520
Yeah.
When you're young.

2509
01:50:15,521 --> 01:50:17,830
That I could've done one thing when I 
was young.

2510
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:22,860
It was just the live as lean as possible
and keep all those doors and options 

2511
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:25,210
open so you don't get stuck in someplace
you don't want to be and and,

2512
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:27,700
and make it more difficult for yourself 
to get out.

2513
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:28,600
Yeah,
I got out,

2514
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:30,340
but I could have easily just not gotten 
out.

2515
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:35,410
I know a lot of people that didn't know 
a lot of people that are postman 

2516
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:35,410
somewhere that really wanted to be a 
rockstar.

2517
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:35,980
You know,
there's a lot,

2518
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:40,990
a lot of weirdness in this world,
and then the one of the most depressing 

2519
01:50:40,990 --> 01:50:42,520
things to be around is someone who never
went for it.

2520
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:45,440
The people that you know that never went
for,

2521
01:50:45,441 --> 01:50:47,470
that had an idea in their head,
whatever it is,

2522
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:48,880
being an author,
whatever it is,

2523
01:50:48,881 --> 01:50:51,240
whatever it is,
they just never changed.

2524
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,890
I want to be a longshoreman and I want 
to be a fucking professional fisherman.

2525
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,920
I wanna.
I want to fucking do what those crab 

2526
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,850
guys doing.
That crazy show guys go fishing for crap

2527
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:05,851
just to fucking know I'm alive.
If you have that thought in your head 

2528
01:51:05,851 --> 01:51:05,851
and you don't do it,
you're gonna.

2529
01:51:05,851 --> 01:51:06,700
You're living like a bitch,
man.

2530
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,070
You don't want to.
You don't want to have those regrets,

2531
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:10,540
man.
It's the saddest thing in the world,

2532
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:11,060
isn't it?
Yeah.

2533
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,090
The,
the,

2534
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:17,120
the feeling that you get when you're 
around someone who just stayed on the 

2535
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:19,690
couch,
just never pursued anything artistic.

2536
01:51:19,691 --> 01:51:21,370
Anything physical,
anything,

2537
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:26,850
anything.
For me it always feels like one of the 

2538
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:28,360
big things of,
of happiness.

2539
01:51:28,361 --> 01:51:33,361
It's like seeing improvement.
Either seeing improvement in stuff that 

2540
01:51:33,361 --> 01:51:37,951
I'm working on,
like comedy stuff or seeing improvement 

2541
01:51:37,951 --> 01:51:38,070
and um,
my uh,

2542
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:41,080
my Jujitsu or seeing improvement in 
playing pool A,

2543
01:51:41,081 --> 01:51:45,820
anything to me it's like if I don't see 
improvement and things then I get like,

2544
01:51:46,060 --> 01:51:47,260
I get really bummed out.

2545
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,870
Like I feel like I'm not doing anything.
I feel lazy.

2546
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:52,140
I feel like I'm just getting by,
you know,

2547
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:54,130
if I'm,
if I go four or five days where I'm not,

2548
01:51:54,131 --> 01:51:57,670
like at least actively working on 
improving some aspect of my life,

2549
01:51:57,970 --> 01:52:02,970
I feel it's totally lazy.
Right to it found out that Matt Danzig 

2550
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:06,940
with them.
Is that what is,

2551
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:09,130
why?
Why is it,

2552
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,410
why would that make it haunted?
Because his,

2553
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:13,030
his podcasts are haunted.
Oh,

2554
01:52:13,031 --> 01:52:14,440
his podcast.
That's right.

2555
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:18,370
He said to podcasts that fucked up Ari 
[inaudible] podcast.

2556
01:52:18,371 --> 01:52:20,690
He did this long podcast with Ari fear 
and uh,

2557
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:23,740
it got deleted and they couldn't return.
We couldn't retrieve it.

2558
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,470
And then mine,
which just crashed recently.

2559
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:28,460
So he made me podcast haunted.
Is he going to come?

2560
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,530
He's coming back.
Come coming tomorrow.

2561
01:52:29,531 --> 01:52:31,960
Yeah,
tomorrow is going to be a crazy day,

2562
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:35,370
ladies and gentlemen.
We have not just powerful Mac.

2563
01:52:35,370 --> 01:52:40,370
Dan's like,
we have billy Corbin who's the director 

2564
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:43,240
and producer of cocaine cowboys.
He's coming in with Mad Flavor,

2565
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:48,241
Aka Joey Diaz.
So Diaz and the director of cocaine 

2566
01:52:48,241 --> 01:52:50,420
cowboys and Joey's on the phone with me 
yesterday who's dropping knowledge.

2567
01:52:50,421 --> 01:52:52,070
He's telling me he was warming up for 
this.

2568
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,120
He goes,
let me tell you something,

2569
01:52:53,121 --> 01:52:58,121
dog.
I'm going to tell people shit I never 

2570
01:52:58,121 --> 01:53:00,131
told before.
The tell people shit I never told 

2571
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:00,131
before.
Joe Rogan,

2572
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:01,940
I'm going to go back to my uncle.
We can call them in Miami.

2573
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:04,550
Seventy years old,
he'll tell you what the fuck happened.

2574
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:09,850
And he started going off and screaming 
at me on the phone after he screamed at 

2575
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:11,210
me for leaving a message.
I fucked up and left a voicemail message

2576
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:13,370
on his machine.
If you leave a message as machine,

2577
01:53:13,371 --> 01:53:15,560
he'll will go crazy and call you up and 
motherfuck you.

2578
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:16,580
Why?
Why?

2579
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:18,140
He doesn't want to listen to messages.

2580
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:19,850
Yeah,
but he gets angry at you.

2581
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:21,860
So if you call his voicemail,
it goes,

2582
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:26,861
what the fuck did I tell you know,
messages do not leave a message on this 

2583
01:53:26,861 --> 01:53:29,210
fucking phone.
So if you leave a message,

2584
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:34,211
he goes bananas.
Even if you have like tell them to turn 

2585
01:53:34,211 --> 01:53:34,211
that,
you can turn that off.

2586
01:53:34,211 --> 01:53:36,620
Can you know these Joey fucking ape?
He doesn't know what cash.

2587
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:39,650
Unless every job.
That phone might as well be solid wood.

2588
01:53:39,651 --> 01:53:43,700
He doesn't know what the fuck the 
buttons to shuts off when it runs out of

2589
01:53:43,701 --> 01:53:45,820
batteries in his hands to somebody.

2590
01:53:48,110 --> 01:53:53,110
He's getting better at that though.
He sent me text messages before and I 

2591
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:53,110
stuck it in his face.
I go,

2592
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:57,311
what the fuck is this?
You sent me a text message for the 

2593
01:53:57,311 --> 01:53:57,311
longest time.
Joe.

2594
01:53:57,311 --> 01:53:58,490
He just had a pager when everyone had 
cell phones.

2595
01:53:58,491 --> 01:54:00,310
He still had a pager.
Yeah.

2596
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,360
He didn't have a cell phone until like 
the two thousands.

2597
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,880
I'm not bullshitting neither man.
Joey Diaz had a.

2598
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:11,230
Did he have a pager when you met him?
He might've had a pager when you met 

2599
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:11,230
him.
Yeah.

2600
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:11,230
Yeah.
He kept a pager deep,

2601
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:14,960
deep into his history on a lot of people
had given up the ghost in the pager.

2602
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:20,140
It's weird how these things just haven't
been around that long and yet you can't 

2603
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,940
even imagine not having them anymore.
Do you remember the transitionary period

2604
01:54:22,941 --> 01:54:27,941
where a lot of a lot of folks in the 
urban community had those little pagers 

2605
01:54:28,311 --> 01:54:29,600
that would send messages?

2606
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:33,350
You could send like a little message to 
somebody meet me at the club.

2607
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:37,040
They would that the black folks were way
ahead of the curve on that.

2608
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:42,670
They were way ahead of the curve.
I never thought that would have caught 

2609
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:42,670
on like,
what are you guys doing?

2610
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:45,551
You're texting a white tank.
I didn't even say texting wasn't even 

2611
01:54:45,551 --> 01:54:45,551
called texting.
I was like,

2612
01:54:45,551 --> 01:54:46,160
you're writing each other letters like,
why do you,

2613
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:47,780
why are you doing that?
And they were like,

2614
01:54:47,781 --> 01:54:49,190
well,
it gets loud in the club.

2615
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:50,000
I was like,
Oh,

2616
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,620
it gets loud in the club.
That makes sense.

2617
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:55,610
That's what started it all for real.
That's it was too loud in the club.

2618
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:58,400
People fast for her to the.
I found not only that,

2619
01:54:58,401 --> 01:54:59,770
but a lot of times,
uh,

2620
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:05,310
there's another thing that is a 
phenomena in the urban community that 

2621
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:05,310
you'd like to talk on speakerphone.

2622
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:06,920
No,
I don't know what's up with that.

2623
01:55:07,310 --> 01:55:12,310
I've talked about this on his podcast 
and people have accused me of being 

2624
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,951
racist,
touching that right after they accused 

2625
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:17,831
me of being racist.
I went to Roscoe's chicken and waffles 

2626
01:55:17,831 --> 01:55:20,291
and there's a dude standing right in 
front of the place talking on his phone 

2627
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:21,110
like this.
Oh Hell No.

2628
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:22,460
Oh Hell No.
They'll do.

2629
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:27,461
Was talking loud.
You could hear the other dude like 

2630
01:55:27,461 --> 01:55:29,030
silver loud and he's maybe he liked,
heard the sheryl crow story and is 

2631
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:29,840
worried about brain tumors,
but I don't think so.

2632
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:32,870
I think there's something going on.
Like they even had a commercial.

2633
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,880
Remember that commercial for boost 
mobile.

2634
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:36,650
They would have their cell phones like 
where you at?

2635
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,600
They would talk into it.
They're not doing this.

2636
01:55:38,601 --> 01:55:40,250
You're not treating it like a white 
person phone.

2637
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:43,440
Now they're holding it.
You at that was the,

2638
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:45,930
that was the commercial they were doing 
urban style.

2639
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,750
It's a weird thing.
So I guess that didn't work.

2640
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:51,150
You know,
cell phones and clubs.

2641
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,920
It's when you're on gone speakerphone 
all the time.

2642
01:55:52,990 --> 01:55:56,040
It's fucking shit.
It's fucking chaos.

2643
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:58,380
Right.
So imagine,

2644
01:55:58,570 --> 01:56:03,570
remember I used to have jokes in my act 
about text messages were stupid before,

2645
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,940
like in 2005,
my showtime special.

2646
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:10,650
I totally marked text messaging like it 
takes you four presses to get an ass.

2647
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,420
I was like,
there was before anybody had keyboards.

2648
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:13,510
Yeah.
People would like,

2649
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:15,720
they were starting out with that crazy 
shit.

2650
01:56:15,721 --> 01:56:18,660
We would have to press four times to get
in that ladder.

2651
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:19,290
Right?
Yeah.

2652
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,650
That was ridiculous.
You remember that were dinosaurs.

2653
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:26,100
I remember when the texting plans were 
like 25 texts per month.

2654
01:56:26,101 --> 01:56:29,060
50 texts per month.
Yeah.

2655
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,560
If you've got a girlfriend,
you go through the day.

2656
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:36,090
No girls love texting.
People are dying and crashing their cars

2657
01:56:36,091 --> 01:56:37,660
because they just can't keep their 
fingers off it.

2658
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:38,790
Oh yeah.
It's real issue.

2659
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:43,850
It's a real issue.
They say it's one of the worst 

2660
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:45,630
distractions ever that you literally 
cannot focus on your phone.

2661
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:49,450
Like it's like zooming in on something 
like that and intently is like,

2662
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:52,830
it's so.
It's so non peripheral.

2663
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:57,860
You don't see anything peripheral.
You've completely concentrated on that 

2664
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:57,860
thing.
Right.

2665
01:56:57,860 --> 01:56:58,260
Some lady almost ran into me at the mall
the other day.

2666
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:01,290
She was on her phone and she was doing 
this and she looked up and I was like,

2667
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:03,870
right in the crosswalk.
People are fucking nuts man.

2668
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:09,200
They're nuts and we've created this 
weird culture again that were prisoner 

2669
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,860
to.
And one of the prisons is technology.

2670
01:57:10,861 --> 01:57:12,660
I mean we,
we benefit from it,

2671
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:17,661
no question about it,
but we are also locked into this really 

2672
01:57:17,661 --> 01:57:20,700
weird symbiotic relationship with it.
Like I am.

2673
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:23,040
I do not leave my house without my phone
man.

2674
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:23,730
If I,
I,

2675
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,130
if I don't have my phone on me,
I feel weird.

2676
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:27,090
That is weird.
Family.

2677
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:31,140
Where's my fucking phone?
And I'll panic.

2678
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:36,440
Even though it's like all you have to do
is you buy a new phone and you stick it 

2679
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:36,440
in your computer,
all your contacts.

2680
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:38,010
It takes you.
I mean if you lost your phone,

2681
01:57:38,011 --> 01:57:41,250
it's not the most,
but the other people,

2682
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,820
I'm alone,
I'm out there on my own with no,

2683
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
no tether.
It's like they were afraid to be in a 

2684
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,900
fucking town without a cell phone.
I mean,

2685
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:53,560
I feel bizarre if I leave,
if I,

2686
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:58,580
if I'm in a town like say in a.
it's like a place where you could walk 

2687
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:01,881
around and I leave my phone in my hotel 
room and then I'll go downstairs and 

2688
01:58:01,881 --> 01:58:01,881
I'll just walk to a restaurant,
sit down.

2689
01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:04,560
I feel fucking strange.

2690
01:58:04,770 --> 01:58:07,440
Like I feel like I can't talk to anybody
right now.

2691
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:12,620
It's worth it.
And it gets even crazier with all the 

2692
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:15,600
social media.
Like you have this compulsion to check 

2693
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,770
twitter and see what certain people are 
saying that you don't even.

2694
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,640
These are people you don't even know.
Well,

2695
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:23,650
some people have it hooked up to their 
phone where they get a text message 

2696
01:58:23,650 --> 01:58:25,740
every time someone tweets any sort of a 
mention of their name,

2697
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,530
you know?
That's,

2698
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:29,220
that's insane.
Don Benson has that.

2699
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:32,520
So does dot Merera.
I tweeted a instagram the other day,

2700
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:37,521
a picture of Don Merera,
the sexy pool boobs was shooting pool 

2701
01:58:37,521 --> 01:58:38,100
and uh,
it showed up on his phone.

2702
01:58:38,101 --> 01:58:39,820
I'm like,
silly bitch.

2703
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:42,630
Turn that shit off.
I'll have people just read.

2704
01:58:42,810 --> 01:58:46,880
I think I already have do that now your 
phone is going to blow up tomorrow.

2705
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:51,730
This is insane.
It just scrolls like crazy.

2706
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:54,700
Yeah,
you can't read all that stuff.

2707
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:59,730
I read as much as I can,
but the problem is some people think I 

2708
01:58:59,730 --> 01:58:59,730
read it all and they're like,
did you respond to my [inaudible]?

2709
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:01,700
Get Mad at you responding to tweet and 
like,

2710
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:06,701
doors tomorrow.
What tweet do you want me to really go 

2711
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:06,701
into your thing?
And there's a lot of people here.

2712
01:59:06,701 --> 01:59:07,990
Do just,
you had the chance to say it again right

2713
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:08,770
there.
And he didn't.

2714
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:12,670
You just said bullet foods do not 
respond.

2715
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:14,300
Foods dealt with.
Oh,

2716
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,810
the negative approach.
I get the guilt move.

2717
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:17,980
Always,
always good.

2718
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:20,230
I was here in Howard stern talking about
twitter,

2719
01:59:20,231 --> 01:59:23,110
about how many people are nasty to him 
on twitter and how evil they are.

2720
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:25,240
Um,
I don't get that.

2721
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:30,390
I really don't get this pretty 
overwhelmingly positive compared to 

2722
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:33,070
other platforms that I've found.
I get overwhelmingly positive.

2723
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:36,310
I mean there's always a few cons,
but it's so easy to block them,

2724
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:37,300
my wife and bring them on it.

2725
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:42,480
And it's rare.
It's really rare and I think a lot of 

2726
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:43,240
people on twitter,
like you look at their names,

2727
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:45,200
it's like that's their real name.
It's,

2728
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:49,150
it's more than a St message boards,
message boards.

2729
01:59:49,151 --> 01:59:54,151
I've always felt like we have a message 
board on Joe Rogan Dot Net and I've 

2730
01:59:54,151 --> 01:59:57,070
always felt like prior to the problem is
the anonymity that it provides.

2731
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:02,880
In a way.
It's good because people can talk about 

2732
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,891
things,
especially like people that have 

2733
02:00:04,891 --> 02:00:04,891
sensitive jobs and people that are at 
work,

2734
02:00:04,891 --> 02:00:05,740
they can get away with talking about 
things and there's no way to google them

2735
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:09,700
and data reference their name,
but in a way it's bad because people say

2736
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:13,240
shit without any reason.
They don't worry about the,

2737
02:00:13,241 --> 02:00:15,460
uh,
the social repercussions of looking at a

2738
02:00:15,461 --> 02:00:17,820
person's eye and calling them a country 
Douche bag,

2739
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,820
you know?
And then they're like,

2740
02:00:18,821 --> 02:00:20,110
what the fuck man,
you didn't like that.

2741
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:23,800
That negativity is gone.
So it's just these verbal barb's.

2742
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:29,040
I think with twitter,
like a lot of times people have their 

2743
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,951
photo that's there.
It's not everybody but a good 

2744
02:00:31,951 --> 02:00:32,080
percentage.
Like I'm looking at my,

2745
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:35,420
my twitter feed.
Most of these are people's names.

2746
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:36,320
Real people.
Yeah.

2747
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:40,670
There's a few that aren't because a few 
like weird names or you know,

2748
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,580
it's like maybe one of them's Divo 
bitch,

2749
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:44,020
you're not Divo,
you know,

2750
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:47,980
and it's depo is me.
Is his twitter name to Divo son.

2751
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:50,950
I mean you might like diva but you're 
not divo and who are you really?

2752
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:53,890
It's probably the name is Mike Callahan 
or whatever the fuck his name is.

2753
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:59,840
When I think the more we have that,
the more we have like a sort of a 

2754
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,621
transparency about who I think people 
are less likely to just lash out and 

2755
02:01:04,621 --> 02:01:05,170
have it become super.

2756
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:06,210
Yeah,
that's true.

2757
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:10,110
I mean I think like a couple of weeks 
ago when you had,

2758
02:01:10,140 --> 02:01:13,170
you retreated like a video I made of a 
Kale shake or something like that.

2759
02:01:13,171 --> 02:01:16,350
We had a back and forth over Kale,
vitamix or something like that,

2760
02:01:16,351 --> 02:01:21,351
so.
So you retweeted this stupid little 

2761
02:01:21,351 --> 02:01:24,411
video that I made of just me making a a 
drink after a run and I got slammed with

2762
02:01:26,210 --> 02:01:28,830
desk squad,
army full of fact.

2763
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,280
Just like if I saw that guy on the 
street I would,

2764
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:34,820
I would stab him in the face and like,
what is it?

2765
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,140
Like the most benign thing my face for 
me,

2766
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:38,310
it's not.
Yeah,

2767
02:01:38,311 --> 02:01:39,500
exactly.
Yeah,

2768
02:01:39,570 --> 02:01:44,570
really.
I mean there were some that were fine 

2769
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:44,570
too,
but I was like suddenly out of the blue,

2770
02:01:44,570 --> 02:01:48,791
like all these comments popped up,
so it's clearly as a result of you 

2771
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:49,000
having this huge following or whatever.

2772
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:54,230
Have you though for your dietary choice 
are very threatened by the Kale Joe?

2773
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,100
Yeah.
That's what they don't know what to do 

2774
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:00,100
with me because I enjoy the Kale.
I love the Kale.

2775
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:00,100
I'm,
I'm,

2776
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:01,640
I'm a big fan of,
of pure vegetable,

2777
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:04,370
just meals.
It's just food is just food,

2778
02:02:04,371 --> 02:02:08,330
but the people need to be on a fucking 
team.

2779
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:13,450
Okay.
It's now during the desk about army and 

2780
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:13,450
if,
if they feel like they're being attacked

2781
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:17,620
by vegetarian,
they'll fucking throw out all their 

2782
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:18,920
vegetables.
I don't know why,

2783
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:23,980
you know,
we all just get along to quote Rodney 

2784
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:24,740
King for drown on PCP and a swimming 
pool.

2785
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:27,980
It's a,
it seems to me that,

2786
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:29,840
uh,
the real problem is annoying people.

2787
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:32,870
It's not vegetarian meat eaters.
It's not.

2788
02:02:33,110 --> 02:02:36,440
The real problem is annoying people or 
people that are ignoring that.

2789
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:41,470
That's the issue.
It's not your different ideology or 

2790
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:41,470
different desire.

2791
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:43,970
I know people that legitimately really 
love classical music and they can't wait

2792
02:02:43,971 --> 02:02:47,630
to get home to put on headphones and sit
there in front of some shit.

2793
02:02:47,631 --> 02:02:50,570
That to me,
which is a drive me out of my head.

2794
02:02:50,571 --> 02:02:53,630
I can listen to classical music for a 
couple minutes and then I go,

2795
02:02:53,631 --> 02:02:56,210
you know what I can be listening to 
right now led Zepplin.

2796
02:02:56,330 --> 02:02:59,600
Why am I listening to this stupid shit 
when I can hear a whole lot of love?

2797
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:00,650
You know,
to me,

2798
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:05,780
I don't like classical music,
but it doesn't mean that it's not 

2799
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:05,920
awesome to you.
You know?

2800
02:03:05,930 --> 02:03:08,300
It's the same thing with dietary 
choices.

2801
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:11,060
Same thing that the way you dress.
I've had it,

2802
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:13,130
man.
He just enjoy your life.

2803
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:16,670
We've lost a little bit of a tolerance,

2804
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:18,650
dense intolerance,
you know,

2805
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:21,550
it's one of the dumbest things to lose 
its,

2806
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:24,610
you know that diversity is a good thing.
Huge.

2807
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:25,630
So why?
You know,

2808
02:03:25,640 --> 02:03:29,390
why are you taking a dump on somebody 
else's preference that has nothing to do

2809
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:29,810
with you?

2810
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,520
Yeah,
and by the way,

2811
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:36,020
tolerance and acceptance of people 
benefits your life very much directly.

2812
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:41,280
It benefits the way you feel.
The more tolerant and accepting you are 

2813
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,710
a people and the more you don't know,
you're just cool with people.

2814
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:45,500
The more positive interactions you'll 
have,

2815
02:03:45,530 --> 02:03:47,660
the more positive interactions you'll 
have,

2816
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:51,470
the better your your,
your feeling in life will be.

2817
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:54,080
And that's like a real direct thing for 
sure.

2818
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:59,110
And that the,
the negative shit that a lot of people 

2819
02:03:59,110 --> 02:04:00,980
project at people for no reason.
What it really is,

2820
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:04,790
is your own shortcomings and magnified 
through your personality traits.

2821
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:07,100
It has nothing to do with the person 
that's being projected.

2822
02:04:07,101 --> 02:04:12,101
A very rarely does.
Very rarely does he just choose them to 

2823
02:04:12,101 --> 02:04:12,890
for your eye or the target of your 
bullshit,

2824
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:15,860
but the reality is you wouldn't have 
that bullshit.

2825
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:20,980
Like,
I try to explain this to a guy once who 

2826
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:20,980
was a heckler.

2827
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:20,980
I know that.
I was like,

2828
02:04:20,980 --> 02:04:21,620
you're,
you have to be a loser.

2829
02:04:21,621 --> 02:04:23,750
There's no way it can be a winner.
You know what I'm saying?

2830
02:04:23,751 --> 02:04:28,751
Like,
do you really think that Michael Jordan 

2831
02:04:28,751 --> 02:04:31,511
would go to a comedy club and haggle?
Do you think anybody who'd be really 

2832
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:34,061
good at anything would interrupt a 
performance and just try to interject 

2833
02:04:34,061 --> 02:04:36,110
now you have no appreciation for things 
that are good.

2834
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:36,740
Like,
this is a,

2835
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,590
this is,
uh,

2836
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:40,710
a dire moment for you where you need to 
realize this.

2837
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:44,880
Anybody who would try to fuck up 
someone's time,

2838
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,160
if you're trying to fuck up their 
enjoyment,

2839
02:04:47,161 --> 02:04:49,620
you're trying to,
you've got something wrong with you,

2840
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:54,621
man.
You got something wrong with you 100 

2841
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:54,621
percent.
There's no way around it.

2842
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:57,030
You have to be fucked up.
And if you weren't that way,

2843
02:04:57,060 --> 02:04:59,340
you would be happier.
Believe it or not,

2844
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,460
like that energy that you put out is 
palpable.

2845
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:06,360
The energy that you put out being an 
asshole is real and it does come.

2846
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:09,060
It does flavor.
Your light comes back.

2847
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:11,940
Yeah.
And for you,

2848
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:16,770
you feel that's a dietary as well,
right?

2849
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,320
So what do you mean?
You mean?

2850
02:05:18,380 --> 02:05:21,410
I mean as far as like putting out energy
mean you're taking in vegetables,

2851
02:05:21,550 --> 02:05:24,630
you're almost like a pure,
you know,

2852
02:05:24,631 --> 02:05:26,260
that that existence of,
of,

2853
02:05:26,261 --> 02:05:31,230
of only eating vegetables and not,
not being connected to animal farming or

2854
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:34,920
any of that horrible shit that you see 
and we're still all connected to it,

2855
02:05:35,010 --> 02:05:40,010
you know,
but just by virtue of living here and 

2856
02:05:40,010 --> 02:05:40,010
all the other things that we have to do,
do you drive a prius posts?

2857
02:05:40,010 --> 02:05:44,030
I know if you drive a van,
like a fucking muscle cars,

2858
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:48,730
we're very proud of you.
I wish I could fucking.

2859
02:05:48,731 --> 02:05:53,731
What are we?
What have we been talking about these 

2860
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:53,731
past two hours?

2861
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:55,310
I really wish you really wish.
I know it needed to get a kickstart,

2862
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:59,250
tapped out and to get a CTO.
A muscle car.

2863
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:01,590
Yeah.
No,

2864
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:02,760
there's a certain,
um,

2865
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,520
I guess it's,
you know,

2866
02:06:05,521 --> 02:06:09,360
it sounds weird to say it,
but there's definitely like a feeling of

2867
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:13,530
like greater harmony.
The environment makes sense.

2868
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:15,990
It sounds really stupid.
It doesn't,

2869
02:06:15,991 --> 02:06:16,650
you know,
I'm,

2870
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:21,120
I'm going hunting for the first time in 
October with Steve Rinella.

2871
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:25,090
He's a guy who had a TV show on the 
travel channel called the wow within and

2872
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:30,000
now he's got a new one called the 
mediator and his show is essentially his

2873
02:06:30,001 --> 02:06:31,790
original show was all about,
um,

2874
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:37,120
you know,
like sort of like living off the land 

2875
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:37,880
and he would do a lot of things that 
were like really similar to what like,

2876
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:39,500
um,
uh,

2877
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:43,620
people had to do in the 18 hundreds,
like you would kill a water buffalo with

2878
02:06:43,621 --> 02:06:44,940
a musket and shit like that.

2879
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,350
And his new show.
It's all about,

2880
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:49,140
uh,
what you call like fair chase hunting.

2881
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:54,560
And one of the things that I've been,
I'm really paying attention to a lot 

2882
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:59,931
lately is the idea of a hunter gatherer 
lifestyle being I'm actually,

2883
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:03,900
uh,
uh,

2884
02:07:03,901 --> 02:07:08,901
like a physically benefiting experience 
for people and that there are certain 

2885
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:15,110
amounts of,
there's a certain system or a reward 

2886
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:18,201
system that's a in our bodies that is a 
satisfied with growing your own food.

2887
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:25,490
There's a certain reward system that's 
satisfied with the hunting and fishing 

2888
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:28,800
and that our bodies are essentially the 
same as the bodies of people that lived,

2889
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:29,970
you know,
20,000

2890
02:07:29,971 --> 02:07:34,971
years ago.
There's very little genetic change and 

2891
02:07:34,971 --> 02:07:36,070
that we still have these reward systems,
these primal feelings

2892
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,210
of satisfaction that are built into our 
very being as a human being in order to,

2893
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:45,620
to,
to motivate us to do the correct things 

2894
02:07:45,620 --> 02:07:46,900
to survive and to carry on.
And I'm at,

2895
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:49,480
me personally as a,
as a person who is a mediator.

2896
02:07:49,490 --> 02:07:51,970
I've never killed an animal ever,
you know,

2897
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,580
except accidentally like car accidents 
and shit.

2898
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:57,040
You know,
I've never like went hunting.

2899
02:07:57,041 --> 02:08:02,041
I've never actually,
I shot a squirrel with a bb when I was 

2900
02:08:02,041 --> 02:08:04,670
little.
I think I might've killed that little 

2901
02:08:04,670 --> 02:08:04,670
guy.
Sorry,

2902
02:08:04,670 --> 02:08:04,670
sorry.
Squirrel.

2903
02:08:04,670 --> 02:08:06,700
But what I'm saying is I've never hunted
anything and killed what I,

2904
02:08:06,701 --> 02:08:09,550
you know what I,
and I don't know how I'm going to feel,

2905
02:08:09,730 --> 02:08:10,540
you know,
I might,

2906
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:12,430
I might shoot a deer and be like,
okay,

2907
02:08:12,431 --> 02:08:17,431
fuck this.
I need to get some beats because I'm 

2908
02:08:17,431 --> 02:08:17,431
done with this.
Or I might go,

2909
02:08:17,431 --> 02:08:17,431
well,
you know what,

2910
02:08:17,431 --> 02:08:20,650
if I didn't shoot that thing,
it would probably get hit by a car or it

2911
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,240
would get killed by a coyote or you 
know,

2912
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:24,280
it's going to die.

2913
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,050
It's not going to live forever and 
become magical.

2914
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:27,880
What's the term you used?
Fair,

2915
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:29,650
fair chase,
fair chase.

2916
02:08:29,651 --> 02:08:31,720
What does that mean?
That means you don't set a bait.

2917
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:36,840
You don't put out like bait and leave 
food and very certain certain spot over 

2918
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,380
and over again so that you know,
the animals will be there.

2919
02:08:38,590 --> 02:08:43,590
In Texas,
they actually have feeders where they 

2920
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:44,560
have these giant drums that dispense 
food on a timer.

2921
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:49,890
So in the morning,
the deer just start walking in because 

2922
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:52,711
they know they're going to get fed 
because most of the time you're not 

2923
02:08:52,711 --> 02:08:54,661
hunting there because they have giant,
what they call high fence ranches and 

2924
02:08:54,661 --> 02:08:56,890
these high fence ranches,
it's essentially like they've converted.

2925
02:08:56,950 --> 02:09:01,950
They've done like a mixture of farming 
and hunting because it's like,

2926
02:09:02,471 --> 02:09:05,020
it's really like farming.
I mean you're just harvesting,

2927
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:07,120
meet the animal.
You're in a blind.

2928
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,670
The animal walks out the spot.
He goes to every day,

2929
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:14,860
goes to get his food above bloomy.
His heart blows out of his chest and 

2930
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:15,510
he's done.
He lives there with his legs kick in.

2931
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,320
You turned them into meat and you cook 
them up.

2932
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:22,380
And that's,
that's a way more humane solution for 

2933
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:24,460
sure,
than a factory farm.

2934
02:09:24,461 --> 02:09:26,530
No doubt about it.
And I'm not criticizing it,

2935
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:29,480
but that's not what Steven Rinella does 
with Steven Nella does he,

2936
02:09:29,481 --> 02:09:34,481
he believes that the real satisfaction 
comes from like stocking the game,

2937
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:39,820
finding the right place to be when 
you're,

2938
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:43,120
you know,
upwind or downwind and getting away from

2939
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:47,770
the area where the animal can detect you
and you know,

2940
02:09:47,771 --> 02:09:52,480
and stalking and hunting an animal the 
way people did thousands and thousands

2941
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:54,170
years ago.
Did you read,

2942
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:55,910
did you read that book?
Born to run?

2943
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:58,490
No.
So what is it?

2944
02:09:58,530 --> 02:10:00,890
It's called born to run by Christopher 
mcdougall.

2945
02:10:00,891 --> 02:10:05,891
It's an amazing book.
He's a contributing writer to I think 

2946
02:10:05,891 --> 02:10:10,241
men's journal or outside magazine or 
something like that was a hugely 

2947
02:10:10,241 --> 02:10:11,770
successful book that,
that uh,

2948
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:13,790
let me shut this door.
There's people in our.

2949
02:10:15,950 --> 02:10:20,030
Oh,
sorry.

2950
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:23,920
Anyway,
this guy went down to,

2951
02:10:23,921 --> 02:10:26,560
uh,
the Copper Canyon in Mexico,

2952
02:10:26,561 --> 02:10:31,561
which is this really remote area and I 
think it's in the northern part of 

2953
02:10:31,561 --> 02:10:32,020
Mexico,
but below that,

2954
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:33,800
the Arizona board or somewhere

2955
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:39,100
and it's like a land lost in time,
like it's impossible to get in and out 

2956
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:42,641
of there.
And there are these tribes in there 

2957
02:10:42,641 --> 02:10:42,680
called the Tarahumara and uh,
they're like this,

2958
02:10:42,681 --> 02:10:45,020
uh,
this uh,

2959
02:10:46,070 --> 02:10:51,070
population of endurance runners that 
essentially run barefoot with these 

2960
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:51,860
little,
they have little sandals or whatever,

2961
02:10:51,861 --> 02:10:56,861
and,
and they'll run incredible distances 

2962
02:10:56,861 --> 02:10:59,171
and,
and in the course of the book he gets 

2963
02:10:59,171 --> 02:11:02,301
to,
he gets to sort of commune with these 

2964
02:11:02,301 --> 02:11:04,511
people and it goes into kind of like 
ultra running and the barefoot running 

2965
02:11:04,511 --> 02:11:05,360
movement and the history of how they're 
running.

2966
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,520
You know,
how Nike sort of created this business 

2967
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:10,520
around running shoes.
And it's fascinating.

2968
02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:13,550
But I'm,
one of the things he talks about is this

2969
02:11:13,551 --> 02:11:18,530
theory that man evolved as a persistent 
hunter as and that and that we were,

2970
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:23,710
we evolved to be endurance runners 
because we would go to chase down these 

2971
02:11:23,991 --> 02:11:28,991
animals that were better,
faster than us that have much more fast 

2972
02:11:28,991 --> 02:11:28,991
twitch muscle.

2973
02:11:28,991 --> 02:11:29,690
We could,
you can't run as fast as them,

2974
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:32,200
but eventually they just,
they get exhausted.

2975
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,360
They can't run days at a time.
And these humans would just patiently 

2976
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:40,580
like sort of track them and just follow 
them and follow them and follow them.

2977
02:11:40,581 --> 02:11:43,730
And then just wait until the animal,
like keeled over out of dehydration,

2978
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:47,480
exhaustion and that's how they would 
conquer the animal and bring it back to,

2979
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:50,000
to eat people still do it today.
Right.

2980
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:52,220
And so,
so the idea that we were sort of bred to

2981
02:11:52,221 --> 02:11:56,210
be endurance athletes or runners out as 
a result of this,

2982
02:11:56,580 --> 02:12:01,580
you know,
thousands of however many thousands of 

2983
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:01,580
years of doing this.
That's fascinating.

2984
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:01,580
So,
uh,

2985
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,320
did they,
um,

2986
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:07,390
did they use weapons when they first did
it or did they just strangle them and 

2987
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:07,530
hit them with a rock once they.
Yeah,

2988
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:09,350
I think it was sort of like,
it was a really.

2989
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:10,790
They,
these animals,

2990
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:15,440
they'd be so exhausted that there wasn't
much need to do anything severe.

2991
02:12:15,441 --> 02:12:18,890
Like they'd kill over.
They get him with a rock or if we really

2992
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:23,891
knew for sure.
It's like really funny when you have 

2993
02:12:23,891 --> 02:12:24,350
like things like that.
Like how did we develop disability to do

2994
02:12:24,351 --> 02:12:29,351
this?
When did they figure out about 

2995
02:12:29,351 --> 02:12:29,351
persistence,
hunting and running.

2996
02:12:29,351 --> 02:12:29,480
It will be really amazing if we could 
know for sure.

2997
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:34,780
It's so funny about how much of like the
past of human beings is like this weird 

2998
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:41,170
ideas where you're trying to like piece 
it together and like formulate a vision 

2999
02:12:41,170 --> 02:12:45,881
of how things went down.
It's really hard to just extrapolate 

3000
02:12:45,881 --> 02:12:46,070
that across,
you know,

3001
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:51,200
in,
and apply it to a certain nutritional 

3002
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:51,200
way of living.
Like,

3003
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:51,200
you know,
with Paleo,

3004
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:52,610
it's sort of all right,
well Paleolithic,

3005
02:12:52,611 --> 02:12:53,930
but you know,
how many,

3006
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,960
how many thousands of years ago are we 
talking about are millions of years ago 

3007
02:12:58,960 --> 02:12:58,960
for a million,
40 million,

3008
02:12:58,960 --> 02:12:59,780
40,000,
right?

3009
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:01,250
What is it,
where your body,

3010
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:07,550
what part of the world and you know,
certain people's evolved to had an 

3011
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:11,770
approach to food because of what was 
available to them in a different way 

3012
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:11,770
than somewhere else.
And,

3013
02:13:11,770 --> 02:13:16,210
and piecing that puzzle together is.
I mean it's tricky and they've just 

3014
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:21,491
started finding some really interesting 
things that show that you might be 

3015
02:13:21,531 --> 02:13:24,800
dealing with far,
far older societies than we think in the

3016
02:13:24,801 --> 02:13:29,801
first place I could.
They were always pushing the dates back 

3017
02:13:29,801 --> 02:13:29,801
of like when people figured certain 
things out,

3018
02:13:29,801 --> 02:13:32,460
like there's some cave art that they've 
discovered

3019
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:34,530
now that they're,
they're looking at like 40,000

3020
02:13:34,531 --> 02:13:36,300
plus years ago and you're like,
okay,

3021
02:13:36,301 --> 02:13:38,700
this is,
this is just throws things way back,

3022
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:40,220
you know,
there's,

3023
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:45,710
it's a,
it's really a fascinating thing trying 

3024
02:13:45,710 --> 02:13:48,201
to piece together what human beings,
how we become what we are right now and 

3025
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:50,600
what led us to this point,
this,

3026
02:13:50,601 --> 02:13:55,601
this apex of 2012.
The whole process of hunter and 

3027
02:13:55,601 --> 02:13:56,280
gathering of.
I mean that's where people,

3028
02:13:56,281 --> 02:13:59,640
a lot of people say the thing went wrong
and we developed agriculture.

3029
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:04,820
That's one of the thing went wrong.
Then we figured out how to have a 

3030
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:07,191
surplus because then we had to defend 
that surplus and then we had this big 

3031
02:14:07,191 --> 02:14:09,891
fucking forte,
but that was also sort of the birth of 

3032
02:14:09,891 --> 02:14:12,120
civilization and the and the intellect 
to where it went wrong.

3033
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:13,590
What went wrong?
Man,

3034
02:14:13,591 --> 02:14:14,960
we fucked it up,
fucked it up.

3035
02:14:14,961 --> 02:14:19,961
I thinking we could have been having a 
great time back in the spending a week 

3036
02:14:19,961 --> 02:14:23,550
chasing down one because yeah,
the video where the guy does it,

3037
02:14:23,551 --> 02:14:24,600
he does it in Africa.

3038
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:27,400
The video that I saw and he's fucking 
persistent.

3039
02:14:27,401 --> 02:14:28,620
Haunting,
so he just lit.

3040
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:31,260
How long did it take him forever.
It was a long day.

3041
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:36,520
He just kept chasing this fucking thing 
and at the end he was so tired and the 

3042
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:37,410
they said that the guy doesn't even eat 
it.

3043
02:14:37,411 --> 02:14:42,411
The Guy who kills the animal didn't even
eat it out of respect for the process or

3044
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:48,740
you know,
the connection that he has to the 

3045
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:48,740
animal,
which we.

3046
02:14:48,740 --> 02:14:52,611
That's the weirdest thing.
And I think one of the weirdest things 

3047
02:14:52,611 --> 02:14:55,050
about human beings is our lack of 
connection to what food is.

3048
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:56,520
You know,
people that are,

3049
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:59,940
they get upset if you want to go hunting
yet they're wearing leather.

3050
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:03,510
People that eat meat but would never 
kill it themselves.

3051
02:15:03,511 --> 02:15:08,511
It's like we've really like figured out 
a way to completely disconnect people 

3052
02:15:09,181 --> 02:15:10,710
from the process,
which I just can't.

3053
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:15,690
I can't see that being natural while 
still living with this ignorance denial.

3054
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:18,290
And disassociation are very powerful and
they're,

3055
02:15:18,291 --> 02:15:21,960
they're powerful defense mechanisms for 
just getting through the day.

3056
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:24,660
Yeah.
How do you fix that?

3057
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:26,280
How do you,
how do you,

3058
02:15:26,281 --> 02:15:27,660
uh,
is there a way to,

3059
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:32,960
to inspire,
inspire in the classroom some,

3060
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:37,350
a different way of looking at things so 
that people don't grow up to be the same

3061
02:15:37,590 --> 02:15:40,500
fucked up pattern monkeys over and over 
and over again?

3062
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:46,070
Well,
it's weird because in some ways I feel 

3063
02:15:46,070 --> 02:15:48,771
like it's changing and it's getting 
better and in an otherwise I feel like 

3064
02:15:48,771 --> 02:15:48,771
it's moving backwards.
I mean,

3065
02:15:48,771 --> 02:15:52,971
when you have the Internet and you have 
all this unbelievable amount of 

3066
02:15:52,971 --> 02:15:56,391
information available to you where you 
can find out anything in an instant and 

3067
02:15:56,391 --> 02:15:59,640
you can get to the bottom of what's 
happening in subject x,

3068
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:01,890
uh,
that's like a good thing,

3069
02:16:01,891 --> 02:16:02,190
right?

3070
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:07,190
Like,
it pulls the covers on a lot of people 

3071
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:07,190
and a lot of organizations and what have
you.

3072
02:16:07,190 --> 02:16:11,990
And yet at the same time you have 
traditional media that's becoming even 

3073
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:12,370
more and more entrenched.
You know,

3074
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:15,750
it's sort of like remember when we were 
kids it was like the local news and that

3075
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:20,751
was how you got your news,
you're going to believe what they tell 

3076
02:16:20,751 --> 02:16:22,290
you and and now it's with the Internet,
it's,

3077
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:27,320
you watch the news and you're like,
well I don't know if that's the whole 

3078
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:27,860
story and saying this and it's easy to 
go online and,

3079
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:30,070
and you know,
extrapolate upon that

3080
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,130
and find out more and figure out why 
they're not telling you this part of the

3081
02:16:33,131 --> 02:16:35,470
story or that.
Whereas he didn't have that before.

3082
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:41,040
Yet at the same time I feel like we're 
more and more entrenched in this fear 

3083
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,410
based culture in which there's a clamp 
down and so where does that lead us?

3084
02:16:44,411 --> 02:16:48,030
Like is it ultimately,
does that like implode on itself or like

3085
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:48,660
where,
what,

3086
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:50,650
how does it all play out?
How does that all play out?

3087
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:51,520
That's the question,

3088
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:53,420
right?
I mean it is playing out and I think,

3089
02:16:53,740 --> 02:16:55,940
believe it or not,
without sounding grandiose,

3090
02:16:56,450 --> 02:16:59,900
conversations like this are a part of 
the decision making process.

3091
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:02,740
It's a part of how society looks at it,
about,

3092
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:06,140
about how we approach it,
because there's a lot of people that are

3093
02:17:06,141 --> 02:17:09,260
like you that realizes this is,
that this is not natural,

3094
02:17:09,261 --> 02:17:14,261
this is,
is this whole thing is bizarre and it 

3095
02:17:14,261 --> 02:17:15,170
can go wrong.
It can all go wrong.

3096
02:17:15,171 --> 02:17:17,330
The whole fear based culture that you 
brought up,

3097
02:17:17,331 --> 02:17:18,380
the idea of the,
the,

3098
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:21,560
the,
the lack of civil liberties,

3099
02:17:21,630 --> 02:17:26,630
uh,
the lack of privacy that we really have 

3100
02:17:26,630 --> 02:17:29,081
in this country now,
the laws that are being passed over and 

3101
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:31,181
over again that allow people to look 
into your stuff because you might be a 

3102
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:31,181
terrorist.
I mean,

3103
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:33,140
how did we not learn from the mccarthy 
era?

3104
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:37,360
How did we not learn that the way is not
to crack district.

3105
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:41,670
We're distracted by our iphones and the 
Kardashians and you know what I mean,

3106
02:17:41,671 --> 02:17:45,330
like people are,
there is a malays know and,

3107
02:17:45,331 --> 02:17:47,050
and technology,
you know,

3108
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:50,570
plays a huge part in that,
in distracting us.

3109
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:52,290
Like again,
it's like the Matrix,

3110
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:53,160
you know,
it's crazy.

3111
02:17:53,930 --> 02:17:58,930
Well,
I said it's weird because you used to 

3112
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:02,691
be,
if you were to talk about this kind of 

3113
02:18:02,691 --> 02:18:04,341
stuff or propose any of these ideas,
you were just a crazy conspiracy 

3114
02:18:04,341 --> 02:18:04,341
theorist,
but now it's,

3115
02:18:04,341 --> 02:18:09,110
there's too many crazy things going on 
too to not realize that there's a lot of

3116
02:18:11,161 --> 02:18:16,161
truth to all this stuff.
I mean everything from like the the 

3117
02:18:16,161 --> 02:18:17,910
label on the front of a food product 
that you buy that's telling you this and

3118
02:18:17,911 --> 02:18:22,911
that when you turn around and look at 
the nutrition facts panel and you 

3119
02:18:22,911 --> 02:18:26,211
realize it's nonsense.
Or how about genetically modified foods 

3120
02:18:26,211 --> 02:18:26,211
now?
That's insane.

3121
02:18:26,211 --> 02:18:27,300
Have you had looked at.
I mean

3122
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:28,250
it,
you know,

3123
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:29,820
so I mean the people that are making 
them.

3124
02:18:29,821 --> 02:18:32,730
Have you looked down the road 20 years 
and found out what people are gonna?

3125
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,410
What's gonna happen when peanut elite 
these,

3126
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:37,720
what's going to alter the environment 
like your past.

3127
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:40,240
You're developing a fucking thing that 
has a natural pessimist

3128
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:45,510
and humans are not.
We're not wired to be forward thinking 

3129
02:18:45,510 --> 02:18:47,550
or to consider the long play.
You know,

3130
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:51,950
we're a bunch of scary creeps button 
pushing these monkeys banks.

3131
02:18:51,970 --> 02:18:55,420
Until recently somebody said,
I can't remember where I heard this,

3132
02:18:55,421 --> 02:18:59,890
but if all the insects died that uh,
if all,

3133
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:02,090
if all the insects died,
the,

3134
02:19:02,091 --> 02:19:07,091
uh,
the whole earth would be dead in 50 

3135
02:19:07,091 --> 02:19:07,091
years or something like that.
But if all the humans died,

3136
02:19:07,091 --> 02:19:10,450
the earth would be,
we'd repair itself.

3137
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,080
I believe that.

3138
02:19:11,780 --> 02:19:12,620
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3139
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:13,350
I mean,
the,

3140
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:16,370
just the massive ants and the jobs that 
ants do.

3141
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:20,600
People don't understand,
know gazelles have to be there.

3142
02:19:20,630 --> 02:19:22,070
Then that means you have to have 
cheetahs.

3143
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:23,810
You have to have something that cleans 
things up.

3144
02:19:24,170 --> 02:19:29,170
And you know,
ants play a very important role in the 

3145
02:19:29,170 --> 02:19:29,170
of shit that

3146
02:19:29,170 --> 02:19:29,480
we leave around.
I mean,

3147
02:19:29,490 --> 02:19:30,710
aunts have,
you know,

3148
02:19:30,711 --> 02:19:33,050
when you leave something on the table 
and the ants swarm it,

3149
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:35,570
that's they're supposed to do.
They find shit on the ground.

3150
02:19:35,571 --> 02:19:37,250
They find dead bodies.
They find everything.

3151
02:19:37,251 --> 02:19:42,251
They and they go to work.
What about all of this craziness with 

3152
02:19:42,251 --> 02:19:42,251
the bees?
It's weird.

3153
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:47,440
It's very weird.
It's weird because there's a bunch of 

3154
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:47,990
different theories and no one seems to 
know what the fuck it is.

3155
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:53,110
Some people say it's cell phones and 
that the extra cell phone signals are 

3156
02:19:53,110 --> 02:19:56,681
fucking with the bees and I've talked to
experts and they say there's no doubt 

3157
02:19:56,681 --> 02:19:56,840
about it,
that it has an effect on the bees,

3158
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:02,080
that the frequency that they operate in,
that they can pick up bands of radio 

3159
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:05,360
waves and things because their antenna,
I mean they communicate with each other.

3160
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:09,860
We had a thing on fear factor once where
we cover these people and bees and uh,

3161
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:10,760
when we were.

3162
02:20:10,890 --> 02:20:15,890
We were out in this place called Sable 
ranch and it's a huge ranch and natural 

3163
02:20:16,131 --> 02:20:21,131
hive of bees was at the ranch.
So there they have all these bees on 

3164
02:20:21,131 --> 02:20:25,181
these people.
These local bees came flying in like a 

3165
02:20:25,181 --> 02:20:28,130
giant group of them and they all made a 
huge cloud in the sky.

3166
02:20:28,131 --> 02:20:30,290
And the a b handlers like,
all right everybody,

3167
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:32,450
let's back away from this.
Everybody get way back.

3168
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:35,150
They've got to work this out.
So they worked it out.

3169
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:38,030
They communicated with each other and 
they found out who was who.

3170
02:20:38,150 --> 02:20:41,280
And then the local bees like separated 
and they let the law,

3171
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:44,560
the bees that were this guy's honeybees,
the train be,

3172
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:45,940
they're never trained,
you know,

3173
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:50,960
the contained bs,
I guess you would say let them go about 

3174
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:54,011
their business.
But it's like there was some 

3175
02:20:54,011 --> 02:20:54,590
communication going on and this guy said
they had to work this out.

3176
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:56,810
Like that's how he described it.
And I go,

3177
02:20:56,811 --> 02:20:57,900
what do you mean work it out?
Like,

3178
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:59,180
what's,
what's going on here?

3179
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:01,430
That's incredible.
It was amazing because I,

3180
02:21:01,480 --> 02:21:04,220
I,
and what's amazing is that nobody seemed

3181
02:21:04,221 --> 02:21:05,750
to give a fuck.
You know,

3182
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:06,920
I,
I was,

3183
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:10,100
I was baffled by like,
are they up there talking?

3184
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:12,270
Are they talking right now?
His bees were like,

3185
02:21:13,690 --> 02:21:18,020
they all got together and I was amazed 
that this guy knew what was going on,

3186
02:21:18,140 --> 02:21:23,140
that he knew that some local bees came 
in and he knew that that's all they had 

3187
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:23,950
to do.
They just had to get together and talk.

3188
02:21:23,951 --> 02:21:25,190
And I'm like,
how often does this happen?

3189
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:30,400
And he's like,
it happens all the time that bees find 

3190
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:31,040
out there's some other bs in their area.
Like what the fuck are they finding out?

3191
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,470
I guess they send scouts,
maybe they have one.

3192
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:34,460
God's like,
dude,

3193
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:37,100
there's a fucking hundred guys I never 
met before.

3194
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:42,160
How does this come out?
And then come back and communicate that 

3195
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:42,470
information to get everyone else to come
out.

3196
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,810
Yeah.
They say they do it through pheromones.

3197
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:45,510
You know,
there,

3198
02:21:45,530 --> 02:21:50,530
there's a lot of um,
there's a lot of confusion about how 

3199
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:54,371
they do it and what,
what level of communication they 

3200
02:21:54,371 --> 02:21:54,371
actually have because they're so alien 
to us.

3201
02:21:54,650 --> 02:21:55,170
I mean,
they're,

3202
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:56,930
what they fascinating because it using 
our.

3203
02:21:57,090 --> 02:21:59,630
One of our cell phone networks are part 
of this texting each other.

3204
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:04,960
I think they're just getting jacked.
I think our cell phone networks like 

3205
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:05,330
Jackhammers,
but they don't,

3206
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:07,180
they can't find them either.
You know,

3207
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:08,540
it's sort of like,
well where are they?

3208
02:22:08,570 --> 02:22:10,490
Where are they going?
Well,

3209
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:12,200
they're not disappearing.
They're dying.

3210
02:22:12,201 --> 02:22:13,750
They're not breathing properly.
Right?

3211
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:15,260
Yeah.
It's crazy.

3212
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:17,030
And if we don't have bees,
especially,

3213
02:22:17,031 --> 02:22:18,770
honeybees were really fucked.

3214
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:22,850
We need to come up with little robot 
bees that do a better job than B's.

3215
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:26,430
Little tiny microscopic robots that go 
out and pollinate.

3216
02:22:26,431 --> 02:22:27,750
Shit.
What is that?

3217
02:22:27,751 --> 02:22:28,530
So hard?
Yeah.

3218
02:22:28,531 --> 02:22:30,480
Why do you have to have drones to kill 
people in Pakistan?

3219
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:35,630
But some drone bees so complex.
If we have this bad ass be that's less 

3220
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:37,530
complex and we control that little 
motherfucker.

3221
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,900
All it has to do is pollinate.
I don't,

3222
02:22:39,901 --> 02:22:41,220
you know,
we can make our own hunting.

3223
02:22:41,221 --> 02:22:43,020
I'm pretty sure we don't need base for 
that.

3224
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:48,021
Right?
Can we figure out a way to make 

3225
02:22:48,021 --> 02:22:49,401
artificial honey?
Probably not like they say that local 

3226
02:22:49,401 --> 02:22:50,700
honey,
I'm from the area that you are,

3227
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:55,850
contains a of protection from the local 
ailments.

3228
02:22:56,250 --> 02:23:01,250
Like say if there's local colds going on
that it would be a good anti a 

3229
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:06,500
antioxidant or what not not sure,
but a good prevention from a,

3230
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:12,080
from catching local colds that a raw 
honey raw food really is where it's at.

3231
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:17,541
I mean,
the real problem with milk for a lot of 

3232
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:17,541
people is the um,
the uh,

3233
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:18,690
the fact that you have to get it 
homogenize it.

3234
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:20,820
Pasteurize.
If you get raw milk,

3235
02:23:20,821 --> 02:23:24,180
it's way easier to digest.
I don't necessarily know.

3236
02:23:24,190 --> 02:23:26,300
I mean crazy.
Well,

3237
02:23:26,310 --> 02:23:27,180
I mean that whole thing.
Yeah,

3238
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:29,460
went down in Santa Monica.
I think they're still in.

3239
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:34,520
What happened there was that there's a 
Santa Monica co-op or there some place 

3240
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:39,381
in Santa Monica that was selling raw 
milk and a government like clamped down 

3241
02:23:39,381 --> 02:23:40,680
ahead.
They like rated the place.

3242
02:23:40,681 --> 02:23:45,681
I guess they'd given him a couple of 
warnings or maybe a donor like a mellow 

3243
02:23:45,681 --> 02:23:49,431
rate earlier and they kept,
they kept trying to sell raw milk and 

3244
02:23:49,431 --> 02:23:50,790
then they finally went in guns blazing 
and shut them down.

3245
02:23:50,791 --> 02:23:51,990
And there's always lawsuits now.

3246
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:57,170
Yeah.
They get the kind of sound like a 

3247
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,170
million dollars bail or something crazy.
Right,

3248
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,170
right.
Well,

3249
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:59,250
what I have found out those,
that raw milk is still legal.

3250
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,830
You can buy raw milk in this country,
in this state.

3251
02:24:01,980 --> 02:24:06,980
What did they,
what did the guy do that with some 

3252
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:09,351
regulatory issue,
but sprouts in woodland hills has raw 

3253
02:24:09,931 --> 02:24:10,770
milk.
They do,

3254
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:15,950
yeah.
There's certain companies that in 

3255
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:15,950
California sell raw milk.

3256
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:16,180
Huh?

3257
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:17,600
Yeah.
Hold on.

3258
02:24:18,740 --> 02:24:19,700
There's a,
there's a,

3259
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:20,540
a,
a,

3260
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:21,740
a,
a famous,

3261
02:24:21,741 --> 02:24:24,530
a raw milk company.
And they,

3262
02:24:24,531 --> 02:24:27,200
um,
they,

3263
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:32,290
uh,
they list where they sell it and they 

3264
02:24:32,290 --> 02:24:34,270
sell it at quite a few different places.
Yeah.

3265
02:24:34,271 --> 02:24:37,510
And we need to find the law on that 
because a raw milk.

3266
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:44,580
I was under the mistaken impression that
it was illegal because they pulled it 

3267
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:47,731
out of whole foods foods.
Raw Milk Los Angeles.

3268
02:24:48,970 --> 02:24:50,020
Yeah.
Let me see here.

3269
02:24:50,710 --> 02:24:51,950
Yeah.
But yeah,

3270
02:24:51,970 --> 02:24:54,060
you can get.
There's websites that are out there.

3271
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:55,960
What happened with that guy in Santa 
Monica?

3272
02:24:55,961 --> 02:25:00,400
Because that was a gnarly situation.
There's actually a raw milk,

3273
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:05,440
a store in Hollywood shout out to the 
old PDC hub,

3274
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:09,220
a raw milk store where you can buy raw 
milk and La.

3275
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:10,630
Yeah.
Oops.

3276
02:25:10,631 --> 02:25:14,860
Every now and then it sickens 10 people 
raw milk seconds.

3277
02:25:14,861 --> 02:25:15,790
Ten people.
Well,

3278
02:25:15,791 --> 02:25:17,170
you know,
thinking about raw milk is,

3279
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:22,190
it's like thing you're not supposed to 
be able to take milk and it sits on the 

3280
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:22,840
couch or it sits rather,
uh,

3281
02:25:22,841 --> 02:25:24,850
in frigerator for a fucking week

3282
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:26,350
and a half.
And it's still good.

3283
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:29,320
That's crazy.
Like that doesn't exist in nature.

3284
02:25:29,321 --> 02:25:31,990
You can't take a steak and leave it in 
your fridge for a week.

3285
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:36,991
And a half,
it looks like shit smells terrible 

3286
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:36,991
because it's rotting,
you know,

3287
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:40,921
and that's that that's going on with 
your milk to like at a certain point in 

3288
02:25:40,921 --> 02:25:40,921
time,
like it's not going to be good anymore.

3289
02:25:40,921 --> 02:25:43,420
You can't just put that homogenized,
pasteurized shit.

3290
02:25:43,421 --> 02:25:46,770
You just leave it in there.
Weeks later stays good for you,

3291
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:48,430
open the top,
weeks later you smell it.

3292
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:50,410
It's fine.
That's crazy.

3293
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:55,440
I mean we,
we've figured out a way to preserve 

3294
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:58,081
things and make them all fucking funky.
Did you have a Milkman when you were a 

3295
02:25:58,081 --> 02:25:58,540
kid?
For a very brief point in time?

3296
02:25:58,541 --> 02:26:01,300
I think my grandparents did because I do
remember it,

3297
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:03,220
but it was,
I don't think it was our house,

3298
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:05,650
but I do remember it.
So I think it was my grandparents,

3299
02:26:05,651 --> 02:26:08,370
but they had like a glass bottle with a 
foil top.

3300
02:26:08,430 --> 02:26:09,120
Yeah,
exactly.

3301
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:11,190
Does mean,
does that even exist anymore?

3302
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:14,650
Somebody must offer that service.
There's always these,

3303
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:18,460
like small companies,
like grass fed is a big issue now with a

3304
02:26:18,461 --> 02:26:19,910
lot of people.
Um,

3305
02:26:20,380 --> 02:26:25,380
specifically before we end this,
I wanted to find out what is wrong with 

3306
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:27,280
what the Paleo guys are saying and in 
your opinion,

3307
02:26:27,281 --> 02:26:28,740
and like what,
uh,

3308
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:31,180
what,
what is faulty about their thinking,

3309
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:34,300
what's faulty about they're thinking?
Well,

3310
02:26:34,301 --> 02:26:39,301
I think that that was problematic for me
is this idea that it's this low,

3311
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:44,710
it's a low carb focus,
right?

3312
02:26:44,711 --> 02:26:46,660
It's low carb,
high protein.

3313
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:51,700
I think the focus is to eat like people 
eight thousands of years ago because 

3314
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:54,290
that's how our body set up essentially 
like just vegetables,

3315
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:55,550
the,
uh,

3316
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:56,290
the,
um,

3317
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,690
the research on how we ate thousands of 
years ago.

3318
02:26:59,691 --> 02:27:04,691
Again,
going back to what we talked about 

3319
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:04,691
before,
like,

3320
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:04,691
you know,
there's,

3321
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:04,691
there's holes in that.
So is there.

3322
02:27:04,691 --> 02:27:07,130
Yeah,
I mean we were hunters and gatherers,

3323
02:27:07,131 --> 02:27:12,131
so there's a gathering part to that that
gets overlooked in favor of the hunting 

3324
02:27:12,131 --> 02:27:13,630
part because that's a little sexier,
I guess it is.

3325
02:27:15,590 --> 02:27:16,340
But,
uh,

3326
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,770
the idea of eating,
you know,

3327
02:27:18,830 --> 02:27:20,320
such a,
such a low,

3328
02:27:20,350 --> 02:27:23,300
like the no grain thing,
the no fruit thing,

3329
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:25,180
all of that to,
you know,

3330
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:27,890
focus on the meat,
the saturated fat,

3331
02:27:27,891 --> 02:27:30,700
the high protein,
low carbohydrate is,

3332
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:36,080
is sort of in a certain respect is kind 
of an extrapolation of the Atkins Diet,

3333
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:39,170
you know,
which is where this whole idea of,

3334
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:41,000
you know,
this way of eating,

3335
02:27:41,001 --> 02:27:43,580
which helps you lose weight relatively 
quickly,

3336
02:27:43,581 --> 02:27:44,980
but also,
um,

3337
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:49,790
can cause you problems with ketosis and 
eating too much protein which can,

3338
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:51,080
which can be damaging.

3339
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,860
And so as a,
you know,

3340
02:27:52,970 --> 02:27:56,120
as an athlete,
like I don't know how you're supposed to

3341
02:27:56,121 --> 02:27:58,340
function without eating more 
carbohydrates.

3342
02:27:58,341 --> 02:28:03,341
Like I couldn't do it without eating 
plenty of grains and fruit and that's 

3343
02:28:03,341 --> 02:28:04,790
just speaking from my own experience.
But,

3344
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:07,520
um,
my biggest thing is again,

3345
02:28:07,521 --> 02:28:09,140
going back to what we talked about 
earlier,

3346
02:28:09,141 --> 02:28:14,141
which is,
which is this incredible incidents of 

3347
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:18,950
western disease that we have to deal 
with here.

3348
02:28:19,130 --> 02:28:24,130
You know,
and when people are dropping dead of 

3349
02:28:24,130 --> 02:28:24,290
heart attacks left and right,
and it's a gigantic problem.

3350
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:24,920
And,
you know,

3351
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:27,140
diabetes,
obesity,

3352
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,910
Alzheimer's,
all these kinds of things,

3353
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:34,120
and there are studies that link animal 
products to the incidence of these 

3354
02:28:34,191 --> 02:28:38,480
diseases and that to me it makes more 
sense to eat,

3355
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:41,600
plant based and the studies show that 
when you eat a plant based diet,

3356
02:28:41,630 --> 02:28:46,630
you can actually prevent yourself from 
contracting these essentially foodborne 

3357
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:47,660
illnesses.

3358
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:49,920
So that's.
So it's not that I'm,

3359
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:55,020
I have some huge beef with Paleo per se.
Um,

3360
02:28:55,070 --> 02:28:57,710
I'm just more plant based Diet and 
again,

3361
02:28:57,711 --> 02:28:58,440
I think there's,
you know,

3362
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:03,480
a lot of cool stuff about Paleo.
Like I love the evolutionary fitness 

3363
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:03,680
aspect of it,
you know,

3364
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:08,740
those sort of returned to moving your 
body and the kettle balls and the focus 

3365
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:11,000
on core strength and how that birth 
cross fit and all of that.

3366
02:29:11,001 --> 02:29:14,000
I think that's fantastic.
Yeah,

3367
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:14,600
there's,
you know,

3368
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:16,180
and it's certainly,
you know,

3369
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:21,190
I think that a plant based diet and the 
Paleo Diet have a lot more in common 

3370
02:29:21,591 --> 02:29:26,300
than they do differences when compared 
to a standard American diet for sure.

3371
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:29,090
You know,
standard American diet isn't even really

3372
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:30,980
a diet,
it's just a filler.

3373
02:29:31,190 --> 02:29:36,190
I know,
but the problem is that if you ask 

3374
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:36,190
people,
90 percent of people,

3375
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:38,000
if you ask them will tell you they eat 
healthy,

3376
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:43,030
when in fact it's probably like one 
percent of people that actually eat 

3377
02:29:43,030 --> 02:29:44,300
healthy or everybody wouldn't be keeling
over with heart disease.

3378
02:29:44,330 --> 02:29:49,330
You know,
and I think that heart disease starts 

3379
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:49,330
when you're a teenager,
you know,

3380
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:53,460
you start clogging those arteries at a 
very young age and you hear these 

3381
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:53,460
stories of like,
oh,

3382
02:29:53,460 --> 02:29:55,250
I had no symptoms and then I killed over
from a heart attack.

3383
02:29:55,251 --> 02:30:00,251
Well,
you've been working on that disease for 

3384
02:30:00,251 --> 02:30:00,251
20 years,
you know what I mean?

3385
02:30:00,251 --> 02:30:03,440
And it's a real problem and it just 
doesn't need to exist.

3386
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:08,620
And so from everything I've read,
the best way to prevent that is to cut 

3387
02:30:08,931 --> 02:30:10,620
the meat and dairy out of your diet.
You know,

3388
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:15,640
I don't know how to.
I don't know how to say it any other 

3389
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:15,640
way.
So why did the Paleo guys deny this?

3390
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:19,070
Paleo guys seem to point to the fact 
that there's an actual benefit to eating

3391
02:30:19,071 --> 02:30:24,071
meat and that a vegetarian diet or Vegan
Diet does not have all the nutritional 

3392
02:30:24,071 --> 02:30:27,110
benefits of a mediating protein eating 
diets.

3393
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:28,700
I don't know why they say that because I
don't.

3394
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:30,380
I don't believe that to be true.
I mean,

3395
02:30:30,381 --> 02:30:32,300
if they're saying that you can't,
you can't,

3396
02:30:32,330 --> 02:30:34,610
you can't thrive on a Vegan Diet.
I mean it's just,

3397
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:36,680
it's an,
it's an ill founded.

3398
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,520
It's an ill founded statement.
I mean,

3399
02:30:38,521 --> 02:30:40,880
I think even rob himself said,
you know,

3400
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:45,910
lots of guys do well on a Vegan diet and
he said he tried a Vegan diet and it 

3401
02:30:45,910 --> 02:30:48,680
ultimately he lost a ton of weight.
I think he said he lost a whole bunch of

3402
02:30:48,681 --> 02:30:53,681
weight or whatever and I can't remember 
why he said he decided to not do it 

3403
02:30:53,681 --> 02:30:57,671
anymore,
whether he wasn't feeling good or 

3404
02:30:57,671 --> 02:30:57,671
whatever,
but I'd be interested in knowing what it

3405
02:30:57,671 --> 02:30:59,180
was that he was eating because I think 
most people that say,

3406
02:30:59,181 --> 02:31:01,030
yeah,
I tried a Vegan Diet didn't work for me.

3407
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:02,090
I felt lousy.

3408
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:03,650
Well,
I don't know what that means.

3409
02:31:03,651 --> 02:31:08,651
You know,
I mean you can be a junk food vegan and 

3410
02:31:08,651 --> 02:31:09,470
eat terribly and being the nutrient 
deprived for sure.

3411
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:10,610
You know,
so it's not about,

3412
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:15,020
it's not about eating tofurkey and fake 
chicken fingers,

3413
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:16,780
it's about the whole foods,
you know,

3414
02:31:16,820 --> 02:31:21,820
the whole food,
plant based Diet and that means you 

3415
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:22,200
know,
similar to Paleo,

3416
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,180
getting rid of the oils,
you know,

3417
02:31:24,181 --> 02:31:25,260
or,
or you know,

3418
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:28,650
reducing the oil as well,
not the saturated fats,

3419
02:31:28,651 --> 02:31:30,600
but the other fats,
I mean this most,

3420
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:32,400
you know,
most of the plant based oils aren't,

3421
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:35,250
don't have saturated.
I mean coconut oil does or a couple that

3422
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:35,610
do,

3423
02:31:36,890 --> 02:31:38,640
but you know,
it's actually still.

3424
02:31:39,430 --> 02:31:40,310
Yeah,
exactly.

3425
02:31:40,311 --> 02:31:45,311
But,
but those are those also contribute to 

3426
02:31:45,311 --> 02:31:45,840
arthrosclerosis and stuff like that?
No,

3427
02:31:46,250 --> 02:31:50,650
just oils and oils in general.
Coconut oil can continue if you are.

3428
02:31:50,710 --> 02:31:55,710
Yeah,
I mean there is a certain contingent of 

3429
02:31:55,710 --> 02:31:57,020
the whole food plant based Diet movement
that basically say no oils,

3430
02:31:57,250 --> 02:31:59,050
no oils in your diet.
What?

3431
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:03,010
But I thought that essential oils are 
essential for brain function and

3432
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:06,560
for there are these are,
these are the people that are.

3433
02:32:06,590 --> 02:32:09,290
This is like the Dr Esselstyn.
The t Colin Campbell,

3434
02:32:09,291 --> 02:32:12,530
like the cores or whatever,
and they're speaking to people that have

3435
02:32:12,531 --> 02:32:17,531
suffered heart attacks or you know,
are in seriously poor health and are in 

3436
02:32:17,531 --> 02:32:19,850
a position where they really need to 
reverse the condition that they're in.

3437
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:22,700
So it's an,
it's an extreme situation.

3438
02:32:22,701 --> 02:32:23,660
Personally,
I,

3439
02:32:23,690 --> 02:32:24,580
you know,
I eat oils,

3440
02:32:24,670 --> 02:32:29,670
I put coconut oil on my morning,
vitamax I like olive oil on my dressing 

3441
02:32:29,670 --> 02:32:30,330
or whatever.
I try not to Overdo it,

3442
02:32:30,331 --> 02:32:35,331
I judicious about it,
but I feel like I need that in order to 

3443
02:32:35,331 --> 02:32:37,760
get the calories that I need to train 
the way that I want to train.

3444
02:32:38,310 --> 02:32:43,310
Yeah.
Because there's a lot of people that 

3445
02:32:43,310 --> 02:32:43,830
believe that fats and oils are,
they're critical to,

3446
02:32:43,831 --> 02:32:44,820
uh,
to brain function.

3447
02:32:45,950 --> 02:32:50,950
Not only that,
there are a very efficient source of 

3448
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:50,950
energy,
especially in endurance sports because,

3449
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:54,920
you know,
every gram of fat has much more whatever

3450
02:32:54,921 --> 02:32:56,710
it is,
kilojoules of energy than,

3451
02:32:56,750 --> 02:33:00,620
than a gram of sugar or carbohydrate 
really.

3452
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:01,780
So,
um,

3453
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:03,970
you're better when it's metabolized in a
different way,

3454
02:33:03,970 --> 02:33:04,990
way,
you know what I mean?

3455
02:33:04,991 --> 02:33:08,350
Like it in an endurance sports,
you're always looking at,

3456
02:33:08,410 --> 02:33:09,190
you know,
sort of what,

3457
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:14,340
what zone of exertion your training in 
and that can be calculated by heart 

3458
02:33:15,191 --> 02:33:20,191
rate,
like wearing a heart rate monitor or on 

3459
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:20,191
a bike by a power meter that measures 
the amount of watts,

3460
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:22,030
like the force that you're exerting on 
the pedal.

3461
02:33:22,510 --> 02:33:27,510
And you can be very specific about what 
your exertion level is and how that 

3462
02:33:27,821 --> 02:33:31,150
correlates to which energy mechanism 
you're using.

3463
02:33:31,151 --> 02:33:36,151
And so when you're an endurance athlete,
you want to really emphasize the fat 

3464
02:33:36,151 --> 02:33:37,570
burning zone,
which is like the lower intensity of the

3465
02:33:37,571 --> 02:33:42,040
aerobic anaerobic zone of energy,
which is kind of like just below that,

3466
02:33:42,280 --> 02:33:45,340
that level where you feel like you're,
you're getting a little too winded,

3467
02:33:45,370 --> 02:33:46,390
you know what I mean?
And that's,

3468
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:50,770
it's a certain level of exertion in 
which you're metabolizing fat for energy

3469
02:33:50,771 --> 02:33:55,771
as opposed to glycogen.
And if you're metabolizing fat for 

3470
02:33:55,771 --> 02:33:55,771
energy,
you can essentially go all day.

3471
02:33:55,870 --> 02:33:57,490
The more you train that,
that mechanism,

3472
02:33:57,491 --> 02:33:59,150
it gets more and more efficient.
Um,

3473
02:33:59,410 --> 02:34:04,410
but if you are,
if your exertion ramps up and you're 

3474
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:04,840
burning glycogen,
all of a sudden for energy,

3475
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:08,530
you're only going to be able to go about
90 minutes before you run out of fuel.

3476
02:34:08,531 --> 02:34:13,531
You can deplete your glycogen stores.
You're Never gonna Deplete your fat 

3477
02:34:13,531 --> 02:34:14,620
stores.
There's just too much of it.

3478
02:34:15,210 --> 02:34:18,040
So you can train your body to burn off 
fat.

3479
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,920
Instead of training your body to burn 
off carbohydrates,

3480
02:34:21,440 --> 02:34:25,150
you're training,
you're training your body to utilize fat

3481
02:34:25,151 --> 02:34:26,890
for energy.
So it's not like you're,

3482
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:28,180
you're,
you know,

3483
02:34:28,181 --> 02:34:29,920
there's a difference between dietary 
fat,

3484
02:34:29,921 --> 02:34:31,570
subcutaneous fat,
but we all have,

3485
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:33,370
no matter how lean you are and how 
matter,

3486
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:34,330
you know,
I've gotten very,

3487
02:34:34,331 --> 02:34:39,331
very lean.
You still have a lot of fat in your 

3488
02:34:39,331 --> 02:34:39,820
system that's available as an energy 
resource.

3489
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:42,850
And how do you train your body to do 
that by,

3490
02:34:42,910 --> 02:34:47,910
by being very specific about the 
training zones and the exertion levels 

3491
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:48,190
that you're,
that you're,

3492
02:34:48,191 --> 02:34:50,080
uh,
that you're,

3493
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:51,580
that you're doing,
whether it's running,

3494
02:34:51,581 --> 02:34:53,710
swimming or biking.
So for example,

3495
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:58,740
cycling is like a perfect machine for,
for the human because you can rig it all

3496
02:34:59,771 --> 02:35:03,760
up to a computer and you can be very,
very specific about what your output is.

3497
02:35:03,761 --> 02:35:06,760
You have a heart rate monitor,
you have the bikes these days,

3498
02:35:06,761 --> 02:35:07,960
have a computer on it,
right?

3499
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:13,140
So you have your power meter which 
registers the force you're exerting on 

3500
02:35:13,140 --> 02:35:16,051
the pedals and watts.
And then you can extrapolate that out 

3501
02:35:16,051 --> 02:35:19,411
after a ride,
what your average watts are for that 

3502
02:35:19,411 --> 02:35:22,171
ride.
And then you balance that against what 

3503
02:35:22,171 --> 02:35:22,171
your heart rate was at that particular 
watts,

3504
02:35:22,171 --> 02:35:22,900
what the grade,
you know,

3505
02:35:22,901 --> 02:35:26,260
how much elevation gain you have,
what the exterior temperature is.

3506
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:31,590
And you can create these insane graphs 
and look at it and like make judgment 

3507
02:35:31,590 --> 02:35:32,920
calls about where your fitness is,
where your weaknesses are,

3508
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:34,840
and adjust your training program 
accordingly.

3509
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:38,260
And so when you're training for 
endurance or ultra endurance,

3510
02:35:38,261 --> 02:35:43,261
again,
it goes back to really emphasizing that 

3511
02:35:43,261 --> 02:35:43,261
fat burning zone,
that aerobic zone,

3512
02:35:43,261 --> 02:35:46,660
because because the more efficient you 
can be at that,

3513
02:35:46,990 --> 02:35:48,520
you can,
you can,

3514
02:35:48,521 --> 02:35:51,730
um,
you can improve your speed without doing

3515
02:35:51,731 --> 02:35:53,250
that much speed work.
I'm not,

3516
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:57,420
I'm not saying this very articulately,
but for.

3517
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:02,460
I'll give you an example.
When I first started doing this 

3518
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:05,950
endurance stuff out and wanted to stay 
in my zone two,

3519
02:36:05,951 --> 02:36:10,951
which is the aerobics,
so I would have to keep my heart rate 

3520
02:36:10,951 --> 02:36:13,711
when I was running below about 1:45.
Initially when I first started running,

3521
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:15,440
I couldn't,
uh,

3522
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:19,660
if I ran faster than like a nine or 9:30
pace,

3523
02:36:19,661 --> 02:36:23,230
my ra would go over 1:45.
And when it went over 1:45,

3524
02:36:23,231 --> 02:36:26,530
I knew I was no longer in the fat 
burning zone that I was getting into the

3525
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:31,560
glycogen burning zone.
But by staying in that specific heart 

3526
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:33,370
rate region,
over time,

3527
02:36:33,580 --> 02:36:35,890
my pace increased without my heart rate 
going up,

3528
02:36:35,980 --> 02:36:37,270
which,
which is telling,

3529
02:36:37,450 --> 02:36:42,450
which is telling me that I'm becoming a 
more efficient athlete at a certain 

3530
02:36:42,450 --> 02:36:46,321
level of exertion.
My body is becoming faster and more 

3531
02:36:46,321 --> 02:36:47,950
efficient.
So by training less hard,

3532
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:53,010
less less physical exertion,
you actually improve your boundaries in 

3533
02:36:53,010 --> 02:36:53,530
a certain respect.

3534
02:36:53,530 --> 02:36:58,530
Yeah,
I mean it was explained to me initially 

3535
02:36:58,530 --> 02:37:00,640
like if you want to go fast first you're
going to have to go slow and build the,

3536
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:03,640
build the foundation of this machine 
from the ground up.

3537
02:37:03,641 --> 02:37:07,570
And that doesn't mean there isn't a time
and place for speed work and you know,

3538
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:11,980
super exertion work at a,
at a higher intensity zone.

3539
02:37:12,430 --> 02:37:17,430
But,
but the key to success in endurance 

3540
02:37:17,430 --> 02:37:20,441
sports is really emphasizing that,
that aerobics on training and education 

3541
02:37:20,441 --> 02:37:22,190
efficiency more efficient.
And so for example,

3542
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:27,640
when I first started doing this training
and I'd go out for these crazy long 

3543
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:27,710
training sessions,
I come back,

3544
02:37:27,711 --> 02:37:28,910
I was starving,
I'd be eating,

3545
02:37:28,911 --> 02:37:30,380
you know,
I just couldn't eat enough food.

3546
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:35,680
Now the toll that it,
the tax on my body for doing a similar 

3547
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:40,541
workout like four or five years later is
de minimus compared to what it was 

3548
02:37:40,541 --> 02:37:45,041
before.
So actually my appetite has gone down 

3549
02:37:45,041 --> 02:37:45,740
even though the training has been the 
same,

3550
02:37:45,741 --> 02:37:47,660
if not more difficult.
So.

3551
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:49,670
So the body adapts in other words.

3552
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:51,570
Wow.
That is fascinating stuff.

3553
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:52,490
So,
um,

3554
02:37:52,530 --> 02:37:57,530
how often are you wearing a heart 
monitor while you're training while 

3555
02:37:57,530 --> 02:37:57,740
you're exercising?
Always.

3556
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:00,270
Always because see,
I never did.

3557
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:02,290
I always buy them and I just fucking 
leave them,

3558
02:38:02,291 --> 02:38:05,550
sit there and I just work out,
work out hard and then I'm done.

3559
02:38:05,710 --> 02:38:10,710
Well and you know,
coming from swimming and what it was 

3560
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:10,710
like in the eighties,
you know,

3561
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:10,710
it was always,
you know,

3562
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:12,970
a go hard or go home and no pain,
no gain.

3563
02:38:12,971 --> 02:38:16,270
It's like if I had an hour to work out 
and I was going to go for a run,

3564
02:38:16,271 --> 02:38:18,370
just run as hard as I can,
you know,

3565
02:38:18,371 --> 02:38:23,371
as fast as I can in that given our.
And that's the best workout then I'm 

3566
02:38:23,371 --> 02:38:23,380
going to get.
And actually,

3567
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:26,020
you know,
the truth couldn't be more different.

3568
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:31,560
So if you want to get better,
and that's the problem with a lot of 

3569
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:33,160
sort of amateur athletes that want to do
marathons or 10 k's or,

3570
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:36,460
or even like shorter distance triathlons
by training,

3571
02:38:36,461 --> 02:38:39,780
that way of just kind of using the time 
allotted and going as hard as you can in

3572
02:38:39,781 --> 02:38:42,100
that allotted period of time,
you're going to reach a certain level of

3573
02:38:42,101 --> 02:38:44,680
fitness and aptitude and what you're 
trying to do,

3574
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:49,980
but you're very quickly gonna hit a 
glass ceiling and you're going to 

3575
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:49,980
plateau and you're not going to be able 
to break through.

3576
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:54,780
So what is the way to break through,
but we had to break through is to step 

3577
02:38:54,780 --> 02:38:56,260
it back and really again,
go back to building that foundation from

3578
02:38:56,261 --> 02:39:01,261
the ground up and focusing on if you 
slow down and really focus on improving 

3579
02:39:04,301 --> 02:39:07,300
your aerobic efficiency and it's time 
consuming,

3580
02:39:07,301 --> 02:39:08,960
it takes time to do this.
Um,

3581
02:39:09,910 --> 02:39:13,750
then you are building a platform upon 
which that speed work,

3582
02:39:13,751 --> 02:39:18,751
which you will do later,
is going to catapult you into a new 

3583
02:39:18,751 --> 02:39:19,090
realm of proficiency.

3584
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:21,620
So it's all about.
It doesn't make sense.

3585
02:39:21,621 --> 02:39:24,290
It's.
So it's all about pushing the heart rate

3586
02:39:24,291 --> 02:39:29,291
at a certain pace,
maintaining that certain pace for 

3587
02:39:29,291 --> 02:39:31,931
prolonged periods of time,
and then building up to the point where 

3588
02:39:31,931 --> 02:39:35,831
you could do that easier and easier and 
easier and that is your real big base 

3589
02:39:35,831 --> 02:39:38,030
and it's not about these wild sprints to
your heart wants to fucking explode.

3590
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:43,390
It's actually about building up your 
ability to maintain a a heart rate even 

3591
02:39:44,031 --> 02:39:48,230
though you're doing more work,
maintained the same heartbreak of 1:45.

3592
02:39:48,231 --> 02:39:48,530
Is that weird?

3593
02:39:48,820 --> 02:39:49,210
Well,
yeah.

3594
02:39:49,211 --> 02:39:52,220
I mean that's just my personal example,
but I mean it,

3595
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:57,340
it requires a different kind of 
discipline because you kind of have to 

3596
02:39:57,340 --> 02:39:57,340
check your ego at the door,
you know what I mean?

3597
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:02,251
And,
and sometimes you want that feeling of 

3598
02:40:02,251 --> 02:40:02,251
like I just exerted myself,
I feel like I did some work,

3599
02:40:02,251 --> 02:40:06,901
I got something done.
And having the discipline to say every 

3600
02:40:06,901 --> 02:40:10,501
workout has a purpose and the purpose of
this workout is I'm going to run for an 

3601
02:40:10,501 --> 02:40:14,130
hour and a half and my goal is to never 
let my heart rate exceed that zone 

3602
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:18,710
threshold.
So say if I'm going to finish the run 

3603
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:18,870
and maybe I'm not even gonna feel that 
tired,

3604
02:40:18,871 --> 02:40:23,871
I might not feel like I was like,
I don't feel like I got anything out of 

3605
02:40:23,871 --> 02:40:26,661
that and believing in that program and 
sticking to it over time to build that 

3606
02:40:26,661 --> 02:40:26,661
house.

3607
02:40:26,661 --> 02:40:31,560
Do you think that that's a good way that
someone should approach a martial arts 

3608
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:35,401
as well?
And that like strength and conditioning 

3609
02:40:35,401 --> 02:40:37,441
for martial arts,
like say kettlebells or something like 

3610
02:40:37,441 --> 02:40:39,331
that,
they should also do the same sort of 

3611
02:40:39,331 --> 02:40:39,331
thing.
Maintain A.

3612
02:40:39,331 --> 02:40:42,930
Well,
it's a little bit different because 

3613
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:43,750
endurance sports are so much about 
efficiency of movement,

3614
02:40:43,960 --> 02:40:46,930
you know,
and over a prolonged period of time.

3615
02:40:46,931 --> 02:40:49,290
Whereas something like Jujitsu or,
or,

3616
02:40:49,480 --> 02:40:51,580
or what have you is about explosive 
speed,

3617
02:40:51,790 --> 02:40:56,790
but at the same time you're going to be 
in the ring for a prolonged period of 

3618
02:40:56,790 --> 02:40:59,641
time.
If you have this sort of lung capacity 

3619
02:40:59,641 --> 02:41:00,310
and stamina to endure,
you know,

3620
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:05,430
longer than your competitor so that 
you're fresher in that last round than 

3621
02:41:05,430 --> 02:41:06,640
he is,
then you're going to have an advantage.

3622
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:11,760
So I think that what that would mean,
and certainly I'm no expert in martial 

3623
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:16,381
arts or what have you,
so I don't want to get schooled for 

3624
02:41:16,381 --> 02:41:19,920
saying the wrong thing,
but it would seem to me that in the off 

3625
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:19,920
season,
um,

3626
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:23,380
or you know quite a bit of time before 
you get into your training camps leading

3627
02:41:23,381 --> 02:41:28,381
up to a fight,
you would focus on doing a lot of base 

3628
02:41:28,381 --> 02:41:29,830
aerobic training work to kind of lay 
that endurance foundation.

3629
02:41:30,070 --> 02:41:35,070
And then you build upon that with the 
specific strength and explosive speed 

3630
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:35,070
exercises to,
you know,

3631
02:41:35,170 --> 02:41:38,500
have that pyramid come to a peak when it
comes to fight day

3632
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:40,200
one of the best fighters in the world.
Uh,

3633
02:41:40,290 --> 02:41:43,650
Nick Diaz is a unknown triathlete.
I mean,

3634
02:41:43,651 --> 02:41:48,651
he's a,
he's constantly doing massive endurance 

3635
02:41:48,651 --> 02:41:49,200
work.
And the thing about nick is that he puts

3636
02:41:49,201 --> 02:41:52,260
guys a,
puts them into a pace he sets them up.

3637
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:53,760
Like when he's,
uh,

3638
02:41:53,970 --> 02:41:54,930
when he,
when he fights,

3639
02:41:54,931 --> 02:41:57,750
he pushes a pace that other guys can't 
compete with.

3640
02:41:58,110 --> 02:42:03,110
Like he uses his endurance.
He uses his verse strong endurance base 

3641
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:04,260
as an extra weapon.
It's an extra.

3642
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:06,860
Yeah,
that makes a lot of sense.

3643
02:42:06,861 --> 02:42:07,410
Yeah,
because he can,

3644
02:42:07,580 --> 02:42:10,740
he can just keep going.
He swimming back from Alcatraz twice.

3645
02:42:10,890 --> 02:42:15,890
I mean he's got ridiculous endurance and
because of that it seems like one of the

3646
02:42:15,931 --> 02:42:17,520
scariest guys in the world because of 
that,

3647
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:19,290
because you know you're not going to 
wear them out.

3648
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:21,150
You're never going to wear him out.
It's impossible.

3649
02:42:21,330 --> 02:42:26,330
There'll be scrambling deep into the 
fifth round while you're gasping for 

3650
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:26,330
air.

3651
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:29,750
He'll be fine and he talks shit to you.
Why he's beating on you sort of terrible

3652
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:34,770
time were alive at the same time.
I'm sure he follows a basically a Vegan 

3653
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:35,490
diet as well.
That's what I thought.

3654
02:42:35,491 --> 02:42:37,200
Yeah,
he does it for performance reasons.

3655
02:42:37,201 --> 02:42:42,201
I think jake shields does as well.
I think jake may eat eggs occasionally,

3656
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:44,730
but I think that's it for a lot of 
people that don't know.

3657
02:42:44,731 --> 02:42:49,731
I didn't know until I was 30 that uh,
when you have an egg that's not like 

3658
02:42:49,731 --> 02:42:53,361
something died,
the chickens just lay those eggs and if 

3659
02:42:53,361 --> 02:42:56,121
they're not fertilized by the mail 
through so he doesn't get in the 

3660
02:42:56,121 --> 02:42:57,330
henhouse those eggs or just go to waste 
beginning of them.

3661
02:42:57,570 --> 02:43:01,080
You don't even have bad Karma Dude.
Um,

3662
02:43:01,081 --> 02:43:06,081
what could someone.
Is there a book that someone could read 

3663
02:43:06,081 --> 02:43:06,081
about this?
Uh,

3664
02:43:06,081 --> 02:43:09,351
this conditioning thing?
I know that for a lot of people that do 

3665
02:43:09,351 --> 02:43:11,691
Jujitsu,
this is gonna be a really fascinating 

3666
02:43:11,691 --> 02:43:11,691
for a lot of people that do anything 
athletic.

3667
02:43:11,691 --> 02:43:13,240
What,
what is a good book that they could read

3668
02:43:13,241 --> 02:43:15,730
about heart rates and.
Well,

3669
02:43:15,731 --> 02:43:16,810
they can read,
they can read.

3670
02:43:16,811 --> 02:43:18,940
My book will tell us what it is.
What's your book?

3671
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:21,100
My book is called finding ultra.
Actually,

3672
02:43:21,101 --> 02:43:21,940
can I grab it?
I have,

3673
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:22,660
yeah,
please do.

3674
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:23,800
I would love to read it.

3675
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:27,130
Here's it on the screen.
Well,

3676
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:27,620
boom.

3677
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:30,010
And is this,
uh,

3678
02:43:30,011 --> 02:43:31,240
uh,
your life story?

3679
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:32,790
Is it also.
Yeah.

3680
02:43:32,810 --> 02:43:33,260
I mean,
this is

3681
02:43:33,280 --> 02:43:35,440
as a,
it's essentially,

3682
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:38,200
it's essentially memoir.
It's like my personal story,

3683
02:43:38,201 --> 02:43:39,740
but it has a lot about,
um,

3684
02:43:40,330 --> 02:43:45,330
how I sort of reinvented myself as an 
athlete and how I had to kind of relearn

3685
02:43:45,881 --> 02:43:50,881
some certain principles about fitness 
that I grappled with and didn't 

3686
02:43:50,881 --> 02:43:52,030
understand initially that I'm sort of 
allowed me,

3687
02:43:52,031 --> 02:43:57,031
I believe,
to reach a new level of fitness sites 

3688
02:43:57,031 --> 02:43:57,280
that I certainly didn't think was 
possible,

3689
02:43:57,281 --> 02:43:59,740
particularly as a middle aged guy.

3690
02:44:00,030 --> 02:44:03,180
And you did this all through that method
of building up the aerobic base

3691
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:06,020
specific thing that is,
you know,

3692
02:44:06,190 --> 02:44:11,190
not what most people are training for,
but the kind of principles that we were 

3693
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:12,580
just talking about I think are 
applicable to,

3694
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:13,640
you know,
the,

3695
02:44:14,060 --> 02:44:19,060
the sort of weekend warrior athlete,
whether you want to go out and be able 

3696
02:44:19,060 --> 02:44:19,770
to feel good in your pickup basketball 
game or,

3697
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:22,120
or touch football or whatever it is.
Um,

3698
02:44:22,270 --> 02:44:27,100
it's how to use your time crunched a 
days effectively.

3699
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:32,160
You know,
rather than just going out haphazardly 

3700
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:34,561
and saying,
I'm going to blast this 30 minutes on 

3701
02:44:34,561 --> 02:44:37,021
the treadmill and do it time and time 
again and wonder why you're never 

3702
02:44:37,021 --> 02:44:37,021
getting any faster.

3703
02:44:37,021 --> 02:44:37,030
So,
um,

3704
02:44:37,060 --> 02:44:42,060
so people can get any answers to any 
questions about conditioning and what 

3705
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:43,270
you learned from finding ultra.
Can they get that on Amazon?

3706
02:44:43,271 --> 02:44:45,490
And it's everywhere.
It's on Amazon,

3707
02:44:45,491 --> 02:44:47,920
Barnes and noble.
And if people want to reach you,

3708
02:44:47,921 --> 02:44:50,000
it's rich.
Roll our Ich,

3709
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:53,260
not rick,
not fucking Rick Astley.

3710
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:55,270
This is not a joke.
Rich Roll.

3711
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:58,120
The real rich roll.
Just like the real rich Ross,

3712
02:44:58,121 --> 02:45:01,210
but a different God.
And you could find rich roll on twitter.

3713
02:45:01,211 --> 02:45:05,170
Just rich roll R I c h a r o l is it the
best way to get ahold of you?

3714
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:08,830
The best information on facebook to my 
websites.

3715
02:45:09,230 --> 02:45:12,130
Rich Roll R I C H r o l l.
well listen man,

3716
02:45:12,131 --> 02:45:14,890
your story's an awesome story.
I love a comeback.

3717
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:20,100
I love,
I love a guy who figured something out 

3718
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:22,591
in his life and makes a change and then 
spreads that information and you're 

3719
02:45:22,591 --> 02:45:22,591
inspirational dude.

3720
02:45:22,591 --> 02:45:23,920
And uh,
having you on the podcast is really cool

3721
02:45:23,921 --> 02:45:25,840
and I would love to do this again if you
want to come in again.

3722
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:28,270
Feeling's mutual and we keep talking 
about this forever.

3723
02:45:28,630 --> 02:45:29,100
I love it.
Yeah.

3724
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:34,110
But I,
I had to stop myself from the endurance 

3725
02:45:34,110 --> 02:45:34,110
questions.
I would have bored the fuck of it.

3726
02:45:34,110 --> 02:45:38,660
Like for my own technical man.
I don't know if people really are going 

3727
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:39,580
to be that.
Some people will hopefully,

3728
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:40,310
um,
uh,

3729
02:45:40,330 --> 02:45:41,380
thank you.
Uh,

3730
02:45:41,410 --> 02:45:42,850
thank you very much man.
Really appreciate it.

3731
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,680
So rich roll.
I follow him on twitter.

3732
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:49,860
Go to [inaudible] dot tv,
you dirty bitches and pick yourself up 

3733
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:50,060
some funky ass cat tee shirts.
Uh,

3734
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:52,420
and uh,
and they come with a free sticker to.

3735
02:45:52,421 --> 02:45:56,190
So you put it on your call so people 
come with a free steak or what are you?

3736
02:45:56,240 --> 02:46:01,240
I thought you said you're sending those 
stickers so they pay for that sticker.

3737
02:46:02,081 --> 02:46:04,360
Hooker.
Go get yourself a sticker.

3738
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:05,250
But those,
uh,

3739
02:46:05,490 --> 02:46:07,930
you can identify fellow squatters and 
parking lots.

3740
02:46:07,931 --> 02:46:08,990
And Shit's good.
You.

3741
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:09,530
What's up?

3742
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:15,090
Guy Just tweeted me.
So that is a neighbor who had never met 

3743
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:15,090
before,
knocked on his door when he heard he was

3744
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:19,871
listening to this podcast.
You heard my voice booming out of his 

3745
02:46:19,871 --> 02:46:19,871
living room.
And so the neighbor knocked.

3746
02:46:19,871 --> 02:46:19,880
I was like,
man,

3747
02:46:19,881 --> 02:46:23,730
I fucking love that podcast.
So thanks everybody for you know,

3748
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:26,690
like I can't thank you guys enough for 
being the coolest crowds ever.

3749
02:46:26,691 --> 02:46:29,300
Sacramento was fucking completely off 
the chain.

3750
02:46:29,330 --> 02:46:30,950
I literally,
uh,

3751
02:46:30,951 --> 02:46:35,951
I never imagined that we would have 
these kinds of crowds on a regular 

3752
02:46:35,951 --> 02:46:40,181
basis.
It's really amazing and we appreciate 

3753
02:46:40,181 --> 02:46:43,451
the fuck out of him.
And what I said earlier is not lip 

3754
02:46:43,451 --> 02:46:44,120
service.
I really do feel a massive obligation to

3755
02:46:44,121 --> 02:46:49,121

your life and it's supportive of our 
life too and everything we're doing,

3757
02:46:49,371 --> 02:46:53,930
