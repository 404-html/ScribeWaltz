00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,220
I've been baking bread lately.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,330
Holy Shit.

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,590
Sour dough bread.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,341
Sourdough bread.

6
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,210
It's very good for you.

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,691
It is.

8
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,620
Has Gluten though.

9
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,080
Yeah.

10
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,390
Natural process.

11
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,400
But sour dough bread apparently has
way less gluten than regular bread.

12
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,420
Right?

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,110
Right.

14
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,291
Yeah.

15
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,620
Cause my wife can eat that mechanic.

16
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,780
The other brand really.

17
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,341
It's a cool thing.

18
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,390
It just takes the,

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,950
you just take flour and water.

20
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,940
You need a starter,

21
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,280
which is culture.

22
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:29,790
Oh yeah,

23
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,091
yeah.

24
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,200
You just start with a flour and water
and the natural yeast that comes from

25
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:38,370
around us in the environment
goes in and starts eating that.

26
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,150
What?

27
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,040
And it becomes a living thing and people
have starters that have like a hundred

28
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,500
years old.

29
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,090
You take,

30
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,450
you take a couple ounces
off and you always maintain
a little and feed it like a

31
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,284
living thing.

32
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,360
It's like a bowl of flour and water.

33
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:51,720
But it's,

34
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,660
you'll see it start to bubble when you
feed it more flour and water east to

35
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:56,110
seating it.

36
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,520
Yeah.

37
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,630
It's the coolest.

38
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,710
That's crazy.

39
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,210
So it's in your refrigerator.

40
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,030
Like what's in my fridge?

41
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,150
Like a little little a mason jar.

42
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,200
Wow.

43
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,370
And then you scoop it out,

44
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,030
you just take a little chunk of
it in the feed it and it expands,

45
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,610
and then you take some of
that and make bread out of it.

46
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
That is fucking nuts.

47
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,943
It's pretty,

48
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,600
yeah.

49
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,210
So never would have been into this
if I didn't hear that concept.

50
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,850
And now I can't stop baking bread,

51
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,320
like Little Red Riding Hood.

52
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,440
Who gave you the idea to do this?

53
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:27,180
This writer friend of mine,

54
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,160
he's been doing it for
a long time and he said,

55
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,580
it's just,

56
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,760
you just have sourdough bread
and the kids love it and wow.

57
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,590
I just started doing it and uh,

58
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,540
I just got hooked on it.

59
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,770
What do you buy your starter?

60
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,210
You don't buy it.

61
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,200
You can just start it.

62
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,733
Make a starter,

63
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,810
make a starter.

64
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,231
Okay.

65
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:43,950
How do you do that?

66
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,210
You just take some flour and
water and put it out on the,

67
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,770
on the counter.

68
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,490
That's it.

69
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

70
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,650
I mean there's measurements and stuff,

71
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,513
but that's it.

72
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,200
And then the natural yeast,

73
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:57,150
there's east around us
just floating around.

74
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,890
That explains a lot of things.

75
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,640
Yeah.

76
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,110
And it goes into,

77
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,730
it goes into the,

78
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:03,564
uh,

79
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,880
into the concoction and as you'll see,

80
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,700
it starts to bubble and get lighter
and you feed it some more and it gets

81
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,150
bigger.

82
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,360
When you say feed it like for you,

83
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,573
cause it's sweet.

84
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
It's like a yeast,

85
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,490
a little like a little community,

86
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,280
right.

87
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,980
Feeding it equal parts.

88
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,330
A flour and water.

89
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,580
Wow.

90
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,483
And it eats it.

91
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
And now it's like this living thing in
the house who has a star that's a hundred

92
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,140
years old.

93
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,820
I went to buy a Dutch oven,

94
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,490
which is like a pot that you can bake.

95
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,050
You put the bread in and
this old guy was like,

96
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,183
what are you doing?

97
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,030
Even the guy who Williamson,

98
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,411
I was like,

99
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:38,460
six foot lanky.

100
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
What do you need it for?

101
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,333
I'm like,

102
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,390
I'm going to make some bread.

103
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,740
Oh,

104
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,360
I've been making bread for a long time.

105
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,093
Really?

106
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,020
I'm going to be making sourdough bread.

107
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,633
Oh,

108
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
I got my start.

109
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:52,920
Or where are you getting your starter?

110
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,311
I said,

111
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:53,401
well,

112
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:58,401
a friend of mine has the Bray a starter
and my daughter Labrea what's the of

113
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,100
starter?

114
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,761
That one.

115
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,820
Is that all the Bray
libray of bakery bread,

116
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,030
you get the yeast off
of the skin of grapes.

117
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,370
So there's a process where you take
grapes and you put it in like cheesecloth

118
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,520
and you just let the,

119
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,650
the yeast come off of all,

120
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,050
all grapes have yeast in the skin,

121
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,380
eating on the skin of the
grapes and that drips off.

122
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,930
And then you put it into the basic
starting with the flour and water.

123
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,540
So it has real sweeter,

124
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,950
brave say chain.

125
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,843
Is that what it would be like?

126
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,241
Yeah,

127
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:28,541
there's,

128
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,050
you'll see them there are actual bakery
and now they're like in Ralph's and

129
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,220
everything that's all over.

130
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,300
And they say,

131
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,960
and like the places San Francisco
that have big sourdough,

132
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,101
that it all,

133
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,340
it's maintains the same started
that they've always had.

134
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
So this guy said,

135
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,650
uh,

136
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,300
so I told him where I
was getting my stuff.

137
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,420
My daughter made one as a gift and
then this other guy gave me a piece,

138
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,960
he said his starter
came from Jackson Hole,

139
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,130
Wyoming and he got it
from a friend of his,

140
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,170
and it's over a hundred years old.

141
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,340
People have been passing
it on to cowboy starter,

142
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,300
cowboy starter.

143
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,051
That's what it was.

144
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:09,730
It was a lot of minors in San Francisco
and all that during the gold rush.

145
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,800
They were creating bred that way.

146
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,210
That's where it started.

147
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,660
No,

148
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,493
Huh.

149
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,971
Yeah.

150
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:20,971
I wonder how old the yeast organisms
get before they die and do they die?

151
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,700
They probably reproduce and yeah,

152
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:25,540
it's a good question.

153
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,760
I don't know because basically like I
have it on my counter nab and feeding it

154
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,630
for the last day.

155
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,470
So now,

156
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,730
so now it's kind of bubbly,

157
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,713
wow.

158
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,680
Glue and it's kind of bubbly.

159
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,960
So I'll scoop out four ounces of that,

160
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,130
make bread out of it,

161
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,790
and then take one ounce of that,

162
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,930
put it back in the jar,

163
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,730
feed it a little and put it in the fridge.

164
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,470
So what's the process?

165
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:50,660
So if you took four ounces
out and made bread with it,

166
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,560
what do you do with that?

167
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,603
The starter?

168
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,150
Uh,

169
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,670
you basically take a lot of flour.

170
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,110
You take like 28,

171
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,690
this is to make two of them two loaves.

172
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:01,530
You Take uh,

173
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,610
uh,

174
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,210
28 ounces of all purpose
flour or wheat flour,

175
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:07,050
whatever you want to use.

176
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,910
You put that in with a little salt.

177
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,100
Then you take your starter,

178
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,440
you take the four ounces
and an 18 ounces of water,

179
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,101
a bunch of water,

180
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:14,871
and you make it into a cloud,

181
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:15,704
a mixture,

182
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,150
and then you dump that into the flour
and salt that's in your mixer and it just

183
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,360
makes it into dough and then
it just rises naturally.

184
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,340
Bold it a couple of times,

185
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,450
put it into a ball,

186
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,590
into the Dutch oven after a couple
hours and then you've got bread.

187
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,590
It's that simple.

188
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,453
It's that simple.

189
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,220
How long before you start growing your
own wheat and smashing up with a rock?

190
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm,

191
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,610
I'm headed that way.

192
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,650
That is the guy who,

193
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,800
who I bought the Dutch oven from is like,

194
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,780
I really like seed breads

195
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,870
and then I looked it up.

196
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,490
That's like crazy.

197
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,560
12 different seeds from different
places and you mash them up.

198
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,160
I mean then then you're getting a job

199
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
at Williams Sonoma.

200
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,900
I went to the Museum of
natural history and they had a,

201
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:05,270
an Egyptian mummy display.

202
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,530
Really fucking cool.

203
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,460
Um,

204
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,480
but one of the interesting things was
by the time Egyptian people were older,

205
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,721
you know,

206
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,890
they didn't leave that live that long,

207
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,671
but if they did,

208
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,360
they didn't have any teeth left
because the way they made bread,

209
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,950
they ground it up.

210
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,370
They ground up their own flour
and it left sand in the bread.

211
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,523
Yeah.

212
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,423
Rose.

213
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,460
So their bread was all you
were eating sand wear away,

214
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,630
your teeth had,

215
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:32,030
it's great.

216
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,230
I thought you were going to say sugar,

217
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,640
no sand.

218
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,723
Oh,

219
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,030
wear your teeth down.

220
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,620
Line the down nerves.

221
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,990
And they had all these methods that they
were trying to concoct to save teeth,

222
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,991
like wooden caps that they would put
on chew on that instead of chewing with

223
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,390
whatever nerve endings
were left in your face,

224
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,950
just so you could eat more sand breads.

225
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,970
Sandy bread,

226
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,920
it's fucked up.

227
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,690
It is a kind of a trippy thing that you
just put some flour and water and this

228
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:07,691
yeast comes from the environment and now
you've got this amazing tasting bread

229
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:10,010
that the family can't stop eating.

230
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:10,880
The kids writing it.

231
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,640
It's just,

232
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,200
especially,

233
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,060
butter's been around for forever,

234
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,980
right out of the oven when it's hot,

235
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,870
we're eating bread like crazy.

236
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,720
Like when you're talking about like
eating sugar and all that flat,

237
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:24,650
we just can't stop.

238
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,160
Wow.

239
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,880
We're all going to be fun.

240
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm going the other way.

241
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm not eating any of it.

242
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,540
At least for 60 days,

243
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:29,901
I'm going to,

244
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:30,734
I don't feel,

245
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,390
I don't feel mentally that clear.

246
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,050
Have you?

247
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,470
Making some life choices.

248
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,304
Big Regret.

249
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,890
I told you I woke up at
seven this morning like,

250
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:40,101
oh,

251
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,630
I gotta do a show tonight and the players,

252
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,590
that's the brand.

253
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,630
It is the is man the bread.

254
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,370
It's making me lazy you down.

255
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,020
It's just so weird,

256
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,160
so weird that you could just like put it
out there and the natural yeast grows.

257
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,180
I had no idea.

258
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,200
I felt like I,

259
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,950
you know what,

260
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,130
I wish someone had asked me
where does east come from?

261
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,050
Cause I never considered it before.

262
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,560
I would have been like
a fucking what is it?

263
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,100
A plant.

264
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,000
What is our,

265
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,811
I don't know.

266
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:09,740
And then there's like,

267
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,071
you know,

268
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:12,980
cause you can buy a yeast that just make
regular bread and you throw it in there

269
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,814
and it eats.

270
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,570
Wow.

271
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,950
The Flower Toman maintains 122
year old sourdough starter.

272
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,251
Yeah.

273
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:19,760
Look at that.

274
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,150
Whoa.

275
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,670
There was a woman on line who's this?

276
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:26,130
Radical feminists who made sourdough
bread out of her pussy east.

277
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,121
Yeah.

278
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,030
Go find that one Jamie.

279
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,310
And couldn't keep their hands off it.

280
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,701
Oh,

281
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:33,440
it was fucking flying off the shelves.

282
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

283
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,320
I tweeted about it,

284
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,550
but it was quite a while ago.

285
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,390
Probably never find it,

286
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,310
but I was like good for her.

287
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,241
There is,

288
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,170
I can't tell you.

289
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,550
It's really a weird thing.

290
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,121
I mean,

291
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,830
who I haven't done it would
never be baking bread.

292
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,370
I don't know.

293
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,270
I'm like hooked on it.

294
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,921
Yeah.

295
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:49,490
There it is.

296
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,780
A woman who made sourdough bread using
yeast from her vagina just ate the bread

297
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,493
thrown.

298
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,353
Ah,

299
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,313
I wouldn't cheat.

300
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,560
You know,

301
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,393
I would eat

302
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,843
my own column.

303
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,953
Donut

304
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,950
gross.

305
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Why is it so gross when I eat it?

306
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:14,460
But when my wife swells
that it's all gravy.

307
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,350
That's a good relationship.

308
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,783
Life is built.

309
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,280
Yeah.

310
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
It's a compromise.

311
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,781
Yeah.

312
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,370
So I'm baking bread and getting fat.

313
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Bread's good.

314
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,393
What's that?

315
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,653
Bread's good.

316
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,370
It's not good for you Tom.

317
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:29,671
Papa.

318
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:30,210
I know.

319
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,980
We started a resurgence.

320
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,730
Oh,

321
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,331
you brought bread.

322
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,290
You son of a bitch.

323
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,670
Oh,

324
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,110
it's wrapped in a cloth.

325
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:37,870
Ladies and gentlemen.

326
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,030
Like,

327
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,400
like,

328
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,530
like he's some old timey
baker character through.

329
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,730
It feels like the only thing
I'm bummed out about us.

330
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,750
I didn't have a basket to bring it in.

331
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,890
Did you make that?

332
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,110
This is a sour dough.

333
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,680
This is a sourdough bread from Tom
Papa that made it into New York Times.

334
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,311
Yeah.

335
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,810
When I did your show and uh,

336
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,490
can I smell it?

337
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,323
Talks about it.

338
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,550
Yeah.

339
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,420
This is a couple of days old cause I
thought it was coming a couple days ago.

340
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,120
Ooh.

341
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Did you even make the
top a little flowery,

342
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:05,460
like,

343
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,360
like a real bakery?

344
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,194
Let me smell

345
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,460
it.

346
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,210
Smell so good.

347
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:09,930
It's good.

348
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,980
God that smells good.

349
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,873
Yeah,

350
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
that's ancient sourdough.

351
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:15,991
Tom,

352
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,411
Papa,

353
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,190
you fucking animal.

354
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,570
You brought a knife and everything.

355
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,260
I don't,

356
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,940
it looks like we're off the Diet today.

357
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,280
Today I was at the lowest weight.

358
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,020
I've been in like years,

359
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,820
so really one 90 this morning.

360
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,843
I really,

361
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,171
yeah,

362
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:28,801
it was crazy.

363
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,634
How tall are you?

364
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:29,971
Five.

365
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:30,480
Eight.

366
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,313
Wow.

367
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,461
I really,

368
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:33,294
uh,

369
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,760
I don't think that this bread,

370
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,720
this is sourdough bread.

371
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:39,870
You digest it as a lower
glycaemic supposedly.

372
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,970
Supposedly.

373
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,660
Allegedly.

374
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,171
I'm in though,

375
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:43,441
Dude.

376
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:44,250
Just slice it up.

377
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,083
Put It on this.

378
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,090
This is a couple of days off.

379
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:47,960
So granted this,

380
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,751
this table,

381
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:49,620
it actually be good.

382
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,330
Like it'll make it cooler.

383
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,790
So he just cut it like
it's a cutting board.

384
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't be shy.

385
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,253
All right.

386
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,160
This is a,

387
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,380
I mean this is how bread
was made originally.

388
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:01,620
This is an ancient Egypt
up thousand years ago.

389
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,491
Ancient Egypt.

390
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,720
Do you know that in ancient Egypt,

391
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,531
when they made bread,

392
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:09,060
they ground their flour
on like mortar and pestle.

393
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,890
But they were really shitty and so
they'd get a lot of sand in the flower.

394
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,100
So the people in ancient
Egypt all had fucked up teeth,

395
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,930
like worn down to the nerves

396
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,770
cause they were chewing sand,

397
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:23,604
all that.

398
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,890
So the inside of their
body was like a fucking,

399
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:26,850
what are those things called?

400
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:27,510
And Birds.

401
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,251
What does that called?

402
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,050
Like a,

403
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,883
um,

404
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,660
like uh,

405
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,291
what is that thing?

406
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,280
That thing that they do?

407
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,870
The crop where your,

408
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:34,041
your,

409
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,500
your,

410
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,400
your gizzard.

411
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,980
Yeah.

412
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,813
You have your

413
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,620
fucking rocks in there
and you chew up your food.

414
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh God.

415
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Which is apparently one of the reasons
why they made ledge shot illegal in

416
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:48,871
California.

417
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,440
Cause like if people do like shooting
clays or if they shoot things and those

418
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,400
little lead pellets

419
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,840
from shotguns,

420
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,760
birds will actually eat those.

421
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,180
Oh.

422
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,390
And it goes in there.

423
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,350
They're gizzard and they use it to,

424
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:03,184
uh,

425
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,390
to grind things up,

426
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,710
but then they get lead poisoning.

427
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,690
That's the thing with
the California condor.

428
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,410
Oh really?

429
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:08,831
Yeah.

430
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,500
That's one of the reasons
why a California condors,

431
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,693
um,

432
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,340
one of the reasons why they made led
illegal for ammunition in California is

433
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,910
because of California condors.

434
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,860
Cause they wouldn't hear it dumped fucks.

435
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,900
So eating pellets,

436
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,510
not a rock.

437
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,800
You stupid fuck condor.

438
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,610
They look dumb.

439
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,421
They have Damas far.

440
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:28,960
They really do.

441
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,793
But we need them.

442
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,850
This should they toasted.

443
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,060
Toasted would really be the thing that
would get you way to tie right now.

444
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:34,301
Folks.

445
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,134
Here we go.

446
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,210
So happy to see you eat bread.

447
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,980
This has a good,

448
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:42,880
it's pretty good.

449
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,430
I was nice and airy.

450
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,200
I make the,

451
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,360
I we haven't bought bread
since I started this.

452
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,343
How long ago was that?

453
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,513
December.

454
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,240
Wow.

455
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,620
We have not bought bread.

456
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,960
Do you know what like bread in uh,

457
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,670
in your supermarket,

458
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,070
this is made with three ingredients.

459
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,611
Flour,

460
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:01,570
water and salt.

461
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,700
That's it.

462
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:02,920
That's,

463
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,131
you know,

464
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,920
from your sourdough starter bread,

465
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,790
like the healthy,

466
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,780
like whole wheat bread,

467
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:08,291
you just get it.

468
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,250
Ralph's or whatever.

469
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,720
32 ingredients.

470
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,910
32.

471
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,350
This is pure.

472
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,210
And is that just because it preserved
preserved preservatives and flavors and

473
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,143
yeah,

474
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,520
people get so mad when they eat.

475
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,354
On a microphone.

476
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,051
I know,

477
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,430
but it's so good.

478
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,330
Normally folks,

479
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:28,750
I would never do this to you and I'm
only doing this to you because Tom Papa

480
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,200
brought some breaded and I'm going
to break my diet for a few hours.

481
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,570
The sour dough flavor,

482
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:36,490
like that little after flavor
and the top of your mouth.

483
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,060
It's an that's a bacteria that's
lactobacillius or something like that.

484
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,700
No.

485
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,180
Yeah,

486
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,013
this is really good.

487
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,630
You're in a excellent bread guy.

488
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,471
It's pretty cool.

489
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,060
Standup comedy thing doesn't pan out.

490
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,313
Dude.

491
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,850
I'm going to just go into it after doing
your podcast and then talking about it

492
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:52,960
on my podcast,

493
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,090
it just kind of erupted.

494
00:13:55,091 --> 00:14:00,091
People were just so interested in just
this pure making something small and

495
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:01,084
simple and,

496
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,433
and uh,

497
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,550
I think I told you when I
saw you at the comedy store,

498
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,501
there's like,

499
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:05,711
you know,

500
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,360
you have some,

501
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,360
you have some real man listeners like
dudes who look like they're going to call

502
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,200
you for like advice on a
truck and they're like,

503
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,940
I can't get my starter right.

504
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
It's about,

505
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,483
there's some like,

506
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,430
and people would start
sending me pictures of,

507
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,280
there's bread and pictures of their
sourdough and then this guy from the New

508
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,571
York Times,

509
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:25,211
Sam Sifton,

510
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:25,960
the editor,

511
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,670
it was doing an article on it.

512
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:31,210
So he contacted me and that
was part of this sour dough.

513
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,650
This whole thing about people keep
their sourdough starter like a pet.

514
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,610
So it was kind of like this
revival of this little method.

515
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,790
So ended up in this article
in the New York Times.

516
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,390
Yeah.

517
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,223
Read it.

518
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,580
I had a lot of people send me
articles about starters to yeah,

519
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:52,160
like people in England that have
150 year old and all this crazy

520
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,090
shit weird.

521
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,450
It's so good that I had never even
heard about it until you brought it up.

522
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,830
I have no idea.

523
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,550
I had no idea either until a
month before that I had the,

524
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,000
I was under the impression
and knows with zero research,

525
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,530
just my head,

526
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,430
this is how you make bread.

527
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,150
I thought you'd take flour
and water and eggs and yeast.

528
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:11,601
Yeah.

529
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,910
You add yeast for Easton
and that's all I thought.

530
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,301
I didn't,

531
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,620
I never knew that you had like

532
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,140
they could take flour and mix it with
water and then you get yeast out of the

533
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:21,800
air.

534
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,310
Yeah.

535
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,390
When you told me that and I was like,

536
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,811
yeah,

537
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,740
get the fuck out of here.

538
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,610
That's crazy.

539
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,410
Just floating around us all the time,

540
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,681
which is,

541
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:27,831
you know,

542
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,950
that's what the case with
nitrogen [inaudible].

543
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,831
Yeah.

544
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,680
Like the reason why there's
so many people on this planet,

545
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,360
and this is from a radio lab
podcast that highlighted,

546
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,850
I think it was called the bad show,

547
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,250
but the,

548
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,580
the radio lab podcast was highlighting
how sometimes really bad people do really

549
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,030
good things or really good.

550
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,020
It's sometimes it's difficult
to differentiate between
someone who's bad or good

551
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,400
because what they've done is so amazing.

552
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,030
Right.

553
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,863
Well,

554
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,250
this is a guy named Fritz harbor,

555
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,120
and Fritz Haber was a
scientist in Germany,

556
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,620
and what harbor did was he figured out
a way to extract nitrogen from the air

557
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,400
because apparently our
air is mostly nitrogen.
