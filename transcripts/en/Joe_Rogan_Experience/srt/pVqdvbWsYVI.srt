1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,690
Her low freak bitches,
you know,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,080
when so many people are dead or driven
or,

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:08,870
or the,
her entire life is about fear and it's

4
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:10,500
all,
it dictates everything that they do

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,150
versus following your gut and putting
the fear aside and once you do it makes

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,810
all the difference in life.
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,620
Fears good.
It is a motivating factor.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,040
Yeah.
Well it's also the lack of fear can be

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,480
very dangerous.
Absolutely.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,510
One of the things that I always say like
people that are not scared when they're

11
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,850
fighting,
like those two people are in trouble.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,571
You're in trouble,
man,

13
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,310
you should be fine.
Nobody likes to be scared,

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,800
but when I was competing,
the worst tournament's that I ever

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,630
fought in,
I was not nervous.

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,290
It was too confident and I just
performed poorly.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,710
But when I was fucking terrified and
like completely on edge,

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,590
then your body's just,
it's just primal.

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,740
It's just like you get down to that,
that the bare minimum amount of

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,470
understanding of what,
what you have to do of the thinking of

21
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:55,691
the,
the,

22
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:59,460
the rest of the world fades away and all
you're thinking about is that task.

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,330
You cutting out everything else.
There's no thought about bills.

24
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,900
There's no thought about the future.
There's just what's going on in front of

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,840
you right now.
And if you can get down to that,

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,330
that's when you perform at your best.
But it's fucking terrifying.

27
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,850
So nobody likes it.
Nobody likes to be like,

28
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,590
when you see guys that are in like the
UFC that are like,

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,390
like here's a good example and I'm a big
fan of Luke rockhold.

30
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,040
I think he's an awesome,
we were just talking about on the way

31
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,510
to,
he was way too relaxed.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,310
Thought he was going to kill Michael
Bisping.

33
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,540
Michael bisping fought that fight.
He was going in against a fucking silver

34
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,360
back gorilla.
He was terrified or not terrified,

35
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,090
but you know,
jacked up with nerves and like you

36
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,520
always on the line for him.
Yeah.

37
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,150
That's how you walked.
Knocked him out.

38
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,780
Such a great sport because first knock
out too in the UFC,

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,720
it's just first Kao like that.
That's how you sell them on the way to

40
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Jorge Rivera in Manchester and beat down
may him Miller is a Tko but the Tkos.

41
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,070
Yeah.
I mean he's also sitting down and its

42
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:57,450
punches better.
Jason Parillo,

43
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:02,130
his boxing coach has really been working
with him and done a fantastic job with

44
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:05,940
him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of
other people that the buildup to that

45
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,960
reminded me of Keith Jardeen talking
about Houston Alexander.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
It was like,
I kept thinking like,

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,050
man,
he's really dismissive,

48
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,400
like cannot even in my league and all
that stuff and all of a sudden you're

49
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:17,770
done.

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,603
Yeah,
you can't.

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,500
When a guy's a professional fighter,
if you just stood there and let him

52
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:24,120
punch you in the face,
would it knock you out?

53
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:24,781
Yeah,
absolutely.

54
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,550
Okay.
So that it can fucking happen.

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,930
They kind of lose a bit of time.
Yeah.

56
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,210
And the last thing you want to be is the
guy that says,

57
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,520
this guy can't beat me.
I'm going to go in there and fuck them

58
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,950
up.
And then you wake up with a flashlight

59
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:34,920
in your eyes like,
what?

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,460
What's going on?
The Dr. Santiago,

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
we don't move.
You're like,

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,400
aw,
shit.

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,370
What happened motherfucker.
Yup.

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,150
And then you have to deal with that.
That ego that allow the ego tells you

65
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,340
that it's gonna protect you from all
this.

66
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,790
You know,
you're the baddest motherfucker.

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,210
You don't have to worry about shit who I
don't even have to worry.

68
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,670
And then you're like,
God dammit,

69
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,533
ego.

70
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,250
Ego leaves you alone.
Like,

71
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:57,680
where are you now?
Bitch gone.

72
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,500
It's okay to say it.
Just believe it.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

74
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,320
And even if you say it,
you gotta be real fun.

75
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah.
You gotta be looking at her saying it

76
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,630
too.
These guys are killers.

77
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,871
I mean,
I just,

78
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,190
man,
that sports awesome.

79
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,690
It's a crazy sport is Brendan's got me
into it and I never missed a fight.

80
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,520
Now have you come live yet?
I have,

81
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,910
yeah.
Where have you been to live?

82
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,550
Went to the Thompson Hendrix.
I've been at like 25 of them.

83
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:22,810
Yeah,
he was at Thompson Hendrix know Lorenzo

84
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,490
Fertitta.
His nephew owns go hunt.

85
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,110
Yeah.
So it runs on our buddy.

86
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,840
So he took me,
we got full access.

87
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,100
Oh,
that was beautiful.

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,090
Oh,
that's beautiful.

89
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,920
Yeah.
The big ones coming up next weekend,

90
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,710
you'll see to the experience alive then
on TV.

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,791
Yeah.
I was like,

92
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,560
wait,
I need to be able to hear Rogan so I

93
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:39,394
know what's going on.

94
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,570
Well,
they have these little things,

95
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,220
these little radios that you can get at
the,

96
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:42,890
uh,
you know,

97
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,350
the concession stand.
Can you really?

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,300
Yeah.
Most,

99
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,480
most arenas have them now.
And you take these little radios and you

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,780
turn them on and it actually has a
frequency that picks up the commentary.

101
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,561
Really?
Yeah.

102
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,790
It's excellent.
It's really cool.

103
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,220
I missed that part of it.
Well,

104
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,120
there's sometimes something's going on.
You don't know what happened.

105
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:58,950
Yeah.
And like,

106
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,130
like they stopped the fight.
Like,

107
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,240
why'd they stop the fight?
You don't realize,

108
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,770
oh,
it's fucking legs broken or,

109
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,451
yeah,
exactly.

110
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,420
You can,
it takes a while.

111
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

112
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,780
Commentary.
And it also,

113
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,550
uh,
I believe you can get,

114
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm not sure about that.
There might just be fight pass.

115
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,870
One of the cool things about UFC fight
passes,

116
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,580
you could listen into the corners.
Oh,

117
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,240
you can.
Yes,

118
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,350
the corner guys are miked up.

119
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,510
So you can,
you can hear like someone saying,

120
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,351
Oh,
you know,

121
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,790
his hands broke,
or Oh,

122
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,540
you know,
uh,

123
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,400
this is what you gotta do that you
wouldn't,

124
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,100
you just get,
you get insight.

125
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,460
And you also get a sense of a building
up anticipation.

126
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,490
Like if you know that a guy's got an
injury and then he's trying to gut it

127
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,230
out,
it makes it even more exciting to watch.

128
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,961
You know?
I mean,

129
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:37,210
yeah,
it's an awesome sport.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,930
Like I said,
I only got a couple of hobbies watching

131
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,830
mma,
hunting.

132
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,701
That's it.
And then they're,

133
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,540
they're very,
it's very,

134
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,270
they're very comparable,
like know from going from being a

135
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:46,831
wrestler.
I mean,

136
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,411
you,
I mean,

137
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,700
it's just,
it's exciting.

138
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,120
It's slow portions of nothing in this
training and grinding and all of a

139
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,290
sudden,
and then every now and again you get a

140
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,420
step in and,
and,

141
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,740
and,
and see where you're at.

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,211
I mean,
it's,

143
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:57,940
it's,
it's,

144
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,650
you know,
like you always say like two guys.

145
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,270
I mean that's,
that's a stripped down to the gets.

146
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,910
You either win or lose at 50 50 I'm
either going to win or I'm not.

147
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,640
And same with hunting.
I mean at at certain point in time and

148
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,700
that hunt,
you either either get them or you don't

149
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,500
like the percentages work out like that.
I mean that's,

150
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,010
that's the cool thing about it.
Well I think also like hunting,

151
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,910
it's very,
it's not perceived correctly by a lot of

152
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,980
people.
It was very misunderstood and a lot of

153
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,700
people think of it as this barbaric,
awful thing involving bullies and

154
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:27,640
assholes when really they're incredibly
intelligent,

155
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,220
difficult people were pursuing one of
the most,

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,510
one of the most difficult things to do
with dire physical consequences.

157
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,720
If you fail those bullies and assholes,
they don't have the dedication that get

158
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:37,990
there.

159
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,600
Those aren't the real guys.
Well they don't have the understanding

160
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,260
of who they actually are.
The T in order to face your own fears,

161
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,910
like a lot of the bullies and the
assholes,

162
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,510
like you can get a certain distance with
that,

163
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,060
with physical power and genetic
attributes.

164
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,870
Make some guys just hit fucking hard and
they're just good at taking a shot.

165
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:58,490
And if you stand in front of them,
whale with them,

166
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,650
they might catch you and knock you out
and beat your ass.

167
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,340
And you just got beat by a bully.
But the reality is when those guys get

168
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:07,940
to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez
or you know,

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,530
uh,
the best of the best,

170
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,080
they're going to get fucked up.
Yeah.

171
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,180
Because those guys are just as just as
physically strong,

172
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,730
just as kate,
but also have their mental shit in

173
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:18,410
order.
You have their ego in order.

174
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,700
They have their understanding in order.
And those guys are some of the nicest,

175
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,610
most down to earth people you ever going
to meet because they get their ego

176
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,250
checked on a daily basis.
Every one of them I met.

177
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,950
We have some guys that are customers of
ours,

178
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,280
um,
Tj and,

179
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,850
and Mendez and I mean,
they're really sharp guys.

180
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,270
Very Sharp and very nice,
very polite,

181
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,670
not assholes.
Very thoughtful.

182
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,400
I mean,
just great people to be around.

183
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:52,480
Okay.
