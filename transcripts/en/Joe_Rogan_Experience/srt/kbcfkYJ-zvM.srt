00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,970

00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,630
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,460
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,970
mandates Tonkin motherfucking,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,590
hello.

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,020
Hey k a super hippie.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,880
What's up?

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,540
What's going on?

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,530
What's going on my friend?

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,970
What happened to the commercials?

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,300
Ah,

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,320
fuck those things dude.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,610
And those bitches in later.

15
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,990
Ah,

16
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,090
I realized somewhere along the line did,

17
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,340
it's all about the flow
of the conversation,

18
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:34,611
right?

19
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:36,620
That's what makes a
podcast interesting to me.

20
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,450
If I'm listening to a cool podcast,

21
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:41,570
I want the flow of the conversation
be as natural as possible.

22
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:41,840
Yes.

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,810
I think even starting with the
music probably should stop to that.

24
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,280
We'll add that shit and post.

25
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,210
Right.

26
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:47,451
You know,

27
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:51,050
the flow of the conversation is what's
up and the best way to get the flow of

28
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,250
the conversation bright.

29
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,710
It's just kind of get into it,

30
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,753
right?

31
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,451
Yeah.

32
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,051
I think that's right.

33
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,220
I didn't mind commercials later.

34
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,410
I just sit down with the
people and start talking.

35
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,550
If you do a commercial first,

36
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:04,880
you've killed the vibe like for
like five minutes more even.

37
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,630
Yeah.

38
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,420
I've been guests on people's shows where
they do it too and I don't want to do

39
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:08,830
it.

40
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,021
You know,

41
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,300
you don't want to sit there with someone's
reading off their commercials even if

42
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:12,040
they're really good at it.

43
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,101
Yeah.

44
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:12,531
Also,

45
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:12,801
yeah.

46
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,430
I mean that's kind of the problem is
that it forces you to do like I read read

47
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:19,010
when someone's there because you want
to get it done with and then that makes

48
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:23,090
you sound like a robot and it's much
more interesting to talk about the,

49
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,440
if you're using it or not.

50
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,131
Like what is it?

51
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:26,030
Cause a lot of this stuff,

52
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,890
a lot of the people are
advertising on podcasts.

53
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,480
It's some weird stuff man.

54
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:34,310
It's like brand new strange
technologies that are new.

55
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:34,821
You know it's,

56
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,280
it's all Internet based
businesses in a lot of that.

57
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,800
A lot of those are cool and Squarespace,

58
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:40,634
that kind of stuff.

59
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,450
Yeah,

60
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,810
it's disruptive and it's very
mild way like you find that that,

61
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:49,720
that the staff is like disrupting
the most annoying technologies.

62
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,730
Like taxis got disrupted by Uber and if
you consider like the experience of a

63
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,330
taxi versus Uber,

64
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,430
no offense to taxi drivers out there.

65
00:01:58,431 --> 00:01:58,851
I'm sorry,

66
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,500
you guys are a,

67
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't want anybody to be
out of work or anything,

68
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:03,800
but man,

69
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:08,801
the difference is so profound that there's
no competition like taxis or like you

70
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:09,351
know,

71
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:13,460
they've got that fucking TV in the back
where it's commercials or like blaring

72
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:16,740
into your face the whole time
and you're just sort of like,

73
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,840
it's if you feel like
you're in a traveling prison
because they've got the plexi

74
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,390
glass in between you and the driver,

75
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,990
because we live in such a crazy dimension
where people who drive other people

76
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:31,991
around have to treat them like pythons
or something and put them behind glass

77
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:33,500
just because that one guy with,

78
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,610
with the ice pick.

79
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:34,821
Well,

80
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,410
do you know how many piece on Ted,

81
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,850
one guy with the ice pack do?

82
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,040
Do you know what happened
in New York City one year?

83
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,030
No.

84
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,380
They killed some insane
number of gypsy cab drivers,

85
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,101
I think.

86
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:49,330
What a gypsy cab driver would they
call gypsy cab driver is someone who's

87
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,800
working kind of without
it was like pre Uber.

88
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,220
Yeah.

89
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,190
It was like they were working without
a license or they're working with some,

90
00:02:55,191 --> 00:03:00,191
some shenanigans were involved and they
would these guys to bad neighborhoods

91
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,640
and shoot them in the back of the
head and they shot a bunch of them.

92
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,830
They showed a bunch of
them paid criminals.

93
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,410
It was like something
they did to rob people.

94
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,060
They take these gypsy cab drivers
deepen in New York City somewhere like

95
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,760
Brownsville or somewhere like that.

96
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,500
Shoot them in the back of the
head and then dumped their cap.

97
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,610
Ah Dude.

98
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,510
It was crazy.

99
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,130
Like it happened a lot.

100
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,701
There was a,

101
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,290
I forget what year it was,

102
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:27,100
but they had no idea how
many people were involved.

103
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,290
They didn't know who was
getting does pre Internet.

104
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,370
Did they ever catch the guy?

105
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,211
I don't know.

106
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,410
I wish I knew that answer.

107
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,060
I wish I,

108
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,540
I'm kind of serial killer or some kind
of who is either a serial killer or a

109
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,960
practice of robbing people
and shooting them in the head.

110
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,940
How hungry are you?

111
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,781
Like,

112
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,050
you know,

113
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,580
you'll have to be so hungry to decide
that you're going to get in a cab and go

114
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:52,510
through the trouble of blasting someone
in the back of the head to get how much

115
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,580
money are they going to
have maximum and a cab,

116
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,440
how much would that have?

117
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,921
You know,

118
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,030
I mean a few hundred bucks,

119
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,220
who knows a thousand maximum.

120
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,700
Who knows?

121
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,390
Man,

122
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,270
it's just hard to believe that it could
be a million and someone would just

123
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,620
shoot someone in the fucking head.

124
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,851
You know?

125
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,684
It's just,

126
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,660
it's weird when you get to a
certain number and people go,

127
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:10,721
oh,

128
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,200
I got it.

129
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,480
You know,

130
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,210
someone kills someone for 1 million bucks.

131
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,391
Like,

132
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:13,900
all right,

133
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,660
well it was $1 million is
probably really tempting.

134
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,381
You know,

135
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,161
for some people,

136
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:18,880
probably I don't,

137
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,990
but it's ridiculous.

138
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,900
You shouldn't be able to kill somebody
for a hundred you shouldn't be able to

139
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,980
kill someone for a million,

140
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,360
but for whatever reason,

141
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,180
if you say it was only for 100 bucks,

142
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,100
they kill them like somehow or another.

143
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:31,960
It makes it like more pointless.

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,880
It killed him for 1 million bucks.

145
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,830
I mean it really weird.

146
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,050
It's like a brinks truck for example,

147
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,510
like a brinks truck you can
cause you're thinking like,

148
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,344
okay,

149
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,410
desperate criminal needs some cash.

150
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,120
If I'm going to kill somebody.

151
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,841
And I think it's a,

152
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,670
obviously a terrible thing to do.

153
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I want to have enough money to live
on it for at least a couple of months.

154
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,110
Not enough to like go bowling
that night and like that's it.

155
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,670
You got to get another cab.

156
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,300
If you're one of those
Uber drivers though,

157
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,740
I mean how much protection do they have
the Uber drivers from getting robbed?

158
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
Things along those lines.

159
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:11,290
Is it harder because of phones?

160
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:11,770
Right?

161
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,251
Yeah.

162
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,990
Well I guess the people are being tracked,

163
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:18,730
but I mean obviously the ultimate
frightening scenario is someone like steal

164
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,720
someone's phone,

165
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,040
uses their Uber App and summons that
Uber and then they're completely

166
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,030
untraceable.

167
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,400
So I think that's probably a,

168
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,500
a danger that the Uber
drivers think about it.

169
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,790
I'm sure they teach them,

170
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,050
you know what to do.

171
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,190
I'm sure they've been like
tutored or are they there?

172
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,650
It's gotta be safety courses.

173
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,310
They're taking for the inevitable
situation where somebody gets in there and

174
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:44,050
thinks they're the reincarnation of
Christ and wants to taste blood on a full

175
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:44,884
moon.

176
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,973
What it's,

177
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,420
I think at the harder situation would
be for the young women who were bothered

178
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:52,420
and nine young women,

179
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,950
women who are by themselves,

180
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,230
who get in a car with a guy that they
don't know and they don't know whether not

181
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,130
he's been screened

182
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,963
properly.

183
00:05:59,690 --> 00:05:59,961
Yeah,

184
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:00,500
that's right.

185
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,210
Or faking being an Uber driver.

186
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:02,451
I mean,

187
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,580
how hard would that be?

188
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,770
Pull up in front of any club
and look at and be like Uber,

189
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,660
Uber.

190
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,270
Yeah.

191
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,230
Easy Dude.

192
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:09,860
Shit.

193
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,281
Easy.

194
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,000
So true.

195
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm sure they've thought of that too.

196
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,131
Yeah.

197
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:18,400
Well I've had people try to get into my
car accidentally cause they thought it

198
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,060
was Dubar.

199
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,350
We rented the escalate.

200
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,981
Wow.

201
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,810
Opened the door and we're like,

202
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:23,550
hello.

203
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,383
And they're like,

204
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,450
we're a,

205
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,201
we're here for Uber.

206
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:26,471
I'm like,

207
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,304
no man,

208
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,543
I'm not Uber.

209
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,460
Hilarious.

210
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,121
Yeah,

211
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:30,331
man.

212
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,740
You can get in a lot of trouble.

213
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,440
Uh,

214
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,650
you can get a lot of trouble
out there in the world,

215
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:34,861
man.

216
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:39,390
It's so strange to think that in this
beautiful time that we're living in and it

217
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:40,650
really is a beautiful time,

218
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:40,831
man.

219
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:41,920
It's an incredible time.

220
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:42,754
Amazing.

221
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,490
It was so strange to think of how there
are still predators existing in our

222
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,420
ecosystem even though I think
it's much less than it used to be.

223
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,320
It's just a fascinating thing to think
that there's people out there whose heads

224
00:06:55,321 --> 00:07:00,321
are just filled with psychic bees and
for whatever reason that ring driven out

225
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,350
into the streets and they
do awful fucking shit still.

226
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,240
If it just becomes more shocking,

227
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,500
the more a technology accelerates
those acts of violence,

228
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
they stand out more,

229
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:12,840
they seem more

230
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,570
barbaric,

231
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,760
they seem more horrific.

232
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean that's really what's
fueling like the furthest,

233
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,760
most fringe left wing ideas.

234
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,780
That's like one of my number one
problems that I have with like super

235
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,260
progressive people is that our agree
with them on almost everything.

236
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,660
But sometimes the way they go about
expressing themselves is so ridiculously

237
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,700
over the top that they become annoying.

238
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,350
And how do you mean they become bad for
the cause or bad for whatever idea they

239
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,184
have.

240
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,990
But ultimately what are they trying to do?

241
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,030
They're just trying to write it all out.

242
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,780
It's just the going so far and they're
so ridiculous with some of the ideas that

243
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:52,100
it just by quiet,

244
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,120
Oh God,

245
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,480
where would I begin the
the use of language.

246
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,590
It's a really important one.

247
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,570
You know like the people that get like
super upset at rape scenes in a movie or

248
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,030
rape scenes on a television show.

249
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,060
People that think that men and women
don't have to adhere to gender specific

250
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,710
roles,

251
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,370
which I agree.

252
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,581
You know,

253
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,211
you don't have to,

254
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,890
but to think that that's not the norm,

255
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:16,731
you know,

256
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:21,620
to think that in some way gender specific
roles for people aren't sort of carved

257
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,000
out in some ways by biologists.

258
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,341
Man.

259
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,360
I gotta tell you though,

260
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,081
that is a,

261
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,190
that is a thing that,

262
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,611
that,

263
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:26,970
that,

264
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,620
that idea is,

265
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,160
we'll be an antiquated
idea within 200 years.

266
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:37,161
I think that will be the idea that your
do your genetic gender assignment is the

267
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:41,880
gender you got to stick with will be
like thinking the Avatar that you pick in

268
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:46,881
GTA is the Avatar that you've got to
run around with permanently because it's

269
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,030
going to get easier and
easier to modify the body.

270
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,631
We don't,

271
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,050
we have no idea what's coming
down the tubes when it comes.

272
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,710
This,

273
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,620
the new stuff that they're
learning about how to alter DNA.

274
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,300
We have no idea what's coming down the
tubes when it comes to like futuristic

275
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:06,150
plastic surgery and the ease of it,

276
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,530
we,

277
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,470
we just don't know.

278
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:07,741
Oh,

279
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,521
no doubt man.

280
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:09,210
No doubt.

281
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,200
So when that happens,

282
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,130
it's cause it's kind of like,

283
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:13,170
the reason this stuff's
seems really weird,

284
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,213
uh,

285
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,090
to us is because mostly we've
grown up in a time where you and I,

286
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,900
especially if growing up in a time
where you used w there was no,

287
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,060
the words they're using right now is
not the words that they used to use it

288
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,610
with.

289
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,920
The word tranny was not an offensive word.

290
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,420
People would just use it.

291
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:30,991
They didn't know.

292
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:31,680
You didn't know.

293
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,250
So you know what the general idea was.

294
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,830
If you're growing up
back in the 70s or the,

295
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,150
or the early eighties.

296
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,790
It's not like everybody
was a complete her heart,

297
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,870
horrible bigot.

298
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,990
But at least I grew up in North Carolina.

299
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,991
So the public opinion on
transsexual people is not
what you would consider to be

300
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,711
rosy.

301
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,850
It's not like people are like,

302
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,690
they deserve rights,

303
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:56,090
they should get married and you live,

304
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,030
we're in a topic of discussion and
wasn't even a topic of discussion,

305
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,140
but the,

306
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,861
but now,

307
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:02,101
you know,

308
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,240
people are realizing,

309
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,931
Oh shit man,

310
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,390
I don't know if I have to be,

311
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,840
uh,

312
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,540
physically what my genetics are saying.

313
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,920
I have to be.

314
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,160
And uh,

315
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,170
so they go through this,

316
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,510
the thing Bruce Jenner's going through,

317
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,550
they take hormone replacement therapy,

318
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,750
I guess they get their,

319
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,090
their penis cut off and they get a vagina.

320
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:21,811
Uh,

321
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:24,270
and I don't think that you'd like
to have you phrase it like that.

322
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,380
How do you phrase it?

323
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,160
Um,

324
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,120
they get reconstructed.

325
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,291
Well the,

326
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,710
yeah.

327
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,131
Okay,

328
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,210
well that's scary.

329
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,750
Imagine sitting in when you're in your
Uber and the guy in the back seats as do

330
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,550
you want to get reconstructed tonight?

331
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,990
I honestly think that there's
gonna come a point in time we go,

332
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,780
or they're going to be able
to change you into anything.

333
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,440
That's it.

334
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,310
Anything male,

335
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:41,731
female,

336
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,310
you will go back and
forth from male to female.

337
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:44,730
Yeah.

338
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,470
I mean it might be a
thousand years from now,

339
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,490
but it's coming.

340
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,810
It's coming sooner than that,

341
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,300
at least in VR space because of the,

342
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,900
Oh,

343
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,231
you know,

344
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:52,501
the,

345
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,180
um,

346
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,620
I was just at this fucking crazy,

347
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,831
uh,

348
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,080
virtual reality gathering downtown,

349
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,220
cause I'm pals with this guy,

350
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,211
Johnny Ross.

351
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,050
He puts him on,

352
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,390
they had everything there,

353
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,111
everything there,

354
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,580
all the new high tech stuff was there.

355
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,280
They had the new valve VR prototype,

356
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:08,581
which is,

357
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,800
this makes my oculus rift look like shit.

358
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,450
But one of the things they add,

359
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,680
which was so incredible,

360
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,980
was a software that scans your face and
then turns that into the mask of some

361
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:21,090
other thing.

362
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,740
So if you're playing a video game,

363
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,270
you're theoretically,

364
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:29,271
your face would be sort of being scanned
and what it would look completely

365
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:29,821
different.

366
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,690
The expressions you are making in the
real world would translate into the

367
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:34,524
Avatar.

368
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,540
And that's pretty bad ass man to be
able to play an online role playing game

369
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,810
with avatars that are making real human
facial expressions and not just one

370
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,470
function of it.

371
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:46,951
Uh,

372
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,660
but it doesn't have to freak you out.

373
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,123
I love it.

374
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,900
Try to give you any pause.

375
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,530
It used to just go,

376
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,060
what the fuck are we doing?

377
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,310
I used to really not anymore,

378
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,520
man.

379
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,150
I happen.

380
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,020
I lifted my,

381
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,790
took Timothy Leary's advice.

382
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,450
What was it?

383
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,820
Lift up your legs and float downstream.

384
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,070
Don't worry.

385
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,300
Stop freaking out.

386
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,150
Don't,

387
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,010
there's nothing.

388
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,873
Number one,

389
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,920
you're not stopping it now.

390
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,930
It doesn't matter who you are.

391
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,660
It doesn't matter what plan you have.

392
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,730
It doesn't mean you ain't stopping it.

393
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,430
Elan Musk could take his clothes off,

394
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,710
climb on the top of the
empire state building,

395
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,860
and hold a banner that says AI is going
to destroy all humanity and nobody would

396
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,110
pay attention because you're talking about
something that seems to be more of a,

397
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,530
something deeper than
just human innovation.

398
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,810
It seems to be something like more of a,

399
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,060
a kind of momentum and an extra Robel
momentum in the direction of us having

400
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,020
100% control over the way we express
ourselves and the things we create and,

401
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,490
and not being limited by our current
meat bodies in any way at all.

402
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,220
That's where it's headed and
that's just one little piece of it.

403
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,480
It's not going to stop.

404
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,321
In fact,

405
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,640
this is the last age,

406
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,230
everyone should just,

407
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,650
you know,

408
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,650
go outside and look around and enjoy a
world where people aren't wearing visors.

409
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,560
In a world where all the clouds of data
surrounding you aren't being visualized

410
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:18,640
in a variety of ways that have
been created by programmers,

411
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,630
because that's what we're looking at.

412
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,631
Just the entire universe animated with
information in real time and people,

413
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,340
people's faces being
whatever they want it to be,

414
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:32,250
people's bodies being
whatever they want it to be.

415
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,820
I think it goes past that.

416
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,220
I think whatever you are as a human being,

417
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:40,030
you're going to eventually accept as
being a digital form because it's going to

418
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,680
be more exciting than the flesh.

419
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,780
You want to get to a point
where it's going to be better.

420
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,591
He,

421
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,980
the idea of you downloading your brain
to computer right now is horrific.

422
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:48,611
I'll go,

423
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:48,911
my God,

424
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,840
why would I want to do that?

425
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,200
Right?

426
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,741
But the idea,

427
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:54,130
if they can get your car and then
biologist say it's impossible,

428
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,200
but I just think it's impossible now,

429
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,610
but if they can get,

430
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,650
whenever your consciousness is,

431
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,200
they can get a digital image of that
absolute three d every molecule in exactly

432
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:07,684
the right place,

433
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,490
digital image of you,

434
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,880
and they can convert this into an
artificial body in instantaneously.

435
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,660
You will be conscious and aware.

436
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,380
Yeah,

437
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,430
that one's going to shut off.

438
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,140
This one's going to show it on click,

439
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,710
click.

440
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,191
Here we go.

441
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:21,550
Dunkin.

442
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,140
How are you?

443
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,540
Great.

444
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,410
Oh my God,

445
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,244
I'm in the mall.

446
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,040
He more,

447
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,270
Oh yeah,

448
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,770
you'd be a digital voice.

449
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,340
Yeah.

450
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,350
You'll be a great full,

451
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,500
it'll be a great voice.

452
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,334
You'll have.

453
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:34,731
Yeah,

454
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:35,391
it'll be great.

455
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:35,990
It's like,

456
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,620
it's one,

457
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,640
it's wonderful.

458
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,120
What's,

459
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,380
what's happening is wonderful,

460
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:39,830
but it's,

461
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,690
it is scary for a lot of people.

462
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,531
But man,

463
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:42,830
just,

464
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,663
just the,

465
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,650
that we have so many restrictions
on us that are based on our biology.

466
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,370
We,

467
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,650
humanity has just grown to accept you.

468
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:53,450
If you accept growing old,

469
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,690
you accept whatever your
particular physical disabilities
or talents have to be.

470
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
The idea that these could be enhanced in
such profound ways with exoskeletons or

471
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,320
with some kind of new,

472
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,170
a cybernetic red blood cells.

473
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,270
Uh,

474
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,570
it's,

475
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,420
it's crazy,

476
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,640
but it really does mirror a video game.

477
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,271
You know,

478
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,520
in a video game when I,

479
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,860
the character levels up and
it becomes a whole new game,

480
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:23,120
the game gets interesting again.

481
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,520
That's what's about to
happen to our species.

482
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,800
Like our species is about to level up.

483
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,430
It's about to become
an entirely new thing.

484
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,413
And it's a,

485
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,750
it's a few specific technologies
that are all converging,

486
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,471
uh,

487
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:37,910
that are forming this thing.

488
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:38,001
And,

489
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,160
and those technologies
are three d printing,

490
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,410
robotics and AI.

491
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,603
Um,

492
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,330
uh,

493
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,550
the legalization of psychedelics,

494
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,361
uh,

495
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,690
and farm psychopharmacology
that's happening right now,

496
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,380
the exploration into psychedelics and uh,

497
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:59,350
all forms of life extension therapy
and all of these things are,

498
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,260
they're meeting,

499
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,520
they're all going to meet,

500
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,050
they're all growing together.

501
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:08,051
They're all appendages that are growing
out of this sentient life form that

502
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,410
seems to be that we seem
to be headed towards a,

503
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,990
on our temporal spaceship
that we call planet earth.

504
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,650
And the appendages are sort of right
now we're beginning to see the first

505
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:22,070
budding growths of them
and the rudimentary Vr,

506
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:26,450
the rudimentary AI or the
rudimentary three d printing.

507
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,270
But the idea that you can
go into an artificial,

508
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:34,271
and I know a virtual space created by
an artificial intelligence that is a

509
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,260
replication of something that you
have stored in your memory that's been

510
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:44,120
downloaded and scan so that you could
go and live inside a memory in three d

511
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:44,954
space.

512
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,820
And then within that memory,

513
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,840
have some piece of it printed
out in a three d printer.

514
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,011
You know what I mean?

515
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,821
Like Holy Shit,

516
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:57,320
I'm hanging out at my grandmother's house
when I was six because they were able

517
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:01,910
to scan my memories and Tran
digitize it and put it in VR space.

518
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,073
Oh look,

519
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,930
there's that.

520
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,010
A pendant that my
grandmother liked a computer.

521
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,050
Print that out and then boom.

522
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:13,820
Now you've got a three d representation
of something inside your memories.

523
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,010
Oh my God.

524
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:15,844
I get that.

525
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Where are we going to put it all,

526
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,720
but it will just fill the
world up with three d images.

527
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,201
Yeah.

528
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:23,060
Their memories will be just clutter.

529
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,170
There'll be the new clutter.

530
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,000
Three d images of your past.

531
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,070
Junkyards filled with old grandma,

532
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,660
append and go out to a field.

533
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,440
What does this,

534
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,850
what does this apartment doing here?

535
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,170
This is the apartment where I grew up.

536
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,880
I rebuilt it out here in the field.

537
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,291
See that mattress?

538
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,400
I came on that mattress.

539
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,443
That's my car.

540
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,400
I reprinted it with the three d printer.

541
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,260
Yeah.

542
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,830
Yeah.

543
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,820
That's what you're looking at,

544
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,091
man.

545
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,960
That's what you're looking at.

546
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,190
You or looking at,

547
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:46,920
um,

548
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,410
now I now the memory downloading stuff,

549
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,940
I don't know of any kind of,

550
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,690
I don't,

551
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:51,991
that's,

552
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:52,110
I,

553
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,381
that's,

554
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,000
I think that's a little bit of a stretch.

555
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,180
I don't know exactly where
we're headed with that,

556
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,781
with that stuff,

557
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:00,000
but I do know that they're
learning a lot about memory.

558
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,590
I just heard that they have,

559
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,920
they think that they've figured out a
way to restore memory in people with

560
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:08,610
Alzheimer's disease using some
kind of like sonic technology to,

561
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,450
uh,

562
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:09,791
to,

563
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,050
to remove the plaque that's in
there and the memories come back.

564
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,370
So we're learning about memories and
the more we learn about memories and the

565
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,530
more we learn about what
you are talking about,

566
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,930
which is this hyper realistic,

567
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:22,890
detailed,

568
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,420
super ultra HD scan of the human brain,

569
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,690
then if that is possible to recreate
consciousness than it makes sense that you

570
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:37,230
would also be able to recreate the
memory's encoded inside the neurology that

571
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:38,070
you're duplicating.

572
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,730
I think that's where I was getting at
when I was talking about this idea that we

573
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:44,580
are,

574
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:44,970
we're,

575
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,260
we're in this weird space right now or
this is all happening when we were like

576
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,070
caterpillars that are giving birth to
a butterfly or be transforming into a

577
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:53,570
butterfly.

578
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:53,850
Yeah.

579
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,960
And it's all happening right.

580
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,620
Right in front of us.

581
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,890
That's why these violent
acts are so repulsive today.

582
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,340
Yeah.

583
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,200
I mean I think there
were always repulsive,

584
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,720
but now they seem particularly
repulsive because you'd like badly.

585
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,330
We have to look what's going on.

586
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,730
Look how much crazy shit is going on if
we're still having religious murders and

587
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,000
all this is going on.

588
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,690
Yeah.

589
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,280
So it's,

590
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,700
there's this weird sort of
disruption in the potential of,

591
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,970
of the situation.

592
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:21,660
That's right.

593
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,830
And this weird disruption
is like being met with more,

594
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,730
more people are looking
at these disruptions now
than ever before and you're

595
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,110
getting extremes on that end.

596
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,720
I think you and I caught a
moderate in our progressiveness.

597
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,300
Right.

598
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,140
And we're both like
totally pro gay marriage,

599
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:39,600
totally pro abortion rights,

600
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,280
do whatever the fuck you want to do.

601
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,900
As long as you're not
harming other people,

602
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,690
but be responsible for your actions too.

603
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,880
And I think more,

604
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,500
more and more people are,

605
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,120
at least in my opinion,

606
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:55,530
what I'm running into kind and aware
that I think ever in my life time,

607
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:56,850
more people were kind of aware.

608
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,810
That's where people are also aware
of like the benefit of being kind.

609
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,380
That's right.

610
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,000
But along the way,

611
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,710
you're going to have
extremes on both sides.

612
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:06,510
You're going to have extreme religious,

613
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,530
crazy fucking people.

614
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,650
You can cause extreme left wing lunatics.

615
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,090
You can have all sorts of people.

616
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,860
Like Chris Ryan said it best.

617
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,551
He was like,

618
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:16,890
they're a fascist wearing hippie clothes.

619
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,490
Right?

620
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,870
They're wearing a hippie outfit.

621
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,230
Yup.

622
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,830
And there's,

623
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,760
there's that too.

624
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,900
But what it,

625
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,900
what we're learning from all of this is
that we know more about what's going on

626
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,040
and we know more about where we're
headed than we've ever known before.

627
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,610
But yet we're still completely in the
dark as to where this thing could.

628
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,500
That's right.

629
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,790
We don't know where it could go,

630
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,850
but we are the midwives of the thing and
that's the frustration is here we are.

631
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,210
All of us are,

632
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,120
are either via our attention or
some people like Rick Doblin and,

633
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:53,121
and the work they're actually doing
or our Kurzweil or Musk or any of the

634
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,860
luminaries who are at
actively transforming society
with their technological

635
00:20:59,051 --> 00:20:59,884
innovation.

636
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,430
These are midwives and they're their
rue drawing this thing out there,

637
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:08,110
letting this thing be born and while
they're letting this thing be born in what

638
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,450
is being born is you can
call it whatever you want.

639
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,220
You can call it a renaissance,

640
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,340
you can call it the tech,

641
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,850
no messiah,

642
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,470
you can call it whatever
you want to call it.

643
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,570
But this thing being born has not existed
as far as we're aware on this planet.

644
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:23,051
And if it did,

645
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:25,870
it was before one of
those meteorite impacts.

646
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,040
You talk about some time,

647
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,250
but here we are delivering this thing
and end the fucking delivery room in this

648
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:37,351
incredible period in human history where
we're looking at complete control over

649
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,500
our genetics,

650
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,740
solving some of the world's
greatest problems solving,

651
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,660
like curing diseases,

652
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,291
uh,

653
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,060
that we thought we never could cure.

654
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,950
There's like assholes throwing
firecrackers in the fucking delivery room,

655
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,180
yapping about some
invisible angry guy that,

656
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:55,690
uh,

657
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,460
the hates gay people.

658
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,370
And that's really
frustrating because you're,

659
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,620
you're witnessing,

660
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,543
uh,

661
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,160
the most radical form of violence,

662
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,420
which is not just violence,

663
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,560
human to human,

664
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,860
but violence in the sense of trying to
destroy the potentiality of our species

665
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,920
by clinging to an antiquated and
ridiculous notion of what God looks like.

666
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,783
And that's,

667
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,850
if there is anything
more violent than that,

668
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,290
I can't imagine what it could be.

669
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,201
No,

670
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:27,680
it's,

671
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,140
it's the most archaic evolve beliefs.

672
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,970
The most archaic of all beliefs is this
magic man that you've never met once you

673
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,620
to kill people who don't believe in him.

674
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes.

675
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,750
That Dad's bananas.

676
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,410
And this is,

677
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,280
this is one of those things that just
been around for long enough to get

678
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,650
traction and it's become
a normal part of life.

679
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,270
But if you tried to introduce it today,

680
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,430
if most people lived a secular life
and you tried to introduce radical

681
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,230
Christianity right today,

682
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,920
yes,

683
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,580
they would be one of the most ridiculous
conversations you could ever have with

684
00:22:58,581 --> 00:22:58,821
people.

685
00:22:58,821 --> 00:22:59,351
They would be the,

686
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,830
the news would report on it,

687
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,190
right?

688
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,930
It would be like they would
talk about the effort.

689
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,270
This strange new cult has come to town.

690
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:07,280
Then once you believe that a,

691
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,760
you were born from original sin and a,

692
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,180
there's a man who died.

693
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,170
They had a hammer him together.

694
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:12,981
He was a son of God.

695
00:23:12,981 --> 00:23:13,880
They had a hammer him to,

696
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,280
some would otherwise they
couldn't fix the whole thing.

697
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,540
There's no other way to do it.

698
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,680
And uh,

699
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,070
they,

700
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,610
they wrote this stuff down back then and
we just passed down from generation to

701
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,211
generation.

702
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,680
And then this is God's word and that's,

703
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,480
that sounds like something,

704
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:27,470
if it didn't exist,

705
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,840
like if you're on the bus with
someone and they started saying it,

706
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,160
you'd switch seats because you're like,

707
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:31,761
shit man,

708
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,710
I sat next to the fucking crazy.

709
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,090
But what was it?

710
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,950
What,

711
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,640
what do you think the original Bible was?

712
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,050
The original Bible man?

713
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:43,970
I think it was a transmission that was
prepping the way for this thing that's

714
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:44,391
coming.

715
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,140
I think it,

716
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,590
uh,

717
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,010
one of the many in the same way you've
got Ilan mosque in the same way you've

718
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,450
got luminaries now,

719
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:54,320
I think back then you add luminaries
who are looking around at a world where

720
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,730
people were barbaric,

721
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,040
barbaric and getting
crucified and they were like,

722
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,874
okay,

723
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,241
you know,

724
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,290
look what they had to work with,

725
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:00,531
man.

726
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:01,730
You have to start with like,

727
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,331
hold on,

728
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:07,331
maybe love your enemy as you love
yourself or these ideas that are unifying

729
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,470
these ideas that can create real
peace because you need the piece.

730
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,740
If you are looking at what's
coming is the formation of a baby,

731
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,980
then whatever early religion
is propagating any kind
of diminishment in war,

732
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,710
any kind of,

733
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,230
or even the attempt to reduce violence,

734
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,370
then you're looking at this.

735
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:32,480
It's kind of like trying to create the
pod within which this thing can grow

736
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,830
cause we need peace.

737
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:36,940
We need stability in whatever
way we can get get to.

738
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,100
Now.

739
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,240
I'm not saying that the creators
of the buy of the New Testament,

740
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,700
the gospels were like,

741
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:44,031
Shit,

742
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:44,241
man,

743
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:47,690
we better come up with this ridiculous
idea so that there can be robots in the

744
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:48,524
future.

745
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,080
But I think,

746
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:51,621
yeah,

747
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:52,161
but that is,

748
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:53,180
it's all the process,

749
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:53,330
right?

750
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,530
It's part of the process,

751
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:56,180
which is why it's so ironic.

752
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,190
Did the people saying
there's an invisible God,

753
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,600
he wants him to kill other people.

754
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,520
Uh,

755
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,390
they're there while
they're doing all this.

756
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,660
The actual God is in the birthing process
in the laboratories and universities

757
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,730
and think tanks of the,

758
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:11,564
of the planet.

759
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,410
It's oozing through the human
imagination and manifesting.

760
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,110
Is it all these high tech
technologies that are,

761
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,720
that have as one of their byproducts?

762
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,730
The tendency to heal.

763
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,200
You're talking about people,

764
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,370
three d printing,

765
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:27,200
they're fucking artificial limbs.

766
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:31,800
Now think about that man that used to be
so hard to get an an artificial limb is

767
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:32,900
so expensive.

768
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,890
Like now you could just print it
out if that's what did Jesus do?

769
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,930
He went around healing people.

770
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,940
And you're seeing the very same thing.

771
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,830
Like cancer is like the,

772
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,693
the,

773
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,121
the,

774
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:44,511
the,

775
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,110
uh,

776
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,340
cancer prognosis,

777
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,060
at least in a lot of cases is
much better than it ever has been.

778
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,810
Not to mention the treatment of all
the varieties of maladies that we have.

779
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:57,350
I'm not like saying Western
medicine is the ultimate thing,

780
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:01,640
but it is helping people live
longer and healing people.

781
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,683
And it's in it.

782
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,580
It can be a very beautiful force.

783
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,491
Uh,

784
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:08,150
it also is an incredibly
destructive force too,

785
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,120
but it has a lot of wonderful byproducts.

786
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:15,121
So I think that it's incredibly ironic
that those folks can't see that they're

787
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:20,621
looking for a god that was invented
when the actual God is right in front of

788
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:23,504
them.

789
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,943
Uh,

790
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,400
and in all the high tech shit that
we see scattered around this planet.

791
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,680
Well it exists in the universe
wanting us to create it.

792
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,580
Whatever the fuck is inside of people
that makes us want to breed and make

793
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:41,220
buildings and keep pushing forward.

794
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,040
It's also the same that gives us

795
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,180
almost universally a desire
for better shit all the time.

796
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,860
Almost universally people are starting
to be so entrenched into this idea of

797
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,280
technological innovation
that all the new shit,

798
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,580
they're,

799
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,390
they're up on it.

800
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,380
They're talking about it.

801
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,370
You hear what's going on.

802
00:26:59,371 --> 00:26:59,671
Yeah.

803
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,510
Masters uh,

804
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,160
creating a new laptop,

805
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:07,161
master's going to get us a 15
inch with a visual optical drive.

806
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:12,150
He reads your retina and plays the
w w we were all like master has us,

807
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,280
master is the machine that makes stuff.

808
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,580
Master master master is the
machine that makes stuff.

809
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,890
And the more of a ball where you are,

810
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,830
the more store flew gammas,

811
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,683
stove,

812
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,790
older stove and this idea that that's
success and that's based on not happiness.

813
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,461
No,

814
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:33,220
not the amount of positive interactions
you have between loved one.

815
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,750
Nope.

816
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,470
Not that.

817
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,520
Know what,

818
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,140
how much shit you got,

819
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,760
how many Zeros and ones,

820
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,710
how much of a boost or you giving to this
system that's trying to give birth to

821
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:44,850
an artificial intelligence.

822
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,211
Yeah.

823
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:45,931
That's how much,

824
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:46,500
how much money,

825
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,011
how much money,

826
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:47,844
how much houses,

827
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,331
and just buy,

828
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:48,481
buy,

829
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:48,601
buy,

830
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:48,751
buy,

831
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:48,871
buy,

832
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:48,991
buy,

833
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:49,520
buy.

834
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,490
You demand the best.

835
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:51,121
You demand the best.

836
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,200
We can reengineer it.

837
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,450
We can make it better with a
better model for Mr. Jones.

838
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,201
Mr. Jones,

839
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:56,670
was that the model that floats,

840
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,050
let's make the bottle with a hoverboard.

841
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,130
And before you know it,

842
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:00,600
it's going further and
further and further.

843
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,020
And for almost all,

844
00:28:02,021 --> 00:28:05,190
it was fueled by this desire for Shit,

845
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,361
materialism,

846
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,290
market pressures,

847
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,124
as it's called.

848
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:08,690
And it,

849
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,520
and it's cool to know that that's
what's manifesting the thing.

850
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,030
It's not,

851
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,680
it's cool to recognize that the,

852
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,610
whatever the womb of technology is,

853
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,030
it's,

854
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,050
it's using everything.

855
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,280
It's using greed,

856
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,740
it's using altruism,

857
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,470
it's using creativity.

858
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,790
It's using every little bit of
nutrients that's floating around.

859
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,840
Our paradigm is being
absorbed into this being.

860
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:34,471
And you know,

861
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:35,630
sometimes like bs,

862
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:35,940
right?

863
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,690
Bees,

864
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,890
they're working fucking hard,

865
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,161
right?

866
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,120
They're out there getting Paulin.

867
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,990
Uh,

868
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,100
and I know this is dumb
cause they probably,

869
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,480
I don't know how it be might think,

870
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,570
but I bet that the B isn't thinking,

871
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,951
fuck man,

872
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:51,810
I've got to get more pollen
for the fucking hive.

873
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,340
I've got to do this man
to work really hard.

874
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,300
I think it's thinking,

875
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,270
God flowers feel so good
are all around inside of,

876
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,290
I just love rolling around inside of
flowers and I think in the same way humans

877
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,910
when they're doing all these things that
seem like recreation and leisure and

878
00:29:08,911 --> 00:29:09,744
hedonism,

879
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,830
they don't realize it,

880
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,520
but they're,

881
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,660
they're building the machine to their
building the machine by their desire for

882
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:19,860
more heightened levels of hedonism for
heightened levels of sense gratification,

883
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,210
for heightened ability to
express themselves or to
bring what's in their mind

884
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,110
out into the world.

885
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,320
They're all worker bees that are
helping to push forward the birth of,

886
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:31,990
of,

887
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,990
of whatever this thing is that is
currently fermenting in the womb of time.

888
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,440
We're giving birth to a new thing.

889
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,160
I think it's going to be a life form,

890
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,510
but it's just not going to be a life form.

891
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,040
Like the way we see life forms.

892
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,380
We've,

893
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,660
we have a very rigid idea of life forms
and our life forms have to be alive.

894
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:50,500
They have to have sex,

895
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:52,210
they have to breed somehow or another,

896
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:55,810
they have to replicate genetics
through biological methods only.

897
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:56,620
That's it.

898
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,640
And that's it.

899
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,840
And then you have to have blood and bone
or something really similar that we can

900
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,920
map out and show the difference.

901
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:03,670
Like a slug,

902
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,840
like what exactly is slug,

903
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:07,020
how it's got some weird skin thing.

904
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,900
There's no bones.

905
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:08,141
Okay.

906
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:08,530
Yeah.

907
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:08,741
Okay.

908
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:09,580
But that's alive too.

909
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,390
I get it.

910
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,430
And this is going to be a new thing.

911
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,660
This is going to be a new thing,

912
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,620
you know?

913
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,640
And along the way,

914
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,040
we're going to have some
fucking bumps in the road.

915
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,690
It's going to be real weird.

916
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,890
There's going to be some bumps,

917
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:21,310
man.

918
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,490
There's going to be some
serious fucking pumps.

919
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,361
No way around it.

920
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:26,050
You ever,

921
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,400
you know,

922
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,730
20 I Terrence,

923
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,400
I ever saw this great
Mckenna Youtube here.

924
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,861
Forgive me.

925
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,530
Every time I come on your
show on blab about him.

926
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,240
But the God man,

927
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:39,241
he gives this great description of what's
happening is we approach this event,

928
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,840
he compares it to a,

929
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,300
like a,

930
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,510
uh,

931
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,680
an airplane accelerating.

932
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,720
And the more you accelerate,

933
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,340
the more turbulence you get.

934
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,620
And so that's the,

935
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,330
that as we like sort of exit
the whatever the atmosphere is,

936
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:58,930
if the current time period that we're
existing in a move into this next place

937
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:00,340
that they're calling the singularity,

938
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,990
there's going to be some turbulence.

939
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:03,530
There's going to be some bar,

940
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,290
some serious fucking bumps,

941
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:05,591
man.

942
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:06,424
But,

943
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,031
uh,

944
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,290
there's gonna be bumps no matter what.

945
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,550
If we don't do this,

946
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,420
there's going to be bumps.

947
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,670
If every scientist on earth was like,

948
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,420
you know what,

949
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,890
let's not work on AI.

950
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,320
Let's not try to harness this power.

951
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,470
Let's keep technology exactly
where it is right now.

952
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,551
Oh,

953
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:22,384
we're fucked.

954
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,800
We're fucked.

955
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,450
Then we're super fucked.

956
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,751
Oh,

957
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,710
then we're just doomed.

958
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,410
Like if all technology
stopped advancing right now,

959
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,303
how would we be fucked?

960
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Because the problems that are emerging
right now are so fucking severe that the

961
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,620
idea that human,

962
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,120
a human being or human intelligence is
going to be able to solve a lot of them

963
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,310
is a,

964
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,270
that's an optimistic idea.

965
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,740
We're looking at ice caps,

966
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:48,790
fucking melting.

967
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,610
We're looking at people
all over the world,

968
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,480
uh,

969
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,470
just out of control
humping like people are,

970
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,543
they're just,

971
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,443
they're just,

972
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,351
they're,

973
00:31:59,351 --> 00:31:59,930
they're,

974
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,930
they're filling up policies
with babies left and right.

975
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:06,580
It's happening everywhere.

976
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:07,660
No one's thinking about it,

977
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:07,890
man.

978
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,330
You one year of water in California,

979
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,550
one year of water in California,

980
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,830
apparently one year of
whatever that means.

981
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,031
Guaranteed.

982
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:21,031
Right now there's 50,000
people in California where
there's sprinklers on full

983
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:24,340
blast watching their sweet green yard.

984
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,830
They know there's one year
of water left in California.

985
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:27,071
They're like,

986
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:27,910
whatever,

987
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,140
whatever.

988
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,980
Here's the big one.

989
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,390
Golf courses.

990
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,021
Oh yeah.

991
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,520
Those fucking golf courses

992
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,413
play golf.

993
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,160
If I did,

994
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,410
I'm sure it'd be
sympathetic and I'd be like,

995
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:37,621
look,

996
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:38,311
I'm paying my money.

997
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:39,290
I want my fucking water.

998
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,100
That's right.

999
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,440
Can they water the golf?

1000
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,403
The Ocean?

1001
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,800
No.

1002
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,830
Too Salty right now.

1003
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,430
They can use reclaimed water,

1004
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,680
water,

1005
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,513
the golf.

1006
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,451
So much.

1007
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,540
I know about golf water,

1008
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,870
the golf course course.

1009
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,430
Can they do that with salt water?

1010
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,610
Salt water is getting wrong is
he's going to fuck up grass.

1011
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:59,570
I think you need some
nice pure clean water.

1012
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,370
But I think that you
can use reclaimed water.

1013
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:01,551
I mean,

1014
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,020
I'm sure there are solutions,

1015
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
but you know,

1016
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,100
my point is we've got some serious uh,

1017
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,650
difficulties facing us and um,

1018
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,580
uh,

1019
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,990
a lot of this stuff that we need to
fix some of these problems is that

1020
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:16,910
technology doesn't quite exist yet,

1021
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,180
but we do know that it's coming based
on the very predictable acceleration

1022
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:23,654
that's happening.

1023
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,703
Um,

1024
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,420
did they call a Moore's law?

1025
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,261
So we know,

1026
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:27,561
okay,

1027
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:32,561
well we can kind of guesstimate how fast
computers are going to be in 10 years

1028
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,400
based on that concept.

1029
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:39,260
And we can look at the problems that
simulators currently are capable of

1030
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:40,094
solving.

1031
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,821
Uh,

1032
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,654
what,

1033
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,100
what kind of problems can a simulator
that has the power of every human brain on

1034
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:46,960
the planet sof?

1035
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,560
If you ask that,

1036
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,280
uh,

1037
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,280
how to deal with the ice caps melting or
overpopulation or some disease running

1038
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,030
rampant,

1039
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,980
what would you think
would be move number one?

1040
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,330
What would you like if you,

1041
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,970
if you wanted to deal
with any of those issues?

1042
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,330
I would think clean up the ocean
is probably one of the first ones,

1043
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:07,164
right?

1044
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,810
Chart.

1045
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,060
Stop chopping down the forest.

1046
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,290
Clean up the oceans.

1047
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,620
Yeah.

1048
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,430
Those are two huge,

1049
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,851
huge islands,

1050
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:12,060
right?

1051
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,760
That's like a kid who like
wants to go play outside,

1052
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,220
but you have shit all
over your bedroom walls.

1053
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,530
Yeah.

1054
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,720
You just shit on your wall.

1055
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:20,790
It's like what do you do when you got
to know you've got to clean this up.

1056
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,624
You fuck,

1057
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,680
you can't just keep going.

1058
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,580
That's right.

1059
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,390
We've made this big mess of the
ocean and the F and everyone's like,

1060
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,051
God,

1061
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:28,770
I didn't do it.

1062
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,603
I didn't do it.

1063
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,050
Nobody wants to say they did it.

1064
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:31,201
Like,

1065
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:35,400
nobody wants to look at that chuge
fucking patch of garbage that's floating

1066
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,160
around the Pacific Ocean that all
these scientists are terrified of.

1067
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,550
Right.

1068
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,140
Nobody wants to like look at that and go,

1069
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:40,381
hey,

1070
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:40,591
hey,

1071
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:40,801
hey,

1072
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:41,041
hey,

1073
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:41,730
hey,

1074
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,150
okay.

1075
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,260
We did a little bit.

1076
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:44,071
You did a little bit.

1077
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:44,701
Let's chip in.

1078
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,534
We got to do this.

1079
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,860
We've got to fix this first.

1080
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:47,400
Like nobody,

1081
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,233
nobody wants.

1082
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,421
Well,

1083
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:49,380
nobody wants,

1084
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,290
I mean the problem is nobody wants to do,

1085
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,310
I mean just say no,

1086
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:54,180
but I want to say no.

1087
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,560
Governments want to do that.

1088
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:55,771
Well,

1089
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:56,011
no,

1090
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,030
I mean fuck that.

1091
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,470
How about November one two?

1092
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:58,741
Well,

1093
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,180
I mean I think people want to,

1094
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,020
people that are super concerned,

1095
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:02,291
they just,

1096
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:04,090
I don't think they have the funds or the,

1097
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,070
maybe the,

1098
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,681
the means.

1099
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:06,970
I don't know if there's a physical,

1100
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,940
that's what we need that.

1101
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:09,081
See,

1102
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:12,890
that's part of what technology
can do is it can connect people.

1103
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:13,750
I mean look at what it,

1104
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,010
how great it is it raising money.

1105
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,250
Look at how powerful it is when it comes
to any kind of goal that you want as a

1106
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:22,250
society.

1107
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,540
Just what you were saying is like a lot
of us are so brainwashed that we think,

1108
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,321
well,

1109
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:29,450
I hope the government
handles this problem,

1110
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,590
but the governments aren't the ones who
are going to be transforming the earth.

1111
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:38,591
It's going to be the super connected
citizens who are using technology to

1112
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:43,020
manifest their will and
hopefully positive ways.

1113
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,571
Yeah,

1114
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,620
there's gotta be,

1115
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,940
there's,

1116
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,940
there's going to be no way in the next
five years to put a lid on this thing.

1117
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,571
Oh,

1118
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:54,930
on,

1119
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,440
on the,

1120
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,981
on the,

1121
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,090
on the spread of technology.

1122
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,781
Oh fuck.

1123
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,400
Now you can't stop it.

1124
00:35:59,520 --> 00:35:59,761
I mean,

1125
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:00,330
that's a verdict.

1126
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,691
I mean there's,

1127
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:05,360
if everyone might as well just give up
the idea that in some way this thing is,

1128
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:09,630
is being stopped and everyone just has
to accept the fact that this stuff is

1129
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,790
coming and also accept the fact that,

1130
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,390
uh,

1131
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,120
the world is a fuck load better
than a lot of people think.

1132
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,500
And that's big.

1133
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,670
And that's a big,

1134
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,440
big shift that needs to happen.

1135
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:19,621
I mean,

1136
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,190
I think,

1137
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,491
you know,

1138
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:22,080
even as we figure it out,

1139
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,160
deal with the oceans or any
great problem facing us,

1140
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,490
there also needs to be a
deep and a prolonged ener,

1141
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:33,930
uh,

1142
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,320
work that people need to be having
with themselves because we are a,

1143
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,380
Migdal Ezer going fucking nuts right now.

1144
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,363
Have you seen this?

1145
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,840
Oh Wow.

1146
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,440
Have you seen this?

1147
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:43,591
No.

1148
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,730
This is a new robot.

1149
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,391
Look at this.

1150
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:45,870
You want to shut,

1151
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,070
your parents are going to shit your pants.

1152
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:47,551
Oh,

1153
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,060
I've seen that.

1154
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,990
I've seen that Gao.

1155
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,441
Yeah,

1156
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,060
I've seen that one.

1157
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,990
Like a Japanese new robot
that they've created.

1158
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:55,920
It's a woman and it will
blow your fucking mind.

1159
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,280
You think you're being taken and
I'll do more than blow your mind.

1160
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,923
I know.

1161
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,730
It's the craziest looking robot
I have ever seen in my life.

1162
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,870
It's very realistic.

1163
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:11,580
So really super realistic.

1164
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:11,810
The,

1165
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:16,810
the youtube video is titled Very Real
Looking robot and it's one of those,

1166
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:18,600
um,

1167
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,270
it's one of those breakthroughs
where you look at it and just go,

1168
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,200
oh wow.

1169
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,370
I didn't know they were that far.

1170
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:23,860
Right.

1171
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,071
Well,

1172
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,320
I didn't know they had got that far.

1173
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,011
And you know,

1174
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:26,251
man,

1175
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,050
it's like,

1176
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,600
that's cool,

1177
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,710
that's fucking cool.

1178
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,550
And that,

1179
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:29,950
that's a,

1180
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,960
that's an amazing,

1181
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:31,950
amazing thing.

1182
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,970
Uh,

1183
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,100
and that's nothing compared and you know,

1184
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,470
that humanoid robot thing
that everyone's sort of,

1185
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,210
we've envisioned is what it is.

1186
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,180
That's really like just
one little piece of,

1187
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:44,190
of what we've got coming down the pipes.

1188
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,433
Um,

1189
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,060
and the other interesting
thing to think about is those,

1190
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,200
uh,

1191
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,070
beings,

1192
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,100
the robots are going to be vessels within
which the AI will exist because the AI

1193
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,370
is going to exist in the cloud.

1194
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,550
So what's really curious is that we
will have this new kind of wind blowing

1195
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,420
through the world.

1196
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,010
It's the wind of the cloud,

1197
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:08,520
of all the,

1198
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,520
all the data that is now
become personified or
personalized by some artificial

1199
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,710
intelligence and that
data whenever it wants to,

1200
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,880
we'll be able to pop in to open a portals,

1201
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,680
which will be robots.

1202
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,410
So robots or cars for
artificial intelligence and
artificial intelligence isn't

1203
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,550
going to be localized inside the robot.

1204
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,780
That's what we all think.

1205
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:31,021
You know,

1206
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:31,470
you,

1207
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,020
you go to the robot and you
like ask it the right question.

1208
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,060
It's eyes bulge out and smoke
comes out and you beat the robot.

1209
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,580
That's now it works it on the robot.

1210
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,160
The fucking image.

1211
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,551
Yeah.

1212
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,211
That's the image.

1213
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:44,620
So bugs bunny cartoon or something.

1214
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:44,921
Yeah,

1215
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,180
it's from Star Trek.

1216
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:46,471
You're like,

1217
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:46,991
good God.

1218
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,330
Make a rock so big he can't move it.

1219
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,740
And the robot White Palau it explicitly.

1220
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,720
That was star Trek.

1221
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,200
Well,

1222
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,070
that wasn't the question,

1223
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:58,270
but there are the ideas
you can malfunction or an
AI if you ask it the right

1224
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:58,810
question.

1225
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,770
That's a perfect one.

1226
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,950
If God can God make a rock so big
that even he couldn't move it.

1227
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,370
Yeah,

1228
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,203
that's a good one.

1229
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:04,660
Yeah.

1230
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:04,881
It's,

1231
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,930
it's like the robot can handle that.

1232
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,230
You handle it can of pop.

1233
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,490
That's what we think.

1234
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,840
That's how you fight these things.

1235
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,520
But the riddles riddles

1236
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,340
fight the Robo with a real,

1237
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,583
yeah,

1238
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,030
but,

1239
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,331
but,

1240
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:23,720
but you see you're,

1241
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:25,060
you're talking about this,

1242
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:25,360
uh,

1243
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,571
it's,

1244
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,571
it's very similar to a lot of mystical
conceptualizations of way human life is,

1245
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:35,791
which is that human beings are antennas
for a transcendent intelligence that

1246
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,050
tunes in to the specific genetic
code that is inside of every person.

1247
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:46,840
That unique code is like
a radio station that the,

1248
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,560
uh,

1249
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,140
vast supernatural,

1250
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,590
undiscovered transcendent cloud of
consciousness that they used to call God

1251
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,240
tunes into or is channeled through.

1252
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,920
It's the same idea with robots.

1253
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:04,720
The idea will be there will be this AI
existing in the cloud that whenever it

1254
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,201
wants to,

1255
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,790
we'll be able to pop into a,

1256
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,070
um,

1257
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,903
a machine.

1258
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,661
What's that sound?

1259
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:11,430
Is that a car alarm?

1260
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,451
It's weird.

1261
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:16,310
It's coming through that
you hear in the headphones.

1262
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:16,860
It sounds,

1263
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,693
yeah,

1264
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,733
it's freaking me out.

1265
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,560
Cheeses.

1266
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,393
Chamie

1267
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,611
what could it be?

1268
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:24,260
Maybe it's a toilet overflowing.

1269
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,670
There's a car alarm going off.

1270
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,750
Hopefully it's not yours.

1271
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,093
I don't

1272
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,001
thank my car.

1273
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,500
The government man,

1274
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,030
they don't want us to talk about this.

1275
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:33,571
They love it.

1276
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:34,404
The government loves us,

1277
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,510
you know they do.

1278
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,370
The military loves this shit.

1279
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,300
That's one of the,

1280
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,410
that's one of the engine's pushing
this thing next door alarm.

1281
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,660
Sorry Ladies and gentlemen.

1282
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,980
Do you think Dee Dee is
really a conscious effort?

1283
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,660
Like people love what's going on,

1284
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,410
like they actually enjoy it or do you
think that it's just this inevitable thing

1285
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,600
that people are trying to profit
off of in one way or another?

1286
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,321
Be a part of it?

1287
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:01,840
Benefit from just ride this wave.

1288
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:03,880
Just stay on the board as long as you can.

1289
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,200
Do you think it's more that than it is
like they love it because it's good for

1290
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:08,831
business.

1291
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,150
Like that's how we would like to look at.

1292
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,750
Yeah,

1293
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,920
they love chaos.

1294
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,470
Stay level profit off of it.

1295
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,480
Oh God.

1296
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:17,980
If only it were that easy.

1297
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,580
It's,

1298
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,000
it's just not that easy man there.

1299
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:20,321
And you know,

1300
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:20,830
when I,

1301
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,960
I just interviewed Doblin
and he's talking about,

1302
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,621
you know,

1303
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:28,621
going into the Pentagon to talk about
using Mtma to treat PTSD with these high

1304
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:33,190
level people and they're not
like you to Hippie Juror Aggie.

1305
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:33,980
They're like,

1306
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,371
oh,

1307
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:34,761
okay.

1308
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:39,020
I think we understand what you're saying
and that's kind of stunning when you

1309
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:39,980
realize that this,

1310
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,843
that that,

1311
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,380
that,

1312
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,500
that you can't demonize all facets of,

1313
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,291
of the government.

1314
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:50,291
There are people in parts
of the government that
must be an awful nefarious,

1315
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:52,220
greedy fucks,

1316
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,480
but also in there there's great people
who really want the world to be better

1317
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,030
and to think that just because you
end up at with a government job,

1318
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,510
he therefore means you're
evil is the most ridiculous,

1319
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,460
stupid idea of all time.

1320
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:04,971
It doesn't,

1321
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:05,781
it's a lot of people,

1322
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:06,320
man,

1323
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,220
they actually want to,

1324
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,400
they're not like us.

1325
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,660
Like we're comedians.

1326
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:15,020
We enjoy telling jokes and we have a
podcast and I think we both have our own

1327
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:16,520
desire to like help the world,

1328
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,410
but some people,

1329
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,030
they want to help the world so fucking
bad that through high school they

1330
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:23,870
volunteer,

1331
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,250
they get out of high school,

1332
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,510
go to fucking college,

1333
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,740
joined the Peace Corps and they
give their entire lives up,

1334
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,770
making very little money
to try to help people.

1335
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,431
And those people,

1336
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:37,640
sometimes they get into the military and
sometimes they get into the government

1337
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,800
because they see that
as the most efficient,

1338
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,250
obvious way of helping
the world and so yeah,

1339
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,080
we can't do the whole black
and white thing anymore,

1340
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:46,610
but some of those people are not,

1341
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:46,941
oh,

1342
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:47,990
let's have very high.

1343
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,640
Some of those people are just like us.

1344
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:50,474
They're like,

1345
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,040
Holy Shit,

1346
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,690
this is incredible.

1347
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,170
Let's fund this and see
where we can take it.

1348
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,820
Let's see what we can do with it.

1349
00:42:59,090 --> 00:42:59,970
Everyone's like that.

1350
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,070
That isn't my best case scenario is that
our government actually becomes cool is

1351
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:07,130
that the internet sort of forces only
cool people in the office and our

1352
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,230
government becomes something
we can all tolerate.

1353
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,700
Yeah.

1354
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,431
That's a dream.

1355
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:11,270
The ultimate thing,

1356
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:11,720
I mean this,

1357
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,040
the structure itself is really only a
problem when enough corruption exists to

1358
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,380
capitalize on the holes in the system.

1359
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:18,770
Yeah,

1360
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,410
like the,

1361
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:19,790
the,

1362
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:24,790
the being influenced by big
money corporations twist
policy to suit their needs.

1363
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:27,884
They could profit.

1364
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,300
All that stuff's a problem,

1365
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,600
but the system itself is not
the worst system in the world.

1366
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:32,991
No,

1367
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,500
it's not.

1368
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,221
It's not awful.

1369
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:35,210
If everybody was cool,

1370
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:35,721
you know,

1371
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,280
if you had an entire system,

1372
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,361
you know,

1373
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:39,590
have a think,

1374
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:40,520
have a very nice person.

1375
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,480
Who's your favorite person?

1376
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,461
Uh,

1377
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:43,610
he was like one of the sweetest,

1378
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:44,500
most intelligent PR.

1379
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,980
How Bout Dj Doug Pound,

1380
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,230
Dj deadpan Dj Doug Pounds.

1381
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:49,140
Cools fucks Mars.

1382
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,360
One of the coolest people on Earth.

1383
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,470
If he was in a position of a
mayor or governor or you know,

1384
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,910
senator,

1385
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,180
if the whole system was
built with guys like that,

1386
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,260
it'd be the coolest.

1387
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:04,460
It'd be the greatest thing ever.

1388
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,320
Weirdest.

1389
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,550
It would be beautiful world ever.

1390
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,070
Every congressman Dj Doug Pounds,

1391
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,730
that'd be amazing.

1392
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,600
That kind of guy,

1393
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,440
that Kinda guy kind of guy I was not
trying to fuck you over or just wants to

1394
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,580
have fun with his
friends is very creative.

1395
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,260
Very intelligent and very considerate.

1396
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,070
Yeah.

1397
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,490
Yeah.

1398
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,450
Well that's possible,

1399
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:20,960
man.

1400
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,190
That's fucking possible.

1401
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,430
We just don't think it's possible because
these wolves have been in office for

1402
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:26,031
so long,

1403
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:26,300
right.

1404
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,830
Snapping at each other's heels and
the all the competitors at bay.

1405
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,190
Yeah.

1406
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,090
Woven it out.

1407
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,420
Right.

1408
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,300
Big corporations are stuffing their wolf
assholes picking up their wolf tail.

1409
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:42,510
And it just packing money and their wolf
assholes and sending them out there to

1410
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:43,410
do their bidding.

1411
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,650
Yeah.

1412
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,570
That's what they become.

1413
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,930
They become these fucking dogs,

1414
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:50,430
these monsters that are just at the
very tip of this hill that we're chasing

1415
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:50,810
them up.

1416
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,210
Yeah.

1417
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,880
What sticks pointy sticks and

1418
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,860
realize if they're gone.

1419
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,000
It's like all that criminal corrupt
bullshit that we think of when we think of

1420
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:01,410
the worst aspects of government a fall.

1421
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:02,250
That shit goes away.

1422
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,121
So you know what?

1423
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:04,950
We're left with Dj Doug Pounds.

1424
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,850
Okay.

1425
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,661
Just cool,

1426
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:11,661
smart people that make rational choices
and aren't going to give into greed.

1427
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,111
Holy Shit.

1428
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:13,831
And here's the other thing,

1429
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:14,430
man,

1430
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,900
it shouldn't be a full time job,

1431
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:16,500
right?

1432
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,770
You should be something
that you contribute to every
now and again when people

1433
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:20,790
try to do our best,

1434
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,250
like we all take turns
running the government,

1435
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,750
like everybody gets a week,

1436
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,441
you know,

1437
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,670
and it's a fucking very,

1438
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,533
you know,

1439
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:27,960
it's a,

1440
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,490
it's a very prestigious job.

1441
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,490
Everybody gets very excited about the
possibility of representing our country

1442
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:33,170
for a week.

1443
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:33,390
Right.

1444
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,440
And you go there and you do your
best to do the will of the people.

1445
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:39,030
You make rational choices.

1446
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,000
You all tried to talk it through and
everybody knows it's very possible.

1447
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,140
One day you're going to get called,

1448
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:43,710
man,

1449
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,543
you're going to get a call.

1450
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,220
I'm going to ask you to be the president
for a week and you've got to step in

1451
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,260
cause you're a fucking
American and that's what we do.

1452
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:49,481
Yeah.

1453
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:49,801
And I go,

1454
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:53,910
Duncan Trussell you are a president for
the week and you'll go on TV and you go,

1455
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,200
I am so not prepared.

1456
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:55,680
But I,

1457
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,430
I promise as an American I am going
to do my best to do what's right,

1458
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:04,420
to do what's ethical and to do it benefits
the greater humanity of the world.

1459
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,490
Do it day after tomorrow
because I procrastinate.

1460
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,830
My trainer was coming over,

1461
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,940
I have to beat off.

1462
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,590
What if that was like what happened?

1463
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:18,300
Like everybody got to be the president,

1464
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,340
isn't it

1465
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,173
for a week?

1466
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,960
Everybody has.

1467
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,280
It'd be amazing if you're a duty.

1468
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:21,850
It's a,

1469
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,760
it's what you're talking
about is a beautiful idea and,

1470
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:26,410
and I think that it's possible.

1471
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,670
I think that's another crazy thing about
this time around is it's possible when

1472
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:31,504
people hear that,

1473
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,830
you know and obviously you're,

1474
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,080
you're,

1475
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,913
you're,

1476
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,900
we're not talking about that literally
but with ideas like be when people hear

1477
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:38,351
what you're saying.

1478
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:43,180
Any kind of optimism right now in
general in the world is met with a pretty

1479
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:44,380
severe eye roll.

1480
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:45,670
I come on day,

1481
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:49,660
I really think you can clear out those
walls tore talking about a fucking

1482
00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:51,610
government that is bought and sold.

1483
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,280
It is controlled by the
prison industrial complex.

1484
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:55,750
It is controlled by big Pharma.

1485
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,360
It is controlled by the
military industrial complex.

1486
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,470
These people,

1487
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,760
their pockets are loaded with so much
fucking doe and they have been so

1488
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:08,761
conditioned by a game that dehumanizes
people to the point where they no longer

1489
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:14,830
see giant swaths of humans
and other countries as people.

1490
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,130
The it is important to realize that
these wolves that you're talking about,

1491
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,470
we're talking about a
different species here,

1492
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:21,070
friend.

1493
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,070
If you look at like what's going on in
the UK with these organized pedophile

1494
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:26,441
rings,

1495
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:30,880
it seems to consist of people
and the level of government,

1496
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,380
I can't remember who it was.

1497
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:33,790
One of the investigators said,

1498
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,030
it seems to be built into
the system in some way.

1499
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,231
Yeah,

1500
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:38,950
look it up.

1501
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,690
It's scary fucking shit man.

1502
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,040
That's insane.

1503
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:42,903
So when you look ahead,

1504
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,570
avoided that stuff cause it bumped me
out when I saw those those stores with,

1505
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,470
that's what they're saying.

1506
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,363
That's what they're saying.

1507
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,450
But here's the difference.

1508
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:49,991
Here's the difference.

1509
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:52,090
And that's horrifying to
imagine cause you know this,

1510
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:52,720
we hear it.

1511
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,960
It's so funny to hear it with the
UK government and people are like,

1512
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,070
what?

1513
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,100
But now you hear about a priest
doing it and people are like,

1514
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:00,371
yeah,

1515
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,360
that just happens.

1516
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,830
It's like you're looking at,

1517
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:03,851
you know,

1518
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:08,770
an organized system that has
as part of the destructive,

1519
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,160
a result that it reaps on the planet.

1520
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,750
Also psychically wounding children
in the worst way possible.

1521
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,250
So this is a,

1522
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,363
uh,

1523
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,523
I think that,

1524
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:25,830
that the reason that that isn't as grim
and horrible as it sounds is because the

1525
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:29,620
difference today as
opposed to 30 years ago,

1526
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,840
is that we get to say it
in front of however many
zillions of people listened to

1527
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:35,770
your podcast.

1528
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:36,400
And it,

1529
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,120
that info instantly travels
around the world 30 years ago.

1530
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,220
If you think that if there truly is an
organized group of pedophiles that have

1531
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,270
as their membership,

1532
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,970
high ranking government officials,

1533
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,470
not just probably in the UK,

1534
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,000
but in the United States too,

1535
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,790
if that really does exist,

1536
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,170
it didn't just start today or
last week or two years ago.

1537
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,060
That's been around for a long,

1538
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,680
long time.

1539
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,860
So the difference between back then and
now is that shit is getting everywhere.

1540
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:11,890
It's everyone on planet earth
is aware of this investigation.

1541
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,200
You can't get that genie
back in the bottle.

1542
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,970
Even though I think a
lot of people are trying,

1543
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,150
they're saying that the
whistle blowers for this,

1544
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:19,760
uh,

1545
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,100
are not going to have immunity.

1546
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,620
That's one thing that the government,

1547
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:22,870
instead,

1548
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,470
if you're a whistle blower for
this weird ring of pedophiles,

1549
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,670
no immunity,

1550
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,110
you're going to jail too.

1551
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,700
So they're like squelching.

1552
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,970
There seems to be an element that
is trying to push this shit down,

1553
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,511
of course,

1554
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:38,140
because if it's true that there that
some speculate that even members of the

1555
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,570
royal family could be
involved in this shit.

1556
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,130
So yeah,

1557
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:42,580
look it up.

1558
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:42,971
I usually,

1559
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:47,560
it's a deep dark David Lynch
level twin peaks shit coaster,

1560
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,220
but the,

1561
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,053
the,

1562
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,253
the,

1563
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,660
that might be one of the
best descriptions ever.

1564
00:49:59,110 --> 00:49:59,943
Say that again.

1565
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,070
A deep dark David Lynch level shit coaster

1566
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,880
twin peaks style worms deep in the ground.

1567
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,720
This is,

1568
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,051
but,

1569
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:15,100
but the positive thing is they're getting
exposed in a way that they could never

1570
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:16,330
been exposed before.

1571
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,560
So yeah,

1572
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,351
I think that the,

1573
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:21,520
that any kind of darkness
that is existing on the world,

1574
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:25,900
it's very good to use the
example of Wolf's being
driven up a hill with torches.

1575
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,891
It's just in this case,

1576
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,010
the or Edwards,

1577
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,480
the torch bearers,

1578
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,770
or Edward Snowden,

1579
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,000
Julian's massage,

1580
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:37,120
all the whistle blowers who have the
fucking guts to reveal and eliminate this

1581
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,563
probably,

1582
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,873
um,

1583
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,490
pretty built in old system of humans
that have victimized children,

1584
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,070
victimized children and
the world and the planet,

1585
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:53,780
and it seemed to take a lot of pleasure
from victimizing other human beings.

1586
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:54,231
It's there.

1587
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:55,580
It might be a secret religion.

1588
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:56,090
Who knows?

1589
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:01,090
Do you think that the reason why this
stuff exists more in the older countries,

1590
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,170
the reason why this,

1591
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:07,700
this system might be in place
in somewhere like the UK.

1592
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,000
I mean,

1593
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,920
this is horrible reality.

1594
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,390
Like that Jimmy Seville guy,

1595
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:16,391
that guy that was the
presenter on television that
it turned out was some crazy

1596
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,271
pedophile.

1597
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:17,750
Yes.

1598
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,880
These guys that are in this country,

1599
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:20,090
I mean,

1600
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,160
England is an amazing country,

1601
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:22,490
right?

1602
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,660
London's fantastic.

1603
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:26,630
One of the weirdest things about London
when you're walking around as you see

1604
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:30,260
the age of things and it makes you as an
American feel like God might countries

1605
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:33,950
a baby like this country has been
around for a thousand fucking years,

1606
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:38,780
but does it not have the echoes of those
old people just like we talked about

1607
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:38,991
before,

1608
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,070
the echoes of savages?

1609
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,360
Does it not have that?

1610
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:41,661
Sure.

1611
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,120
And don't you think that the
best case of escaping that,

1612
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:44,521
it's almost like,

1613
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:48,080
like literally escaping the
physical space of that contract.

1614
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:51,290
So getting it and the people that are
trapped there and might take them longer

1615
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:53,200
to shake that shit out yet.

1616
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:53,980
Well,

1617
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,470
especially like if you look at the
epigenetic research coming out,

1618
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:58,304
the idea that,

1619
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,160
uh,

1620
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,350
phobias get passed down genetically
from one generation to the next,

1621
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,690
then you're also kind of looking at,

1622
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,030
it's a really curious
thing and this is pure.

1623
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:09,190
We will hit be ramble.

1624
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:10,280
So I get it.

1625
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:12,390
Everybody out there is
going to tweet something.

1626
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,400
How wrong this is.

1627
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:14,090
But,

1628
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:14,923
uh,

1629
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,620
that if like I was thinking like these
countries where a war's been going on

1630
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:19,454
forever,

1631
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,960
if epigenetics,

1632
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:24,500
if what they're thinking about epigenetics
is correct and that phobias get

1633
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:29,501
passed down through somehow chromosomally
then if there is a place where war has

1634
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:32,030
been happening long enough,

1635
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,070
then there is the potential that encoded
genetically into the people who have

1636
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:42,071
been living there is like all the phobias
and fears and terror that comes from

1637
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:47,050
living in a war zone for hundreds and
hundreds of years that like it's the,

1638
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:50,960
it's inside of them somehow it's
like made its way inside of them.

1639
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,370
It's a really scary thing to think it and,

1640
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,400
and that the problem that
we are experiencing is not
just our own inner turmoil

1641
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:03,260
that comes from all the
laws and catastrophe that is
inevitable and human life.

1642
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,620
But there were also dealing with all
the turmoil and catastrophe of our

1643
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:08,350
ancestors and that,

1644
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:08,871
you know,

1645
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:09,740
the United States,

1646
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,550
it's been,

1647
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,001
you know,

1648
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:13,130
our wars are happening elsewhere.

1649
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:18,370
That's one of the spoiled Brat aspects
of our warlike country is that we don't

1650
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:24,070
experience what it's like to hear the
hum of a drone and the suddenly the

1651
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:29,370
incineration of a landmark
that we have grown up around.

1652
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,990
We haven't experienced that.

1653
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,630
That's why the motto of
the weather underground,

1654
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,970
that terrorist organization
that was trying to homeland
terror organization that

1655
00:53:36,971 --> 00:53:39,240
was trying to protest Vietnam,

1656
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,760
their motto was bringing
the war back home.

1657
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:46,470
They wanted to blow up buildings in the
United States to demonstrate to people

1658
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,350
this is what it looks
like when bombs go off.

1659
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,270
We're doing that there.

1660
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,640
So if this epigenetic shit is correct,

1661
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,740
a lot of people living
in the United States,

1662
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,190
they're not going to have
the same kind of phobias,

1663
00:53:59,500 --> 00:53:59,820
uh,

1664
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,000
in their chromosomes that people living
in countries that have been exposed to

1665
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:05,010
war for hundreds of years would have.

1666
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,061
Yeah.

1667
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:07,200
There's no getting around it,

1668
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:07,680
right?

1669
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,960
No getting you look at like bs,

1670
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,120
like you look at a B that makes a beehive.

1671
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,150
Um,

1672
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,850
we were talking about bees earlier today.

1673
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,680
Like what would it be
like to be a be right?

1674
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,190
It might be some beautiful things.

1675
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,043
Yeah.

1676
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,140
Where it was supposed to be getting
the information to build that hive.

1677
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:23,690
Why are they all doing
the exact same thing?

1678
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,030
Right.

1679
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,480
How do they figure out that they're
supposed to go get the nectar and then

1680
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:30,310
they're covered with Paula and then
these fly over to the other flower.

1681
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,880
Is that encoded in them somehow?

1682
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,560
It must be if they can't communicate.

1683
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,910
I think it's all doing it.

1684
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,571
I think it's a,

1685
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:37,340
it's a,

1686
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:37,680
there,

1687
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,150
it's a,

1688
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,280
it's a frequency that they're
structured is tuning into.

1689
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:46,281
Like if you saw a remote control car at
tiny little remote control car zipping

1690
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:50,910
around on the table and it was like
avoiding obstacles and going to exactly

1691
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,590
where it would go if you were like,

1692
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:56,490
let me look inside the car to find the
way that it's able to figure all this

1693
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:57,324
shit out,

1694
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,760
you would be missing what
was really happening,

1695
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,990
which is that the car is tuning
in to a frequency that is,

1696
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,891
you know,

1697
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,170
the directing it.

1698
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,640
So you place it and I mean again,

1699
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,170
no,

1700
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,660
it's a totally fascinating concept
and it might totally be right.

1701
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:13,381
I mean,

1702
00:55:13,381 --> 00:55:18,210
think about how many different bugs
exhibit the exact same behavior.

1703
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,490
All of them all over the world.

1704
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:21,720
They have their own little groups.

1705
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:22,840
They exhibit the same behavior.

1706
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:23,730
They know how to build these,

1707
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,780
these leaf cutter ants.

1708
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:27,630
They build these gigantic compounds,

1709
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,670
dig holes.

1710
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,180
They create little areas
were like leaves for meant,

1711
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:32,731
you know,

1712
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:33,171
like it's,

1713
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:37,590
it's a bizarre complicated thing
they figured out how to all do,

1714
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,940
like it's not so out of the question
and think that they're getting that from

1715
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:44,610
the sky or they're getting that from some,

1716
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,760
some frequency.

1717
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,510
They have a channel they
can tune it in and we can't.

1718
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,021
Well,

1719
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,141
it's,

1720
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:50,070
and you get into like,

1721
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,461
you know,

1722
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,560
two dimensional stuff where it's like,

1723
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,394
okay,

1724
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:58,490
if it's epigenetics and if information
is being trance for not just in writing,

1725
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,140
uh,

1726
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,690
and not just in the teachings
of the parents to the kids,

1727
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:08,691
but chromosomally then that means that
every living entity is the very tip of a

1728
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:15,081
temporal appendage that stretches
all the way back to the big bag.

1729
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,370
So it's not just an ant,

1730
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:22,371
it's the end of the genetic line of that
particular aunt family tree that goes

1731
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:24,250
all the way back through time

1732
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,070
and it's transferring
information via a chromosome.

1733
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:31,570
So this is a creature you're
looking at the very tip of it.

1734
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,550
It's like what I'm Douglas Adams said
about mice and hitchhiker's guide to the

1735
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:37,384
galaxy.

1736
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,100
That mice were actually the very tip of
the appendages of a super intelligent

1737
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:44,200
creature that likes to study scientists.

1738
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,560
Ah,

1739
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,230
that's beautiful.

1740
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,161
It's so cool,

1741
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:53,670
man.

1742
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:53,851
Uh,

1743
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:54,121
but,

1744
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:54,960
but in the same way,

1745
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,830
it's like every single one of us is just,

1746
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,770
there's the tip of this temporal appendage
or opting into this fucking dimension

1747
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:02,300
in that,

1748
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:02,730
uh,

1749
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,740
connected to us theoretically,

1750
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:05,574
by the way,

1751
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,290
don't ever fucking show of,

1752
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,040
uh,

1753
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,750
some of my stone or one internet article
on epigenetics or you won't suddenly

1754
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:16,020
become a doctor of epigenetics
and won't shut up about it.

1755
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,250
So I'm sorry.

1756
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,780
But if that stuff is true,

1757
00:57:18,781 --> 00:57:23,781
man and memories are being transferred
chromosomally then that means that we are

1758
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:24,981
the very end of it.

1759
00:57:24,981 --> 00:57:28,950
Telephone wire that goes back through
all our ancestors all the way down to

1760
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,720
proto hominids and before that to
whatever fucking shit we were in the

1761
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:34,171
beginning.

1762
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:37,170
And that information is
like zinging up through,

1763
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,090
through time and is a determining possibly
determining what we like and what we

1764
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:42,750
don't like.

1765
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,800
It totally makes sense.

1766
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,890
I mean this is the most
recent civilization in modern,

1767
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:47,280
uh,

1768
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,200
modern world is America.

1769
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,270
And this is the most recent version of it.

1770
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,163
California.

1771
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,330
This is like everybody got,

1772
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,490
they land on the east coast
and they went fuck this.

1773
00:57:56,491 --> 00:57:57,580
And they kept going right?

1774
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,120
And the really crazy fuckers
made it all the way over to here.

1775
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,710
This is like the latest version.

1776
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,210
If you go back the furthest,

1777
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:04,500
go back the furthest,

1778
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,760
you're an Africa,

1779
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:06,370
right?

1780
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,290
You're in Iraq,

1781
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:07,770
you know,

1782
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,011
that's,

1783
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:08,910
that's the beat that,

1784
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:11,110
so my assertion was always at that,

1785
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,630
those are the townies of the world,

1786
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:12,901
right?

1787
00:58:12,901 --> 00:58:13,501
That's what that is.

1788
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:13,621
Like,

1789
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:14,370
this is where the,

1790
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,480
this is where the people started.

1791
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,920
Everybody was left.

1792
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,190
It's still believing shit that was
written down on tablets because they never

1793
00:58:20,191 --> 00:58:22,020
got a fresh influx of DNA.

1794
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:22,440
Right.

1795
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,540
There's still dealing with
the old operating system.

1796
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,580
They have windows 95
and the machines right.

1797
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,940
And they never got out right.

1798
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,591
They never got out.

1799
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,424
They're still there.

1800
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:30,220
And,

1801
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,110
and not only that,

1802
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:32,220
they're dealing with loss.

1803
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,580
They're dealing with
massive loss left and right.

1804
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,780
A mass more than a million
people dead over there.

1805
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:37,721
So the,

1806
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:38,321
the there,

1807
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:38,730
there,

1808
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,460
the need for revenge is through the roof.

1809
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,780
The madness is through the roof.

1810
00:58:42,781 --> 00:58:46,170
The loss of loved ones is all the
chaos that comes along with that,

1811
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:46,830
through the roof,

1812
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,620
which almost reinforces
the old ways of thinking.

1813
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:50,431
That's it,

1814
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:50,760
man.

1815
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,240
Less,

1816
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,040
it's less than new DNA.

1817
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:56,070
It's rekindling the most primal of DMA,

1818
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:58,950
the animal that wants to kill
the other attacking animal.

1819
00:58:59,090 --> 00:58:59,451
Yeah.

1820
00:58:59,451 --> 00:58:59,680
That,

1821
00:58:59,680 --> 00:58:59,931
yeah,

1822
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:01,210
you got to let me listen menu.

1823
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,130
If you live in a country where
wars happening all the time,

1824
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,720
you got a lot to work with,

1825
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:05,931
man.

1826
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:10,460
There's a lot of shit that you've seen
in a lot of fear that you've seen,

1827
00:59:10,461 --> 00:59:11,211
that you've witnessed in.

1828
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:14,660
And this is like this interview I
did with Doblin was really cool.

1829
00:59:14,661 --> 00:59:17,690
He's talking about one of the folks that,

1830
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:18,524
uh,

1831
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,210
helps out at maps is a,

1832
00:59:20,211 --> 00:59:20,651
is like a,

1833
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,820
one of the descendants who,

1834
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,200
and I can't remember his name now,

1835
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,161
but who,

1836
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:25,994
uh,

1837
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,440
who is recognized that in these
war torn parts of the world,

1838
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,023
uh,

1839
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,420
if you really want to heal the,

1840
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,280
the psychic damage has
been done to these people.

1841
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:41,540
It's going to require Mtma assisted
psychotherapy or some kind of psychotropic

1842
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:43,670
substance where you could get in there.

1843
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:45,590
And I help deal with these,

1844
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,290
these traumatic memories
that people have over there.

1845
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,770
That has to be a part of reconstruction,

1846
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:52,370
uh,

1847
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,840
is not just going and build,

1848
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,050
not just blowing a place up and
then flying in and being like,

1849
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:57,381
all right,

1850
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:58,670
we'll help you build it back up guys,

1851
00:59:58,671 --> 00:59:58,940
aren't we?

1852
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,721
We're fine now.

1853
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,051
Right?

1854
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:00,890
Everybody's cool.

1855
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:01,983
It's,

1856
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,051
hey,

1857
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:04,520
we made you a water treatment plant.

1858
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,680
We did is we did.

1859
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,101
No,

1860
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:08,690
it's like you gotta get in there and like,

1861
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,460
and not just there everywhere.

1862
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:10,851
Like,

1863
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:12,470
we gotta get in there
and we have to start,

1864
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:13,101
you know,

1865
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:17,180
doing a lot of inner work
with ourselves so that we can,

1866
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:18,463
um,

1867
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,780
so that we're not going
to fuck up once this,

1868
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,250
once we hit a certain mph when it
comes to technological acceleration,

1869
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:25,821
you know,

1870
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:26,121
that's,

1871
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:27,290
that's the thing.

1872
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,400
There's two jobs,

1873
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,440
work on the south and then,

1874
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:30,920
uh,

1875
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,960
do as much as you can
to help in the world.

1876
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,210
Do you want to be the force of kindness?

1877
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:39,170
You want to be that wave of
positivity that you're talking about?

1878
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,200
Because the hope is that the
more that there there is,

1879
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:45,640
the more it'll trickle
trickle a end to end to that.

1880
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,061
As I'm saying this,

1881
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:47,400
I'm like,

1882
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,020
oh no,

1883
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:48,281
no,

1884
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:48,471
no.

1885
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:49,410
Allowing people up,

1886
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:49,701
man,

1887
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:50,330
they're there.

1888
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,440
How do you fix that?

1889
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:51,681
You know,

1890
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,600
I just write what's the solution?

1891
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,070
There's one part of me that's like,

1892
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,780
I know that if I know that the combination
of these technologies along with a

1893
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:04,370
shift towards the positive
or the concerted effort by
a certain number of people

1894
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:09,170
to turn their attention to the
potentiality of our species can create an

1895
01:01:09,171 --> 01:01:10,640
incredible change in the planet.

1896
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:14,390
And then there's another part
of me that's like no friend,

1897
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,850
no nuclear proliferation,

1898
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,560
biological weapons.

1899
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:19,550
Uh,

1900
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,230
there's no fucking way to like,

1901
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:24,140
there's no way to uh,

1902
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,063
to stop it.

1903
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,033
Is that true though?

1904
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,500
Because if we look at life right now,

1905
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,970
no nuclear war,

1906
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,410
no biological war,

1907
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,551
why would we seem to,

1908
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:35,640
that's inevitable if we're smart enough
to avoid that right now with all the

1909
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:40,641
conflicts over mineral rights and oil
in the fucking ad Arctic region and the

1910
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:45,240
Soviet Union's plant and flags and new
spots near Greenland or wherever the fuck

1911
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:46,230
they are yet,

1912
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,520
we're just talking about
blowing each other up.

1913
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:48,031
Like,

1914
01:01:48,031 --> 01:01:49,110
why do we have to think that Dutch?

1915
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,870
It's inevitable if we're
all on the same trend.

1916
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:57,290
If human beings are not tolerating this
shit like overall that we did before,

1917
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,880
people were more aware of like
what we're talking about before.

1918
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,061
Yeah.

1919
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:02,940
That's one of the reason why it's so
horrific when you see acts of violence

1920
01:02:02,941 --> 01:02:03,540
today.

1921
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,580
When you see someone
blowing up a mosque today,

1922
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:08,160
when you see someone gunning
down people at a synagogue,

1923
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:10,710
any crazy religious motivated things,

1924
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,830
especially in us and people that you don't
even know whether they were the wrong

1925
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:14,241
religion,

1926
01:02:14,241 --> 01:02:15,020
so he gunned him down.

1927
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,200
Alex,

1928
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,610
it's the worst representation
of the human mindset,

1929
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:17,821
right?

1930
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:18,654
Yes.

1931
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:23,770
When when you're seeing that
and you're seeing the potential,

1932
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,520
you're seeing this potential for oneness,

1933
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:28,230
almost like a DMT trip.

1934
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,480
You're almost seeing like a living,

1935
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,340
breathing DM t trip,

1936
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:32,690
right?

1937
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,550
That is a rounded is gut ease,

1938
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,990
organic,

1939
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,910
frustrated souls trapped
in terrible scenarios,

1940
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:42,070
right?

1941
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,800
Without any of it being there,

1942
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,230
doing born in the Congo,

1943
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,990
born in Iraq during the war,

1944
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,870
born in Afghanistan,

1945
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,450
all,

1946
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,440
all the above,

1947
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,540
born in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

1948
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:58,740
All this stuff is going on at the same
time and all this chaos and fucking

1949
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,910
outdated,

1950
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:04,650
crazy monkey having a murder
rampage take Bonnie Shit.

1951
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,071
Yeah.

1952
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:06,690
And all that's going on right.

1953
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:08,890
When the electronic DMT trip is happening.

1954
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,540
Yes.

1955
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,360
All together at once
and threaten each other.

1956
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:12,901
So in,

1957
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:13,260
in,

1958
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,130
in certain ways.

1959
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,641
That's right.

1960
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:15,230
Well,

1961
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,063
awesome.

1962
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:16,541
Yeah.

1963
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:17,530
Well that's what it seems like,

1964
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:17,741
man.

1965
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:18,190
And then you,

1966
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:18,580
I mean,

1967
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:21,310
you get into some really
tricky terrain here because,

1968
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:22,920
uh,

1969
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,150
you,

1970
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:23,983
you gotta like,

1971
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:25,590
well,

1972
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,310
isn't this race and organism?

1973
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:27,731
Well,

1974
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:28,031
yeah,

1975
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:28,391
I think,

1976
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:28,931
I think it is.

1977
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:30,580
I think we're looking at a super organism.

1978
01:03:30,581 --> 01:03:31,480
All of humanity.

1979
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:31,780
Yeah.

1980
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,180
Super Organism has some
form of schizophrenia,

1981
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,320
super organism.

1982
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:40,321
It's like a tree and every single branch
of the tree is a human being in that

1983
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,351
tree.

1984
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:43,120
The is all the,

1985
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:44,830
some of the branches are
fighting with each other.

1986
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,390
It doesn't know what
the tree yet and it's,

1987
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,010
or another way to put it might be the
tree is fighting over what kind of fruit

1988
01:03:51,011 --> 01:03:51,770
to bear.

1989
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:52,581
And the tree is fine.

1990
01:03:52,581 --> 01:03:57,581
Like part of the tree wants to bear
a super like radical Islamic fruit.

1991
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:03,731
You know what I mean?

1992
01:04:03,731 --> 01:04:04,750
It wants there to be,

1993
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:06,580
you want people to get
up early in the morning,

1994
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,380
pray,

1995
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,470
pray once a women to wear is
and it wants there to be that.

1996
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:14,050
Now that's an extreme
version and I don't know how,

1997
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,990
how enormous that population is.

1998
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:17,820
Uh,

1999
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:18,371
I actually,

2000
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:18,970
you know,

2001
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,511
when I did,

2002
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:20,100
uh,

2003
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:20,770
a lot,

2004
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,970
one of my live podcast man
where I answered there,

2005
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:25,240
there's a Muslim in the
audience in this guy was like,

2006
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:26,074
yeah,

2007
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,620
and I had him come on stage and
talk about isis and he's like,

2008
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:30,340
we fucking hate,

2009
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,270
we hate them.

2010
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:33,070
Like that's not what it is at all.

2011
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:34,900
That's just the most extreme,

2012
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,000
ridiculous version of it.

2013
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:38,103
Um,

2014
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,580
and he was as sweet as could be,

2015
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:39,851
man.

2016
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:44,851
This guy was like the opposite of any
thing that you would consider to be even

2017
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:48,190
mildly fucked up or dangerous.

2018
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,310
He like saying this like beautiful prayer.

2019
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:55,070
It didn't feel like he was
secretly anything at all.

2020
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,080
It was a beautiful thing,

2021
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:56,291
man.

2022
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,124
It was really cool.

2023
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:57,700
Of course.

2024
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,690
So of course,

2025
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,583
so,

2026
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,091
but you know,

2027
01:05:01,091 --> 01:05:02,350
there's a lot of people who say,

2028
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:02,720
no,

2029
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:02,891
no,

2030
01:05:02,891 --> 01:05:02,991
no,

2031
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:03,130
no,

2032
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:03,730
no.

2033
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,320
The whole fucking thing's fucked.

2034
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,870
That if we're really gonna
like make this a better planet,

2035
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,450
then more and more and
more and more and more,

2036
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,510
you have to abandon these
antiquated symbol structures.

2037
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,720
We have to turn our eyes away from our
addiction to the past and like focus on

2038
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:20,980
the now.

2039
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,701
I don't agree with that.

2040
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:24,160
I think there's a lot of beauty to
be harvested and all that stuff,

2041
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,720
but still man,

2042
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:30,721
it's like it's a complicated
problem because what do we
do when three d printers

2043
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,650
meet DNA?

2044
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,160
What do we do when you can
three d print and Ebola virus?

2045
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:40,540
What do you do when you can,

2046
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,690
when that technology is
accessible to anyone who wants it?

2047
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:46,000
Because that's a problem is that we're,

2048
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:50,320
everybody's going to have this level of
power and you really do just need two

2049
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,040
people.

2050
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,960
You want to like fuck up guns.

2051
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,760
You want to fuck up guns for everybody.

2052
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:55,594
What do you do?

2053
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,591
You start shooting.

2054
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,330
People start shooting people.

2055
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,210
You want to fuck up and
inevitably what happens?

2056
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:01,870
What happens?

2057
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,703
Someone will do it.

2058
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,130
If you,

2059
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,881
there's guns,

2060
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:08,470
inevitably some fucking asshole who
is either going to hallucinate a bird

2061
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:11,110
talking to him or just have a fucking,

2062
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:12,050
uh,

2063
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,990
a chip on his shoulder about his boss
is going to go into a fucking place and

2064
01:06:16,991 --> 01:06:18,130
shoot up a bunch of people.

2065
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,780
And that ruins it for all of us.

2066
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:21,670
Now if you own a gun,

2067
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:24,700
some people will think you're a
fucking asshole for no reason.

2068
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,240
Just cause they don't understand that
it's fun to blow up things at a firing

2069
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:29,074
range.

2070
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,173
It's just fun.

2071
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,180
Nothing,

2072
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:32,861
nothing else.

2073
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:37,750
I just like watching skeet explode
from time to time I have theirs.

2074
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,261
That's it.

2075
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:40,870
It doesn't indicate some
darkness in my heart.

2076
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,220
It's fun to be outside.

2077
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,750
It's fun to watch shit blow up.

2078
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,430
It's fun to hear big booms.

2079
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,210
It's fun.

2080
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,020
So,

2081
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:47,590
uh,

2082
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,423
anyway,

2083
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,420
that's beside the point.

2084
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:49,751
The point is,

2085
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:50,560
that's a gun,

2086
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,393
right?

2087
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,930
The fucking guns that are coming,

2088
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:53,764
man,

2089
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,720
this shit that's coming down the pipes,

2090
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:59,230
the fact that you're going to be able
to have some wet works bio lab and your

2091
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:02,050
basement and harvest
some kind of weird shit.

2092
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:02,800
Uh,

2093
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,011
the,

2094
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:03,430
the,

2095
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:07,030
the weaponry that's going to be accessible
to people in the future is going to

2096
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,310
be way more powerful
than what we have now.

2097
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,050
And that's the scary part.

2098
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:15,910
Don't you think that's kind of built
into the system that in order for us to

2099
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:18,700
progress to this next level,

2100
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:23,140
the only thing that's holding us back
is that there's going to be a certain

2101
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,580
amount of people that are left behind.

2102
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:30,060
So the idea is the system is almost
ensuring by providing almost everyone with

2103
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:34,150
the same technological
capabilities to destroy the world,

2104
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,610
that we all have to get it together.

2105
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:40,870
Like you have to force people to
take care of all the fucked up spots.

2106
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:41,681
Literally.

2107
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:46,560
We have to literally embrace the idea
of us as a super organism and they any

2108
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,770
spot we see that sick,

2109
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,720
we have to heal it immediately.

2110
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,880
We can't look at some
cancerous thing and go,

2111
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,150
I'm not even gonna get that checked out.

2112
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,060
What's cancerous?

2113
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:59,350
The worst aspects of skid row skid rows,

2114
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:01,090
cancerous skid row is a,

2115
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,070
if you haven't been and you go to la,

2116
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,070
really should go through
downtown and see skid row.

2117
01:08:06,071 --> 01:08:07,000
Cause it's shocking.

2118
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:07,250
It's,

2119
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,621
it's,

2120
01:08:07,621 --> 01:08:08,350
it's,

2121
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,350
it's one of the most densely
packed representations of
people with mental health

2122
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:15,801
people,

2123
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:16,634
despondent,

2124
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,451
drug addicts,

2125
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:20,870
all these all jammed into this area
and they're all living out of boxes.

2126
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:21,890
And it's like,

2127
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,390
it's one of those things
where you just go,

2128
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:23,631
okay,

2129
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,100
what is anyone going to do?

2130
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:25,520
Anything?

2131
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,540
Like what are they going
to do is just come up.

2132
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,840
Yeah.

2133
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,730
Put up places to feed them.

2134
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:29,481
You know,

2135
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,860
is there a way to fix this?

2136
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,390
Is there a way to help these people?

2137
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:33,110
Is there a way,

2138
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,240
is there a way to get the medication?

2139
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,470
Do you did get them counseling?

2140
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:36,801
Is it,

2141
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:37,640
is there a way,

2142
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,080
like what can we do like,

2143
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,720
or is everybody just gonna ignore that
you have a cancer in the middle of your

2144
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:42,110
city?

2145
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:42,500
Yeah.

2146
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,790
I'll give you drive by that.

2147
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:45,080
That's a spot that's sick.

2148
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,561
Like that.

2149
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:46,280
Spot Sec.

2150
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:46,670
That's,

2151
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,510
if that's us,

2152
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:51,650
if that's not us in our best versions
of Duncan Trussell go on hiking.

2153
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:51,921
Yeah.

2154
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,000
We're going to Laurel Canyon.

2155
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,590
[inaudible] hey everybody.

2156
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,390
I'm drinking water.

2157
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:55,640
Yeah,

2158
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,480
I got a new trainer.

2159
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:56,811
Yeah.

2160
01:08:56,811 --> 01:08:57,644
There's that.

2161
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,970
And then there's this,

2162
01:08:58,990 --> 01:08:59,300
yeah.

2163
01:08:59,300 --> 01:08:59,691
You know,

2164
01:08:59,691 --> 01:09:00,410
and you see,

2165
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,161
you see skid row,

2166
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:01,341
you go,

2167
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:01,590
okay,

2168
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,140
what the fuck is going on there?

2169
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,240
What are you gonna do with
those pieces of Congo?

2170
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,200
What are you to do with India?

2171
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,240
What are you gonna do with all parts?

2172
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:08,841
Me Mean India,

2173
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:09,770
which part of India?

2174
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:10,723
Most of it.

2175
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:15,470
How about there's three times as many
people and one third as much room as

2176
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:15,980
America.

2177
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,640
Right.

2178
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,870
And they're going to keep going to,

2179
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:18,111
right.

2180
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:19,670
They're going to keep your
having sex with people.

2181
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,171
Yeah.

2182
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:20,331
And,

2183
01:09:20,331 --> 01:09:20,481
and,

2184
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:20,730
and,

2185
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:20,940
and,

2186
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:21,450
and uh,

2187
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:21,671
yeah.

2188
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,200
So that's a problem,

2189
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:23,591
man.

2190
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:24,071
It's crazy.

2191
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:24,311
So,

2192
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:25,071
but in see the,

2193
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:26,890
but that's where you get in
a real interesting terrain,

2194
01:09:26,891 --> 01:09:28,750
which is that okay,

2195
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:30,340
because the thing that
you're talking about,

2196
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,270
I'm pretty sure it's going in
and cleaning up the cancer.

2197
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,860
It's almost totally socialism.

2198
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,040
It might make Alex Jones butthole suck
so far inside of him that it would cause

2199
01:09:41,831 --> 01:09:44,760
the singularity gyros and he would,

2200
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:45,560
he would be very upset.

2201
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,780
Clean up that cancer.

2202
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:47,591
What are you going to do?

2203
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:48,730
Put Them in camps?

2204
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,080
What are you going to me to amps.

2205
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:50,440
Yeah.

2206
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,170
You're going to put them in
Phoenix cause it is that that

2207
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:53,871
though it's the,

2208
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:54,790
it's kind of the opposite.

2209
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,830
It's kind of figure out
some way to give them,

2210
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:57,760
Huh?

2211
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,280
Will mean we will look at it
like if you look at skid row,

2212
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:01,400
how much money would it cost?

2213
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:02,080
X Cleanup,

2214
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:02,741
skid row,

2215
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:06,040
how much money would it
cost to almost a sign.

2216
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:11,130
Like a swat team of specialists that can
like re introduced homeless people back

2217
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:16,390
into society and the in a
comfortable way and get them jobs,

2218
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:18,720
train them and like have money but to,

2219
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,500
hold on a sec.

2220
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:19,720
Sorry.

2221
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,280
How much money would that cost?

2222
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:24,220
Would there be even what the
Iraq war costs and a day,

2223
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:24,670
right?

2224
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:25,870
I mean you could fax true.

2225
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,860
You could fix jai hidden
spots on earth with,

2226
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,180
with money and everybody's like,

2227
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:31,481
ah,

2228
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:33,220
you can't just throw money at the problem.

2229
01:10:33,221 --> 01:10:37,870
It's our tax dollars as I'm talking
about the exact same tax dollars.

2230
01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:38,850
Redistribute it.

2231
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,640
That's cool.

2232
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,091
If you,

2233
01:10:40,091 --> 01:10:42,760
if you really don't like the
government taking your tax dollars,

2234
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:44,110
I completely understand.

2235
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,400
I completely understand.

2236
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,810
But guess what?

2237
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,480
You don't have any choice now
as to what they do with it.

2238
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:49,751
Right.

2239
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:53,860
Wouldn't you be happy if they took the
same amount of money and they just put

2240
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,540
more of it towards that?

2241
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,880
More of it towards fixing up all these
fucked up neighborhoods where everybody's

2242
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,720
born and to severe poverty.

2243
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,350
That's cool.

2244
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,610
That's a fucking cancer spot.

2245
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:06,310
And that you could call me socialists
cause I kind of am with that,

2246
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,181
with that kind of stuff.

2247
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:08,014
I kind of am.

2248
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,990
I am with people that are
trapped in bad circumstances.

2249
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,310
I am with babies,

2250
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,100
I am with that grow up

2251
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,030
in horrible environments.

2252
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,170
I'm totally socialist.

2253
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:16,471
Yeah.

2254
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:19,170
I don't think those kids should have to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

2255
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,160
And I think there should be a way that
we prevent these people that live in the

2256
01:11:23,161 --> 01:11:26,000
worst spots in the world from,

2257
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,900
from continuing with that
horrible like state of living,

2258
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:34,130
that horrible quality
of life where you're,

2259
01:11:34,131 --> 01:11:35,310
you're getting sick all the time.

2260
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:36,450
Like Justin Wren,

2261
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,190
who's a friend of mine from the UFC,

2262
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:40,890
he used to fight in the UFC and now he's
been working with the Congos and the

2263
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:41,724
pygmies.

2264
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:46,350
And these pygmies in the Congo is like
the sweetest people and he helps them.

2265
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:47,310
He gets a medication.

2266
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,290
We helped fund wells there.

2267
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,191
Yeah.

2268
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:50,471
And we,

2269
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:50,780
we,

2270
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,660
we get people that donate money on bitcoin
and I matched the money and then we

2271
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:55,740
bought wells.

2272
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:56,761
It's dude,

2273
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:57,300
it's,

2274
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,320
this guy's the coolest.

2275
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:58,760
But these,

2276
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,030
the,

2277
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:01,770
these people didn't ask
to be born there man.

2278
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,410
And they have these bulging stomachs
because these little kids have all these

2279
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:07,010
parasites inside of them
and they have bad water.

2280
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,820
It's one of the reasons why
so many of them gets sick.

2281
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:10,950
Is this case going over there man?

2282
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:14,490
And this guy is helping these
people in a very tangible,

2283
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:15,690
very real sense.

2284
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,180
He's right there in that.

2285
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,571
And when,

2286
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,080
when you,

2287
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,270
when you see that someone
out there is like that,

2288
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,970
it's like it gives everybody
a like a little more hope.

2289
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:24,080
Yeah.

2290
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,530
That's what we have to do this,

2291
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:28,740
what we have to do is make sure that
all those spots where there's people,

2292
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:29,970
all the spots for these people,

2293
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,050
they get brought up,

2294
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,880
took a normal way of living,

2295
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:38,160
like a normal way of living
Madison Education Shan food.

2296
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,120
We can do that,

2297
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,660
we can do that and all we have to do is
just put different people in charge of

2298
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,420
getting all the money right,

2299
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,470
but just prop the other people
pro instead of war profiting.

2300
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,740
You just have like hope profiting.

2301
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,663
Yeah.

2302
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:59,310
All these different organizations that
people are like drawn to and they want

2303
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:01,560
like a guy like Justin wren drawn to,

2304
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:02,590
he has to go over there.

2305
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,590
He spent six months over there,

2306
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,700
he gets malaria,

2307
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:06,930
he got fucking malaria.

2308
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:07,950
Fuck yeah.

2309
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,950
Fuck these people are out there,

2310
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:11,610
man.

2311
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,420
They're out there.

2312
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,130
And then the idea is like instead of does,

2313
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,890
instead of like recognizing
those people are out there,

2314
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:20,040
recognize that they're out there
and then become one of them.

2315
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,510
That's the next step.

2316
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,470
But come one,

2317
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,110
you know it's like this Guy Cornfield,

2318
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,200
a Jack Kornfield.

2319
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,940
This Buddhist teacher
tells me about Buddhism.

2320
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:27,780
He says,

2321
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,730
we don't want you to be a Buddhist.

2322
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,500
We want you to be the Buddha.

2323
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,850
Don't be a fucking,

2324
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:33,421
don't you?

2325
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:35,730
You want to become that
you and anyone can.

2326
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:36,481
That's the other thing,

2327
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:36,691
man.

2328
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:41,691
You can instantaneously right now by
calling the number on your screen.

2329
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,270
You can instantaneously right now,

2330
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,550
no doubt about it within the next hour,

2331
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,800
regardless of your economic situation,

2332
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,840
give some percentage of what you have
in a way that's probably barely going to

2333
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:59,700
affect your life to some cause that in
mass would create what you're talking

2334
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:00,180
about.

2335
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:01,230
The healing beam,

2336
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,460
the transformation,

2337
01:14:02,461 --> 01:14:03,294
this shift,

2338
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:04,650
it could easily be dealt with.

2339
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:06,270
You could do it right this second.

2340
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,300
It's could and it could
also be done with taxes.

2341
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:10,500
It could be,

2342
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,040
it can be needs to be both.

2343
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,300
It's not just taxes.

2344
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:15,100
Cause again that goes
back to the government,

2345
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:15,611
the government,

2346
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:16,031
government,

2347
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:16,421
government,

2348
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:16,751
government,

2349
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:17,584
government,

2350
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,870
the government at least we
could look at the books,

2351
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:23,620
private citizens to start open up
companies and go over there and do charity

2352
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:23,831
work.

2353
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:25,930
And we ended up pocketing
a lot of the money.

2354
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,420
Like it's still hits us
back at the core level.

2355
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:33,400
We got to figure out a way to eliminate
greed and figure out a way to elevate

2356
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,250
people up to like a normal health status.

2357
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:36,730
That's right.

2358
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:38,020
Like modern living.

2359
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:38,651
That's right.

2360
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:39,490
If they want to,

2361
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,570
but what if they don't want to,

2362
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:41,290
if they don't want,

2363
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:43,540
I mean there's a lot of people
that live in the jungle of Brazil.

2364
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:44,081
They probably was like,

2365
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:44,701
fuck this man,

2366
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:45,534
I like it right here.

2367
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:50,260
Or like the guy I pass next to the seven
11 yesterday I saw shoot up with black

2368
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:51,094
tar heroin.

2369
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:51,851
He,

2370
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:52,690
I don't know if that,

2371
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,260
if like,

2372
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,670
I don't think that's getting to like,

2373
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:59,890
I can't imagine what conversation and
like some nice air condition dome I could

2374
01:15:00,731 --> 01:15:02,080
have with that guy that,

2375
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:02,561
but you know what,

2376
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:03,221
that's not fair.

2377
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,870
Who knows what if you
gave him my beginning,

2378
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:05,620
what if there was,

2379
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,960
or what if we developed like an actual,

2380
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:08,501
you know,

2381
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:11,680
super cure for addiction and you
could like snap him out of it.

2382
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:12,341
Well listen man,

2383
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,670
I had a guy on my podcast today
and he was really interesting.

2384
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,620
Dr. Andrew Hill and uh,

2385
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,060
he's the guy who created this stuff.

2386
01:15:19,061 --> 01:15:20,350
It's like a nootropic blend.

2387
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:21,790
It's called true brain,

2388
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,280
like three different ones
and tribes if you want.

2389
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,001
That was good.

2390
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:27,550
I had the one with
caffeine earlier anyway.

2391
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,121
Very,

2392
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:28,990
very cool.

2393
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:32,200
And interesting guy and he was
talking about this very thing.

2394
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,263
Well you know,

2395
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:37,240
and you know this very thing is uh,

2396
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,081
this is uh,

2397
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:42,030
a lot you know about
singularity university Kurzwell
and d I think his name is

2398
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,990
Dia Mondelez.

2399
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,320
You wrote this book abundance.

2400
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:44,601
I,

2401
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:46,000
I can never get his name right,

2402
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,220
but so basically the idea is,

2403
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,433
um,

2404
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,750
what are the world's big problems?

2405
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:56,920
How do we fix them using the
law of accelerating returns?

2406
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:00,400
And it's really the thing you're
doing right now is the most,

2407
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:00,800
is,

2408
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,520
is almost as important
as fixing the problem.

2409
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,360
It's like what Tim Ferris told me when
he was interviewing like super wealthy

2410
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:10,324
people.

2411
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,550
He said they asked better questions.

2412
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:13,860
It's the question,

2413
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:18,430
it's like fearlessly asking
the big fucking questions.

2414
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:23,431
Like what do we do to heal skid row?

2415
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:29,670
How do you fund wha how do you get fresh
water to all the parts of the world

2416
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:32,910
that are currently drinking diseased?

2417
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:33,280
What,

2418
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,113
how do you do it?

2419
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,360
And how do we use this new technology,

2420
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:38,700
this new emergent technologies?

2421
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:40,360
Is it to get that to people?

2422
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,410
Well this was this guy.

2423
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:46,060
Specialty is one of his specialties is
using neurofeedback to cure people of

2424
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:51,061
Adhd to cure people of all sorts of
issues by figuring out a way to give them,

2425
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,360
to empower them,

2426
01:16:52,361 --> 01:16:55,540
how to manipulate their brainwaves
all done through technology,

2427
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,900
all legit aboveboard all
know woo stuff at all.

2428
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,150
All fascinating biofeedback stuff.

2429
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:02,740
Super Open minded guy.

2430
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:07,900
We like really fascinated about the
concept of fixing certain addictions and

2431
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:10,610
weird behaviors by monitoring

2432
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,580
neurofeedback and figuring
out how the mind works.

2433
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,170
Really interesting stuff dude.

2434
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:15,621
Really,

2435
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:17,000
really cool that some,

2436
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,410
some of this stuff that they've created,

2437
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:22,730
they've been able to eliminate seizures
and people who are epileptic by giving

2438
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:25,210
them the ability to manipulate
the way their their mind more.

2439
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:25,940
Wow.

2440
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,830
Like changing the gears in your mind,

2441
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:31,430
teaching you how to manipulate
it and move it and train it.

2442
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:31,910
Wow.

2443
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:32,331
Really,

2444
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:34,190
really mainly fascinating stuff.

2445
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,890
So when you know that guys like that are
out there that are doing this kind of

2446
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:37,630
shit,

2447
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,470
it's like Ibogaine is one,

2448
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:40,850
but he was talking
about a bunch of things.

2449
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:42,260
He was telling a bunch of things.

2450
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:44,930
Even sometimes shock
therapy when he says is,

2451
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:49,340
it's what seems to need to to happen is
it needs to be a complete reset of the

2452
01:17:49,341 --> 01:17:49,970
system.

2453
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,140
Then he said a bunch of medical terms,

2454
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:51,974
I don't remember.

2455
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,860
I'll have to go back over and listened
to exactly how he described it.

2456
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:55,694
It happens,

2457
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:59,480
but he said that these transformative
experiences are like very,

2458
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:01,670
very important for
resetting and reshaping.

2459
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:02,720
Essentially what we've been saying,

2460
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:04,550
it's like you operate on momentum.

2461
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:06,070
You just like got the momentum,

2462
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,400
the world clipping it,

2463
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:08,180
your heels,

2464
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,980
and it's almost like you
can't get out of your own way.

2465
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:10,701
All right,

2466
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:15,230
so this guy is talking about it
from a neuroscientist standpoint,

2467
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:19,400
so it's really interesting to get like a
guy who really knows what the fuck he's

2468
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:20,234
talking about.

2469
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,970
Kind of affirm what your
suspicions might be,

2470
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:24,650
some sort of a vague way,

2471
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:25,540
you know?

2472
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:25,691
I mean,

2473
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:30,400
your suspicions being like the reset
that comes from a super duper psychedelic

2474
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:30,930
trip.

2475
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:31,290
Very.

2476
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:31,880
Yeah,

2477
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,200
yeah.

2478
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:32,681
Oh yeah.

2479
01:18:32,681 --> 01:18:33,190
Right.

2480
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:33,551
Yeah,

2481
01:18:33,551 --> 01:18:34,010
man.

2482
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:34,331
You know,

2483
01:18:34,331 --> 01:18:35,950
like you need to step outside yourself.

2484
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,813
Yes.

2485
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,271
And,

2486
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:37,991
or you know,

2487
01:18:37,991 --> 01:18:41,190
the reset that comes when you have some
tragic event happened in your life or

2488
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:42,024
their resets.

2489
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:42,940
Yeah.

2490
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,361
Yeah.

2491
01:18:43,361 --> 01:18:44,890
It's always that moment where you're like,

2492
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:45,700
oh shit.

2493
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,540
Cause it's like it's,

2494
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,300
it's kind of like a bit,

2495
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,110
a really intense game of make believe
that's what society is like everybody's

2496
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:56,170
playing these roles in it and everyone's
really committed to the game and the

2497
01:18:56,171 --> 01:18:58,090
most intense way possible.

2498
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,510
And you get so committed to the
particular role that you're playing,

2499
01:19:01,511 --> 01:19:06,511
whatever it may be that you forget that
that's just one roll out of an infinite

2500
01:19:07,031 --> 01:19:10,250
number of possible ways
that you could be a,

2501
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:10,931
you could be,

2502
01:19:10,931 --> 01:19:11,291
you could,

2503
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:16,291
you don't have to be stuck in your
current system of predilections or to like

2504
01:19:18,071 --> 01:19:20,410
really like break it down.

2505
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:24,130
You're people are either
attracted to certain people,

2506
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:25,600
tend to be attracted to,

2507
01:19:25,601 --> 01:19:27,100
things are repelled by things,

2508
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:27,820
right?

2509
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:29,590
And the things that you're attracted to,

2510
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,100
some people aren't attracted to and
the things that you're repelled by,

2511
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,170
some people are not repelled by.

2512
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:36,220
They're attracted to.

2513
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:37,780
So the question is,

2514
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:42,930
how much can you change your levels
of attraction or desire and aversion?

2515
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,220
How,

2516
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,830
how trapped are you in that,

2517
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,131
uh,

2518
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:48,341
in,

2519
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:52,420
in whatever that your particular modality
is a I can you get out of that and you

2520
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:53,560
sure as fuck can.

2521
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,260
And these,

2522
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,570
the psychedelic trips,

2523
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,690
um,

2524
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:56,880
are,

2525
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,940
are definitely one way.

2526
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,650
Meditation is another
way to figure it out.

2527
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:00,891
Yeah.

2528
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:01,571
It seems like we,

2529
01:20:01,571 --> 01:20:01,851
we,

2530
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:02,930
whoever we are,

2531
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,711
whoever we are,

2532
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:06,190
where we are operating on some sort of a,

2533
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:09,540
an operating system and that
operating system is your personality.

2534
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:10,600
It's like it,

2535
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:15,600
it allows you to go through this life
with some sort of a weird semblance of how

2536
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:18,300
things are going to be because
you know how they just were.

2537
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:18,870
Yes.

2538
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:23,190
And it can be empowering or it
can be extremely disempowering,

2539
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:26,430
especially if you don't like
certain aspects of your past.

2540
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:27,151
You know,

2541
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:27,451
if they,

2542
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:27,721
you,

2543
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:27,991
you,

2544
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:30,510
you were frustrated
with them defining you.

2545
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:30,990
Yeah.

2546
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:35,490
And that's where things like psychedelic
experiences can really come in handy

2547
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,710
because they jolt you out of this or
the death of a loved one could have a

2548
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,640
similar effect,

2549
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:42,803
you know,

2550
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,590
obviously much more tragic and
much more difficult to get out of.

2551
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,371
But if you know,

2552
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:49,710
you talk to someone and
they lost a loved one,

2553
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:54,090
regular trivial bullshit is really a
knock on affect them the same way it's

2554
01:20:54,091 --> 01:20:56,250
going to affect someone
is living a bored life.

2555
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,110
Who wants to gossip about shit.

2556
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:59,100
If someone loses their mom,

2557
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:00,750
they don't want to gossip
about knots and man,

2558
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:01,561
you know,

2559
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:03,750
it's like there's just
this reality of things.

2560
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:04,680
It's totally different.

2561
01:21:04,681 --> 01:21:04,820
Well,

2562
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:07,110
people can go and when they'd go,

2563
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,531
you,

2564
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:08,520
you're going to miss them,

2565
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,300
you're going to miss your loved ones and
then we're all going to get out of this

2566
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,080
one time or another while I,

2567
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,530
while everybody else is going.

2568
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:16,821
Well,

2569
01:21:16,821 --> 01:21:19,250
that's where it becomes
simultaneously tragic.

2570
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:20,840
And then on top of it,

2571
01:21:20,841 --> 01:21:24,080
there's that DMT thing that
you get taught where it's like,

2572
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,220
right,

2573
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:25,760
yes,

2574
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,850
your mom died gas wise,

2575
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:33,290
you're going to die too and everyone's
going to die and everyone's already died

2576
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,120
and there's so many people
have died before you.

2577
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:36,620
And then somewhere in there,

2578
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:38,061
cause you know,

2579
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:38,361
man,

2580
01:21:38,361 --> 01:21:39,780
that thing you're talking about there,

2581
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,630
the waking up that happens from
it death that involves grief.

2582
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:45,823
Uh,

2583
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:51,350
that's like the very beginning part of
the thing that you're given when a parent

2584
01:21:51,351 --> 01:21:51,920
dies,

2585
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,910
but then the next thing you're given
is the after that is pretty fucking

2586
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:56,744
incredible.

2587
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,200
Which is that you realize that they're in,

2588
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,800
they don't seem to be gone that day.

2589
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:02,661
You know what I mean?

2590
01:22:02,661 --> 01:22:05,780
That even though that their
physical body isn't here anymore,

2591
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:10,010
you really do feel them in
certain ways inside of you.

2592
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,000
Not in a delusional way.

2593
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:11,420
Like,

2594
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:11,661
oh,

2595
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:14,090
the spirit of my mom
is following me around.

2596
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:18,260
But it feels like you can feel your
mom and your heart all the time.

2597
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:22,790
Always there all the love that they
give you all this thing behind all the

2598
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:23,271
bullshit.

2599
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,730
Everyone's got bullshit
cause we're human beings.

2600
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:26,990
But the thing behind all that,

2601
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:29,300
that's what sticks around inside of you.

2602
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:30,230
And it's really,

2603
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:31,430
it's really beautiful.

2604
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,200
And I think,

2605
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:33,411
you know,

2606
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:34,940
whenever I take a DMT trip,

2607
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,230
because my tendency is for my attention
to go to the grief for my attention to

2608
01:22:39,231 --> 01:22:40,064
go to the,

2609
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,631
Oh God,

2610
01:22:41,631 --> 01:22:43,940
I don't want to die and I don't
want to lose anybody else.

2611
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:44,180
And I,

2612
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:46,130
I can't believe how many
people are going to die.

2613
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:48,320
And everyone's going to that
my attention habitually,

2614
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:49,154
it goes to there.

2615
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,380
But whenever you like smoked DMT,

2616
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,160
one thing that I've
noticed when I've done it,

2617
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:56,450
uh,

2618
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:58,390
outside of whatever the
statute of limitations,

2619
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,200
what ways is that,

2620
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,333
uh,

2621
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:06,400
you're immediately given this view of
one of most beautiful things you've ever

2622
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:10,750
seen in your life and there
appears most beautiful,

2623
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,381
the most,

2624
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:13,100
perhaps the most beautiful.

2625
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:13,660
Then there's sin.

2626
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:14,070
There's,

2627
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,130
there's sentience to it.

2628
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:15,880
It's alive.

2629
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,360
However,

2630
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,230
for whatever reason,

2631
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,050
it does not feel like
it's coming from you.

2632
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,910
It feels like it's outside
of the things alive.

2633
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,790
And you're like somebody,

2634
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,300
you're like somebody,

2635
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:30,610
you just had a hard day at work and just
walked into the ultimate surprise party

2636
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,380
where everyone's like,

2637
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:33,543
hi.

2638
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:34,990
And it's like,

2639
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:35,950
Oh God,

2640
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:36,671
it's beautiful,

2641
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:38,680
but I'm so fucking tired.

2642
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:42,550
I'm so sad and I feel like shit.

2643
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,110
And it's like the,

2644
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:44,830
uh,

2645
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,410
the message it gives you is right.

2646
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,753
See,

2647
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,200
you are clinging to this
identity of the sad,

2648
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,250
tired,

2649
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,170
unhappy person.

2650
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,380
But if you just let go for a second,

2651
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,320
you're going to have a really
good time at this party.

2652
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,060
You know,

2653
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:10,780
and that's the identity reset that I
think that they're talking about and it's

2654
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:12,610
so possible cause that's a game.

2655
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,990
The game of the hunched over businessman
with a briefcase and the weary face in

2656
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:18,850
the big size and the depressed tweets.

2657
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:19,210
Ooh.

2658
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:20,420
Oh Man.

2659
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,520
Just fucking world.

2660
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,321
That's a role.

2661
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:24,580
You are playing a part.

2662
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,480
You are like,

2663
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:30,310
you are like fucking Daniel Day Lewis
and you are committing fully to the part

2664
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:33,100
of the Moby depressed businessman,

2665
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:33,940
businessman.

2666
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:37,480
That's a part and you're winning awards
for it left and right in the form of all

2667
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:41,020
the people who secretly hate
you or all the people who are,

2668
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:41,320
who,

2669
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,030
who you make feel sad or all the,

2670
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:43,900
all the,

2671
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,480
you're having a real effect in the world.

2672
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:46,211
Well when you,

2673
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,620
when you try to sell someone something,

2674
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:49,660
you were in a suit and tie or
aren't you doing a ritual dance?

2675
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,633
Yes you are.

2676
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,421
Yes,

2677
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:53,400
you are a hypnotic dance.

2678
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:57,150
You're throwing up those fucking tail
feathers and sucking in the gullible.

2679
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:57,481
Yeah,

2680
01:24:57,481 --> 01:24:58,090
it's a dance.

2681
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:58,923
Let me tell you something,

2682
01:24:58,930 --> 01:24:59,890
I can make you a deal.

2683
01:24:59,891 --> 01:25:02,550
And then when these 2014 F-150,

2684
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,110
they changed the structure to aluminum.

2685
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:04,631
But I'll tell you what,

2686
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:05,590
I don't like it buddy.

2687
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,120
I like the old steel.

2688
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,610
I like the good old steel and I'm
wearing a real good deal on that.

2689
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,050
Joe.

2690
01:25:10,050 --> 01:25:11,040
You have a way of talking to him.

2691
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,280
Ah,

2692
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,113
ah.

2693
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:14,340
That's what salesmanship is.

2694
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,240
It's really good acting.

2695
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:15,751
Yeah.

2696
01:25:15,751 --> 01:25:17,310
And that's what being a pickup artist is.

2697
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:18,144
And that's what,

2698
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:18,481
yeah,

2699
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:19,231
it's the same idea.

2700
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:20,790
It's pickup crates.

2701
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,710
It's trickery or it's like,

2702
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:23,670
yeah,

2703
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,090
yeah,

2704
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:24,331
but,

2705
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:26,790
but a cool thing to realize is,

2706
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:29,490
and it's a fun thing to realize and
it's a blast when ms thing to realize,

2707
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,110
and it's just,

2708
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:30,570
for me,

2709
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,361
it's blasphemy.

2710
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:36,090
It's because you want to believe that
you're a victim and you want to believe,

2711
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:38,010
nice to feel like you
can blame other people.

2712
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:38,943
It's the best.

2713
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:43,170
It's the best to come home and split the
fucking briefcase down and take the PSI

2714
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,850
and sink down into your couch.

2715
01:25:44,851 --> 01:25:48,300
Now you've got an excuse to slurp back
that fucking whiskey that you've been

2716
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:50,250
trying to pour all over your,

2717
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:50,820
uh,

2718
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,720
happiness.

2719
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,560
Um,

2720
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,930
it's frozen under the fucking ice,

2721
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:55,600
uh,

2722
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,880
of the role that you're playing.

2723
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,631
It's fun.

2724
01:25:57,631 --> 01:25:58,620
It's fun to be like that,

2725
01:25:58,621 --> 01:26:00,150
but the psychedelic,

2726
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:00,481
the,

2727
01:26:00,481 --> 01:26:00,721
the,

2728
01:26:00,721 --> 01:26:01,111
the,

2729
01:26:01,111 --> 01:26:01,670
the psychic,

2730
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:02,520
the mushroom,

2731
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:05,330
the psychedelic reminds you.

2732
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,070
It won't let you get away with that.

2733
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:07,611
It's like,

2734
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:07,841
no,

2735
01:26:07,841 --> 01:26:07,971
no,

2736
01:26:07,971 --> 01:26:08,780
no.

2737
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,220
I'm sorry friend,

2738
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,200
but you're in the garden of Eden.

2739
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:15,650
It's beautiful here and perfect.

2740
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:18,140
And I'll get ready for
some really bad news.

2741
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:20,000
You're perfect.

2742
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,290
We love you.

2743
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,580
You're wonderful.

2744
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:23,750
You're forgiven.

2745
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,610
You haven't done anything bad.

2746
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:29,090
Everything that you think
is bad is something that you
did when you're in a kind

2747
01:26:29,091 --> 01:26:29,780
of dream,

2748
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:30,770
you were sleepwalking.

2749
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,150
We don't care.

2750
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,860
We love you no matter what.

2751
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,890
And whenever you're ready to accept
that we're right here for you.

2752
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,080
And that sucks because
if you're really hooked,

2753
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:43,970
I'm being Elliot Smith and you're really
getting off on that fucking dark hell

2754
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:44,804
that you're in.

2755
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,610
It's a little annoying to realize like,

2756
01:26:46,611 --> 01:26:47,240
Yo,

2757
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,040
you're fucking given away the thing.

2758
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,950
Mandel let people know
I'm committed to this.

2759
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,570
It's like they say Daniel Day Lewis,

2760
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,460
he had to get carried around during my
left foot by the crew cause he committed

2761
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:01,490
so much to the role of being a paraplegic.

2762
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:04,220
Did they had to carry him
from one place to the next?

2763
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,810
Cause the way he acts,

2764
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,850
it's incredibly disruptive to him.

2765
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:12,560
If people talk to him is Daniel Day Lewis
that he wants to be the role that he's

2766
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,100
in.

2767
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,180
So in the same way,

2768
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,450
when DMT comes along and is like,

2769
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,373
um,

2770
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,390
Mr. Lewis,

2771
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,200
no,

2772
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,790
that is not who I am.

2773
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:28,150
I am a depressed man who is middle
aged and is terrified and is trying to

2774
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:29,150
control people.

2775
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:31,070
You aren't acting the
way I want them to act.

2776
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,320
I am not fucking Mr Trussell,

2777
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:34,370
whoever you just called me.

2778
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,170
I'm not a being of love.

2779
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:37,610
I am a being of darkness.

2780
01:27:37,611 --> 01:27:37,971
And it's like,

2781
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:38,804
no,

2782
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:39,771
you're just playing.

2783
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:40,581
Make believe,

2784
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:41,300
man.

2785
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,920
You don't have to keep playing that.

2786
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,120
You have shiny shoes.

2787
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,370
You have shiny slippery shoes on.

2788
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:47,180
Yeah.

2789
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,440
Why do you have a tie clip on?

2790
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:49,670
Yeah.

2791
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,670
Why do you have that?

2792
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,010
Why are you wearing a fucking,

2793
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,020
why are you wearing a noose?

2794
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:55,700
The geometric patterns on it.

2795
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:57,230
Oh,

2796
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:57,621
you know,

2797
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:59,420
that's one of the things that
those secret service suits,

2798
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,441
like any guy,

2799
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:01,910
what has to wear a tie on the job.

2800
01:28:01,911 --> 01:28:03,020
They all have clip ons.

2801
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:04,250
You can't choke those guys.

2802
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:05,243
All right,

2803
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,140
that makes sense.

2804
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,583
Yeah.

2805
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:07,790
But,

2806
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:08,200
but you know,

2807
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,130
if you're a business is
not being a businessman,

2808
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,470
is any better or worse than any
other role that you're playing?

2809
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:15,320
It's what's bad is when you forget
that you're playing the role.

2810
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:16,391
Well,

2811
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:16,840
the,

2812
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:21,340
the realization that you've come
to wall on a psychedelic trip,

2813
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:26,470
that'll have to be almost the
realization that everybody comes to when

2814
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:31,471
technology and an information like
they meet head on when we hit,

2815
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:33,161
when we hit the puff,

2816
01:28:33,161 --> 01:28:34,120
the fork in the road,

2817
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,290
the tip of the spear.

2818
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:40,590
If you get to the part where both sides
are moving in like an unstoppable pace,

2819
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:45,130
there's gotta be a way,

2820
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,830
has got gotta be a way to
bring everybody into the party.

2821
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:48,940
Yeah.

2822
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:49,600
And if you don't,

2823
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,433
if,

2824
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,180
if more people don't know about it,

2825
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,120
if more people don't experience this,

2826
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:59,190
this pause in history where people across
the entire planet are waking up and

2827
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:01,950
saying,

2828
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:02,310
wait

2829
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:02,550
a minute,

2830
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,271
this thing,

2831
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:07,110
this whole thing might not be what we
think is this whole thing might not be

2832
01:29:07,111 --> 01:29:07,944
what we think it is.

2833
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:13,460
This crazy desire that we have is finite
life forms to build a nest egg and put

2834
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:17,400
together some fucking structure somewhere
that you're going to stuff with shit

2835
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,430
and doing so in doing self feed.

2836
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:21,840
This weird machine,

2837
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:23,300
you're throwing money into it.

2838
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:26,370
It's chewing the money up and
it's about to fucking give birth.

2839
01:29:26,371 --> 01:29:30,830
It's got its robot legs in the air and
it's robot pussies quiver and it's indeed

2840
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:33,390
just just throwing money
into it's robot tits.

2841
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:33,751
Yeah,

2842
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:35,460
and it's just chewing that robe up,

2843
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:37,920
money up and it's ready to give birth.

2844
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:40,680
It's ready to give
birth as some sentience,

2845
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:45,310
super intelligent thing that will
then give birth to other sentience and

2846
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:50,040
superintelligent things figured out a way
to completely rewire the entire earth.

2847
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:53,970
All of our waste will then
be converted into a positive.

2848
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:54,420
Yeah.

2849
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:55,860
Everything that's negative,

2850
01:29:55,861 --> 01:30:00,370
all pollution will be engineered out
of commission and into some sort of,

2851
01:30:00,371 --> 01:30:00,840
uh,

2852
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:01,051
uh,

2853
01:30:01,051 --> 01:30:06,051
oxygen cleaning machine that it fuels
itself on pollution to the point where it

2854
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:08,430
gets to a certain point
and when it runs out,

2855
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:09,720
just spits flowers.

2856
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:10,891
When it runs out,

2857
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:14,310
it takes whatever remnants and
shoots flowers into the sky.

2858
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:15,144
And as where you walk,

2859
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,000
you're gonna have to rose petals falling
from the street because the sky's going

2860
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:19,110
to be perfectly clear.

2861
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,741
Sure.

2862
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:20,290
North.

2863
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:20,920
Yeah.

2864
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:21,671
Why not?

2865
01:30:21,671 --> 01:30:22,180
Why not?

2866
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:22,900
Why not?

2867
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,211
It's,

2868
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:23,470
it's,

2869
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:23,801
I mean,

2870
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:28,660
if you look at what's going on now
compared to what was going on a thousand

2871
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:28,840
years ago,

2872
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,860
this is a wonderful,

2873
01:30:29,861 --> 01:30:30,760
wonderful time.

2874
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:31,780
And also in this book,

2875
01:30:31,781 --> 01:30:32,614
abundance,

2876
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:33,070
uh,

2877
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:35,180
highly recommend it for anybody using the,

2878
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:36,970
not feeling like you're in hell.

2879
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,660
Who wrote it?

2880
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,890
I can't pronounce his name.

2881
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:39,550
Can you look it up?

2882
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,150
I'll look it up.

2883
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:44,440
[inaudible] as he's one of the
cofounders of Singularity University,

2884
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:45,280
uh,

2885
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,600
let me look it up real quick.

2886
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:48,990
And he's one of the guys that
thinks it's all going to be rosy.

2887
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:49,391
Well,

2888
01:30:49,391 --> 01:30:49,541
I,

2889
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,890
it's not like they think everything's,

2890
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,360
they recognize that.

2891
01:30:52,361 --> 01:30:53,194
See this,

2892
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:57,340
the thing about the Peter Diamandis,

2893
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:58,000
yeah.

2894
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,231
The,

2895
01:30:58,231 --> 01:31:01,690
the thing about this law of accelerating
returns is it doesn't just apply to

2896
01:31:01,691 --> 01:31:02,321
great things.

2897
01:31:02,321 --> 01:31:03,970
It also applies to chaos.

2898
01:31:03,971 --> 01:31:04,804
So,

2899
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:05,381
so,

2900
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:06,910
so these guys,

2901
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:07,540
these new,

2902
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,140
there was a hook.

2903
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:10,480
These guys understand that the collapse,

2904
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,640
the collapse is going to have the same
kind of velocity is the whatever this

2905
01:31:15,641 --> 01:31:16,151
thing is.

2906
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:16,420
So that,

2907
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,860
I don't think they're so naive about it,

2908
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:18,963
they're just,

2909
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:24,900
they've just recognize this what
we're calling up a baby being born.

2910
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,130
They've recognized the things being born.

2911
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:30,100
They can kind of predict
what phase of birth it's in.

2912
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:31,600
And based on that prediction,

2913
01:31:31,601 --> 01:31:34,020
they can predict what's coming out next.

2914
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,290
And based on that prediction,

2915
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:40,500
they can start working right now to
solve some of the big problems out there.

2916
01:31:40,721 --> 01:31:43,030
And one of the things
he says is that in a,

2917
01:31:43,031 --> 01:31:44,410
in a lot of countries,

2918
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:45,131
you know,

2919
01:31:45,131 --> 01:31:45,351
the,

2920
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:50,020
the amount of people that have phones
right now is just insane or the amount it

2921
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:50,854
costs.

2922
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:51,941
One example,

2923
01:31:51,941 --> 01:31:52,774
he gives us this,

2924
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:56,890
the amount it would have
cost to light your house,

2925
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:57,670
uh,

2926
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:01,060
prior to electricity
with like wax candles or,

2927
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,600
or,

2928
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,600
or lanterns is so much more expensive and
the amount of cost to light your house

2929
01:32:06,701 --> 01:32:07,001
now,

2930
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:08,110
it's so much cheaper.

2931
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,770
The technology of lighting
is accessible to almost,

2932
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:17,010
almost all levels of economy
except for the ultra super,

2933
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:18,123
very,

2934
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:18,701
very,

2935
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,271
very,

2936
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:19,901
very poor.

2937
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,070
And there's a lot of them out there.

2938
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:25,120
But having a light bulb in
your shack can still happen.

2939
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,430
And if you have a light
bulb in your shack,

2940
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:32,140
you're doing a hell of a lot better than
a lot of people used to have to have

2941
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:33,820
tallow or I can't remember
what he called it,

2942
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:35,290
like old school wax.

2943
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:37,030
And there's a lot of other examples,

2944
01:32:37,031 --> 01:32:38,170
which is our,

2945
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:38,800
like,

2946
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,950
part of what he's saying is there's,

2947
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:43,030
if there's a few problems
we have to solve right now,

2948
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:44,403
uh,

2949
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,330
one of them is clean water.

2950
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:49,450
We've got to get clean water for the huge,

2951
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:50,880
so many people in the world,

2952
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:51,611
you just don't have it.

2953
01:32:51,611 --> 01:32:53,740
They're drinking poison every day.

2954
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:55,960
So that's something
we've got to figure out.

2955
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:56,471
Uh,

2956
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:58,540
and then there's a few
other biggies like that.

2957
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:03,750
And people I came are of the opinion that
these are very solvable problems based

2958
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,680
on current predictions,

2959
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:06,281
uh,

2960
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,130
involving the direction that
technology technology is going in.

2961
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:12,070
And Kurzweil's fucking
predictions are coming true,

2962
01:33:12,071 --> 01:33:12,640
man.

2963
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,440
There's a lot of people
who roll their eyes at him.

2964
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,050
Wazniak recently came out and said,

2965
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,831
you know,

2966
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:19,390
you used to think that staff was crap,

2967
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,010
but now he's realizing it's true.

2968
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:21,970
You know,

2969
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,020
this is happening.

2970
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,520
It's definitely happening.

2971
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,970
And folks like Dia,

2972
01:33:25,971 --> 01:33:27,020
Mondelez or uh,

2973
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,280
they're trying to steer the boat in the
direction of Utopia because they know

2974
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:31,120
that it can be done.

2975
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,020
And,

2976
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,650
um,

2977
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,290
wow.

2978
01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:33,440
Yeah,

2979
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:33,850
it's cool.

2980
01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:34,061
People,

2981
01:33:34,061 --> 01:33:35,380
I've heard people criticize,

2982
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:36,520
um,

2983
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,610
Kurzweil's idea is saying that he
doesn't really understand human biology.

2984
01:33:39,611 --> 01:33:41,260
It doesn't understand
the biology of the brain.

2985
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,730
But I think his point,

2986
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:45,700
his point is I think is
that it's not gonna matter.

2987
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:48,220
You're not going to have to be able to
replicate everything that the brain does

2988
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:52,000
and how it does it in order to recreate
consciousness that consciousness may be

2989
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,770
independent of that.

2990
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:55,420
You might be able to literally,

2991
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,560
you might be able to transfer it.

2992
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:57,873
I hope so.

2993
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,110
That's going to be so bizarre.

2994
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:00,160
If that really does happen.

2995
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:04,210
If they could figure out a way to download
your consciousness into a computer,

2996
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:05,740
if that really becomes we,

2997
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:07,450
right now it's like it's,

2998
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,340
it's one of those things
that they're working on,

2999
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:10,300
but it seems like a pipe dream,

3000
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:10,661
right?

3001
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:13,140
It doesn't it to you still
what to consciousness,

3002
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:15,310
challenge building
consciousness into a computer.

3003
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:16,210
That seems like a pipe.

3004
01:34:16,211 --> 01:34:17,830
Chase seems like a pipe dream until he,

3005
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:18,131
okay,

3006
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:18,964
so I'm not,

3007
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,140
but I believe it could happen.

3008
01:34:20,141 --> 01:34:20,530
I'm sorry.

3009
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:21,580
I think I blew it to happen.

3010
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:22,971
I think it could too,

3011
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:23,290
man.

3012
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,200
You are an antenna.

3013
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:29,210
You're they Iran antenna consisting of
all the nanoparticles all the way up to

3014
01:34:29,211 --> 01:34:30,200
what you are right now.

3015
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:35,000
That combination of everything inside
the meat body that you're currently,

3016
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:39,260
it's called Joe Rogan is in
some configuration right now.

3017
01:34:39,261 --> 01:34:43,820
It's in some exact configuration
or maybe in the deepest levels.

3018
01:34:43,821 --> 01:34:48,230
It's kind of like harmonic vibrations are
weird resonances that are happening in

3019
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:50,990
the Nano tubules of your
dendrites or something.

3020
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,520
But regardless the place,

3021
01:34:52,521 --> 01:34:54,350
what this thing in front of me right now,

3022
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:59,090
the idea is if I duplicate exactly,

3023
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,313
uh,

3024
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,460
is it going to be you?

3025
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:04,130
Is it going to be exactly
you as you are right now?

3026
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,051
And if it's the,

3027
01:35:05,051 --> 01:35:06,680
if we really are antenna,

3028
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:07,251
then yeah,

3029
01:35:07,251 --> 01:35:11,270
it's going to tune in the thing that
you're tuning in and maybe both of you,

3030
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:13,100
we'll be tuning in at the same time.

3031
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:18,370
Maybe they'll be this weird sense of
being stretched into two different forms.

3032
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:24,161
It may be you will actually
have to extinguish one form
to experience the other

3033
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:24,531
one.

3034
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:25,364
Who the fuck knows?

3035
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,730
That would be the ultimate poll,

3036
01:35:26,731 --> 01:35:27,120
right?

3037
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,980
If they can prove that that form,

3038
01:35:28,981 --> 01:35:32,790
the form of virtual
life is more rewarding,

3039
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:33,511
more powerful,

3040
01:35:33,511 --> 01:35:34,410
more beautiful.

3041
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:34,831
I mean,

3042
01:35:34,831 --> 01:35:36,660
if you went into a virtual life,

3043
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:40,230
if you plugged into the matrix and you
were in the Avatar and you were in love

3044
01:35:40,231 --> 01:35:43,560
with that blue chick and you're just
flying around on dragons together,

3045
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:44,761
we might do it.

3046
01:35:44,761 --> 01:35:45,240
Dude,

3047
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:46,050
you might do it.

3048
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:46,291
I mean,

3049
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:47,700
it might feel amazing.

3050
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,860
It might feel just wonderful,

3051
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:50,630
right?

3052
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:50,871
I mean,

3053
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:51,141
okay,

3054
01:35:51,141 --> 01:35:51,740
so if like,

3055
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:52,220
okay,

3056
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:52,970
let's imagine,

3057
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:54,560
let's imagine that we could do this,

3058
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:59,730
which is just because we've gotten to
the point in history where through some

3059
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:01,310
form of analysis,

3060
01:36:01,311 --> 01:36:05,880
we can scan the human body
and tune consciousness in,

3061
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,670
in virtual land.

3062
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:08,390
Right?

3063
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:09,980
But you're still out here.

3064
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:11,090
It's just temporarily,

3065
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:14,630
your consciousness has been transferred
into avatar world or you're flying

3066
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:15,464
dragons,

3067
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,110
uh,

3068
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:20,030
making love to these
Amazonian blue skin women.

3069
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:25,390
Imagine like an hour and a half of living
in this planet when you knew you had

3070
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:27,380
to come back and you're like,

3071
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,214
you know,

3072
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,770
I don't think I'm going to come back.

3073
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,300
I think I'm just going to stay.

3074
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,540
How do you pay for it?

3075
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:36,270
So you'll just have to get a
job while you're in the cloud.

3076
01:36:36,271 --> 01:36:36,950
Now Do,

3077
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,741
you don't have to get a job.

3078
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:39,180
You've been assimilated in the cloud.

3079
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,760
You for your credit card comes
up in the cloud and they're like,

3080
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,230
[inaudible],

3081
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:43,500
we need needed to go on missions.

3082
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:44,363
And you know what?

3083
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:44,851
Yeah.

3084
01:36:44,851 --> 01:36:47,130
And I realize you have to earn your keep.

3085
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,360
Even in the virtual world,

3086
01:36:48,361 --> 01:36:49,950
they don't tell you
that until you sign up.

3087
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,930
Nobody would sign up if we told them that.

3088
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:56,190
But you have to be our virtual slave to
pay for your virtual account so you can

3089
01:36:56,191 --> 01:37:00,090
keep riding virtual dragons here I want
to show you something really funny and

3090
01:37:00,091 --> 01:37:04,320
then it goes to either web cam or the
computer your body sitting in front of and

3091
01:37:04,321 --> 01:37:08,310
it's just some guys like mouth
fucking year paralyzed meat body.

3092
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:09,000
That's a,

3093
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:09,811
that's the thing too.

3094
01:37:09,811 --> 01:37:10,650
What happens to that?

3095
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:11,630
To our bodies if we,

3096
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:14,000
if our consciousness gets
transferred a very good point.

3097
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,710
Are they going to do with all these
bodies and what if you want to go back,

3098
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,420
can you go back and if you go back,

3099
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:19,170
what have you,

3100
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:20,550
what have you go back and you're like,

3101
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:21,090
uh,

3102
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:22,800
like a person with brain damage.

3103
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:25,230
Like what if you go back
and you don't get it?

3104
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:25,890
It's just,

3105
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:26,790
it doesn't work anymore.

3106
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:27,380
It's all fact,

3107
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:27,750
right?

3108
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:28,500
It's not quite right.

3109
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:33,150
Or what happens when you're out of it
in some other fucking thing pops in and

3110
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,130
pretends to be you.

3111
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,760
Like what about that?

3112
01:37:35,761 --> 01:37:39,690
If we're tuning in stuff because really
what we're talking about here is if you

3113
01:37:39,691 --> 01:37:42,220
do believe we've gone real far match

3114
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:42,480
though.

3115
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,340
If we did transfer you
back and forth and you,

3116
01:37:45,341 --> 01:37:49,390
you went there and you were just a meat
box for a while and then you came back

3117
01:37:49,391 --> 01:37:51,940
like six months later but
you'll like brain damaged.

3118
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:53,950
But you had fantastic stories.

3119
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:54,610
Yeah,

3120
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:55,111
he was just like,

3121
01:37:55,111 --> 01:37:56,100
they lend me back but

3122
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,800
you can't believe what's
on the other side.

3123
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:01,310
There's trackings they stayed,

3124
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,393
they fly.

3125
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,660
The dragons are the people who are big.

3126
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:04,410
They're blue.

3127
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:05,071
That's amazing.

3128
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:05,940
They talked to the tree,

3129
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,110
they link up at the tree,

3130
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:12,111
that tree you seizure and they like try
to decide whether or not you're telling

3131
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:14,340
the truth that we believe he's delusional.

3132
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:15,810
Something happened to Dunkin.

3133
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:20,970
We think he had some sort of a seizure
and when he returned he thought they did

3134
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:23,070
live for seven years in the clouds.

3135
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,690
It's giant blue people.

3136
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:26,100
Obviously that didn't happen.

3137
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:26,431
Okay.

3138
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:28,500
It was only unconscious for
half an hour and you're like,

3139
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:30,930
and you know,

3140
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,980
you know what they don't know.

3141
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:32,850
You know,

3142
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:33,750
you know that you crossed over.

3143
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:34,584
But you run out of money.

3144
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,560
Well that's hilarious.

3145
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,100
Kicked off backpage.

3146
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:42,040
Well that is going to be part of it is
they take everything and then you'll,

3147
01:38:42,110 --> 01:38:43,320
you know like six years.

3148
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,530
What happens after six years?

3149
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:45,753
Right now.

3150
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:46,943
Right now.

3151
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,233
Sign up for it.

3152
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,290
I'm saying is you're going to your car
right now as you're walking to your car.

3153
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:52,901
You're like,

3154
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:53,131
guys,

3155
01:38:53,131 --> 01:38:54,270
if that was a good podcast,

3156
01:38:54,271 --> 01:38:54,481
man,

3157
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:55,081
this is so cool.

3158
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:56,130
I get to be Joe Rogan.

3159
01:38:56,131 --> 01:39:00,810
I was the UFC and a fucking awesome
and all of a sudden a pop up.

3160
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,480
It's like a,

3161
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:05,760
your credits have expired
for the Joe Rogan experience.

3162
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:07,050
If you wish to continue.

3163
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:09,330
Should I do I even fucking pay for this?

3164
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:13,470
Then you just haven't come
to your some sweaty guys.

3165
01:39:13,471 --> 01:39:13,921
Sweaty,

3166
01:39:13,921 --> 01:39:17,520
Ethiopian and on wife
care on that fucking,

3167
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,230
what's that cat?

3168
01:39:19,290 --> 01:39:21,770
That stuff they chew cot caught.

3169
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:22,410
How'd he say it?

3170
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:23,020
I don't know.

3171
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,600
Jc Gusting someone gave me,

3172
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:25,771
yeah,

3173
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:26,970
you're just on a weird end.

3174
01:39:26,971 --> 01:39:28,290
Fetterman illuminating.

3175
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:29,461
But you know,

3176
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:29,731
man,

3177
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:30,630
I think that I,

3178
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,410
that's probably something that we're,

3179
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,050
that's a,

3180
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:37,770
that's a kind of thing we are going to
have to deal with based on this new VR.

3181
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:38,603
I've seen.

3182
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,160
Vr addiction is going to be a very,

3183
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,720
very real thing.

3184
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,130
So you called me,

3185
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:45,000
uh,

3186
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,320
when I was in front of the Improv,

3187
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:47,041
I picked up the phone,

3188
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:49,170
I've told about 10 people in
the store and you're like,

3189
01:39:49,171 --> 01:39:49,471
dude,

3190
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:50,550
just changes everything.

3191
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:50,880
Yeah.

3192
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,170
This is bigger than the Internet.

3193
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:52,591
Yeah.

3194
01:39:52,591 --> 01:39:53,011
And I was like,

3195
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:53,371
what?

3196
01:39:53,371 --> 01:39:57,420
And I was really high and it was about
to go on stage and I was listening to

3197
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:57,871
this whole like,

3198
01:39:57,871 --> 01:39:59,370
what the fuck dude?

3199
01:39:59,371 --> 01:39:59,800
Like what,

3200
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,660
what are you talking about?

3201
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:01,494
Like what happened?

3202
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,570
And you told me about
this video that you saw,

3203
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,030
like explaining the video
of going up to the up piano.

3204
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:06,841
Oh yeah.

3205
01:40:06,841 --> 01:40:07,411
The video.

3206
01:40:07,411 --> 01:40:08,101
This is like,

3207
01:40:08,101 --> 01:40:08,880
you know,

3208
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,110
Shit's gotten like five,

3209
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:12,270
probably 10 times better
since that's by the way,

3210
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:13,350
but this was a,

3211
01:40:14,230 --> 01:40:16,200
it's a demo of um,

3212
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:17,240
uh,

3213
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:22,240
Oculus oculus rift and you put this on
and suddenly you're like in a loft in New

3214
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,380
York and uh,

3215
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:27,420
you're watching this guy,

3216
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:31,020
he's like looking at you like he knows
you and he's smoking a cigarette and he

3217
01:40:31,021 --> 01:40:33,840
starts playing piano and you look around,

3218
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:35,400
you're in a fucking waft man.

3219
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,800
It looks like it's like tracked perfectly.

3220
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:38,540
It was,

3221
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:38,831
it was,

3222
01:40:38,831 --> 01:40:39,480
it looks,

3223
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,080
you're suddenly in this other
place and it feels really intimate.

3224
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:43,531
Like it feels like,

3225
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:44,490
you know the guy,

3226
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,650
this is before I tried VR porn.

3227
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,730
Who by the way,

3228
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:48,823
um,

3229
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,580
which I must have told
you that we stumble.

3230
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:51,990
I must have told you about it.

3231
01:40:51,991 --> 01:40:52,824
You have to pee.

3232
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,340
I don't have to pay because I know,

3233
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:54,731
sorry,

3234
01:40:54,731 --> 01:40:55,560
I'm wriggling around.

3235
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,701
No,

3236
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:56,080
but you,

3237
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:56,810
I know you,

3238
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:57,271
you told me,

3239
01:40:57,271 --> 01:40:58,104
you warned me.

3240
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:00,600
I warned Joe van through two hours.

3241
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:00,970
Like,

3242
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,720
like a champion.

3243
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:02,021
I can't,

3244
01:41:02,021 --> 01:41:05,680
well that's cause I squeezed it out
right before I like before he came on,

3245
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:06,580
squeezed it.

3246
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:08,201
But yeah,

3247
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:10,540
if you tried Vr porn and I'm scared,

3248
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,720
I'm scared to lose my life
in that it's from the porn.

3249
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,670
Lose your life in Vr porn.

3250
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:16,803
Jesus Christ.

3251
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:17,081
Joe,

3252
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:17,920
you're going to try it.

3253
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:22,930
Doodoo Doodoo do to to
to to eat a hash cookie.

3254
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:24,910
Put on the Vr porn goggles.

3255
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:26,980
Slap warm baby oil all over your cock.

3256
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,083
Yeah.

3257
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:28,631
No,

3258
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:31,360
you're not going to slab
warm baby oil sex with you.

3259
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:31,961
Yeah.

3260
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:36,961
You're going to put some kind of sleeve
on your car that is going to perfectly

3261
01:41:37,421 --> 01:41:41,560
replicate exactly what's
happening inside the VR.

3262
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:44,530
Do you think you'd be at one pump
Trump under those circumstances?

3263
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:45,790
The first time

3264
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,200
he does it,

3265
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:48,600
you fucking,

3266
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,050
a day I'd go to Doug and says,

3267
01:41:50,051 --> 01:41:50,471
hey man,

3268
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:51,580
I haven't seen you for a while,

3269
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:53,230
so I thought I'd just check in on you.

3270
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:55,290
You've lost 50 pounds and she,

3271
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:58,330
she sunk it in your eyeball deep
in the back of your head like,

3272
01:41:58,331 --> 01:41:59,164
hey man,

3273
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:00,260
you got any water,

3274
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,980
any liquids,

3275
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:03,814
man,

3276
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,840
you got any PDLA caucus just been rubbed
down to some kind of really like red.

3277
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,750
You can see tendril,

3278
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:13,060
outer layers of the onion
have been peeled away

3279
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:19,450
first time,

3280
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,810
which feel one pump,

3281
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:23,703
chunk

3282
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,991
his picture.

3283
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:29,950
You'll fucking pizza boxes
stacking up mountain dew.

3284
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:32,070
You just fucking hands up in the air.

3285
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:40,480
My Chihuahua chewing
discarded come Napkins.

3286
01:42:40,481 --> 01:42:42,610
Just cause I as an evening days.

3287
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,670
So it's just trying to
get protein from anything.

3288
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:46,570
You Bet.

3289
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:51,570
You faintly hear the bark over the crazy
loud three d porn coming out of the

3290
01:42:53,471 --> 01:42:55,870
fucking Sennheiser headphones.

3291
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,473
You're talking like,

3292
01:42:59,010 --> 01:42:59,741
just ignore it.

3293
01:42:59,741 --> 01:43:00,140
Put it,

3294
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:00,973
goddammit.

3295
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,950
I can't come up with
this fucking dog barking.

3296
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:03,750
Yeah,

3297
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,050
you're going to put it back back.

3298
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,221
That's it.

3299
01:43:06,221 --> 01:43:07,054
But that is,

3300
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:08,423
that is it.

3301
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,200
That's what you're looking at,

3302
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:11,990
man.

3303
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:13,120
You're that crazy.

3304
01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:13,510
Yeah.

3305
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:14,200
Well I mean,

3306
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,040
yeah man.

3307
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:15,993
I mean this is,

3308
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:18,280
I'm terrified because porn is already,

3309
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:19,800
uh,

3310
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:20,080
for,

3311
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,170
I'm sure that from time to time you
occasionally will look upon porn,

3312
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:24,541
having them.

3313
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:25,990
Imagine you do from time to time.

3314
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,770
And it's already incredibly
engrossing just in today's space.

3315
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:32,320
So when suddenly you find yourself,

3316
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:33,070
uh,

3317
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:33,903
in a,

3318
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:34,930
in a room,

3319
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:35,720
I,

3320
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:40,570
that's not your room with a girl
that you've never seen in your life,

3321
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:45,990
writing you and looking at you like she
really loves you and then you look down

3322
01:43:46,481 --> 01:43:49,540
and it's not your body anymore
and that's not your cock.

3323
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:52,110
And he looked back up at

3324
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,120
this beautiful girl.

3325
01:43:53,121 --> 01:43:54,170
He seems to really like,

3326
01:43:54,171 --> 01:43:55,430
she's known you for a long time.

3327
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:57,950
It seems like you're in a really
good part of your relationship.

3328
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,091
You know what I mean?

3329
01:43:59,091 --> 01:43:59,540
Like,

3330
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,170
uh,

3331
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:01,370
that's the one that I saw,

3332
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,383
but it's like,

3333
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,373
uh,

3334
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,150
for a lot of people,

3335
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,190
uh,

3336
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:08,540
I think that's going to be
real hard to come back from.

3337
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:12,860
It's going to be real hard to
peel those goggles off and uh,

3338
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:17,330
walk into your living room where
your wife is passed out on the,

3339
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,770
on the Sofa,

3340
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:23,480
and maybe your blanket falls down and all
the farts that have been held in there

3341
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:27,380
from the Campbell's chunky
soup did she ate earlier,

3342
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:29,990
come wafting up into your face.

3343
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,130
Oh,

3344
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:31,963
you know,

3345
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:34,220
and you look down at your body and it's,

3346
01:44:34,221 --> 01:44:34,521
you know,

3347
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:35,840
it's just a normal body.

3348
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:40,610
It's not the ripped tattooed dude
who is fucking whoever that girl was.

3349
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:45,611
And you're going to like have this strange
kind of a virtual jet lag where you

3350
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:51,290
have to accept that the paradigm that
you're existing in is not a perfect

3351
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:53,950
paradigm that's going to be
hard for a lot of people to,

3352
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:54,200
uh,

3353
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:54,861
to deal with.

3354
01:44:54,861 --> 01:44:56,180
I think that's going to be a real,

3355
01:44:56,660 --> 01:44:58,220
a real problem.

3356
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,520
That's a real problem,

3357
01:44:59,521 --> 01:44:59,900
man.

3358
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:00,500
I think it's,

3359
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,101
I think you're right.

3360
01:45:01,101 --> 01:45:01,410
And I think,

3361
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:01,510
I think

3362
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:05,530
the visual aspect of it and just having
the robot thing on your Dick thought so

3363
01:45:05,531 --> 01:45:06,071
crude,

3364
01:45:06,071 --> 01:45:07,390
that's like one step.

3365
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:12,010
They're going to figure out a way to tap
those ideas directly into your brand.

3366
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:13,750
You're going to be able to experience it.

3367
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,920
You're gonna be able to experience it.

3368
01:45:14,921 --> 01:45:16,510
I think it's probably
going to come in the form.

3369
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,880
Obviously I have no idea what
the fuck I'm talking about.

3370
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:20,890
But if I had to guess,

3371
01:45:20,891 --> 01:45:24,760
like if I had just random
speculation on the future,

3372
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:30,210
I think we're gonna find a way to
record memories on a device in HD there.

3373
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:36,190
They're going to find a way to either do
something with the eyes or figure out a

3374
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:42,631
way through something you wear to
tune in to the reality that you're

3375
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:44,920
experiencing from head to toe tuna,

3376
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:45,180
right?

3377
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:46,540
Tuna didn't sit through a frequency,

3378
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:50,050
record it on some sort of a hard drive,

3379
01:45:50,051 --> 01:45:52,000
a little tiny flash thing,

3380
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:54,460
and we'll have a little flash
thing in the back of our head.

3381
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,061
Or who knows,

3382
01:45:55,061 --> 01:45:55,331
man,

3383
01:45:55,331 --> 01:45:58,220
maybe we'll even all just be in the
cloud all around you all the time.

3384
01:45:58,410 --> 01:45:59,260
That's more likely,

3385
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,221
very likely,

3386
01:46:00,221 --> 01:46:03,760
and you will be able to dip into the
Bank of other people's experiences.

3387
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,440
You will have the antenna that'll shoot
right into our memory or write into our

3388
01:46:08,441 --> 01:46:12,550
mind or right into our
experience center and boom,

3389
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:14,020
I'm live in Duncan trussell's life.

3390
01:46:14,021 --> 01:46:17,250
I'm snowboarding as Duncan
Trussell and when it right,

3391
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:18,130
and I start with it,

3392
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:19,300
Jimmy Hendrix,

3393
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:20,800
manic depression is playing.

3394
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:21,630
No,

3395
01:46:21,630 --> 01:46:21,940
no.

3396
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:26,940
Don't you wake up snowboarding in your
body listening to Jimi Hendrix and I'm

3397
01:46:27,401 --> 01:46:31,750
living your life for the next hour or
two hours that you recorded this and put

3398
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:32,770
it up on Youtube.

3399
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:34,150
That's what you two becomes.

3400
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,201
Two becomes.

3401
01:46:35,201 --> 01:46:36,910
Everybody gets to live cranes.

3402
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:37,750
You are living,

3403
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:38,920
it goes total.

3404
01:46:38,921 --> 01:46:39,754
Next level.

3405
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,490
It makes youtube today
look like cave drawings.

3406
01:46:42,491 --> 01:46:43,210
Yeah,

3407
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:44,650
figure out a way to tap deep,

3408
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,770
deep into the actual memory itself.

3409
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,250
Even missing dog.

3410
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:52,590
Even like thinking when I get home,

3411
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:54,600
I'm going to definitely
throw out that toilet.

3412
01:46:55,060 --> 01:46:55,891
You know all that stuff.

3413
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:56,910
It's going to be in your head.

3414
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:58,770
You're going to be all of it recorded,

3415
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,520
all of it.

3416
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,990
We're going to be in an ocean of memories
digitally recorded in the cloud and

3417
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:04,950
also don't forget,

3418
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,270
possibly,

3419
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,350
maybe suddenly graveyards are preserved.

3420
01:47:10,351 --> 01:47:13,350
Brains become reservoirs of old memories,

3421
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:16,770
so you might even be able to
harvest the memories of the dead.

3422
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:17,850
You know you might.

3423
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:19,410
Who knows if epigenetics,

3424
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:19,710
if,

3425
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:22,290
if these memories are
being stored are encoded.

3426
01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:27,810
Maybe you could go into the DNA of
a mummy and have Einstein's brain.

3427
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:30,210
I hope they'll die.

3428
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:31,230
I don't know.

3429
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:33,300
I feel like these
preserved Einstein's brain.

3430
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:36,000
I think they got us
doing experiments on it.

3431
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:36,301
Shit.

3432
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:37,800
Trying to find out why it was so wacky,

3433
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:38,311
strong,

3434
01:47:38,311 --> 01:47:39,300
super powerful.

3435
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:40,440
Can you imagine that?

3436
01:47:40,441 --> 01:47:44,310
Imagine the fucking waking Einstein up
and of computer and the first thing he's

3437
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:44,760
like,

3438
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,270
what?

3439
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:45,630
Wait,

3440
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:46,350
where am I?

3441
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:47,070
What?

3442
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:47,970
What have you done?

3443
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:49,283
Yeah,

3444
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:50,930
you fucking assholes done.

3445
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,590
Who would let you do this?

3446
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:53,340
Yeah.

3447
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:53,521
Okay,

3448
01:47:53,521 --> 01:47:54,354
shut me off.

3449
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:57,360
He's having a great time
and he's up in heaven.

3450
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:58,651
No,

3451
01:47:58,651 --> 01:47:59,570
I'm not going to shut you off.

3452
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,520
I'm going to drop you
into world of Warcraft.

3453
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:07,040
I know.

3454
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:07,711
What are you going to do,

3455
01:48:07,711 --> 01:48:08,421
Einstein?

3456
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:11,360
You better get some magic clean.

3457
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:14,970
You gotta level up.

3458
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,490
That's going to be weird
to think that we are.

3459
01:48:16,491 --> 01:48:21,491
We're going to be able to re to resurrect
anyone whose DNA still exists and drop

3460
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:25,050
them into video games and
tortures and just for fun.

3461
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,980
Well that when you were talking
about porn being a real problem,

3462
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:31,950
the other thing that's going to be
a real problem is that video games,

3463
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,290
video games are going
to be a crazy problem.

3464
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:35,101
This is awesome.

3465
01:48:35,101 --> 01:48:35,934
As they are now.

3466
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:36,361
Dude,

3467
01:48:36,361 --> 01:48:36,931
I get jealous.

3468
01:48:36,931 --> 01:48:41,190
I was watching this thing on kim.com
kim.com was apparently like the number one

3469
01:48:41,191 --> 01:48:43,440
call of duty player in
the world at one point.

3470
01:48:43,441 --> 01:48:43,981
You know who he is,

3471
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:44,760
right?

3472
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,400
He's the Guy who runs a mega upload.

3473
01:48:47,401 --> 01:48:47,880
Yep.

3474
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,710
And they took all of his money.

3475
01:48:49,711 --> 01:48:52,800
It's like this crazy thing with America.

3476
01:48:52,801 --> 01:48:56,370
They're saying he's fleeing justice
because he won't come to America,

3477
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:58,350
stays in New Zealand and reports are,

3478
01:48:58,351 --> 01:48:59,880
he's the coolest guy ever.

3479
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:00,900
He seems very,

3480
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:01,291
very,

3481
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:01,651
very,

3482
01:49:01,651 --> 01:49:01,981
very,

3483
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:02,814
very cool.

3484
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:03,810
And um,

3485
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,160
for whatever reason.

3486
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:05,790
Anyway,

3487
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:06,601
the point is they should,

3488
01:49:06,601 --> 01:49:08,400
they had this tour of his house and uh,

3489
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:08,591
you know,

3490
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:10,170
it was kind of going over
the details of his case,

3491
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:13,200
but I was watching like his video game
room's got to like a room where he plays

3492
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:14,010
this fucking game.

3493
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:17,010
I can't even watch it for a few minutes
and watch her for a few minutes ago.

3494
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:17,341
God,

3495
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:18,270
that must be fucking awesome.

3496
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:19,800
That must be so awesome to play.

3497
01:49:19,801 --> 01:49:20,011
Come.

3498
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:21,380
Maybe I'll just get into it from,

3499
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,780
no,

3500
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,110
no,

3501
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:22,943
I can't fucking do it.

3502
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,570
But this is going to be nothing.

3503
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:25,700
This is almost like a pitstop.

3504
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,760
You don't even have to take like,

3505
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:27,260
dude,

3506
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:28,093
hold you.

3507
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,010
Are you this hungry?

3508
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:32,610
Cause in the half an hour
there's a Kentucky Fried
Chicken and they got that new

3509
01:49:32,611 --> 01:49:33,361
double double.

3510
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:34,194
If you had that,

3511
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:35,671
you know,

3512
01:49:35,671 --> 01:49:38,790
it's like you pass like Mike Shit Burgers,

3513
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:41,130
you know and you know like it just
hang on for another half hour.

3514
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,180
That's what it feel like.

3515
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:44,760
It's like what they're coming
out with with these goggles.

3516
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:45,301
Yeah.

3517
01:49:45,301 --> 01:49:46,134
That evening.

3518
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,350
Sorry.

3519
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,700
Carmax had it to me the other day.

3520
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,820
He asked me if I had been in doctor dated.

3521
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:51,611
Oh,

3522
01:49:51,611 --> 01:49:52,840
I saw that tweet man.

3523
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:54,130
I turned green with jealousy.

3524
01:49:54,131 --> 01:49:55,390
Carmax tweeting you.

3525
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:56,320
That's incredible,

3526
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:56,730
man.

3527
01:49:56,730 --> 01:49:57,910
I met him a bunch of times,

3528
01:49:57,911 --> 01:49:58,390
man.

3529
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,470
Holy Shit.

3530
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:00,520
Quake against his crew.

3531
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:01,420
That was nuts.

3532
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:01,810
Yeah,

3533
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,620
I saw that.

3534
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:02,830
Yeah.

3535
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:04,180
One of the coolest things ever,

3536
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:04,480
dude.

3537
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:08,080
He's right about indoctrinated too
because it is an indoctrination it in the

3538
01:50:08,081 --> 01:50:12,370
people who like indoctrinate you like
my pal Johnny Ross when he brought me to

3539
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:14,740
this special room to try this VR shit out.

3540
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:15,071
He's like,

3541
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:15,904
get ready,

3542
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:16,863
get ready.

3543
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:17,773
This will change you.

3544
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,000
This is going to blow your mind.

3545
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,830
He's totally right to mash it.

3546
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:21,581
Fly to Dallas,

3547
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,360
you and me.

3548
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,680
We should film it for the show.

3549
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:24,880
The show that we're going to do,

3550
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,860
which is fly to Dallas
and hang out with carmax.

3551
01:50:26,861 --> 01:50:27,694
That'd be awesome.

3552
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:28,220
He's,

3553
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:30,070
he's an intimidatingly intelligent.

3554
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:33,340
We definitely need to get you
to try out the most outdated.

3555
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,563
You need to try it.

3556
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:35,793
You gotta try it.

3557
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:36,481
Skirt.

3558
01:50:36,481 --> 01:50:36,721
Of course.

3559
01:50:36,721 --> 01:50:37,470
I'll try it,

3560
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:38,440
but I'm scared thing.

3561
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:39,331
Is this a,

3562
01:50:39,331 --> 01:50:40,450
the new magic leap thing?

3563
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:43,560
That video they put out last week of this
is supposedly what it's going to look

3564
01:50:43,561 --> 01:50:44,190
like.

3565
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:44,461
Okay.

3566
01:50:44,461 --> 01:50:46,110
Let's see what magic leap looks like here.

3567
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,090
Can the folks at home
see some version of this?

3568
01:50:48,091 --> 01:50:48,300
Yeah.

3569
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:48,660
Okay.

3570
01:50:48,660 --> 01:50:50,790
I'm going to go pee all the
time and make that happen.

3571
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:53,190
Tonkin decays healthy,

3572
01:50:53,191 --> 01:50:53,491
new,

3573
01:50:53,491 --> 01:50:54,330
healthy fit,

3574
01:50:54,331 --> 01:50:55,164
Dunkin,

3575
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:56,970
keeping it together.

3576
01:50:56,971 --> 01:50:57,804
Dunkin.

3577
01:50:57,930 --> 01:50:58,741
Oh my God.

3578
01:50:58,741 --> 01:50:59,910
So this magic leap,

3579
01:50:59,911 --> 01:51:03,690
it lets holograms appealing
appear in front of you and the,

3580
01:51:03,691 --> 01:51:04,471
they're spinning.

3581
01:51:04,471 --> 01:51:07,710
This person in this video
is spinning these holograms,

3582
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:11,960
moving them around and stretching them
and touching them as if they're the

3583
01:51:11,961 --> 01:51:12,794
interface.

3584
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:14,690
On a computer just loaded up the game.

3585
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,280
You got to play a video game right now.

3586
01:51:16,610 --> 01:51:19,310
So he's about to play a video
game right now in his head.

3587
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:20,960
This is fucking insane.

3588
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:23,480
And he grabs a gun?

3589
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:23,900
Yeah.

3590
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:24,770
Where's he get that gun?

3591
01:51:24,771 --> 01:51:25,670
That's plastic gun,

3592
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:26,121
right?

3593
01:51:26,121 --> 01:51:27,830
Or it's a visual virtual.

3594
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:30,170
We can't be virtual because
he's holding in his hand.

3595
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,150
I think it's virtual.

3596
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,150
No chance.

3597
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:33,260
What they're trying to say.

3598
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:35,030
That's what they're trying to say.

3599
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:35,690
Yeah.

3600
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:36,410
I think I'd be,

3601
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,520
I'd rather have a real gun.

3602
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,553
Cause a real gun.

3603
01:51:39,170 --> 01:51:39,921
But this is pretty dope.

3604
01:51:39,921 --> 01:51:42,410
So he's playing video games at his house?

3605
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:43,100
Yeah.

3606
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:44,960
He's shooting things that
are in his house with,

3607
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,790
this might be the end of the world.

3608
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:48,561
Okay.

3609
01:51:48,561 --> 01:51:49,220
Come on dude.

3610
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:51,410
Who's going to fucking go
outside and play stick ball.

3611
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:52,993
Tell me that.

3612
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:55,460
What kid is going to go play
stickball when you can do this.

3613
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:57,980
This is the dopest shit
the world has ever seen.

3614
01:51:59,450 --> 01:52:00,500
Oh my God,

3615
01:52:00,501 --> 01:52:01,280
man.

3616
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:01,671
Oh my God.

3617
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:02,900
You get an attack by a robot.

3618
01:52:02,901 --> 01:52:03,734
This is terrifying.

3619
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:04,823
Oh yeah.

3620
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:06,551
The key here,

3621
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:07,330
the guys scream,

3622
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:07,841
oh shit.

3623
01:52:07,841 --> 01:52:09,850
He's like literally out of breath,

3624
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:11,620
kids are going to get in shape.

3625
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:14,830
We're going to develop super warriors
because they're going to be constantly

3626
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:15,491
running around.

3627
01:52:15,491 --> 01:52:15,521
Yeah.

3628
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:15,750
Around

3629
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:16,710
playing video games.

3630
01:52:16,711 --> 01:52:18,630
I'm one of those Omni
Directional treadmills.

3631
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:19,883
Yeah.

3632
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:20,820
That's just insane,

3633
01:52:20,821 --> 01:52:21,091
man.

3634
01:52:21,091 --> 01:52:22,590
You haven't seen a black mirror yet,

3635
01:52:22,591 --> 01:52:24,300
but a lot of the stuff you
guys are just talking about.

3636
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:25,550
They talked about it at all.

3637
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:26,070
Yeah,

3638
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,920
I'm the new episode.

3639
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:31,500
Don't spoiler alert it because everybody
told me that the new episode is

3640
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:32,340
insanely good.

3641
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:33,100
You got to see it.

3642
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:36,510
What's everything you had Duncan
just talk about of course episode.

3643
01:52:36,511 --> 01:52:37,500
That's of course.

3644
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:39,240
Have you seen the new episode of uh,

3645
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:40,110
what is it called again?

3646
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:41,610
Black Mirror and I've seen it.

3647
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:43,980
I've seen one episode of
that show and I liked it.

3648
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:44,221
It was,

3649
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:46,130
it was weird as pig fucking episode.

3650
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:47,120
The Zealand laughs a,

3651
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:47,421
yeah,

3652
01:52:47,421 --> 01:52:47,980
that was good.

3653
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:48,531
It's Whoa.

3654
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:50,690
It's like what kind of a
crazy fucking show is this?

3655
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,100
I mean that was a really interesting
dilemma that guy was facing.

3656
01:52:55,190 --> 01:52:56,023
Yeah,

3657
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:57,320
that was a fascinating show.

3658
01:52:58,310 --> 01:53:00,950
But the new one is supposed to be awesome
and deals with a lot of the stuff that

3659
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:01,784
we just talked about.

3660
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:05,780
There's a bunch of people that are
aware that we're in some weird space.

3661
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,590
We just showed the games that you play
on magic leap and I see that we just

3662
01:53:09,591 --> 01:53:11,090
shoot the people in your living room.

3663
01:53:11,091 --> 01:53:12,290
You get robots coming after you.

3664
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:13,430
It's insane.

3665
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:14,720
Insanely cool.

3666
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:14,861
Yeah,

3667
01:53:14,861 --> 01:53:15,170
that,

3668
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:15,951
that's right man.

3669
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:16,161
That,

3670
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:17,510
that stuff is really cool.

3671
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:17,901
That's,

3672
01:53:17,901 --> 01:53:20,000
that's the data visualization,

3673
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:20,240
you know,

3674
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,600
that's the idea that we're sort of
surrounded by this midst of data and that

3675
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:26,750
technology is going to visualize
it and all these new ways.

3676
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,770
Like currently the way it's visualized
is in two d on the screen in our pockets.

3677
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,510
But the idea of like,

3678
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:32,991
you know,

3679
01:53:32,991 --> 01:53:37,991
just cool shit like as you're driving
your tweets or any tweets at you come

3680
01:53:38,451 --> 01:53:41,570
flying into your car or you know,

3681
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,470
tweets will become three d things
floating around people or my friend,

3682
01:53:45,830 --> 01:53:48,170
my friend Pemberton says uh,

3683
01:53:48,171 --> 01:53:50,960
it's all gonna be Johnny
Palmer and funny guy but he's,

3684
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:51,130
he,

3685
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:54,770
he says that it's going to be like credit
is going to become the new form of a

3686
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:57,410
leadism and that you're in
your augmented reality land,

3687
01:53:57,411 --> 01:53:59,470
your credit score can float around you.

3688
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,550
So people get,

3689
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:01,970
you know,

3690
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:02,803
that kind of shit.

3691
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:07,400
Like it's going to be weird cause the way
that the people build themselves up is

3692
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:10,040
in augmented reality is
going to be hilarious.

3693
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:11,330
Like the trophies,

3694
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:14,270
you were like little augmented
reality metals that you'll wear.

3695
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:15,740
Cause you know like you know,

3696
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:17,480
it's a big deal for people.

3697
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:19,490
My Twitter followers,

3698
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:20,211
you know what I mean?

3699
01:54:20,211 --> 01:54:21,080
People were really into that.

3700
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:25,100
The number of Twitter followers you have
is that some kind of indication of your

3701
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:25,850
fame.

3702
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:27,380
So that kind of shit,

3703
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:28,880
people are going to figure out ways to,

3704
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:31,880
to wear it and augmented reality space.

3705
01:54:31,881 --> 01:54:33,080
And kind of subtle ways,

3706
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:34,370
but ways that people can see it.

3707
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:37,250
It used to be if you wanted
to brag about your success,

3708
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,580
the way you would visualize
it was by wearing gold.

3709
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:41,631
You know what I mean?

3710
01:54:41,631 --> 01:54:43,170
It's that people still do it right?

3711
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:44,150
They want to show their,

3712
01:54:44,290 --> 01:54:45,350
they want it subtly.

3713
01:54:45,351 --> 01:54:50,351
Say I'm a rich mother fucker by showing
you their Kohl's watcher gold chains.

3714
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:51,081
It's like,

3715
01:54:51,081 --> 01:54:51,411
see,

3716
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:54,980
I'm actually wearing a rare metal
that's cause I'm doing good.

3717
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:56,510
Recognize it,

3718
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,880
but the new way of doing that,

3719
01:54:58,881 --> 01:54:59,714
it's going to be,

3720
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,590
you know,

3721
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:00,980
Shit.

3722
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:02,510
There really is more relevant,

3723
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,650
which is like,

3724
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,621
you know what?

3725
01:55:04,621 --> 01:55:06,680
What are you going to look
like in that virtual world?

3726
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:07,341
I mean,

3727
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:09,560
if it's predicated on
how much money you have,

3728
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:10,791
like what if you,

3729
01:55:10,791 --> 01:55:14,270
what if you look like that Persian
guy from 300 the giant guy.

3730
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,140
What was his name?

3731
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:15,973
Xerxes.

3732
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:16,580
Xerxes.

3733
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:16,880
Yeah.

3734
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,140
How about that shits on.

3735
01:55:18,230 --> 01:55:20,180
That's when you're super
bowl and you're 10 feet tall,

3736
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,700
10 foot tall Persian dude,

3737
01:55:21,701 --> 01:55:22,550
but cool earrings.

3738
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:25,550
But you can only look like that if
you've got a 700 credit score and have a

3739
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:26,384
Citibank card,

3740
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:30,680
but you can look like that if you have
a 700 credit score and a Citibank card,

3741
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:31,670
you can look like that.

3742
01:55:31,671 --> 01:55:31,970
Yeah.

3743
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:32,960
That's something to aspire to.

3744
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:35,320
Dunkin feed the machine because it's like,

3745
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:35,811
think of that.

3746
01:55:35,811 --> 01:55:37,920
What's that stupid car
thing that everybody,

3747
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:42,110
that people get really into the black
American Express who's got the black,

3748
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:46,360
but it's like things that like stupid
stupid ways that we try to like this

3749
01:55:46,361 --> 01:55:50,580
stupid tail feathers that you tried
it and he's a baller dunk control.

3750
01:55:50,650 --> 01:55:52,920
He's got a black or or the or the like,

3751
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:53,401
you know,

3752
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:57,210
there's just so many ways that people
try to d or The new ad and an apple watch

3753
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:58,201
and if you want,

3754
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:03,201
you can get one for $19,000 with a gold
chain and then like he can go around and

3755
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:05,890
show everybody luck.

3756
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:07,080
I'm allowed Ed.

3757
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,280
If it's 10 grand,

3758
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:11,610
10 grand for the Super Spencer one
Tangere isn't something like that.

3759
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:12,450
It's crazy.

3760
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:12,961
But still,

3761
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:13,900
it's very funny though.

3762
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:17,760
The way we try to indicate our worth
or value is through a rare metal,

3763
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,840
uh,

3764
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:19,261
when,

3765
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:23,850
when what it really indicates a person's
value these days is not so much like

3766
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:27,600
can you afford to wear a rare metal?

3767
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,850
It's a lot of other
stuff that goes into it.

3768
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:30,121
You know,

3769
01:56:30,121 --> 01:56:32,250
it's not just the jewels
that you were or you know,

3770
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:36,570
like that's a thing you give
your girlfriend a diamond
and then they wear it.

3771
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:37,110
Are there,

3772
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:38,100
some women are,

3773
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:38,791
so you know,

3774
01:56:38,791 --> 01:56:39,421
like the thing,

3775
01:56:39,421 --> 01:56:39,851
it's like a,

3776
01:56:39,851 --> 01:56:42,900
it's a boring class shea
in movies where it's like,

3777
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:43,531
Ooh,

3778
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:47,010
he got you a giant diamond
and it's like a big,

3779
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:47,581
it's a,

3780
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:48,630
it's a big deal.

3781
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:50,700
That's just so funny the way that we,

3782
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:53,670
those things are going to be
outdated with augmented reality.

3783
01:56:53,671 --> 01:56:58,671
It's going to be certain add ons to your
physical form that you can only obtain

3784
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:00,210
via shit.

3785
01:57:00,211 --> 01:57:01,790
Tons of money or some others.

3786
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:02,624
Social,

3787
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,680
online standing,

3788
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:07,920
which demonstrates your
worth in the cloud.

3789
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,000
So for now,

3790
01:57:09,070 --> 01:57:11,730
embrace the physical reality,

3791
01:57:11,731 --> 01:57:14,570
enjoy the shit out of the
cheeseburgers and milkshakes.

3792
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:15,000
Yes.

3793
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:15,833
Sex.

3794
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:16,963
And you know,

3795
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,120
just have a good time.

3796
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:21,270
Give a lot of hugs out cause
it's gonna get real virtual.

3797
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:21,601
Yeah,

3798
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:22,110
that's right.

3799
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:22,860
Real quick.

3800
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:23,340
Yeah.

3801
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,061
It's coming.

3802
01:57:24,061 --> 01:57:26,280
Get all the reality
stuff out while you can.

3803
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:26,970
That's right.

3804
01:57:26,970 --> 01:57:27,900
Within a hundred years,

3805
01:57:27,901 --> 01:57:28,860
it's not going to be here.

3806
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:31,800
We're all going to be living
inside a cloud 10 10 years,

3807
01:57:31,801 --> 01:57:32,370
10 years.

3808
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:32,640
Geez.

3809
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,140
I'd say 10 I mean 10 years in,

3810
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:35,460
we're all in some odd,

3811
01:57:35,461 --> 01:57:38,730
we're all aware it using some form
of augmented reality technology,

3812
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:40,800
but all these people,

3813
01:57:40,801 --> 01:57:40,981
man,

3814
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:41,970
when you ask them,

3815
01:57:42,150 --> 01:57:44,700
the people who are really
like in the know about this,

3816
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:47,400
when you ask them what do
you predict in 10 years,

3817
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:47,790
they're like,

3818
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:48,623
they're like,

3819
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:50,340
forget it man.

3820
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:50,520
You,

3821
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:55,520
you want me to tell you what things are
gonna look like when they're five times

3822
01:57:55,561 --> 01:57:57,180
as fast as they are now?

3823
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,530
That's what you want me to tell you.

3824
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:03,710
You want me to predict what
kind of innovations come
from an apple computer five

3825
01:58:03,901 --> 01:58:06,870
times as fast as the fastest
apple computer on planet earth?

3826
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:08,310
I can't do that.

3827
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,900
It's impossible to guess.

3828
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:11,160
We don't know.

3829
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,440
It's a big fucking question mark.

3830
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:15,510
Especially when you start
talking about decades.

3831
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,673
Yeah.

3832
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:17,301
Can't do it.

3833
01:58:17,301 --> 01:58:18,150
Who decades.

3834
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:19,381
Yeah,

3835
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:20,160
go back.

3836
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,000
Go back in time.

3837
01:58:21,001 --> 01:58:23,700
10 years and predict this.

3838
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:24,170
How,

3839
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:24,491
how,

3840
01:58:24,491 --> 01:58:28,410
how accurately would you have predicted
some of the things happening right now

3841
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:31,410
and I wouldn't have predicted Uber.

3842
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,390
You wouldn't have predicted most things.

3843
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,171
Who would?

3844
01:58:34,171 --> 01:58:35,820
Who would have predicted podcasts?

3845
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:36,910
Let's go there.

3846
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:37,740
Oh yeah,

3847
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:38,190
that's right.

3848
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:41,440
Do you remember that Christian Slater
movie where he was the rebel that was

3849
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,370
broadcasting

3850
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,020
the pirate radio show?

3851
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:44,741
Do you remember that?

3852
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:46,030
He had a run and hide.

3853
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:47,620
He was broadcasting

3854
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:52,120
out that it's so funny.

3855
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:54,220
I'm going to have to
watch that to tie it up,

3856
01:58:54,221 --> 01:58:55,054
man.

3857
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:57,400
He's fucking going to play the cool songs.

3858
01:58:57,490 --> 01:59:00,040
Not that fucking Jessie's girl bullshit.

3859
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:00,910
You listening to

3860
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:04,320
me?

3861
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:04,510
Well,

3862
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:06,400
Jessie's girl is a bad ass jam.

3863
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:07,733
You know?

3864
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:09,890
Maybe Christian Slater
just has obscure tastes.

3865
01:59:09,891 --> 01:59:10,960
He doesn't have to shove it down,

3866
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:11,350
throw it.

3867
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:14,680
What he needs to do it was by a god
damn radio license like everybody else.

3868
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:14,910
Well,

3869
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:16,350
I'll set up a business or

3870
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:20,013
government.

3871
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,610
Why doesn't he do that?

3872
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:22,990
Why does he have to be a pirate?

3873
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,580
He needs to get licensed,

3874
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:25,570
get licensed,

3875
01:59:25,571 --> 01:59:30,571
pay the government there due to criminal
broadcasting music through the sky

3876
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:32,440
without a license.

3877
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:33,640
It's ridiculous.

3878
01:59:33,641 --> 01:59:34,100
He had a,

3879
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,610
he had a fucking dangerous situation.

3880
01:59:36,611 --> 01:59:37,750
He was running from the cops,

3881
01:59:37,751 --> 01:59:42,640
but it was more important to
him to continue broadcasting
shitty music over the

3882
01:59:42,641 --> 01:59:46,270
forbidden skies to fight the
found that it was to stay free.

3883
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,860
He was going to take chances.

3884
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:49,090
He was so beautiful,

3885
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:50,620
had great bone structure,

3886
01:59:50,830 --> 01:59:54,000
such a cute man with a sort of
young Jack Nicholson thing going.

3887
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:56,890
Daria is broadcasting from his car,

3888
01:59:57,490 --> 02:00:00,160
pump up the volume to food there.

3889
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:03,130
He gets on the first podcast
or pump up the volume.

3890
02:00:03,131 --> 02:00:04,600
He was the first podcaster.

3891
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,940
He was driving around yelling at people.

3892
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:08,620
The Sky's falling and they were like,

3893
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:09,220
God dammit,

3894
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:10,090
we're so glad you're here.

3895
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:12,160
It's so funny,

3896
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:14,170
the idea that some young guy too,

3897
02:00:14,190 --> 02:00:14,490
it was,

3898
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,280
it's always great.

3899
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:18,430
Like some young guy who gets it and
there's like these older people that just

3900
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:19,170
don't get it.

3901
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:21,100
Email how annoying this
dude be in real life.

3902
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:22,900
Some young guy driving on the street,

3903
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:25,000
they'd government is stealing.

3904
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:27,280
Taxes are stealing.

3905
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,030
Oh.

3906
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,570
Oh,

3907
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:29,410
this fucking guy.

3908
02:00:29,770 --> 02:00:31,420
I don't know what he was protesting about.

3909
02:00:31,421 --> 02:00:33,940
What was the protesting about
wanting to play the smiths.

3910
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:40,631
I need,

3911
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:45,280
do I need to educate your people
and could fucking music Kubo.

3912
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:46,943
Let's play vine.

3913
02:00:47,070 --> 02:00:47,980
Oh Dude,

3914
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:48,940
I remember that movie.

3915
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:50,790
I thought I thought he was
the coolest fucking guy.

3916
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:51,010
Talk.

3917
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:51,850
He's the coolest guy ever.

3918
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:52,300
Yeah,

3919
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,133
girls would love him.

3920
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:53,800
I walk.

3921
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:54,450
Can I be him?

3922
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:55,283
I wish I was a rebel.

3923
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,020
God.

3924
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:57,910
I says movies.

3925
02:00:57,911 --> 02:00:59,290
Those guys would be so perfect.

3926
02:00:59,520 --> 02:00:59,921
I God,

3927
02:00:59,921 --> 02:01:02,170
I wish I could be like John
Cusack can say anything.

3928
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,110
Just stand there with a boom box
on my head and get the girl back.

3929
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:10,200
Or what's his name and what
about footloose remember
footloose I wish I was so

3930
02:01:10,481 --> 02:01:13,960
free that I could come to some small
town and dance and still try to pick up

3931
02:01:13,961 --> 02:01:14,411
girls.

3932
02:01:14,411 --> 02:01:16,000
Some top 10 that I'm not gay.

3933
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:17,590
I'm just showing up dancing.

3934
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:18,550
Who the fuck is dancing?

3935
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:19,690
Kevin Bacon.

3936
02:01:19,691 --> 02:01:20,890
That's who bitch shows up.

3937
02:01:20,891 --> 02:01:21,920
He's got fucking moves.

3938
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,810
He's been practicing.

3939
02:01:23,070 --> 02:01:23,311
Whoa,

3940
02:01:23,311 --> 02:01:23,521
Whoa,

3941
02:01:23,521 --> 02:01:23,770
Whoa,

3942
02:01:23,770 --> 02:01:24,040
whoa.

3943
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:26,140
How come you haven't been
doing man type shit sign?

3944
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:27,003
How come you,

3945
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,940
he shows up hanging
around Barnes and shit,

3946
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:31,661
bleeding,

3947
02:01:31,661 --> 02:01:32,494
dancing and they,

3948
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:34,240
they overthrow the old fuddy duddies.

3949
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:35,133
That's right.

3950
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:37,210
The fucking preacher
had the sluttiest girl,

3951
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:38,410
the daughter member,

3952
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,710
yet preacher's daughter.

3953
02:01:39,711 --> 02:01:40,490
He was banging her.

3954
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:41,440
She was a little upset.

3955
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:42,500
Classic.

3956
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:43,423
Classic.

3957
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,490
I guess that's what the singularity is,

3958
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:46,850
right?

3959
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:51,500
It's just Kevin Bacon coming to our
dimension and like teaching us all how to,

3960
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:56,480
how to overcome the oppression of old
power structures were just in footloose

3961
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:58,590
fancy to step [inaudible].

3962
02:01:58,700 --> 02:02:00,250
Who's fixes everything?

3963
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:01,790
Kenny Loggins songs.

3964
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:02,511
God,

3965
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:04,010
I heard that song the other day.

3966
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:05,360
Footloose well,

3967
02:02:05,361 --> 02:02:08,900
how about there's fucking
geniuses that remade that movie.

3968
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:10,063
How about that?

3969
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:11,570
How long someone sat around,

3970
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,433
they remade it.

3971
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:12,591
Oh,

3972
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:13,550
they already did.

3973
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:14,413
They already did it.

3974
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:14,871
Yeah.

3975
02:02:14,871 --> 02:02:16,130
Someone watched footloose and goes,

3976
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:16,993
God damn,

3977
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,350
we need to do this again.

3978
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:19,730
How come,

3979
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:23,720
how come they haven't
done that with road house?

3980
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,643
Okay.

3981
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:27,350
You know,

3982
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:29,060
and they need to do that dude from,

3983
02:02:29,061 --> 02:02:29,894
uh,

3984
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,190
the HBO show,

3985
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:31,990
Danny Mcbride,

3986
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:33,530
you know Danny the hilarious dude.

3987
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:34,101
Oh yeah,

3988
02:02:34,101 --> 02:02:34,420
man,

3989
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:35,090
totally.

3990
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:36,500
He needs to do roadhouse.

3991
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:39,860
That'd be amazing to his version
of how he needs to do anything.

3992
02:02:39,861 --> 02:02:40,970
That's one of the hang on its own.

3993
02:02:40,971 --> 02:02:41,750
However,

3994
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:42,950
if he did a real,

3995
02:02:42,951 --> 02:02:45,800
if they did the exact same script
exactly the way it happened,

3996
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,990
I bet it would be one
of the funniest movies.

3997
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:49,040
So it will be sell funny.

3998
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:50,450
It'd be incredible.

3999
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:51,500
You should pitch that to

4000
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:57,200
Danny Mcbride and for that's the
Sam guy with the thick mustache.

4001
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,430
Danny trio.

4002
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,421
Uh,

4003
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:00,200
yeah,

4004
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,760
I'm a casting agent.

4005
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:02,743
Yeah,

4006
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:05,620
that would be an amazing move.

4007
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:06,111
Who wouldn't?

4008
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:07,730
That's a great God damn fucking movie.

4009
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:13,090
Danny Mcbride as Patrick Swayze and
Danny Tree Hill as that Sam doodle fine.

4010
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:14,413
Sam,

4011
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:16,243
what is his name?

4012
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:17,360
God dammit,

4013
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,650
the guy who does the truck commercials.

4014
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:19,850
Ram trucks.

4015
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:20,920
Ram tough.

4016
02:03:21,170 --> 02:03:22,070
It doesn't he do around?

4017
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:23,870
I'm not sure you mean I'm confused.

4018
02:03:23,871 --> 02:03:26,180
I thought you were talking about
the guy who used to be in jail.

4019
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:27,323
The Ram.

4020
02:03:27,530 --> 02:03:28,100
Yeah,

4021
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:32,000
but I'm talking about the guy in the
roadhouse movie in the roadhouse movie.

4022
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:32,953
What is his name?

4023
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:33,980
Sam Elliott.

4024
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:34,401
That's right.

4025
02:03:34,401 --> 02:03:34,701
You know who?

4026
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:35,331
Sam Elliott,

4027
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:36,080
his son.

4028
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:36,913
How dare you?

4029
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:38,570
You know Sam Elliot is right.

4030
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:40,251
No,

4031
02:03:40,251 --> 02:03:42,260
I just want to lie and say I do.

4032
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:43,021
I'm in Paris.

4033
02:03:43,021 --> 02:03:44,060
I'm looking it up right now.

4034
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,050
I'll pull it up for you.

4035
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,800
There he is.

4036
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,290
Oh yes.

4037
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:46,710
That guy.

4038
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:46,911
Yeah,

4039
02:03:46,911 --> 02:03:47,241
sure.

4040
02:03:47,241 --> 02:03:47,540
I know.

4041
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:51,380
You know that guy is so in
the Danny Mcbride version.

4042
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:51,591
Dot.

4043
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:53,090
Guys prayed by Danny Trejo.

4044
02:03:53,460 --> 02:03:54,293
Oh that's cool.

4045
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:55,101
Cause he,

4046
02:03:55,101 --> 02:04:00,101
he's the guy that gets jacked and then
I don't want to spoil alert Roadhouse,

4047
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:05,000
but he's the guy that get jacked and
then the Patrick Swayze guy has to go in

4048
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:05,750
and kick some ass.

4049
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:08,540
So who plays the Badass
dude who plays this guy?

4050
02:04:10,670 --> 02:04:11,010
There was,

4051
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:13,060
there were some other guys
they would back up real quick.

4052
02:04:13,061 --> 02:04:14,770
I want to show the guys
that they would fight with.

4053
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:17,440
There's some other dudes,

4054
02:04:17,441 --> 02:04:18,090
right?

4055
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:18,923
I don't know.

4056
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,350
It's just all pictures of him.

4057
02:04:20,351 --> 02:04:21,900
That's not necessarily all roadhouse.

4058
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:23,290
What there was whoever,

4059
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:27,070
there was a guy who was the number
one karate guy that Patrick Swayze.

4060
02:04:27,071 --> 02:04:29,170
He had to fight [inaudible] excuse me.

4061
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:31,510
And the guy at the end where he kills him.

4062
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:32,220
Remember that?

4063
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:32,560
Yeah.

4064
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:35,290
That was the guy that he brought
in the fucking super bad ass guy.

4065
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:36,820
I dunno who plays him.

4066
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,310
That guy.

4067
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,143
Yes.

4068
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,280
I vote for Mario Lopez.

4069
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:43,050
Perfect.

4070
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:43,590
Yup.

4071
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:44,400
Handsome.

4072
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:45,060
Beautiful.

4073
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:46,500
Have you seen the F can act,

4074
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:49,350
can box if he seen the fist foot way?

4075
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,720
Of course I have so fucking guy's,

4076
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:54,090
that guy's genius.

4077
02:04:54,091 --> 02:04:54,924
He's genius.

4078
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:57,480
He's just funny as shit all times.

4079
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:59,190
He is so funny.

4080
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:00,061
Did you see that movie,

4081
02:05:00,061 --> 02:05:01,380
the end or this is the end?

4082
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:03,960
Whatever the one who was with
James Franco and no broken.

4083
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:05,970
I'm glad that your mind
has to see that shit.

4084
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:07,230
Is He funny in that movie?

4085
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:08,310
Holy Shit.

4086
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:10,020
Is he funny in that movie that was like,

4087
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:12,780
that might be as funny as role
ever and I'm not bullshitting.

4088
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:15,810
I hate when people say that and I said
we can't wait to watch it and I'm not

4089
02:05:15,811 --> 02:05:16,644
bullshitting.

4090
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:17,870
Maybe sometimes the bullshit,

4091
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,620
but I got to go soon.

4092
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:20,473
I do too.

4093
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:22,380
So what a crappy,

4094
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:23,670
crappy way to end the podcast.

4095
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:24,450
I'm sorry.

4096
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:25,680
There's no good way to end these things.

4097
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:27,121
Excuse me,

4098
02:05:27,121 --> 02:05:27,954
ladies and gentlemen,

4099
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,670
there's no good way to
end these things there.

4100
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:31,523
They're two fun,

4101
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:32,070
right?

4102
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,210
We were too high starting out.

4103
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:34,890
I wasn't [inaudible].

4104
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:36,420
I was a little on the high side.

4105
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:36,961
God Damn,

4106
02:05:36,961 --> 02:05:38,820
I was tumbling because I had a point,

4107
02:05:38,821 --> 02:05:39,180
but we were,

4108
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:42,080
we were both so energetic
and so energized to say it,

4109
02:05:42,081 --> 02:05:45,600
but I had a point about like super left
wing people and it totally lost it in

4110
02:05:45,601 --> 02:05:46,434
mid thought.

4111
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,060
Oh I didn't know where it went,

4112
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,210
but that's a pretty good job.

4113
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:55,300
Talking about how they disguise their
aggression and their in the clothes or

4114
02:05:55,301 --> 02:05:56,580
whatever the thing is they're doing.

4115
02:05:56,581 --> 02:05:58,630
It's just here people are going to use it.

4116
02:05:58,631 --> 02:05:58,940
Some.

4117
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,210
Some people are going to use symbols,

4118
02:06:00,211 --> 02:06:03,420
structures to try to make the world a
better place and some people are going to

4119
02:06:03,421 --> 02:06:03,961
use symbols,

4120
02:06:03,961 --> 02:06:05,340
structures to punchy with.

4121
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:10,230
It's like somebody who's like
putting on like a a a boxing glove.

4122
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:12,240
It's like it's like a velvet glove.

4123
02:06:12,241 --> 02:06:13,890
It's like someone
punching you with velvet.

4124
02:06:13,891 --> 02:06:14,071
It's,

4125
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:15,240
there's still punching me.

4126
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:18,780
That's why it feels like shit when you
get around people who are inflicting

4127
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:20,370
their aggression on you at some kind of,

4128
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:22,830
I think it's ultimately
a good lesson though.

4129
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:23,850
It's told to me less than that.

4130
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:25,043
There's,

4131
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:29,090
there's no real one ideology that's
got it nailed and you're going to have

4132
02:06:29,091 --> 02:06:30,950
weirdos in every single group.

4133
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:31,750
And the,

4134
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:35,540
the real thing that we have to all sort
of come to some sort of an agreement on

4135
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:37,430
is that we're all part of this organism,

4136
02:06:37,460 --> 02:06:37,730
right?

4137
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:37,971
That's,

4138
02:06:37,971 --> 02:06:39,140
that's what we keep getting to.

4139
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:42,890
The only way to fix this thing is if we
all really do have some sort of ultimate

4140
02:06:42,891 --> 02:06:43,161
power.

4141
02:06:43,161 --> 02:06:46,790
Like if technology continues to
exponentially increase the point where the

4142
02:06:46,791 --> 02:06:50,620
average person can just hit
the universe reset switch is,

4143
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:51,740
there's too much power.

4144
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:52,250
There's just,

4145
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:57,250
it becomes some crazy singularity moment
where the average person has waiting,

4146
02:06:58,511 --> 02:07:03,050
you mean the power that you have and
your phone is so indescribable to someone

4147
02:07:03,051 --> 02:07:04,160
who lived in ancient Rome.

4148
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:04,730
It's,

4149
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:05,720
it's indescribable.

4150
02:07:05,990 --> 02:07:08,810
And if it continues that
way and somehow or another,

4151
02:07:08,811 --> 02:07:12,710
the cat gets out of the bag and
they invent some way to literally,

4152
02:07:12,740 --> 02:07:16,730
everybody has the power to stop life
as we know it at any given time.

4153
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:17,260
Yeah.

4154
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:17,811
It was the oldest.

4155
02:07:17,811 --> 02:07:22,811
The only way everybody looks at everybody
as just as important is that it's

4156
02:07:23,121 --> 02:07:24,860
really almost the only
way to cure the disease.

4157
02:07:24,861 --> 02:07:26,840
That is the craziness of humanity,

4158
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:28,430
the craziness of humanities,

4159
02:07:28,431 --> 02:07:31,430
like this weird thing where we can,

4160
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:33,320
we can be to human beings,

4161
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:38,530
can either be madly love or the best
of friends are so appreciative of each

4162
02:07:38,801 --> 02:07:43,690
other or at each other's throats trying
to kill each other with their fingers.

4163
02:07:43,691 --> 02:07:47,770
There's no real present shit like trying
to hit each other in the head with

4164
02:07:47,771 --> 02:07:48,604
rocks fighting.

4165
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:53,610
It could easily happen one way or
the other and the amount of times,

4166
02:07:53,611 --> 02:07:56,530
and it happens the
right way is incredible.

4167
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:58,870
If you look at the numbers
that we're dealing with,

4168
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:01,660
300 plus million people in this country,

4169
02:08:01,870 --> 02:08:06,700
the amount of kindness and the amount
of happiness is off the charts,

4170
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:07,050
right?

4171
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,500
Just not salacious.

4172
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:09,700
It doesn't draw us in.

4173
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,200
It doesn't scare us,

4174
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:12,580
so we don't focus on it.

4175
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:14,500
And by not focusing on it in his stead,

4176
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:19,501
focusing on fear or focusing
on hay or focusing on blame,

4177
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:24,930
we sorta perpetrate it and the more people
could focus on figuring out a way to

4178
02:08:28,301 --> 02:08:32,410
just interface as nicely with all
the people around you as possible,

4179
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:35,680
as friendly and easily with all
the people around you as possible.

4180
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:37,810
The more you can figure
out a way to do that,

4181
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:41,020
the better off the whole
planet is in a whipple,

4182
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:43,180
it'll rip and there's going
to be people that violate it.

4183
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:44,830
It's going to be people
that don't play along.

4184
02:08:44,831 --> 02:08:48,460
It's going to be built to try to exploit
it and fucked up just a man or man.

4185
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,200
Eventually we'll figure that out.

4186
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,940
Eventually we'll overwhelm that.

4187
02:08:51,941 --> 02:08:56,941
There's a new ethic and a new ethic
is brought about by this way that we

4188
02:08:57,101 --> 02:08:57,940
communicate now.

4189
02:08:57,970 --> 02:08:58,570
That's right.

4190
02:08:58,570 --> 02:08:59,890
That doesn't exist before

4191
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:00,140
and,

4192
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:03,030
and I think also you have to become,

4193
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:06,870
you have to become a person of action
like your friend or you're talking about.

4194
02:09:06,871 --> 02:09:07,704
He's like,

4195
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:10,290
he's helping people
get water in the Congo.

4196
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:10,800
Dude,

4197
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,750
anyone listening can become that guy.

4198
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:17,550
Anyone listening right now can start
taking steps in the direction of doing

4199
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:18,210
that.

4200
02:09:18,210 --> 02:09:19,140
And if you don't have time,

4201
02:09:19,141 --> 02:09:20,460
go to fight for the forgotten.

4202
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:22,200
Just Google fight for the forgotten.

4203
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:24,240
I think it's fight for the forgotten.org.

4204
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:24,370
I'll,

4205
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:29,370
I'll pull it up right now cause he's cool
as far as what I didn't say anything.

4206
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,550
So Jamie did didn't,

4207
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:32,810
um,

4208
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:34,620
I think it's fight for the forgotten.com.

4209
02:09:34,621 --> 02:09:35,430
Yes it is.

4210
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:36,870
It's fight for the forgotten.com.

4211
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,480
One word fight for the forgotten.com.

4212
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:40,680
Just a genuine,

4213
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:42,570
real cool guy.

4214
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,010
A real sweet guy.

4215
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:45,030
And you know,

4216
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:49,020
I mean he kind of throws into the face
the idea that a lot of people have about

4217
02:09:49,021 --> 02:09:50,010
him and may fighters too.

4218
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:51,500
They think they're brutes and,

4219
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,070
and you know mean people.

4220
02:09:53,071 --> 02:09:54,180
He couldn't be kinder.

4221
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:54,421
I mean,

4222
02:09:54,421 --> 02:09:56,190
look at this picture of him
hanging out with these pygmies.

4223
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:57,361
