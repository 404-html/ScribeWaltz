1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,880
Freak bitches.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,750
Yeah,
like the duke boys are supposed to be

3
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:08,900
like these heart of gold moonshiners
don't want to fuck their cousin.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,400
I'm not buying it.
I would be like,

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,350
we're cousins.
Look at this bitch.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,150
She's nobody's fucking daisy.
Okay.

7
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:20,010
She can't get a goddamn boyfriend.
She's running around her because she

8
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:20,760
likes.
She cleaned.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,250
She likes cletus.
She could.

10
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,060
She make it more obvious.
She's cut the legs off short so you can

11
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:29,660
just finger her swing.
She's there for you.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,170
She's.
She's hacking in short.

13
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,700
It's like no girl.
Ever ever done that ever.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,450
Even now it's like God damn.
And she was doing it when no one was

15
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,140
doing it and she was wearing a men's
shirts like she just got done fucking

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,070
touch a man's shirt on like your shirt.
She could be wearing your shirt buttons

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
down to the fifth button.
Tied off on the bottom.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,910
Come on son.
She's got a man's shirt on.

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:58,330
Why is that super hot girl have almost.
That ain't number one.

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,040
Bonus number two,
dare you.

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,440
You don't even know your history.
So we're the number two boats.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,320
That's,
that's him.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,820
And it's been a while.
Tom Wolf,

24
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:09,290
PAC man,
that hair.

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,830
Those are the number two.
No,

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,860
these are still.
People Go God,

27
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,240
look at those shorts.
Cry.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,610
She was hot pink.
This makes me nervous.

29
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,870
Just looking at him.
You could see their fucking junk in

30
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,590
their pants.
Yeah,

31
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,730
they're dicks was hard as rocks.
Oh my God.

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,640
And they're not even related to her
because not.

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,350
Does she have camel toe on that?
She's got at the beginning of one.

34
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,600
Just the beginning of badge.
Outline everything.

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,110
You could see the slice.
Yeah.

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,490
They had grandma panties back then.
Oh,

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,990
guess who doesn't care about me?

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,580
Are you a panties guy?
What do you mean you like?

39
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,300
I like when girls with dogs don't like
granny panties.

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,650
I think girlfriend.
Nothing.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,780
Say it.
Somebody got

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,560
constraining yourself.
So they were moonshiners with a heart of

43
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:04,490
gold but never got any pussy.
And they were beautiful man.

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,150
Beautiful men and their hot cousin.
It was a show where no one fucked.

45
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,810
It was the most ridiculous world.
That was way more ridiculous in the fact

46
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:14,540
that they were shooting arrows with,
with lightning,

47
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,810
with a dynamite at the end of it,
and they didn't have guns because they

48
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,860
did time for fucking running moonshine,
but the man should let them do what they

49
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:25,730
do down here and Hazard County.
We got our own rules,

50
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,183
man.
That was nobody.

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,610
Nobody fucked.
Yeah.

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,820
You think fucking boss hog would have
had a slew of hookers.

53
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,890
Did she should have all do that,
move that show now in reality like this

54
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:37,730
is what it would be like.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,690
Well,
let's think about her.

56
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,610
She was the only hot girl in the show
ever.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
Look who she should have been one of the
grossest women of all time.

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,130
That's his wife.
How dare you.

59
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,790
How dare you.
He would have been here for a woman in a

60
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,010
gray color.
Fucking or he would have been fucking

61
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,270
her uncle.
Jesse would've fucked.

62
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,980
Everybody would fucked to cletus
scooter.

63
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,010
Boss Hog definitely would.
I definitely would have had her on the

64
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,860
payroll.
She'd been right next to him.

65
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,140
That cadillac with the bull horns on the
front of it,

66
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,670
but she came on to the other guy.
Oh,

67
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,740
she was always coming on as gay as fuck.
And he was comfortable by it because

68
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:12,700
Jesus was strong in his life.
That's why cletus didn't want to admit

69
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,110
it.
When I was a kid,

70
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,890
my dad was rich and he would carry like
$15,000 around in his wallet.

71
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,150
He's like ball and big money,
you know?

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,090
Did he have like crazy shoes?
And like he wore,

73
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,060
he wore a lot of like stupid looking
silk shirts and shit.

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,650
He looked like some kind of decadent
Roman emperor and he always had like big

75
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,190
orgies at his house to.
Who'd you dad is cool.

76
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,290
He was cool.
What did he do for a living?

77
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,080
He was pretty much a con man.
Whoa.

78
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,430
Really?
Where,

79
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,240
uh,
he started as a diploma mill called

80
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,480
Lasalle University.
Did you?

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,090
Shit,
I don't believe you,

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,953
but.

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,930
No,
no,

84
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,020
they uh,
he just started.

85
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,740
He started a fake university degree
mill,

86
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,120
you know,
I mean,

87
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,110
it kind of,
you could say in some ways maybe it was

88
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,880
fake or maybe it was just a precursor to
things like Phoenix University of

89
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,050
Phoenix that just,
you know,

90
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,550
but his real problem wasn't the school
it,

91
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,820
they've never.
The government never went after him and

92
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,350
said,
you're running a scam school.

93
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,910
The government went after him for,
for,

94
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:22,300
you know,
committing mail fraud and for um,

95
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,440
a tax evasion was the big one because he
didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes

96
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,220
they felt otherwise.
So he ended up in jail for um,

97
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,490
you know,
three or four years over that.

98
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,320
Well actually it was sentenced to five
years,

99
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,930
but then he claimed to be a drug addict
even though he wasn't,

100
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,190
never did drugs and they gave him some
time off his sentence from enrolling in

101
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,690
a drug treatment program.

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,740
God,
that's awesome.

103
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,860
He was always looking for the angles.
I wish I had that ability like my dad

104
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,940
did.
Is he still around?

105
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,043
No,
he's dead.

106
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
Is your mom still around?
Yes.

107
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,740
When you talk to your mom about him,
like,

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,410
like how long were they together?
Uh,

109
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,260
you know,
I think about maybe eight or nine years.

110
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,480
Wow.
What a,

111
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,940
what a blessed be like to be a woman and
to have a child with a crazy man who's

112
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,470
running around just scamming people and
hustling.

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,960
You know what I mean?
It wasn't like he was really scamming

114
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,780
people.
He was actually helping people to scam

115
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:18,160
employers if point they know that the
degree is fucking bogus.

116
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,010
Right.
That's a good point actually.

117
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,300
So they.
And actually it was crazy because when

118
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,380
it was exposed there was like
congressman and you know,

119
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,920
uh,
they got their degree,

120
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,930
like ceos of major companies that all
had degrees from Lasalle University.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,490
Super successful even with fake degrees.
Yeah.

122
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,870
That's hilarious.
Well,

123
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,000
you know what I mean.
Degrees are bullshit anyway.

124
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,420
Well,
they certainly are not the only limiting

125
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,310
factor in someone's competency.
Yeah.

126
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,720
I mean,
especially not for like business or

127
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,980
something science.
Maybe that's a different story.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,660
Oh,
for sure.

129
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,430
Medicine.
Yeah.

130
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,820
You want a real doctor?
I don't want,

131
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,640
you know,
a doctor with a Lasalle medical degree

132
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,750
with an incomplete ideas.
I don't think he,

133
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,603
I don't think he,
uh,

134
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,600
he,
he issued medical degrees though.

135
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,670
Well,
either way,

136
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:05,150
that's not the most egregious example of
someone being a con person.

137
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,150
That's not.
I mean,

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,560
uh,
there's probably way worse things,

139
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,120
but you know what I mean.
Yeah.

140
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,610
But he was interesting guy though.
Yeah,

141
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:14,820
there he is.
Robocop.

142
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,050
Wow.
He had a dope outfit to the new robocop.

143
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,920
I never saw.
I wasn't really into the new outfit that

144
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,360
you just didn't see.

145
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,280
This is the new one.
Did you watch the new one?

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,300
No,
I didn't know either.

147
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,010
I think that is the new one.
I met that dude.

148
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

149
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,340
See why?
Why does he have his hands covered?

150
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,210
I'm gonna.
Chop your hands off.

151
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,130
We've got to have your hands covered.
How come your mouth isn't covered

152
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,941
either?
I'll shoot you right in.

153
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,950
The mouth.
Will have identified the weak spots.

154
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,420
Yeah.
You don't want to have a,

155
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:43,570
an exposed mouth hole.
Yeah.

156
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,840
Why would you ever have your exposed
mouth?

157
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,630
Yeah.
He's got his whole face.

158
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,830
His whole faith is ready to be shot
because I'm assuming there's a brain

159
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,640
back there,
right?

160
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,340
You've got skin,
so there's no.

161
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,810
I'm gonna.
Shoot the right through your eyeballs.

162
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,280
I your brain.
So stupid.

163
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,830
You know,
like he's got like a regular human

164
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,030
mouth.
Why would you have that?

165
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,730
When everything else is protected,
you can't project.

166
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,710
You'll have some sort of a speaker on
the outside.

167
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,000
There's so many veins and important
arteries that run around the neck here.

168
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,520
How's he going to eat with no teeth
going to get shot in the face with a

169
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,920
Canon in Detroit to do,
you know,

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,590
and it seems like the best place to put
it in today.

171
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:19,071
It is.
Yeah,

172
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,290
right.
No one seems to have seen this movie.

173
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,760
It must have been a robo flop.

174
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah,
he out.

175
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,280
He had it.
He delivered it.

176
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,250
You were stunned and now you're
defensive and now it's not true.

177
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:37,970
I actually went and saw the movie and I
eat a lot of popcorn during it.

178
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,160
I was a Robo slop.
Come on,

179
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:44,340
Robo stop.
He doubled

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,590
Queen Anne House in here.
Somebody grab us a Robo.

181
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,290
Oh,
get your guys' expectations are too high

182
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,950
here.
Robo.

183
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,390
Putting,
battling,

184
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,030
gross paddle,
but red badges.

185
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,020
One to year.
I lost one to me.

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,953
He did.
Oh,

187
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,880
how?
Why do you keep making do with

188
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,613
what I do?
I go,

189
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,830
how would you like me to react?
I'll do whatever you like.

190
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,690
I don't know.

191
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,730
Oh,
la La,

192
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,090
la,
la La la La.

193
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,620
Oh no,
that's the pun.

194
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:28,920
Laugh right now.
Could you imagine

195
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,240
cracks upon onstage and the whole cargo?

196
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,080
Ah,
LA,

197
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,820
la,
la,

198
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,653
la.

199
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,740
That would be awesome.
Dude.

200
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,450
You're fucking manifested.
You better be careful what you wish for

201
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,270
full,
but you wishful young Tony.
