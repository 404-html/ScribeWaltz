1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,823
Okay.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,490
And we're back to wrap it up.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,720
We just stepped outside.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,510
Sacrifice the sacred
plant to the fire gods.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,410
If you try to just put Brian
in a better state of mind,

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,950
I think you feel like a lot of
people are attacking you and um,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,730
I,

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,080
I get attacked a lot nowadays.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,010
I know you do.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,150
I talked about that earlier,

11
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:33,110
but we're not attacking you.

12
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:37,280
And one of the things that I think
that's real important that I brought up

13
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,900
earlier is B,

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,870
be generous to a point
where it's indefensible.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,180
Be Generous to a point where you know,

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,290
you people know that what you're doing
is you're doing it all for the right

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:48,610
reason,

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:48,960
I think.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,000
I think if you're a listener,

20
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,950
you know that already
what I did for comedy,

21
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,230
and that was the one thing I started
screaming at Dunkin was like,

22
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,030
you don't understand how
much I do for comics.

23
00:00:56,031 --> 00:01:00,140
My free time is devoted to 100% of
doing shit for free for other comics.

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,711
Now,

25
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,790
if they will tell you what,

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,200
I will tell you this though,

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,770
there's a lot of clubs over the
years that have had this theory that,

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:06,951
well,

29
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,130
you're lucky to be getting the
stage time and a part of comedians.

30
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,050
We don't respect ourselves.

31
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,360
We were like,

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,050
absolutely,

33
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,830
you're absolutely right.

34
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:13,790
But the other part is like,

35
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:14,391
fuck yeah,

36
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:18,400
but I'm also not driving to pass a dean
yet fucking editing audio software for

37
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,621
you.

38
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm not fucking doing all this shit.

39
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,130
That's not the same as saying like,

40
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:22,371
yeah,

41
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,204
you should be listening

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,360
what you're doing.

43
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,730
You know?

44
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,020
I mean,

45
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,351
listen,

46
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,161
this is what you're doing.

47
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,410
You set up a beautiful thing right there.

48
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,280
They ain't bad.

49
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,420
There's nothing wrong with that.

50
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,231
And you know,

51
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,980
when I asked you about how many shows
do you want just to sort of eliminate

52
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,240
people as to what you're doing?

53
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,020
Okay.

54
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,920
I like what you're doing.

55
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,080
I like a lot of shows that
come out of what you're doing,

56
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
but I think that we have to always be
very careful that if there's any money

57
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,550
that's ever taking place in,

58
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,770
in any sort of a thing
where you're selling comedy,

59
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,100
comedians get super defensive and super
sensitive when you're selling a show and

60
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,360
the comics are going to go up and do
their standup and they're not going to get

61
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,320
compensated from it,

62
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,510
but yet they know that
money is exchanging hands

63
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,160
a show that people didn't
use it as a workout room.

64
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:07,350
For the most part I,

65
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,630
these are people that just like fucking
around like not actually like I'm

66
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,171
selling in.

67
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:14,710
Plus the fact that there's like seven
or eight people usually on each one of

68
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:15,544
these shows.

69
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,320
I think it's a little
different than if I were like,

70
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:17,801
hey me,

71
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:20,440
Ari and you are doing a show at
the Hollywood and scales and stuff.

72
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,290
While you wouldn't have it.

73
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,251
First of all,

74
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:26,120
the reason why you get to control this
money at all is because I gave it to you

75
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,780
because I don't,

76
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,290
I can you to rent that place out.

77
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:30,951
And since then I'm like,

78
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,161
look,

79
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,320
I'll give you all my money from my shows.

80
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,570
Right?

81
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,040
So you chose,

82
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,740
we'll sell it.

83
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:35,910
You do.

84
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,170
Yeah.

85
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:36,801
It shows I do,

86
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,360
or 90% of the shows that go on there.

87
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,810
Well,

88
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,920
I do them every week.

89
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,450
You say you're not lot.

90
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,051
Okay,

91
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:42,950
let's onsite nineties.

92
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,940
It's more than half.

93
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:44,571
More than half.

94
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,850
And that's more than pays the rent.

95
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,450
Right.

96
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:47,721
The,

97
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:52,070
the idea being that I think
when a comic knows that you're,

98
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,530
even if you're only making
150 bucks to a comic,

99
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,011
that's like,

100
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,770
why doesn't he make 50 and give us 50?

101
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,200
That's how they think
you're selling standup

102
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,541
comedy.

103
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,374
This is why,

104
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,750
if,

105
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,160
if,

106
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,530
uh,

107
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,230
the fact that you guys
are doing all this to me,

108
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm like,

109
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,641
all right,

110
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,420
bottom line.

111
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,130
Each one of these shows for going in
there and being there for five hours for

112
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,560
going in there and putting
together all these comics,

113
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,100
uh,

114
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,430
putting,

115
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,950
putting up advertising
and making posters for it.

116
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,401
Uh,

117
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:18,751
all the,

118
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:19,510
all this,

119
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,343
all this,

120
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,281
all this shit.

121
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:26,281
If it's not worth $150 is not
worth $150 and I'm not doing it.

122
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,680
If I'm getting this much
trouble for 150 bucks,

123
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,371
fuck bucket,

124
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,250
then I'm not doing,

125
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:31,631
hold on,

126
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,020
hold on.

127
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,070
A 15 bucks a ticket,

128
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,210
150 bucks,

129
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,210
even at 60% I'd say maybe on average after
I'm saying the average after tax that

130
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,671
I get after paying the host and comics
or whatever is usually about 150 bucks.

131
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,501
Well,

132
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:47,681
look,

133
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,550
if you spending money paying the comics
and you feel good about that and you

134
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:51,791
can,

135
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,061
you know,

136
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,350
you could sit down with them and say,

137
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:53,561
look,

138
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:53,681
I'm,

139
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,050
because you know what it
the only reason what it is,

140
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,680
it's whoever you heard it from or
whatever whispers you heard it from.

141
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,900
And Dunkin for some reason
who's been on the show?

142
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,420
I think $15 yeah,

143
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:04,771
but dunk,

144
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:05,740
it's been on one show.

145
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:06,400
I like it.

146
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,151
We'd like to 15 bucks.

147
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:07,990
We go to the comedy store.

148
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,550
It's just like,

149
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,320
well it's something nominal so I get it.

150
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,573
I get it man.

151
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,180
I get it.

152
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,560
But I'm just saying that after that.

153
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,670
I know what you're saying.

154
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,720
You're saying that you,

155
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,561
it's not worth it to me.

156
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,590
I don't give her saying you doing a good
thing by creating the spot for them to

157
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:23,800
warm up and they don't appreciate that
and that if you're not at least getting

158
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,390
something out of it like 150 bucks,

159
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,530
you're not going to just doing it.

160
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,131
Honestly.

161
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,360
You know how hard it is,

162
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:32,800
like devoting like almost every Friday
to being somewhere and on fact of that

163
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,070
being on there for like five or
six hours and that's called a job.

164
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,020
I completely understand that.

165
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,310
The worst night ever,

166
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,540
but two comedians,

167
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,020
they're also doing a job too and
they're also selling something valuable.

168
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:47,710
Their work in their materials and they
know that a unit though you are putting

169
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,760
together a promotion,

170
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,920
the promoter shouldn't be the only
one that's getting money out of it.

171
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,070
No,

172
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,903
and they don't.

173
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,510
Well they,

174
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,691
well,

175
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,770
we need to work that out,

176
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,820
that that should be an,

177
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,900
you know what it should be?

178
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,990
It should be each one of the
comics that come on it either goes,

179
00:04:58,991 --> 00:04:59,171
Hey,

180
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,340
can I get $20 I'm like,

181
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,940
okay,

182
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,700
I'm not criminal.

183
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah.

184
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,620
Well you,

185
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,940
you want them to ask for money.

186
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,280
If you are somebody that that are like,

187
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:06,581
no,

188
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:07,840
I think I need to be paid.

189
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,360
I don't think I need
to deserve comparison,

190
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,230
but compared to me,

191
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,420
I will do almost any show for free.

192
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,030
I never care about fucking money at all.

193
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,541
Okay,

194
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:16,871
Brian,

195
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,500
but your $450 what's that?

196
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,100
Hold on.

197
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
Just so you know,

198
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,930
$30 to an MC is 20 paid tickets after the,

199
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,481
I get it.

200
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,120
But for comedy,

201
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,450
I don't want to get
paid for the most part,

202
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't think that you need to be gay.

203
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:30,381
I have fun.

204
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,020
So why don't you give
up his mind to people?

205
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Why don't you give up the money that
people give him 20 bucks a piece.

206
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,780
I'm 40 bucks is what I do.

207
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,870
But you have the deal happen.

208
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:38,501
Yes,

209
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,450
I haven't got why do you
think first time we did that,

210
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:41,284
why do you think that

211
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,830
pose in any comics that I know that
many people have asked for money,

212
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,250
but just because of poor doesn't mean
there's less or more deserving of that

213
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:51,620
money.

214
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,530
No one's five to a spot for 15 minutes.

215
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,960
I don't care if you do a
spot for 50 minutes to Joe.

216
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,860
I don't deserve that or less than him.

217
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,480
No,

218
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:58,990
no,

219
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,823
no one.

220
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,780
The only time I really ever
pay somebody as if I know,

221
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,310
uh,

222
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,143
uh,

223
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,730
for,

224
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,660
for these shows,

225
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,110
right.

226
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,840
If I know this person would appreciate it,

227
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,111
you know,

228
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,531
like the like,

229
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:09,860
dude,

230
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,820
thank you so much man.

231
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,151
You know,

232
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,800
I fucking have no money
and stuff like that.

233
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
But when it's somebody
that's pretty comfortable,

234
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,071
like,

235
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:18,570
like I feel like I'm
very average pace signup.

236
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,330
Like if it's something like
me cause security cutter,

237
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,730
I don't want you to pay me and I,

238
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not doing it for money and this show,

239
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,890
this show is always been like when,

240
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,341
hey,

241
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,630
I got this room in the ice house,

242
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,161
you want to do it.

243
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,470
It's like a workout room so I don't,

244
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,080
I consider this more like,

245
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,660
do you want to come do a really
good audience at a workout room?

246
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,621
Well then here's,

247
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:38,070
here's what you should do now to charge.

248
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,800
No cover told him until the ice house,

249
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,910
hey give me 50 bucks,

250
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,640
I'll pack this place,

251
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,100
charge no cover and there was no problem.

252
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:43,521
Absolutely.

253
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,354
That's a great idea.

254
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,430
Great idea.

255
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,660
Because you know why I took my door,

256
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,820
I'm not sure.

257
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm not in it for money and
I'd keep it as low as possible.

258
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:55,400
Anybody who asks for a copy and give
it to him and I still get the rest of

259
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:55,810
charity,

260
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,210
not names,

261
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,260
I don't want the responsibility.

262
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,290
Somebody else is going to
completely do the desk.

263
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,690
A desk squash show there.

264
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,420
It's very difficult.

265
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,290
[inaudible] you're not in it for money
and then say you need a certain amount of

266
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,820
money or you won't do it because it's,

267
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,750
in my opinion,

268
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,170
uh,

269
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,560
if,

270
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,150
if I had to be asked,

271
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:11,540
hey,

272
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,160
every Friday you have work,

273
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:13,810
you put them through it.

274
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,300
Yeah.

275
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,680
If you have to go here,

276
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,300
you have to sit here and record,

277
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,153
you know,

278
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:18,981
and then,

279
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,070
and then in DC,

280
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,300
those podcasts usually go from
like three to five hours a lot.

281
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,500
The podcasts because some people don't.

282
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,071
Oh,

283
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,730
those pockets [inaudible] to put it
all in the hands of the Ice House,

284
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,680
give the ice house to contact numbers
for all the people that want to go.

285
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,480
That's what I do.

286
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,001
That's what I did.

287
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:33,834
Have him pay it.

288
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,940
That's what I do whenever
I don't want to do it,

289
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:36,261
I'll pay it.

290
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,630
They pay their headline is 100 bucks.

291
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:38,510
I was always helps people.

292
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,390
He kind of was always a thing,

293
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,560
a hundred bucks for headliners,

294
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,160
except for those fucking money they
have the on the staff and they have,

295
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,530
you mean they have to.

296
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,430
It's true.

297
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,100
That place especially has got so much
history behind it and the place had been

298
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,420
around for 50 plus years.

299
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,440
It's such a great place,

300
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,740
but I think that we gotta be real
considerate of of comics and the fact that

301
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,280
comics have a legitimate gripe when it
comes to worrying about someone making

302
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:04,521
money.

303
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:04,671
I mean,

304
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,930
it has to be explained,

305
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:06,764
I think in a,

306
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,390
in a thoughtful manner and not in this
knee jerk sort of angry Yeley sorta

307
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,090
shouty type away other people when you
don't even come to me and talk to me.

308
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,410
Well we're friends.

309
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,090
Fuck you've Duncan Trussell oh,

310
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:20,811
come on man.

311
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,640
See this is,

312
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,130
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

313
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,350
This is fuck Dunkin.

314
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,310
Stop Man,

315
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:25,850
stop.

316
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,420
Look,

317
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,440
this is this kind of why because it
tells you on a podcast because he's,

318
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,010
you know what?

319
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm just done.

320
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,310
I've done so much for that dude and
he just pretty much attacked me.

321
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,731
I was like,

322
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,200
fuck him.

323
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Well,

324
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,171
you know what?

325
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,340
If he had no point,

326
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,740
no place to stabbed with a pencil,

327
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,450
shit playing.

328
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,570
If he had no point.

329
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,810
If you have no place to
to talk to you about this,

330
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,910
there was no argument
there then it would be,

331
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,110
it would have no impact.

332
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,530
The reason why it has somewhat of an
impact is because it is an arguable

333
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,190
position.

334
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,290
Is there any ever a way to talk
about it where someone says,

335
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
let's just say this argument,

336
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:55,500
say,

337
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,741
Hey,

338
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:59,430
so and so you should pay this much money
to so and so and instead of going like,

339
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,290
what the fuck I do this and
this instead of going that go,

340
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,100
well,

341
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,000
let me think about that.

342
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,240
Why should I or shouldn't I pay this
person this much money or less money or

343
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,220
more money and just having a
nice conversation about it.

344
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,060
Yeah.

345
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,720
Now I,

346
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
that's why I don't think
it's worth it to me.

347
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,640
Well I think you took on a job then you
didn't quite know how much time it was

348
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,160
going to take.

349
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,500
I do take on stage.

350
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,490
How do you want to call the people and
schedule The times and have them come in?

351
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:28,491
It is how many $15 I went from going
to doing open mikes with a lot of these

352
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,940
people that I have on these shows or
just going to like different clubs and

353
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,540
doing stage time and never doing
real shows with these people.

354
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,781
Right.

355
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,230
You know,

356
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,500
so when I decided to
take on this crazy shit,

357
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,191
it wasn't more like,

358
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:41,820
Hey,

359
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,950
I got this access to this room.

360
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,490
I can make a show and we can all together
and we could have a show once a week.

361
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:48,270
It'd be cool.

362
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,820
And so you wouldn't think of
it as a financial decision?

363
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,020
Never financial fun.

364
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,883
Absolutely.

365
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,820
One of the,

366
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,770
one of the things we were talking about
that conversation with magical and you

367
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:57,780
and they're at the ice house though,

368
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,330
those nights where like one of the
things we were all saying is like,

369
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,440
and we'll just take the money,

370
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,760
not not them,

371
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,623
we will,

372
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,673
it will be us,

373
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,340
but how much,

374
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,820
how many texts did you have to sell
to get $150 at 15 bucks apiece?

375
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
Average average.

376
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,960
I think that thing holds 75 or something
like that and sometimes they stuffing

377
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,190
10 so 10 people and you only get,

378
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,350
you'll take taxes out of that.

379
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,550
So you only get 60% of that.

380
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,690
Huh?

381
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,780
I'm trying to think how many tickets you
would have to sell to go over that 150

382
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,030
mark that you normally,

383
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,930
I have no idea.

384
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,441
I don't know.

385
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:26,790
I don't get 100% of the door.

386
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,750
You got 60% of the door.

387
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,860
I think so something like that.

388
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,750
Do I know what to do about any of this
shit anyway because I think I'm literally

389
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,700
don't want to talk about,

390
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,560
I made a mistake as well and I just handed
it over to you cause the first couple

391
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,660
of shows when he's getting half of that.

392
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,950
But when I just handed it over to you,

393
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,700
I should have said let's sit down and
figure out where this should go and that

394
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,070
we should have the rent
paid for and the insurance

395
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,533
I,

396
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,830
I,

397
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,000
to me it's not even worth it to me.

398
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,470
I'll go,

399
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:51,900
I'll go.

400
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,550
I'll go somewhere else for once a week.

401
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,400
And do comedy somewhere else and enjoying
myself and not get paid for it and

402
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,200
just have fun and not dead.

403
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,220
Last thing I do is like,

404
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,170
thank you so much for letting
me have this stage time.

405
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,430
Fucking you should pay me.

406
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,740
What the fuck I might talk about it.

407
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:03,880
No,

408
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,070
no.

409
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,580
That's not the way people are saying it.

410
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,180
Then assign one of those guys comedians

411
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,090
you feel attacked all the time.

412
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,890
Anything attack by fucking Jane.

413
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,890
More getting attacked by Duncan Trussell.

414
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,020
I'm getting attacked by fuck.

415
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,540
Just blockchain warrants or
whatever and this never a problem.

416
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,480
Tack by everybody.

417
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:24,991
What does that mean?

418
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:25,824
Attacked?

419
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,060
What does that even mean?

420
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,141
Not Exactly.

421
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,010
What does that mean?

422
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,940
They're saying a thing that I
liked about something to do.

423
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm going to fucking do this to you.

424
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,100
I'm going to get that to you.

425
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,480
There's a patio.

426
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,670
There's a path with least
resistance out there.

427
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:41,760
I know it's kind of not bringing it
up on a podcast and getting into it so

428
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,650
everyone knows about this
and thanks a lot guys.

429
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,170
What are you talking about,

430
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,750
Ryan?

431
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,100
What are you talking about man?

432
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,010
You make it impossible to talk to you
about anything when you react this way,

433
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,440
turn this into some crazy
situation that it's not,

434
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,221
you know,

435
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:53,650
I,

436
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,071
if you,

437
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,410
I can understand you don't
want it to book a comedy show,

438
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,190
I can understand that being a
tremendous time consuming thing.

439
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,811
Well listen,

440
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:06,010
let's all talk about this and figure out
a way where we can have a show that the

441
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,410
ice house books let's
they're professionals.

442
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,483
That's what they do.

443
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,570
What am I doing is I'm married to
an ice house chronicles and uh,

444
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,170
I will make it just,

445
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,004
you know,

446
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,873
some other thing.

447
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,620
I'll make it just like a green room while
somebody else can do the room and I'll

448
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:20,800
have nothing to do with that room.

449
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,260
So Brian,

450
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,520
Brian,

451
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,240
just so you know,

452
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,150
this reaction we're getting from you is
the normal reaction we get from you when

453
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:25,900
he brings something up.

454
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,260
So does that make it more likely
for us to bring things up to you?

455
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,710
Are less likely to be open and honest?

456
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,490
I tell you why.

457
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,360
Because honestly,

458
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,470
I am so fucking busy that I don't
even need to deal with any of this.

459
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,340
You know?

460
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,320
I would rather just do this podcast,

461
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,154
be happy,

462
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,630
do everyone else's podcast,

463
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:44,770
be happy and not have something that's
such a big deal of that I thought was

464
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:47,380
just helping friends out
to you got a good point.

465
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,700
I think you've got a good point in that.

466
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,590
I think it is a lot more responsibility
and a little extra thing that you have

467
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:57,870
to chew on every week and I think it can
still be done and done through the ice

468
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:58,181
house.

469
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,030
This way the icehouse
pays people and we'll,

470
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,560
we'll set aside a chunk of it so you
can get paid for running the icehouse

471
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,230
chronicle tickets,

472
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,163
plus pay the guy,

473
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,651
you know what,

474
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:11,484
what,

475
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,700
or I can just do the exact same thing
I was doing and any comic that wants to

476
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,500
get paid,

477
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,970
we'll tell,

478
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:17,290
well,

479
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,550
I'll give them my man.

480
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,230
You can't ask people to ask for money.

481
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,060
You know what all I do at the time,

482
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,331
I go,

483
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:22,511
hey,

484
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,230
you want some cash?

485
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,681
And then they go,

486
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,514
no dude.

487
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:24,911
And I'm like,

488
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:25,540
okay,

489
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:25,811
okay.

490
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:26,471
Well those people,

491
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,310
how many times did that happen?

492
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,750
A lot more than you would think.

493
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,603
All right,

494
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,270
well get out of here.

495
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,261
Don't worry about it.

496
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,420
It's not stupid talking about it.

497
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,230
You don't want to become one of
those guys that doesn't pay people.

498
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,250
I don't even feel like talking about it.

499
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:42,084
I didn't know.

500
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,390
That's why it's hard to bring up.

501
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:44,860
That's why I say I'd like to get paid.

502
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:45,694
It's a hard thing to break,

503
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,360
but it isn't boring to me.

504
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,690
Podcasts be entertaining.

505
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,011
Not like,

506
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:51,161
Hey,

507
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,300
let's bust open Brian and fucking see
why he's thinking about financial shit.

508
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,260
No one's trying to bust you.

509
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:56,620
Open,

510
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,060
open on a podcast with,

511
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,260
we were at a fucking restaurant.

512
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,370
We could talk about all this.

513
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,290
I don't feel like doing
wrap this on a podcast.

514
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:02,890
Sorry,

515
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,350
I bring stuff up through Paychex.

516
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,440
Let's talk about,

517
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,630
very understandable,

518
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,591
very understandable,

519
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:08,891
Brian,

520
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,340
but you,

521
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,790
do you understand that you get into this
like really angry defensive position

522
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,320
with people that aren't
even attacking you?

523
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,133
Okay.

524
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Do you understand that
you do that sometimes?

525
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,521
Listen,

526
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:18,910
man,

527
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,230
it's avoidable.

528
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,940
Sometimes you can talk in a,

529
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,110
in a rational tone.

530
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,550
I mean,

531
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,190
and I've been guilty of it
as well happened in her life.

532
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,180
It's easily avoidable with
like seven people right now.

533
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,590
Some of it to needle though.

534
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,251
Brian,

535
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,480
what you're doing is a great thing.

536
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,700
What are you doing with your
podcast network for those guys?

537
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,280
I'll drive out there just to do it and
what you said about like Freddy Lockhart,

538
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,440
like needing the network to get them on.

539
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,011
That is true.

540
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:45,690
It is all true.

541
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,481
It should,

542
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,830
they lead with you every time.

543
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,011
It's like,

544
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:48,221
Hey,

545
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:48,671
just so you know,

546
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:49,660
you do a lot of great things for me,

547
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:50,770
but I like to bring up this one thing.

548
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,890
If it's without help,

549
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,090
if you don't,

550
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,120
if you guys don't think that what I do
helps comedy or comics does your reading

551
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,690
as we just saw it as you must hate you,

552
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,533
right?

553
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,910
If you think there's a
better death squad idea,

554
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,150
I will gladly change the name of desk
quad to something just to make you happy.

555
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,660
You should do whatever desk.

556
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,271
What is you,

557
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,470
you're a part of death squad.

558
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,191
You know,

559
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,510
all of our friends are part of desk.

560
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,360
Why the fact that you and
Duncan don't talk or no,

561
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,030
it's disgusting.

562
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,560
You know what that's called,

563
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:19,370
trimming fat.

564
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,130
He's done a few things in the past
that I've let go and you know what,

565
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,001
I don't need that guy.

566
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,340
I've helped that dude so
many times and you know,

567
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
I mean been on his podcast once.

568
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,650
Well the same thing.

569
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,940
Dunkin is no perfect person,

570
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:29,990
but I love that guy to death.

571
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,360
I'm no perfect person
either and neither of you.

572
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,220
I think we can avoid these kinds of
conversations in the future if we just,

573
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,920
you just calm down a little bit man.

574
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,100
And what I said about being,

575
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,870
being in arguably you don't have to be a

576
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,590
straight deal with people.

577
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:46,110
You don't have to say,

578
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm going to give you all my
profits and not so all the profits.

579
00:15:48,471 --> 00:15:50,620
I'm saying you just completely reasonable.

580
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,560
Why are we talking about
this on a podcast is,

581
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,690
and that's what I'm talking about,

582
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,180
talking about fucking
farts and olive garden.

583
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,780
We don't have to talk about
only far it's an all barn barn.

584
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:00,770
There's nothing wrong with it.

585
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,960
This is a good conversation for all of us.

586
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,410
You know?

587
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,100
It's a good conversation
for me to understand that
sometimes you don't feel like

588
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,410
you're getting enough credit for all
the work you're doing for all those guys

589
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,500
that are on your network and in,

590
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:11,841
in,

591
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:14,840
in built this platform where a lot of
people find you find people because of

592
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,491
that platform.

593
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:18,440
We built it and I've been very supportive
of a Brian and I've been trying to

594
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,100
help it and I talk about it all the
time on this podcast and tell people to

595
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,160
subscribe to it and I tell people to
subscribe to it on Twitter and this the

596
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:25,970
only way to get it,

597
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,920
the icehouse chronicles just
to go through dusk squad.

598
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,220
No one's trying to stop.

599
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,130
It doesn't mean everything
you've ever done with it.

600
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,660
It's completely the right way to go.

601
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,030
You'd have to be able to bring up
something in order to get better.

602
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,240
Yeah,

603
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,260
we know we're not trying to
stop anything or just the,

604
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,173
the,

605
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,930
the icehouse thing can all be
worked out and I think it's,

606
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:45,980
it's a huge burden on your
back to financially when it
comes to figuring out who

607
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,200
gets paid and taking taxes and shit.

608
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:48,921
It's just not worth,

609
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:49,521
that's not worth it.

610
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,990
I just wanted to do comedy.

611
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,011
Well,

612
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,170
we can still tell you what you bought.

613
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,470
If you slap everybody 10 bucks,

614
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,420
it would be great.

615
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,290
You know what?

616
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,480
I just need an employee to go
and actually do that for me.

617
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,343
Goodbye.

618
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,670
[inaudible] to the podcast.

619
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:01,850
We,

620
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,710
we need to hire you and assistant,

621
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,050
so let's get going with that Asian guy.

622
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:06,884
What does he do?

623
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,640
That guy,

624
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,510
he's gone with the wind

625
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,050
dust in the wind.

626
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,693
Oh yeah.

627
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,170
It's dust in the wind.

628
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,820
I'm sorry if this was uncomfortable.

629
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:18,430
These gentlemen are uncomfortable
but unnecessarily uncomfortable.

630
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,480
It didn't have to be an Brian needs to
know that we all love him and he's doing

631
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:23,314
a good thing.

632
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,640
Just I think that's what it is.

633
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,050
You don't realize that
people still like you.

634
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:27,370
If I mentioned any sort of critique,

635
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,040
but it's still do like you last thoughts,

636
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:30,874
Brian,

637
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,743
please be positive.

638
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,251
Last thoughts,

639
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,084
Brian.

640
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,503
Ah,

641
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,661
Fuck Duncan.

642
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,710
Trussell oh,

643
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,700
come on.

644
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,830
How dare you after all that you go,

645
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,760
you go to fuck Duncan.

646
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:44,594
Trussell Yup.

647
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,171
Come on.

648
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,250
Let's think of something positive.

649
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,270
How to end this positive.

650
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
Ah,

651
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,180
goodbye.

652
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,841
Ari Shirt.

653
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:54,674
It's awesome.

654
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,970
Go sale yet.

655
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,600
Oh yeah.

656
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,350
Say say weeks or something like that.

657
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,900
So mine is this Brian Rabbit up.

658
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:00,690
Bring it all home.

659
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,970
Bring it all home in a positive way.

660
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,550
The fans.

661
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,383
No,

662
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,801
no,

663
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:04,790
it's not a contest.

664
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,660
There's no fight.

665
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,410
Don't make fights.

666
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:06,531
Yeah.

667
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:07,670
What do you mean the fans know?

668
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,120
They know how much I work for you guys.

669
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,620
Yes.

670
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,170
They know how much you work for us guys.

671
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,720
A nurse thing.

672
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,553
Hi Brian.

673
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,353
They know,

674
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,700
they know the time I put
in and doing all this shit.

675
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,331
Yeah.

676
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:23,800
Everybody knows that Tommy put into it.

677
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,723
Brian,

678
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,043
it's not bad.

679
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:26,891
Right?

680
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:29,710
So you wouldn't say I'm stealing
from comments that we do.

681
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,240
Brian,

682
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,370
I've never said you're
stealing from company Duncan.

683
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,460
He was out of line and he was upset at
you because he wasn't making an argument

684
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:43,510
about south by southwest and he didn't
feel that you should've been interjecting

685
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:44,620
what you were saying when he is,

686
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:48,160
our whole argument was about they offered
him to come out there and not pay him.

687
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,820
It's a silly emotional
thing between two guys.

688
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:55,630
They got dragged out in a public way
that was unfortunate and unnecessary.

689
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,860
He shouldn't have done that.

690
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,170
You acted in a very,

691
00:18:59,171 --> 00:18:59,561
you know,

692
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,060
angry and you know,

693
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,560
fucking violent way.

694
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,990
And I had to actually separate the two.

695
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,421
You guys,

696
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,254
I mean the whole thing.

697
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,620
And now he's trying to leave the room
and you wouldn't let me leave the room

698
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,550
pushing towards him.

699
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:12,490
You were pushing towards now I was
screaming at him with my finger pointing

700
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,450
towards this direction.

701
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,490
We're moving towards him to the
point where I had to stop you.

702
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,270
What am I going to do?

703
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,620
I don't know if you're
going to do anything.

704
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,790
I didn't think you were
going to do anything,

705
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,140
but you were so mad.

706
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,093
I was mad.

707
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,760
All right.

708
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,630
And that's why I say,

709
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,630
why were you so mad in contrast
with Ryan and just be like,

710
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:25,990
Nah,

711
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,500
you're wrong,

712
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,731
Brian.

713
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:27,311
You know we love you,

714
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:28,144
right?

715
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,860
Do you know we love you?

716
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,320
Yup.

717
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,153
I think Brian,

718
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,930
we really do appreciate the work you do.

719
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,550
If we give you a lawsuit without you,

720
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,930
if we give you a big hug right now,

721
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:35,764
you're going to feel better.

722
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,490
No,

723
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:36,761
no.

724
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,020
He's going to feel way more uncomfortable.

725
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,220
No big hugs.

726
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,620
No.

727
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:39,971
All right.

728
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:40,804
We'll see you tomorrow,

729
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,681
Brian.

730
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:41,981
Calendar.

731
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:42,160
Mark.
