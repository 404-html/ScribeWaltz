1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,720
So when you're considering known
ordinary or altered states,

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,620
one of the first questions is what do
they feel like what's actually going on

3
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:15,940
in those places and spaces,
and one of the challenges in coming up

4
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:19,990
with a good and consistent answer,
not just for a specific state like

5
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,930
meditation or a flow state or a
psychedelic state,

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,620
is how do they all,
what qualities do they all share?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,670
Because each of those communities of
practice over central decades,

8
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:34,900
centuries and even millennia,
have accumulated their own storytelling

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,080
or content about what the state and they
access are or what they mean and where

10
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,550
you're supposed to go through them.
So for instance,

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,610
if you were a Buddhist meditator,
you will be instructed in all sorts of

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,360
stages and levels and progressions of
non ordinary states of consciousness

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,730
ranging from waking state all the way to
white light,

14
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:56,890
voice to Buddha consciousness,
etc.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,980
If I am a peasant farmer in India and I
have a non ordinary state experience,

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,420
I might experience ganash right?
That the elephant god in a rice patty.

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,630
If I'm a peasant in Mexico,
I might experience the virgin of

18
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:12,160
guadalupe hidalgo,
right?

19
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:16,930
If I'm a coder in silicon valley,
I might experience the matrix and code

20
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:19,090
mode.
This is ones and zeros streaming all

21
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:24,091
night is I bang away on my keyboard and
the reality is is that underneath those

22
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,970
experiences are far more alike than the
wrapping paper.

23
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:31,330
The narratIve wrapping paper of what
people see based on culture accustom

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,740
biography and what we.
What we attempted to do was create a

25
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:40,150
functIonal framework that lets us talk
about these things as apples to apples

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,470
and really see the similarities and what
we realized is that because of the

27
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:48,370
neurobiology,
there are four qualities that tend to

28
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:53,371
arise pretty consistently regardless of
which door you go through to get into

29
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,400
these northern states and they a
selflessness,

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,650
timelessness,
effortlessness,

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,710
and richness or stir for short and
selflessness tends to happen because the

32
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,770
areas of our brain,
specifically the prefrontal cortex,

33
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:13,771
but including additional networks that
connect often turn off or completely

34
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,400
light up.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,510
Either way,
they knock out our everyday waking sense

36
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,370
of self consciousness and self
awareness.

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,510
So we ended up momentarily lost our
inner voice,

38
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,400
lost our inner critic last,
our jimminy cricket,

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,730
and we are in a state of not thinking
about our thinking.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,750
Timelessness happens for a similar
reason as as basically different parts

41
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:42,160
of our brain light up and turn off.
Our ability to calculate time gets

42
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:45,790
knocked out because it is a is a
comprehensive measurement.

43
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,770
It's not.
It doesn't just occur in one single

44
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:51,100
location in our brain.
So when we start knocking out parts of

45
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:55,840
the networks,
we lose our chronometer and all of the

46
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,370
neurochemistry,
right?

47
00:02:57,371 --> 00:03:01,450
Focusing attention,
learning drives our attention.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,400
We dropped out of daydreaming about the
past or the future and we get absolutely

49
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,260
sucked into the immediate present
moment.

50
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:10,450
So a feeling of timelessness comes with
it.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,320
The effortlessness is just,
it's no longer about what I'm trying to

52
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:14,710
do.

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,590
It's not about exerting grit or will
power,

54
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,370
which has been,
you know,

55
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,580
a lot of people have been talking about
and writing about these days and it's

56
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,160
literally in the sort of almost in the
biblical sense,

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,900
sort of not my wIll,
but thy will.

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,290
I feel myself swept along.
And it can be I'm just self propelled

59
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,290
and it feels awesome or it's terrifying,
but I don't have a choice,

60
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,420
but either way it's not me plotting one
foot in front of the other to get to a

61
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,920
goal.
I've decided so that's the

62
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,750
effortlessness and then the final bit is
rich is the richness and that's arguably

63
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,430
the whole shooting match.
Because when I knock out my self

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,320
consciousness,
I don't have a voice inside my head,

65
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:53,410
second guessing,
filtering when I'm not in the past or

66
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,030
the future.
I'm just in the deep present.

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,910
When I am effortlessly being propelled.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
The next thing that consistently seems
to happen is we have access to far more

69
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:08,371
information than we do in our regular
waking state and that is when we go from

70
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,130
conscious processinG,
which is very limited and narrow to

71
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:17,110
unconscious processing,
which is faster and vaster.

72
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,350
And Dr. David eagleman,
who's at stanford,

73
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,470
who's a friend and a colleague and a and
a board member of ours at the flow

74
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,630
genome project,
will constantly makes that case that

75
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,210
that really it's as if our conscious
mind is sort of like the headlines of

76
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:36,211
tomorrow's newspaper reporting on the
reality of today and when we get into

77
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,150
non ordinary states,
because of the all of the shifts and

78
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,720
brain function and,
and hormones and neuro electricity,

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,950
we have access to more of that
information in real time.

80
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,700
And,
and the results often feels

81
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,530
supernatural.
People in the past historically have

82
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,590
assigned this to the gods,
to the muses,

83
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,820
to fate,
to possession,

84
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,320
to angels.
You name it,

85
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,850
right?
And we've preTty much exhausted the

86
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,240
gamut of all the ways we could say,
this is just too much.

87
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,070
This is too cool,
let's do inspired.

88
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,800
It's too,
it's too informed to possibly be me.

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,980
So we've assigned it supernatural
origins,

90
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,360
but in reality we now know it might just
be super hyphen natural.

91
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,330
It's just us in an automated state.
It's,

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,330
it's,
it's biG data for our minds.
