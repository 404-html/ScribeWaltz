1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,670
Well,

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,760
he gives zero fucks.

3
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,350
Your Ratha though,

4
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,841
drove,

5
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:07,620
rode to the Experia and the grass eaters,

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,090
they supposed to be grass eaters.

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,470
You ever have grass fed beef?

8
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,490
Do you buy grass fed beef?

9
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:11,970
No,

10
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,080
I buy it exclusively now.

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,273
It tastes better.

12
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,170
Where do you get at whole foods?

13
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,060
A lot of a organic grocery store.

14
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,590
Sprouts?

15
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,861
No,

16
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,790
you got to ask for it.

17
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,010
Yeah cause a lot of hope.

18
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,800
Even when I was in,

19
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,770
I was in whole foods and I,

20
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:27,930
I was asking for it and the butcher was
actually trying to steer me towards um,

21
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,550
grass fed meat and he was like,

22
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,820
it's actually taste here or try
to steer me towards corn fed meat.

23
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,541
And he's like,

24
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,330
it's actually tastier is more marbling.

25
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,671
I was like,

26
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:35,940
dude,

27
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,510
I know it.

28
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,343
I like,

29
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,311
I'd like to get that.

30
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,830
Please tell him like,

31
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,920
what are you saying?

32
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
Like you're telling me to eat
something that's less healthy.

33
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,551
Like you're saying,

34
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,211
it's tastier.

35
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,044
I don't even agree.

36
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,471
I don't agree.

37
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:46,940
It's tastier.

38
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,773
It's a matter of choice.

39
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,511
And second of all,

40
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,940
it's been demonstrated that this
shit is not that good for you.

41
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
Like when you're eating corn fed beef,

42
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:54,000
you're reading a sick animal.

43
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,600
The reason why they're so fat and
Marbley it's their fucking ready to die.

44
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,331
Like it's,

45
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,250
it's like a fucking,

46
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,150
it's like Rob Ford.

47
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:01,560
It's like if you ate the mayor of Toronto,

48
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,580
like he'd be a corn fed cow looking at
me like what the fuck is that guy still

49
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,414
alive?

50
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,350
Smoking crack and eating
pussy there Charlie Sheen man,

51
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,650
if he came to America he
would be the King of Florida.

52
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,680
Fuck if he just went to two.

53
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,800
If he just moved to America long enough
where they trusted him and decided to

54
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:20,970
run for mayor of Florida,

55
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,020
he would be the King of Florida.

56
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,420
He made her and her brother,

57
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,470
I think he got a reality show already
and then he was such a fuck up.

58
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,480
They cancelled it after like
one episode but the canceled.

59
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,440
That's the reality show I want to watch.

60
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,260
The reality show was just the Internet.

61
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,970
You don't want an organized bullshit
Beverly Hills housewives version of that

62
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:39,480
guy.

63
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,290
You want him doing impromptu live press
conferences where he talks about a woman

64
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,610
accusing him of eating her pussy

65
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,421
and says,

66
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,710
I have plenty to eat at home.

67
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,270
Did you see that?

68
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,780
I wonder what his,

69
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,451
why you see that?

70
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:49,690
Yeah.

71
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,480
What his wife said about that.

72
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,380
That's almost an insult
saying that she brings,

73
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,110
she probably said,

74
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,400
yeah,

75
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,071
ask him again.

76
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,080
I think we've got some
leftovers here at the house.

77
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,790
It doesn't sound like you.

78
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,760
She has a huge pussy.

79
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,110
He said he has plenty to eat at home
now that he's not eating enough of it.

80
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,861
You know,

81
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:05,770
I think that uh,

82
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,710
says I'm happily married
and this is Toronto.

83
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,210
This isn't some podunk town.

84
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,530
This is the biggest fucking city
and biggest city in Canada by far.

85
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah.

86
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,910
It's an enormous city.

87
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah.

88
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Massive metropolitan city has and very
international and when my favorite places

89
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,070
to perform on ours,

90
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,600
I love it.

91
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,230
Love Toronto.

92
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,830
Yeah.

93
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,650
I love this guy to listen
this press conference.

94
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:25,771
I mean,

95
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:26,920
it's fucking fantastic work.

96
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,763
And he called me,

97
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,840
he goes out there,

98
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,480
he's got a fucking Football Jersey on.

99
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,920
He's a thousand pounds overweight.

100
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,440
Even Charlie Sheen was
over eater who just talks,

101
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,274
they still

102
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,370
come in yesterday,

103
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,990
listen to all this,

104
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:43,590
um,

105
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,423
what's going on?

106
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,950
Why is that

107
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,520
the documents that was released?

108
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,310
There we go.

109
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,720
Uh,

110
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,421
unfortunately,

111
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,254
um,

112
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,230
it's unfortunate I have
to take the legal action.

113
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,020
I don't appreciate people call Atlanta
a prostitute and never had a prostitute

114
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,201
here.

115
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:04,300
I'm very happily married at home.

116
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,380
Um,

117
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,630
that this is very disturbing against wave.

118
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,530
Um,

119
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,580
unfortunately I have to take legal action
against Isaac grants and McGeorge for

120
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:13,300
to stop lists and,

121
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,134
um,

122
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,550
mark Toohey I have to take legal action
against the waiter that said I was doing

123
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,384
lines.

124
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,850
Your market that is celebrating the lives.

125
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,780
That is not true.

126
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,080
Um,

127
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,913
you know what?

128
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,231
It hurts my wife,

129
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,064
but in a,

130
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,600
they're calling a friend of mine,

131
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,480
a prostituted Atlanta is not a prostitute.

132
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,650
She's a friend and it makes me
sick of people are saying this.

133
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,500
So unfortunately I have no other choice.

134
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,930
I'm the last one to take legal action.

135
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,950
I can't,

136
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,420
I can't put up with it anymore.

137
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,010
So I've named the names,

138
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,610
um,

139
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,041
litigation.

140
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,200
We'll be starting shortly.

141
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,131
I've had enough.

142
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,420
That's why I warned you guys yesterday.

143
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,590
Be careful what you wrote.

144
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,221
Okay,

145
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,320
so that's all I have to save for now.

146
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,920
And the next thing I want
to call a mare Brittania,

147
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,620
it's in Hamilton and tell him that we're
going to have to spank their little

148
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,030
tiger cats all in.

149
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,330
The last thing was um,

150
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,320
Olivia dawn back then it says
that I wanted to eat her pussy.

151
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:05,881
They let him go on.

152
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:08,440
And I have never said
that in my life tour.

153
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,274
I would never do that.

154
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,390
I'm happily married.

155
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,740
I've got more than enough to eat at home.

156
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,490
Unscripted nails,

157
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,370
every word of it.

158
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,360
And the best part about that
video is after he leaves,

159
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:21,320
one of the reporters goes,

160
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:22,820
I fucking love that guy.

161
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,171
One of the report,

162
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,004
it says it.

163
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,710
It's like finally something's happening.

164
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,150
And he's naming names.

165
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:29,361
I mean,

166
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:32,180
the first thing you learn is
politician is keep it vague.

167
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:32,871
Keep it general.

168
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,280
This guy's going like at Billy,

169
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,450
the waiter down there,

170
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,150
he said that I was doing lines and the

171
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,210
lines,

172
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,480
most likely you're doing lines,

173
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,490
especially if there's a
video of you smoking crack,

174
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:43,880
right?

175
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,810
He admits to that.

176
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,320
Yes.

177
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,060
He admits to the video
of him smoking crack.

178
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:47,751
He's beautiful.

179
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,730
He is a beautiful man.

180
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,450
Meanwhile,

181
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,283
by the way,

182
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,130
by the way,

183
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,963
he does good.

184
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,801
These are good.

185
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,910
He has gone through the
roof with him as the mayor.

186
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,721
It's not a bad man.

187
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:59,960
He's also a guy who came up
through going to the projects,

188
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:02,440
helping out the working poor and you know,

189
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,380
being an inspiration.

190
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,220
I think he coaches a football team
and the reason why he's an off his

191
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:10,520
favoribility rating is not
that fucking low considering.

192
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,750
And it's because the poor people
remember where this guy came from and he,

193
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:18,410
they know what he's done for that and
they'll overlook who gives a shit.

194
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,750
Nobody really should
give a shit the crack.

195
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,710
Yeah,

196
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,251
the rest of it.

197
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,090
Who Cares?

198
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,910
It's kind of funny that it's cracked too.

199
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:29,240
It's like you went for the most ghetto
of ghetto drugs and he did it with a

200
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,460
bunch of black people and
they got videos of him.

201
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,031
I mean,

202
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,970
does he not know what a fucking cell phone
is where they're holding a cell phone

203
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:35,804
in front of him?

204
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,950
Look at Mike Tyson.

205
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:40,100
Shit's the best part where he
said he wants to fight Mike Tyson.

206
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:40,311
He's like,

207
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,450
I'll kill Mike Tyson.

208
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:42,200
And he said,

209
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,291
Oh,

210
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,820
you haven't seen that
and that's the best one.

211
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,983
I've seen that.

212
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,130
Oh my God,

213
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,510
I,

214
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,800
I've seen one where he
challenged some guy too.

215
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm an MMA fight.

216
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,103
Maybe that's it.

217
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,690
It challenged.

218
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:51,920
I've,

219
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,200
I've only watched like five seconds of it.

220
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:54,450
I was like,

221
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,690
this guy's crazy.

222
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,031
I was like,

223
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:56,930
Jason Ellis,

224
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,030
he's a mayor.

225
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,580
Right.

226
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,520
Umay your,

227
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,950
I mean we had Marion Barry,

228
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,200
but that guy was like not like this.

229
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,450
He didn't have the
dimensions that this guy had.

230
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,360
Well he also does not have
the ability to own it.

231
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,920
Marion Barry lied about it all.

232
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,850
Like Marion Barry was on opening a
and Anthony and I got to ask him some

233
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,520
questions and uh,

234
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,330
I was one yes in person,

235
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,440
as close as you are to me.

236
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,610
And I was like,

237
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,710
what about the crack thing when
they caught you smoking crack?

238
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,590
Like I knew he only had like
five minutes and I was like,

239
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,300
I am going to ask this like right away.

240
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,920
Like you can't like beat around the bush.

241
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,001
He's in and out.

242
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,200
He's doing a bunch of different reviews.

243
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,681
I go,

244
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,550
what was that about?

245
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,121
What was going on there?

246
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:32,510
He goes,

247
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,990
they,

248
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,530
they did not know whether
or not what I had was crack.

249
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,160
Okay.

250
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,690
What they have is a video.

251
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,230
Me Smoking.

252
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,411
I go,

253
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,131
but what was it?

254
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,964
Was it crack?

255
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,500
Like wouldn't,

256
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,311
wouldn't answer.

257
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,144
It wouldn't say,

258
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,040
listen man.

259
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,470
Right.

260
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,400
I got a little crazy.

261
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:46,941
I fucked up.

262
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,774
I smoked a little crack.

263
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,840
That's what you should never said

264
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:52,911
I did.

265
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,451
Lines.

266
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,560
That's an outright lie.

267
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,730
It's an insult.

268
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,220
My friend is not a prostitute.

269
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,181
As soon as you have to see,

270
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,380
your friend is not a prostitute.

271
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,950
Nice man by name.

272
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh yeah.

273
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,200
Kill that fucking guy.

274
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:08,580
I'm telling you a first degree murder.

275
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,443
Mike Tyson.

276
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,573
He is

277
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,330
walking around like this.

278
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,403
Fucking,

279
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,661
oh my God,

280
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,494
he's coked up.

281
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:46,741
Oh,

282
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,000
how come I haven't seen this?

283
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,203
Looks like

284
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,250
everyone in the room and he keeps
on saying brother like brother

285
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,730
15 minutes

286
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,780
now because of this video,

287
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm on the side of the people
trying to get them out of office

288
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,150
because of that video.

289
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:26,350
I officially think he's out of control.

290
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,060
I didn't think he was
out of control before.

291
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,410
I thought it was just being silly man.

292
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,730
Somebody from Toronto that I know,

293
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:34,710
it says actually he knows that this
drug dealer that's friends with him and

294
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:35,450
that's that.

295
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,720
That's not calling in
to the podcast on now.

296
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,070
I think they already have talked to drug
dealers and I think this is like known

297
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:42,810
in Canada that like
this is just ridiculous.

298
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,090
Problem is a fat guy.

299
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,410
Dom is dangerous.

300
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,640
Like thinking he can actually beat up
Mike Tyson and it only needs this 15

301
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,720
minutes and I'll have him down.

302
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,800
Rip His eyes out like,

303
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,663
oh,

304
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,683
okay,

305
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
you're too stupid.

306
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,543
You're

307
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,900
delusional.

308
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,130
That's why you're so confident now.

309
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,840
I understand.

310
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,340
Yeah,

311
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,850
cause that's the dumbest
Shit I've ever heard.

312
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,043
Politicians,

313
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,720
the mood,

314
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,550
like the decisions they
make in their lives,

315
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:10,470
the fucking balls that they just cheating
while in office when you think that

316
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,140
everything's being examined as cameras
on you all the time and you're going to

317
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:14,490
fucking cheat and you think,

318
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:14,830
you know,

319
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,600
again,

320
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,590
I think they've always done it.

321
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,910
I think guys like,

322
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,531
like the,

323
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:18,740
the,

324
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,970
the Clinton types are the JFK types that,

325
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,330
you know,

326
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,710
have this like lust for it.

327
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,930
I think it's always been
what they got away with.

328
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,890
It's always been a part of it.

329
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,050
Someone's always swept it
under the rug and so they,

330
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,110
they've always kept going and like they
like it so much they don't want to stop.

331
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,280
They liked the power of it,

332
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,690
but no one's ever been like,

333
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,390
no,

334
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,320
that's sanity.

335
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,030
Well the guy down in San Diego
gave us a pretty good run.

336
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,660
He was right.

337
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,450
He was a grow lurcher light
were dozens of Leche lecturer.

338
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,430
He was a latch.

339
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:46,840
Yeah.

340
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,361
That guy was,

341
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:47,810
uh,

342
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,170
he's,

343
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,970
he's been sued by a gang of them too.

344
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,390
Yeah.

345
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,830
Yeah.

346
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,010
There's that guy's going,

347
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,870
what's a sad about him is he
didn't even get any pussy.

348
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,590
I think he was just grabbing acid.

349
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,140
So amateur,

350
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,130
that's eighth grade with seeing that
guy say that he'd beat up Tyson.

351
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:02,520
He's like,

352
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,240
do you have any idea how fun that would
fight that fight would be for Tyson?

353
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,660
Tyson would literally right now you
can wake them up and tell him he has to

354
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,440
fight this guy.

355
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,860
It could be taken a nap and he would get
in there and he'd be laughing the whole

356
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,131
time,

357
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,470
like laughing like all,

358
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:16,350
come on big guy.

359
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,184
You're going to kill me.

360
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,540
You're going to put my eyes out.

361
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,051
Were you going through it?

362
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,070
You to hold me down.

363
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:21,000
What's going to happen here?

364
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,290
You're going to rip my throat out.

365
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:23,851
Well,

366
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:24,211
to me,

367
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm on from my profession
and I said a ludicrous,

368
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:29,300
but I'm willing to engage you
in this context if she so want.

369
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,580
If you thought [inaudible] have
the dude chasing him around,

370
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,550

371
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,383
like that's a great,

372
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,640
that's a great shirt.

373
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,474
Where can I buy that?

374
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,460
Please tell me it's for sale.

375
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,821
It is.

376
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,550
Andrew Wk is Rob Ford parties.

377
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:46,080
Andrew Wk is that guys by saying
you're a millionaire before Christmas.

378
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,943
I'm buying one.

379
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
I'm going to buy one right now.

380
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,660
Party hard with blood
pouring out of his nose.

381
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,730
A fucking love it.

382
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,890
It's on Andrew's official party store.

383
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,031
If you want to make some money,

384
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,460
promote the fight Tyson versus him.

385
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,383
No,

386
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,830
he got to give him cook first

387
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,360
and then you've got to have like 10 dudes
outside the ring at all corners with

388
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:03,541
the,

389
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:03,741
the,

390
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:06,450
the fucking defibrillators
just ready to go.

391
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,930
Cause I know that guy's
going to have a heart attack.

392
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:08,550
Right?

393
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,840
Like you see him pacing?

394
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:13,110
Like how does a fat guy that old do coke?

395
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,910
Like that's fucking dangerous

396
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,480
colds.

397
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,313
That Dude,

398
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,613
how old's Rob Ford?

399
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,410
I think he's four.

400
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,810
He looks old and 54 50 can remember being
on a coke Jag and pacing like that and

401
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:27,120
saying shit like I'm a bad mother.

402
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,960
Felt like I remember being in that space.

403
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,180
Okay,

404
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,830
let me stop you.

405
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,120
You were 19 right?

406
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,240
Big Fuck right.

407
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,740
44 44 44 Jesus Christ.

408
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:36,574
It looks like shit.

409
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,523
Yeah,

410
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,640
I thought he was deep in his fifties
so what happens to rob forward over the

411
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,650
next year is different.

412
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:44,891
Yeah,

413
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:45,461
most likely,

414
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:45,910
right?

415
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,660
But Canada is different when it comes
to their ability to get people out of

416
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:50,260
office.

417
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,100
You can't just pull something out of
office for conduct if they don't any

418
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,750
of the state laws,

419
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,640
if they don't like get in trouble,

420
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,474
steal money.

421
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,180
It was like a lot of things that you
have to have done to get them out of

422
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:01,930
office.

423
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,930
So right now they're just
sort of taking away his power.

424
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,470
They're just slowly but surely
making him a puppet mayor.

425
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,820
They removing his power,

426
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,030
so that gets weird because then you
sort of like crippling your own sort of

427
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,390
economy and you're,

428
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,550
you're crippling your own government.

429
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,520
Like I don't know if that's going to work.

430
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,790
Most people would quit,

431
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,010
but this guy's not good,

432
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:23,620
so I got to quit.

433
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,101
He'll never quit.

434
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,934
He's suing them.

435
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,710
He's going to sue them to keep his job,

436
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:30,460
but they should show that video and then
have an expert come in and you're like

437
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:34,750
a teddy atlas and explain what would
happen if Mike Tyson and him got into an

438
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,770
actual ring together.

439
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Does this make sense or would you
categorize a person that's 44 years old?

440
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,900
It looks like there's 60 that's
clearly coked out of their mind.

441
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,640
It looks like they ate a beach ball.

442
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,870
D would you categorize that
as delusional to the utmost?

443
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,230
Bring in Dr drew.

444
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,600
You'd have to just bring
in a few fight experts,

445
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,340
just bringing Teddy Atlas and Jim Lampley
and have them describe and then have

446
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:01,780
Mike Tyson and then tell him though,

447
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,580
theory athlete.

448
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,413
He said,

449
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
have him laugh and

450
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,610
okay.
