1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:03,060
Everybody like as far as I'm concerned,

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,540
like mom,

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,830
I got my daily problems.

5
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:04,931
I,

6
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:05,764
I don't,

7
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,370
I don't the government and
the clamp down the internet,

8
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,060
fuck the Internet.

9
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,950
I honestly told her,

10
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:10,561
I've said many,

11
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:13,200
many times if I could
get rid of one thing,

12
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:16,170
like I think for every great thing the
Internet's done and there's a thousand

13
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:16,651
slimy,

14
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,500
he's coming fucking awful
rotten things about it.

15
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,011
Wow.

16
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:20,731
That's interesting.

17
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,170
I look at it a completely
opposite I think for everyone.

18
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,120
I mean it changed my,

19
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,410
it changed the trajectory of a
whole business depended on to,

20
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:28,820
you know what man?

21
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,540
I think Dan took the carpet enabled on
delivery on levels that I never would

22
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:38,541
have imagined in like 1995 it thievery
meaning people to illegally downloaded

23
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
songs.

24
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:39,691
Yeah.

25
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,191
Not only that.

26
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:40,471
Okay.

27
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,760
And then let's just go with the,

28
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,031
you know,

29
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,020
just small things like,

30
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,231
you know,

31
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:43,561
back,

32
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:43,831
you know,

33
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,970
maybe in the 90s if there was
a guy who liked fucking pigs,

34
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,870
you know what I mean?

35
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,390
He'd be alone fucking wolf somewhere that,

36
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,690
you know,

37
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,130
would never really act on it or anything.

38
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:53,910
Now there's probably,

39
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,750
you could probably find a
website dedicated to that gap.

40
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,820
This most certainly if people
gather and they fuck pigs,

41
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,660
that's bad.

42
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,520
That's bad for society.

43
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:01,800
Yeah.

44
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
Why is it okay to eat pigs?

45
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,020
But it's not okay to fuck them.

46
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,950
That's what I want to know.

47
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,030
I mean,

48
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
I feel like you dude podcast
might be over after that.

49
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,530
I don't feel like,

50
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,560
I don't know if I have any
response to that legitimately.

51
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,880
I don't feel like that makes any sense.

52
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,891
I feel like,

53
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:19,260
uh,

54
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,720
if you,

55
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,160
you know,

56
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,340
if you will fuck people and we
didn't eat and them's wrong,

57
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,360
uh,

58
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,081
well site and wrong.

59
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:29,790
If you trapped car crashed in the Andes
mountains and just eating a person,

60
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,500
well people have done it.

61
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,020
I mean,

62
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,210
the whole bond or party,

63
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,160
those people that got
stuck in the Rockies,

64
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,960
people done it.

65
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,750
But it's under notoriously bad story.

66
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,220
Like it's not cool.

67
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:41,721
They're accepted.

68
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,160
It's not like things you
should do on a regular basis.

69
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:44,790
But I mean,

70
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,540
if someone can,

71
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:45,901
pigs,

72
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,070
let's just apply the same,

73
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,360
probably the same logic.

74
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,790
How about you're stuck on an island
and there's no people to fuck,

75
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,730
but you got a pig and they come
back after all these years and the,

76
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,120
hey man,

77
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,780
what are you doing?

78
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:54,961
Like,

79
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,081
well,

80
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,930
I raised pigs and a and
I killed them for food.

81
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,371
Oh,

82
00:01:58,371 --> 00:01:58,651
okay,

83
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,250
cool.

84
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,180
What would you do for sex?

85
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,110
He just beat off lot.

86
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,860
Nah,

87
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,730
fuck my pigs.

88
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,721
They'd be like,

89
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,830
whoa and cool.

90
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,360
Not Cool.

91
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,250
He did something.

92
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,640
She just kept that to yourself,

93
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:08,831
man.

94
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:09,664
You know?

95
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,040
That's really what it is.

96
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,580
Would it be worse if he
made love to the pig?

97
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,990
I don't think either one is bad.

98
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,131
I think honestly,

99
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,240
if you're going to kill an animal,

100
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,900
fucking it,

101
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,240
as long as you don't
like fuck it to death.

102
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
That's kind of a crazy way
to kill something and we'd
just go anal with the pig

103
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,704
or vagina.

104
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,120
She'd have to see the setup.

105
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,590
You have to see what you deal with,

106
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,220
you know,

107
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,641
condom,

108
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,301
no condom.

109
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,134
It's about a question.

110
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,550
Internal organ lies.

111
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,440
Pigs are supposed to
be very similar to us,

112
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,460
so you don't,

113
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,500
you definitely don't want to go
aina without a little cleanup.

114
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:37,831
First.

115
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,400
I mean,

116
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,160
you get some pig shit through
the tip of your Dick for sure.

117
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,020
That can be a problem at home clubs.

118
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:43,500
Nice.

119
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,460
It's nice to have a spot.

120
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,620
So like we're standing.

121
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,560
Hope is out in Bisbee.

122
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,580
There's no fucking club.

123
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,800
So that crazy asshole.

124
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,270
Just do a show in his back yard.

125
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,100
Set up some speakers,

126
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,450
plugged the Mike and

127
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,290
he did a show in Vegas
and some dude's backyard.

128
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,800
There was a guy in Vegas,

129
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:03,580
some kid who was hiring comedians do shows
in his yard and have his friends come

130
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,380
over and uh,

131
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,880
has to be a great gig.

132
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,110
No.

133
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,040
Can you say about it right?

134
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,160
Standup said it was awesome.

135
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,341
Like we got it.

136
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,790
Got It got shut down by like
city ordinances or something.

137
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,031
Yeah.

138
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,320
He didn't have the proper permits.

139
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,333
Let a bummer.

140
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,830
What the fuck is that one
with the proper [inaudible].

141
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,470
Well then you could shut
down lemonade stands.

142
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:20,820
You know,

143
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,161
so you don't,

144
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,994
and you don't have a permit.

145
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,380
Right.

146
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,230
But you don't want anybody throwing
like crazy late night parties in the

147
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,370
backyard next to you.

148
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,420
That would suck.

149
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,381
Like,

150
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,910
what if they were playing bad rap music?

151
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,500
Like you're cool with it if it's stand up.

152
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,521
And it's funny,

153
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,480
like at Stan hope do her standing up tall,

154
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,950
terrible,

155
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,540
whoo,

156
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,130
whoo,

157
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,710
whoo,

158
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,380
whoo,

159
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,213
whoo,

160
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,573
whoo,

161
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,373
whoo.

162
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,780
And you'd try to get some
fucking sleep and you're like,

163
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,710
God damn it,

164
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,550
this is def.

165
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,740
Maybe that's how they
feel about Stan hope.

166
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,574
Talking about aids.

167
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,091
When I,

168
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:55,924
uh,

169
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,540
when I turned 16,

170
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,960
my parents made the tactical error of
going out of town that weekend and I threw

171
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,660
one of the biggest parties
Oviedo high school had ever seen.

172
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,990
And there were cars parked all down the
block and just massive party and people

173
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,810
just,

174
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,643
you know,

175
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,400
drinking on,

176
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,880
I,

177
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,510
I was,

178
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,343
uh,

179
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,350
talking to like three of the
hottest girls in my school,

180
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,580
in our living room,

181
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,960
and this guy vomits on the,

182
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,950
on our living room,

183
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,400
carpet.

184
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,851
You know what I mean?

185
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,290
What am I do?

186
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm gonna get down on my hands and knees,

187
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,241
you know,

188
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,750
in the middle of this party or the,

189
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:32,970
the,

190
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,140
these girls that I,

191
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,530
I care about,

192
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,061
uh,

193
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:36,310
you know,

194
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,600
watch me cleaned some vomit.

195
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,753
So what'd you do?

196
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,890
Sprinkled some dog food on
it and let the dog in now.

197
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,120
No.

198
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,020
Did you really?

199
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:44,951
Oh,

200
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,770
you fucking Sao human being.

201
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,830
Why would you want to dog
me drinking this cost?

202
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,930
It was a the cleanest carpet area
that dog haunted you wake dog farts.

203
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,633
Poor dog.

204
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,120
Come on.

205
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,670
Rip and horrible farts.

206
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,230
Bio farts.

207
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,380
Worst me here.

208
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:09,280
Your dog's Fart.

209
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,960
When you look over at him and be like,

210
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,890
come on man.

211
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,730
For Real.

212
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:12,971
Hey,

213
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,530
that's when the dog is
comfortable with you.

214
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,540
They're always comfortable with your man.

215
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,830
They never hold in farts.

216
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,270
I was just something about dogs.

217
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:20,260
They never figured it out.

218
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,280
You yell at them when they farm.

219
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,290
They never put two and two together
like what the fuck you yelling at,

220
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,090
man,

221
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,790
I'm just over here doing my thing.

222
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,031
I'm just being me.

223
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,240
I didn't even move fucking stinky bitch.

224
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,200
I don't want to be an ass.

225
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,430
I wanna.

226
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,280
I wanna make sure that people understand
that I think is that people are working

227
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,510
at the limits of their understanding.

228
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,180
We have burnt athletes at the,

229
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,240
at the stake of performance that we
didn't understand all the ramifications of

230
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,930
got the job done.

231
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,591
We lived on the clock.

232
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:47,640
Let me use an analogy for you.

233
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,480
I learned this from you.

234
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,140
This is like,

235
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,340
this is one of the from me.

236
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,791
Yes.

237
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,570
This is one of the swear to
God guiding forces in my life.

238
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,470
Don't hang tough.

239
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,890
Okay.

240
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,723
Fear factor.

241
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,153
Oh,

242
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,060
this guy had eat like a foot
long horse cock in like an hour.

243
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,163
Okay.

244
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,071
That never happened.

245
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:04,904
But go ahead.

246
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,440
Uh,

247
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,800
there was a hang tough.

248
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,640
He had eats something.

249
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,810
So you guys eating right and he's
making jokes and you're like,

250
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,141
hey bro,

251
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,974
watch the clock.

252
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,160
It was like in the best
of fear factor too,

253
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:15,310
right?

254
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,071
Like watch the clock,

255
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:16,701
watch the clock.

256
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,630
You're trying to help them,

257
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,800
your coach and he's making jokes.

258
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,790
He's flirting with the girls.

259
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,110
He's eating any swallows.

260
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,810
The last bite at the last second and a,

261
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,350
you're like,

262
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,070
sorry bro,

263
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,780
you timed out and the guy freaks out.

264
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,081
Yeah,

265
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,914
I remember that dude.

266
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,630
I was trying to tell that guy,

267
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,590
I know what you're doing,

268
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,430
but you can't do it.

269
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,270
Don't do it.

270
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,210
Don't fucking waste your
energy talking and having fun.

271
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:35,451
I'm like,

272
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,051
you've got a lot.

273
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,290
I,

274
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,850
I've been there before.

275
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,740
I've seen a lot of people eat dick.

276
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,030
It takes some time,

277
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,460
takes some serious fucking time.

278
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
And you think you take the first
couple of bites like I'm fine.

279
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,050
Did you do you got five minutes?

280
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,080
Eat that whole deck.

281
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,950
It's not that easy in
cobble and Dick got that.

282
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,030
He got to watch the clock.

283
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,500
You gotta manage the details.

284
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,530
You also have to have chewing
endurance and that sounds so crazy,

285
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,660
but there's shit like livers and kidneys.

286
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,800
Kidneys is a perfect one.

287
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,731
Somebody tells you,

288
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:01,941
Hey,

289
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm going to make a bet with you.

290
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:03,281
Listen,

291
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,114
you wanna make some money.

292
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,480
Tell him mother fucker he can't
eat a kidney like a cow kidney.

293
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,350
Tell him that he can't eat it in an hour
cause he's not going to fucking eat it

294
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,030
just to make sure he can't have any water.

295
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,590
You can't wash it down with shit.

296
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,610
You just have to eat it.

297
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,600
It's not happening.

298
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,141
Okay?

299
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:18,901
It's not going to happen.

300
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:19,470
It shouldn't happen.

301
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,500
You know how I know I'm an expert on that.

302
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:21,860
I know.

303
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,131
I know.

304
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:22,820
I've seen,

305
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,410
I've seen a lot of people.

306
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,140
I've Seen Pa's do it for 100 bucks.

307
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,730
I've seen contestants do what?

308
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:29,570
You can't eat it.

309
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,830
It's too hard.

310
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,031
It's,

311
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:32,480
you'd shooting the shit out of something.

312
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,210
It's like you're running up
hill sprints with your jaw.

313
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,050
That's what it's like.

314
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,800
That's right.

315
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,690
You're wrestling Karalyn with your jaw.

316
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,270
Can't train for that.

317
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,150
The kidney is insurmountable that you
have to control what you can control.

318
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,620
Right?

319
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,130
So,

320
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,100
so you learn that from me.

321
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,400
I've got to control the clock,

322
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:49,640
Bro.
