1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,293
Do.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,050
Oh No.
Yeah,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,580
Vamos.
See,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,933
okay.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,090
We'd lie.
That's all I know.

6
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:12,320
Spanish.
Don't expect more.

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
elite camp.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
This is what I want to do,
buddy Lee camp.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,500
Alex Jones.
Anger at me.

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,590
Let's go drink it.
We can all be friends.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,740
We're going to pass around a joint.
We're going to agree to be friendly

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,920
while I'll just go to dinner somewhere.
Have a good old time.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,300
Throw back some beers.
I think we would all get along famously.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,230
I know nothing about Alex Jones off the
mic.

15
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:42,140
I can't even imagine what goes on.
I love him.

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,900
I love him.
I don't care what anybody says about him

17
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,270
being crazy.
Alex Jones is my friend and I love that

18
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,700
guy.
He's a big sweet teddy bear.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,760
He's a super nice guy.
Does he get humor all?

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,470
Oh yeah.
He comes to comedy shows all the time.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,910
It's a fucking big comedy fan because I
saw Doug,

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,930
Stan Ho,
Doug.

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,960
Doug's been friends with them too and I
said I've gone with him once and it just

24
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:06,110
seemed like he dug was being hilarious.
It just seemed like he didn't get it.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
What was happening?
Have you ever seen him with Joey Diaz is

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,770
one of the funniest moments in the
history of radio.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,800
They're like bizarro version.
He told Joey Diaz that um,

28
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,820
it was on the Internet.
That's where he fucked up because there

29
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:24,410
was one part that we're dealing.
We're in Austin and we're in studio and

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,720
one part we were doing was on the radio,
radio,

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,651
radio,
radio.

32
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:28,371
You can't swear.
He's like,

33
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,320
well,
this next part is going to be on the

34
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:31,154
Internet,
but uh,

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,140
you know,
you can swear.

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,210
Many of you shouldn't swear,
shouldn't put it,

37
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:35,330
but if you do,
it's no big deal.

38
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:39,800
No one's going to go to jail.
So all of a sudden Joey Diaz realized as

39
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,260
the flood gates are open.
So he just,

40
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,161
I mean,
Joe,

41
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,600
he's the funniest guy.
He's like,

42
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,310
Oh joke,
he's not the funniest guy that's ever

43
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,770
lived.
He's in the top two or three.

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,860
So he is amazing.

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,810
Just goes off.
And I'm just sitting there red faced and

46
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,510
crying and laughing.
I'm laughing so hard.

47
00:01:55,511 --> 00:02:00,490
I can't breathe.
And he just had alex to do with it.

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,380
They know what to do with it.
He was trying to juggle it.

49
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:07,060
You won't player Jimmy to this part of
it.

50
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,640
Yeah,
but just don't move.

51
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,460
And he was dancing and singing and
Mexico.

52
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,640
He's done oxygen.
No,

53
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,370
not a junkie is a junkie.
The junkie is a junkie.

54
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,890
Everyday.
He doesn't wake up singing dance and

55
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:20,380
then he has oxygen tanks at night.
Something's not right.

56
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,360
Michael Jackson case.
You're worth more dead than what you are

57
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,350
alive.
You understand me?

58
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,770
He and now they got a new record coming
out that no more.

59
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,800
He's doing a tour next year with the
people from Vegas that jump up and down

60
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:36,850
the blue band group,
but he's worth more now than he's ever

61
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,550
been.
Michael Jackson was up to me.

62
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,670
What?
I know.

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,500
I smoke a little joint.
I'll break it down,

64
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,690
break it down,
because he bought the music from Paul

65
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,970
Mccartney back and all of a sudden they.
They put Paul Mccartney,

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,470
the soup bowl.
They tried to build up the Beatles to

67
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,780
get to Jackson.
By the way,

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,460
we're so high right now so high.
Like we got barbecue

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,293
before this thing.

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Obama is a strategy,
keep going know what to

71
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,150
do you,
but what to do,

72
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,990
never be on the air,
so most of this is on the regular radio

73
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:26,370
until joey finds out that the radio,
see if he could find where it goes off

74
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,380
because he only goes off for like five
minutes,

75
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,620
but he's screaming and yelling about
going to the TSA with a bag of weed

76
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:36,621
under his balls and Alex just try to
bring it back to Hillary Clinton,

77
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,880
a knee elites.
I would never want to try and compete

78
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:41,880
with Joey Diaz.
Will you just got to let him go.

79
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,050
Let him go.
I'm telling you,

80
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,840
joey loves Alex to Joey and Alex.
they went to

81
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,090
stinking,
stinking up a storm.

82
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,170
Not to mention my balls.
I'm sweating now because I'm going to go

83
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:00,010
to jail.
Shook my hand.

84
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,810
I'm like,
my tax payers are work a politician.

85
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,430
Nice talking to you.
Like a Christian.

86
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,830
Someone already edited.
Oh,

87
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,530
this is someone else's edit obviously,
because that's where he goes.

88
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,780
You get take a taxi.
When?

89
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,210
What does he yell out?
Oh yeah,

90
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,080
a pig.
Dixon gas is bad for your health state.

91
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,500
Black and then he leaves this to black.
That's the most important thing.

92
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,210
I mean he just.
He knows when to exit the room.

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,593
No,
that's.

94
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,940
Go Fuck Yourself.
You can hold on.

95
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:35,010
Hold on one second.
Don't take the shuttle.

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,720
Joey Diaz.
Facebook.

97
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,330
Check yourself before you wreck
yourself.

98
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,070
Big Dixon.
Yes.

99
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,820
This is the.
I'm drawing

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,060
a blank because that's the most
important.

101
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,840
The only way to deal with,
but I'm telling you Alex,

102
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,880
a good guy.
Nice guy.

103
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,880
He just.
He's just balls deep in that world.

104
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,820
He's balls deep in the.
You got to get dried food.

105
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,680
You need gold.
He believes half the half of the shit he

106
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,970
say and I think he just knows he gets
hits.

107
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,390
We've got hypnotic brain pills at the
CIA.

108
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:24,220
Found in a basement.
Charlton Heston uncover this years ago

109
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,360
and was silenced for it.
The crane pills.

110
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,810
You've got to get silver and your veins
and they drink that silver water.

111
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,370
I had a buddy of mine,
he used to do that.

112
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,610
He used to have a like a rod that you
would electrify.

113
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,100
You would like.
It would have like wires on it and you

114
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,480
would dip it in water.
I'm like,

115
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,980
what are you doing?
And he's like,

116
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:45,340
you're making some sort of a silver
drink and if you have a cold,

117
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,070
you drink that.
You're good.

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,281
I,
yeah.

119
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,560
If you spend,
if you spend your whole hour telling

120
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:55,090
people that they need to fear for their
lives and then go and then go buy the

121
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:56,470
survival garden,
it's like,

122
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,410
yeah,
you just us,

123
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,230
we need the survival

124
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,330
garden.
Set it up.

125
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,510
He sells some good fucking survival food
though.

126
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,240
If you want some solid survival food.
Jesus Christ.

127
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,060
There was a video that Duncan sent me
yesterday.

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,030
Um,
this dude put together of Jim Baker,

129
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,670
the Jim Baker.
Do you know Jim Baker's back?

130
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,490
And when trump won,
I mean they were like,

131
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,890
it was like Jesus came home.
You got to put in.

132
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,580
Watch this video because I put it,
see how much of it we can watch.

133
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,410
How much of it can we watch without
getting kicked off?

134
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,090
We just put a little bit of it in the
background,

135
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,280
but it's the actual Jim Baker show,
Jim Baker as an actual show now,

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,980
and he.
He sells food.

137
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,740
He sells dried food,
like survival food that you.

138
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,630
They're advertising it as furniture.
You stack it around your dinner table

139
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,460
table on showing it and I sell it.
Somebody had that furniture to to run

140
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:53,171
for your lives up on the stage.
He has a whole setup on the state.

141
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,180
Pretty sure we can't play this.
Okay.

142
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,890
Does this the one that was on my twitter
feed?

143
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,570
Look at this guy.
Yeah.

144
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,970
This is it.
This is who put this together.

145
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:04,010
What is the guy's named?
Super Deluxe.

146
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,210
What's that number?
Twitter.

147
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,680
Super Deluxe,
but that's it.

148
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,533
Just super deluxe.
Yeah.

149
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,160
Fucking.
Oh,

150
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,330
youtube.
Super Deluxe.

151
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,100
Whoever you are.
You've asked man,

152
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,630
this is God damn genius.
This is

153
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,340
the survival food.
Genocide.

154
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,360
No,
I love that because that was the number

155
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,880
one problem with survival food is what
do you do with it all?

156
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,140
So you've got to make it furniture

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,130
fracture and people's houses.
I mean,

158
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:33,350
he's doing all this shit with this with
a straight face.

159
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,620
This guy's a maniac.
That's crazy.

160
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,760
And he's making cash.
I almost want to like.

161
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,720
I would almost like to get that guy high
and get him on the podcast.

162
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,160
How bizarre would it be done in a boy
and a little hat like that baby?

163
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,760
Like if you could just talk him into
going camping with you and slip them a

164
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,210
couple of edibles.
You know,

165
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,740
Derek,
it would wake all these.

166
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,150
What would Alex Jones be like?
I got to settle down.

167
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,740
I got to relax.
I'm just setting.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,380
The elites are just got me so fucking
riled up.

169
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,240
I just want to start.
Did you.

170
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,120
Did you see Eric Andre when he kind of
crashed Alex Jones things at the agency.

171
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,390
I just ran into him at the airport.
Yeah,

172
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,390
he's hilarious.
Alex Jones thinks he's with the daily

173
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:22,210
show so that Eric Andre is in the crowd.
He's like,

174
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,590
he's like,
let's get to the daily show up here.

175
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,500
Bring him up and bring him up here.
She'll come up here and come over and he

176
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:28,780
goes,
this guy's a Pentagon shuttle for the

177
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:31,720
daily show,
and Eric Andre is like,

178
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,810
I'm not with the daily show.
And then he got my own show and then he

179
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:39,790
goes,
I want to sleep with your wife Alex.

180
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,890
oh no.
I was just like,

181
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,880
what are you talking about?
He's like,

182
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,481
no,
I really.

183
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,590
I want to sleep with you,
or no,

184
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,850
I want you to sit with my wife.
I'll give you the room cave.

185
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,700
You sleep with my wife,
and I was just like,

186
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,710
I don't know what's going on.

187
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,530
He's a.
he's susceptible to manipulation.

188
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,880
Say that he can be trolled.
He's a good dude though.

189
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,983
I swear to God.
He is.

190
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,440
I've known Alex forever.
I've known him since [inaudible] 99.

191
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,461
Really?
Yeah.

192
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,970
We did a video together a long time ago
with me and him dressed up like George

193
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,340
Bush running around the capitol.
We went into the bathroom and smoke

194
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,350
bongs.
No,

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,480
it was hilarious because I offered them
a hit of the Bong and he goes,

196
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,410
uh,
I don't do that shit.

197
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:17,244
Makes me paranoid.

198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,870
Does he
do that?

199
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,050
Makes him very though it was an inside
joke.

200
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:24,800
That was fun.
Uh,

201
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,700
and did he have the same stake then?
Look Dude,

202
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,540
he was doing that long

203
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,373
for.
I'm Adam.

204
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm Adam.
He would like fucking like Herbert

205
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,300
Walker.
Bush would be somewhere and he would,

206
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,730
you know,
meet there and call him a war criminal

207
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,660
and yell out and get arrested.
And there was actually,

208
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,220
it was like Gw when he was running for
president.

209
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,720
I thanks.
Alex got arrested.

210
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,730
He got arrested a gang at times,
you know.

211
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,850
And the thing is Alex had some,
he was right about a lot of shit

212
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,510
and this is where it gets wet in a war.
Criminals fine.

213
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,810
It was right about the NSA stuff.
He was saying from a long time ago.

214
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,990
I mean years before the Edward Snowden
Shit came out.

215
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,560
He was like,

216
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,520
I guarantee you there is a place right
now where they are dumping all of your

217
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,230
information.
They collect data.

218
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,020
They have the capability that,
that was like,

219
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:10,860
come on man,
who's,

220
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,880
who's copying all the emails?
And that's the thing.

221
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,660
Could you imagine 15 years ago you said
they're watching everything.

222
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,240
They know your emails that you.
Anyone said that you were like,

223
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,680
all right,
let's get the fuck away from this guy

224
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,700
right now.
Everyone's like,

225
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,360
oh yeah,
sure.

226
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,290
They're like,
how quickly they changed so quick.

227
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,770
It's like you just assume we're still
NSA.

228
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,190
Nsa and privacy were mentioned in the
three presidential bates,

229
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:36,940
one vice president Dennis was a zero.
It never came up in all the best.

230
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,570
This is the largest surveillance
infrastructure ever created,

231
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,880
not mentioned in the presidential
debates.

232
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,070
Never discussed.
Fucking insane.

233
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:45,180
Right?
That's like,

234
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,180
that's almost like the agreement,
like you guys conduct shit about each

235
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,920
other.
All you want started talking about the

236
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,720
NSA,
we're going to have a real fucking

237
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,231
problem.
I mean,

238
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:55,500
that's the number one way that they
honestly like mainstream media and all

239
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,510
this shit lies to us.
It's just ignoring stuff.

240
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,700
It's not.
It's not usually flat out lies.

241
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,810
It's just we're not going to talk about
it.

242
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,350
I'll tell you what,

243
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,110
man.
There was a really impressive moment

244
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,540
where I was like,
I was really impressed with Obama as a

245
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,590
person where he was at this,
they were doing this campaign speech and

246
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:16,580
this guy that trump supporter was in the
crowd and this guy was a throwing a flag

247
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:21,020
up there is a trump flag and waving and
he's an older guy and he had like some

248
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,560
sort of military outfit on and he's
yelling out,

249
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,820
you know,
trump and he's kind of sign up and all

250
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,970
these people are billing and Obama stops
him and he goes and he goes,

251
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,350
first of all,
he goes,

252
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,080
this is a gentleman,
he's an older gentleman.

253
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:35,960
We should respect our elders,
so let's think about that.

254
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,940
And he goes,
and it looks like he's done some

255
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:40,880
military service,
has got a military so we should respect

256
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:43,720
our veterans.
And then he got it,

257
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,930
got to the singles.
He goes,

258
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,560
don't boo vote,
don't vote videos.

259
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
We respect freedom

260
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,010
speech like don't boo this map.
Yeah,

261
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,280
I

262
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,960
liked that,
but the whole respect,

263
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:59,350
the veterans thing,
when you don't fucking fund their

264
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,970
medical care,
when they get home,

265
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,680
we treat them like shit and then they
go,

266
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,610
oh,
respect them though.

267
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,620
Like you're totally right.
You're totally right.

268
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,460
It drives me nuts

269
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,240
more in a leadership role or as a
respect someone for like the way to

270
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:13,380
handle a delicate situation like that.
Yeah,

271
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,000
I agree with that because I think,
I mean ultimately you do have to be

272
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,790
concerned and we've been talking about
this with the whole trump thing.

273
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,140
You don't have to be concerned as much
about what trump's going to be able to

274
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:29,141
do as you do about people that see trump
in office and they getting bold and to

275
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:33,590
be assholes because I really think that
there's some people that are on the

276
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:36,880
fucking fence to asshole fence go one
way or another.

277
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,620
Oh yeah.
Then they might go full asshole,

278
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,460
full asshole doors open.
It's not trump's fault.

279
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,700
It's not trump's fault,
but it's a reality of being the person

280
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,940
who's setting the tone for the way the
country thinks of itself.

281
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:49,960
Right?
Oh absolutely.

282
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,170
And here's part of the,
the maybe the positive of having someone

283
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,470
like trump in the presidency is this
country,

284
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,490
like,
you know,

285
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,390
racism being an ass hole,
treating people like shit that's been

286
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,560
part of this country,
that is as long as we didn't have a

287
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:08,020
leader that you didn't think represented
that people were like,

288
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:08,501
oh,
okay,

289
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:12,910
we'll just keep going at this rate.
Whereas now people like are looking at

290
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,220
it.
Maybe we needed this ugly orange face as

291
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,440
the face of things to really be like,
Hey,

292
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:20,890
what is going on with the,
with the xenophobia and the racism and

293
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:21,850
what is,
what is the deal,

294
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:22,750
man,
we needed that face.

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,890
Well,
it definitely it.

296
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,280
It highlights the fact that it's a giant
issue still.

297
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,800
People that don't think it's an issue
because they don't see it in front of

298
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:32,040
their face that you're forced to look at
it now it doesn't,

299
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,740
you know,
this is something that Alonzo Bowden

300
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:38,610
said during the young Turks,
a coverage of the election that was so

301
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,870
on.
He goes,

302
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,510
he goes,
not all trump supporters are racist,

303
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:47,511
but all racists are trump supporters.
That he nailed it.

304
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,250
Is there,
they're not racist,

305
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:53,850
but he has a number one with racists
racists or voted for Hillary.

306
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,210
She get in that boat.
You know,

307
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,600
it's funny,
man.

308
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,490
It's funny.
It's a great point.

309
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,250
It's dead on.
It's you.

310
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,500
GotTa worry about the tone.
I mean,

311
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:10,950
it sounds ridiculous to someone who's
like got sovereignty,

312
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,070
someone with personal sovereignty,
somebody who knows who they are and

313
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:16,220
isn't so easily swayed and like,
that's not gonna.

314
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,930
Make me an asshole.
It probably won't make you an asshole.

315
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,830
Right.
But there's,

316
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,990
there's a guy.
Yeah,

317
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,040
that guy.
There's a bunch of those guys.

318
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:27,350
There's a lot of disenfranchised men out
there and this is where

319
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,680
I really put it on on,
you know,

320
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,230
the mainstream media is they legitimize
some of the shit that trump says or

321
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:36,980
whatever trump supporters say that is
just crackpot nuts.

322
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,730
Like when CNN had the Kyron that said
are Jews people?

323
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,660
And it's like,
oh you didn't hear about this.

324
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,210
And it went kind of viral.
They were,

325
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,140
they were saying,
hey,

326
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:48,580
this crazy white supremacists,
or maybe there's someone in Toronto

327
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,220
having something to do with trump said
has in past question

328
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,430
whether Jews or people or something,
so then they run with the chirons says

329
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:56,390
are Jews people?
It's like,

330
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,010
well now this is a legitimate
discussion.

331
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,050
You just made this a legitimate
discussion.

332
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,830
Instead of just ignoring it.
Instead they're like,

333
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:05,300
hey,
let's have a panel to discuss.

334
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,470
Dude,
you smell funny.

335
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,330
It's a human.
Legitimize this shit.

336
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,180
If Jews are people,
there you go,

337
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,960
so fucking stupid.
That sounds like if someone gave the

338
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,620
news to people in the 15 hundreds and
said,

339
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:18,880
listen,
it's time.

340
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,340
This is a new technology.
If you imagine if he gave it to people

341
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,710
are just people.
I'm not sure

342
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,380
that's something we should discuss.
Let's sit down.

343
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,210
Talk about this.
What kind of people discuss where

344
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,070
they're not?
Usually people are like,

345
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,990
what else is Santa Claus Real?
Is that next?

346
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,750
What about Rudolph?
Was he a real character or is that a

347
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,370
mythical creature?
Is he an analogy as enl allegory?

348
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,020
What is he?
They gave $5,

349
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,120
million dollars of free coverage to
trump twice as much as hillary in the

350
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,250
primaries,
23 times as much as Bernie,

351
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,510
and they wonder how trump got elected.
It's like help themselves.

352
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,360
He was a master at manipulating them in
that regard.

353
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,880
Say controversial things,
whether it was on purpose or not.

354
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,110
Wow.
Jesus Christ,

355
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:01,160
fully.
God dammit.

356
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,180
People could die.

357
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,910
You're.
You're the first guest to do that.

358
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,370
I'm a fuck load of time.
Shit.

359
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,670
I've wrecked at least two laptops on the
show live.

360
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,193
We're good,
dude.

361
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,250
It.
I just did it.

362
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,370
Oh my God.
What a cluster fuck here.

363
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:20,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
at least she knows.

364
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,030
That's a good host is you wanted to make
me feel better about.

365
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm just a slob.
Clumsy Dork,

366
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,440
but we're good.
Nothing got zapped.

367
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,110
We're good.
We were just talking about

368
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,300
country.
Trump and media.

369
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,470
The endless media coverage

370
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,100
can awesome job,
but you know what?

371
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,650
There's the possibility,
like I would like to think that we

372
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:48,120
watched some genius chess play by a
master of the media,

373
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,380
which he most certainly is,
right?

374
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,600
I had a guy absolutely television
forever,

375
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,000
but

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,040
I really wonder,
do you,

377
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,790
I mean,
do you have thoughts on who he,

378
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,400
what he genuinely believes?
That's the question.

379
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,040
No idea.

380
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,690
I thought that was my question.
I was going to say,

381
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,130
do you think that.
Did we watch a master manipulator or did

382
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:08,150
he just get lucky that his personality
like totally works right now?

383
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,730
Now like that,
everything is lined up for you to be the

384
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,190
guy that says,
you know,

385
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,030
you should grab chips by the pussy and
everything goes.

386
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,290
That's locker room talk.

387
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,120
I think so.
I think it's a little bit of both.

388
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:23,010
I think it's the perfect time for him
combined with a great manipulation.

389
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,410
Here's the thing,
if you didn't have people struggling so

390
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,880
hard,
if you didn't have this quote unquote

391
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,580
recovery all going to the top one
percent,

392
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,660
people wouldn't have gotten behind this.
You needed a populace that is furious

393
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:36,450
and struggling and miserable to get
behind this.

394
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,030
Isn't that weird?
A populace that is furious and

395
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:42,370
struggling and miserable wants to get
behind a dude who's a billionaire is

396
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,990
probably
get there.

397
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,870
I mean the whole thing is like,
I mean,

398
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,070
how much tooth Fang

399
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,030
and claw competition in businesses,
that guy had been involved in probably a

400
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,960
fuck load.
Right.

401
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,660
It sounds like every deal he's ever
signed,

402
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,690
he reneges on like half of it.
Like it's hilarious.

403
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,880
Like when,
when they were talking to him,

404
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:05,560
but during the debate when Hillary to
brought up the taxes and not pay any

405
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,400
taxes because I'm smart.
Yeah,

406
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:07,840
yeah,
yeah.

407
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,000
Well,
but he got away with it,

408
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,500
but you know why he gets away with it?
Cause he goes,

409
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,240
yeah,
those laws shouldn't be there.

410
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,970
But since they are,
I'm not going to not use them.

411
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,410
Of course I'm going to use them.
He goes,

412
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,870
but let's take them out.
Let's take those logs out.

413
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,130
People wanted someone who just said,
fuck the system,

414
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,410
which,
which it's hilarious that you then get

415
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,960
behind a billionaire is the guy who's
gonna say fuck the system.

416
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,510
No,
but he's also a populist.

417
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,500
That's what's weird.
Like,

418
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,580
he likes to be popular,
you know,

419
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,350
and you have a unique opportunity with a
guy like him or I don't think he's gonna

420
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,040
be as influenced by other people as
we've had presidents before.

421
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,700
You know,
we've had presidents before they get

422
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:46,290
into the office and I'm like,
Oh my God,

423
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,640
this guy's not doing anything.
He said,

424
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,430
all right,
let me know.

425
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,263
Say who they are,
right?

426
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,350
Obama,
all of them.

427
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,660
Right.
All right,

428
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,390
but this is the first time a guy has
gotten in that like the,

429
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,200
the,
the party itself doesn't even want them

430
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,270
in there when they were trying to force
them out,

431
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,850
like everybody didn't want them in.
Everybody was saying,

432
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:07,300
there's no way we can lift this guy.
You know?

433
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,000
Basically the Republicans tried to rig
their primary to beat trump and failed

434
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,280
the democrats rigged to their primary
and succeeded.

435
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,720
That was the only difference.
Yeah.

436
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,040
It's fascinating,
isn't it?

437
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,470
Like they fucked over that Bernie
Sanders guy.

438
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,360
Oh man,
on every level we,

439
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,670
I covered this unredacted and I like
endlessly.

440
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,110
I just couldn't get enough of it.
It was like,

441
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,060
it was like on every was like voter
suppression,

442
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,730
closing polling places,
you know,

443
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,580
x opposed aren't matching up just at
media manipulation 23 times as much

444
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,580
coverage as I was saying for trump and
and like 10 times as much coverage for

445
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,610
Hillary as Bernie Sanders.
It was just like an every level they

446
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:42,390
tried to force through their candidate.
He would have been great.

447
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,760
Yeah,
I think Bernie would have been really

448
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,310
interesting.
I think Bernie running against trump

449
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,880
would have been way less vulnerable.
He was a,

450
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,990
he had way less skeletons in the closet.
Yeah.

451
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,710
He was pretty much an open book.
He also didn't,

452
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,290
he,
he had immense like compared to hillary

453
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,640
immense unfavorability numbers.

454
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,510
Whereas Hillary just had crazy
unfavorability.

455
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,610
Well he was,
he represented character to us.

456
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,880
Thirty years of saying the 30,
40 years of saying the same stuff.

457
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,430
Whereas Hillary from week to week,
you didn't know what she stood for.

458
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,410
Yeah.
And even the way looks,

459
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
you know,
like he represents character.

460
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,000
He represents this,
this,

461
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,440
you know,
disheveled,

462
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,820
really smart guy with his glasses and
his jacket and he's not trying to look

463
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,710
good at all.
He didn't have any orange makeup on.

464
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,611
He's like,
really?

465
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:31,470
The polar opposite of trump.
I would love a guy that cares more about

466
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,510
getting shit done than his hair.
I would love that.

467
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,350
Also seems to care about people whether
you agree with them or not.

468
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,510
I think that guy,
he genuinely cares about people.

469
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,670
Hopefully I'm not getting bullshitted,
you know,

470
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,340
because he is a politician.
Here's how you know a little something

471
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,100
is you don't spend 30 years in
government and not

472
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,810
get rich unless you've got other goals.
It's like everybody has been in Congress

473
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,470
that long is a multimillionaire.
Hinton.

474
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,140
He's not

475
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,310
waste from Vermont,
right?

476
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,930
Yeah.
They're all hippies up there.

477
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,990
They're all hippies and farmers in
Vermont is weird.

478
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,980
I had been going on a bunch of Ben and
Jerry's Vermont to too.

479
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,380
It's so weird.
It's great.

480
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,500
Don't get me wrong.
It is a great place like Burlington.

481
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,500
That place is amazing.
I did a gig up there once.

482
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:14,161
I was like,
wow,

483
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,110
this is like a little frozen paradise up
here,

484
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,570
like this little small town of like
hippie people and they always go against

485
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,480
whatever's going on around them.
How do you get like a group?

486
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,340
Is that.
It has to be a university town.

487
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:30,030
It's the only way you get like a group
of liberals in a mountain.

488
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,970
Right?

489
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,960
Well they uh,
yeah,

490
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,390
and then into,
I mean guesses universities there too,

491
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:37,150
but in some of these southern towns it's
just like they all fleet to one city.

492
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:38,410
It's like Asheville,
North Carolina,

493
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,940
just like we got to get together.

494
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,650
But that's the university too.
That's where Duncan went to school.

495
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,730
Asheville's amazing.
It's amazing.

496
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:50,720
It's such a great little town the best
and now like the people are so cool.

497
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:54,890
It's like you guys are like,
if you took like 30,000 of the best

498
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:57,770
people from Austin and brought them in
North Carolina,

499
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,600
that's what Asheville is.
It's like,

500
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,610
what are you guys doing here?
Like this is weird,

501
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,390
really cool bars.
Everybody walks around.

502
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:05,560
Okay.

503
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,200
But played there like six months ago and
I told them,

504
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,360
I was like,
you guys should build a wall around the

505
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:13,210
city.
It's great here.

506
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,220
Yeah.
That's the.

507
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
The area outside of it.

508
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,320
It's very strange.
There's still parts of this country that

509
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:22,190
haven't recovered from the civil war.
Really?

510
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,700
Yeah.
No,

511
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,510
I know.
No,

512
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,110
there's parts of this country we were
driving through and we'll.

513
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,940
You'll run into small towns that still
have like the vague echoes of the city.

514
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,740
Dude.
I grew up in Richmond,

515
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:35,720
Virginia.
I'm named after Robert e Dot Lee.

516
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,940
Oh my God.
I went.

517
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,550
Really?
Yeah.

518
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,130
My high school,
my high school was the confederate

519
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:41,670
rebels.
Whole Mascot.

520
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,910
Did you got to have a rebel flag?
Rebel flag.

521
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,980
We had a rebel flag the first year I was
there.

522
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,830
Then they finally decided that it was a
offensive.

523
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,980
So they took away the flag but kept the
rebel soldiers the fast.

524
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,380
Oh my God.
Wow.

525
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,790
Dad Drinking whiskey.
What is that?

526
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,310
It's just water.
It's water and like a flask.

527
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,720
Yep.
What do they do?

528
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,540
And I try and get crafty.
Getting crap.

529
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:01,750
So.
So

530
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,500
it's Fred.
My name is Fred drink.

531
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:06,940
My water came off my breast.
Fresh water.

532
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,870
That's water.
That's how you advertise it during.

533
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
You just change the shape of the bottle.
Yeah,

534
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:12,610
he made it.
He made me talk about it.

535
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,680
Why is his name on the front of the
bottle?

536
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,150
Isn't that water?
She didn't just say water.

537
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:17,560
You fuck.
Say Fred.

538
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,480
Fred is in giant letters and underneath
it in tiny letters it says water.

539
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,260
Look at that.
That's ridiculous for it.

540
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,090
But here I am.
I'm talking to him about he won.

541
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,000
Were you surprised when they pulled the,
uh,

542
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,300
the confederate flag off the generally
you'd have freak you out?

543
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,210
Say Generally?
Yeah,

544
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,091
dude,
I had that.

545
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:40,660
I had the Dukes of hazzard bedsheets.
I think I had the poster,

546
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,830
the poster when they pulled the,
uh,

547
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,380
off TV land.
I was like,

548
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,010
Whoa,

549
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,690
dude.
Is it different history growing up in

550
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,501
Richmond,
Virginia,

551
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:51,350
it was,
I was 12 before anyone mentioned we lost

552
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,300
the civil war.
That was like,

553
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,530
wait,
we didn't win.

554
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,920
So you knew there was a civil war,
but you didn't know that the south lost?

555
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,211
No,
I just,

556
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:00,710
yeah,
because it's because it's talked about

557
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,570
like uh,
like almost like a victory because they

558
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,420
talk about it like all the grand old
times of civil war and stuff like that.

559
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,500
Do they really?
Yeah.

560
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,334
And,
and I was like,

561
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,151
I was like,
wait,

562
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:13,151
we lost what
all the monument avenue in Richmond,

563
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:17,840
Virginia is basically all civil war,
quote unquote heroes meaning the losers.

564
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,543
Wow.

565
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,410
It's crazy that,
that was so recent that 18,

566
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:29,411
65 was so recent 100 years ago.
There was like slavery pretty much.

567
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,120
Pretty close in 1916.
I mean there's probably,

568
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,610
well,
there's slavery now.

569
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,070
It's been that long.
Well yeah,

570
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,180
they're asleep.
That's the craziest thing.

571
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,100
Well,
there's not slavery now necessarily in

572
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:43,100
America,
but there's more slaves in the world now

573
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,830
because there's more people also.
There are,

574
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,070
there are more black people in prison
right now than the were slaves during

575
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,320
the civil war.
We imprison so many people and those

576
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:54,260
people are largely,
a lot of them are forced to labor for

577
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:54,891
like,
you know,

578
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,630
a nickel an hour or whatever.
So we,

579
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,430
because we have a,
we have a stipulation in the

580
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,680
constitution that you can have slavery
as long as they're in prison.

581
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,860
We've been talking about that a lot.
There's apparently there's a documentary

582
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:04,850
about that on Netflix.

583
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,170
Thirteenth.
Did you see it?

584
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,460
How is it?
It's great.

585
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,740
I keep hearing it.
I get real close to and I go,

586
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,480
God damn.
I haven't caught up on narcos.

587
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,350
Yeah,
I it,

588
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,370
but I got like one episode left and no
need to be entertained.

589
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,570
I want to watch westworld.
Sorry.

590
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,990
It's not looking good for Escobar.
It's not looking good man.

591
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,260
I'm worried what's going to have to.
But he is the star of the show.

592
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,260
How are you going to have another
season?

593
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,890
Just seems like he's digging a hole for
himself and he's just not going to come

594
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,350
out.
He should start treating people better.

595
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,600
I mean,
you keep killing people.

596
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,390
Eventually someone's going to kill you.
That's just what I think.

597
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,400
Uh,
he just said thank you a little more

598
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,540
please.
And thank you.

599
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,050
It is absolutely insane that you can
have a minimum wage except when you've

600
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,940
trapped someone for a crime.

601
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
Then not only do they have to pay for
that crime by being incarcerated,

602
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:56,460
but then they have to work and make
pennies to it.

603
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,870
It is such a.
it's such a game like that.

604
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,600
Another great book by T v is the divide
talks about this.

605
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,580
It's like it's like Matt,
Matt,

606
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,290
Matt Taibbi.
Then the cops just running.

607
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,400
They'll run around,
look for mostly black people standing on

608
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,160
the corner sometimes in front of their
own apartment,

609
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,190
charge them for loitering or something
and then and then they take a plea deal

610
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:17,390
because they're told like,
Hey,

611
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:20,450
do you want months of a trial where you
could spend a year in jail or do you

612
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:23,420
want to take this plea deal and just
have a tiny charge until they all take

613
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,760
the collegial.
So now they're in the system and it's

614
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:29,720
just designed as this railroading so
crazy.

615
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,370
It's so crazy that people have made an
industry off of like there's money to be

616
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:37,910
made from keeping people locked up.
It's just the way that we have allowed

617
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:41,600
that to happen.
It's so shameful because it's sort of

618
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,130
just everybody sort of woke up as adults

619
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:44,963
and was like,
what?

620
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,230
How many,
how many private prisons are that we

621
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,540
make?
How many people are in jail?

622
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,880
We didn't even know what percentage of
who or what.

623
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,340
We're five percent of the world's
population.

624
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:55,050
Twenty five percent of the world's
prisoners.

625
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,730
We have way more prisoners than any
country and it's all like it's going on

626
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,290
without us looking,
you know?

627
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,230
I mean,
they're not obviously for violent

628
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:06,390
crimes,
but let's just talk about the nonviolent

629
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:06,850
ones.
Yeah.

630
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,310
It isn't that like 50 percent.
Yeah,

631
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:11,670
it's a huge.
Most people in prison are nonviolent,

632
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,420
so 50 percent of them are locked up in
jail for something nonviolent.

633
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,730
And then what percentage those are
drugs,

634
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,830
I don't know,
but it's.

635
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,441
Yeah,
it's a lot.

636
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,260
A lot of this has to do with a lot of
this has to do with the drug wars.

637
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,220
Yeah,
I mean

638
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,770
I think like deft and obviously all the
violent crimes,

639
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,950
but all those things that they sort of
rationalizes you need some sort of

640
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,970
punishment,
but has anybody ever even proven the

641
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:34,980
prison is effective?

642
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,540
No,
that's not at all.

643
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,810
It could be because here's the thing is
that it destroys most people's lives.

644
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,540
They can't get a job when they get out,
their family's been broken up,

645
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:46,650
their community's been broken up.
So it's like you get out and then how do

646
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:47,910
you put things together?
So it,

647
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,750
it doesn't help people.
It doesn't help them get to a regular,

648
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:53,490
you know,
upstanding citizen level.

649
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,650
It's a lot of people.
It institutionalizes.

650
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,543
Yeah.
Yeah.

651
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,580
Yeah.
So,

652
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,570
but here's the thing,
the big question is like,

653
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,850
what,
what could be done that's better?

654
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,111
What does that say,
Jamie?

655
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:05,550
Would you putting up?
Well,

656
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,200
first of all,
if it's a nonviolent,

657
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,710
you know,
I think you shouldn't,

658
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,680
you shouldn't be in jail.
You got that one,

659
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,060
stick it out.
What do you think it is?

660
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,150
Um,
with a different offenses.

661
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,130
Oh,
that's,

662
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,230
is that drugs,
drug charges on the giant.

663
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,300
When's a drug charges?
Oh my God.

664
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,750
See,
that's crazy.

665
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,680
Six percent.
Oh my God.

666
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,410
That's crazy.
Look at those numbers.

667
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,820
The only.
The only thing.

668
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,830
Scroll down a little more.
Yeah.

669
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:34,170
The only thing,
even above 10 percent is drugs.

670
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,004
Okay.
And weapons.

671
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,070
Here's the thing.
You're not stopping people from selling

672
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,270
drugs,
obviously.

673
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,770
Plus there's a bunch of other drugs that
are available legally with

674
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:47,730
prescriptions.
You need to stop this illegal drug

675
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:49,950
thing.
You need to stop telling grown adults

676
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:53,700
what they can or can't do.
Keep it away from children.

677
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,280
Make strict laws about the age
restrictions.

678
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,140
Put a lot of money into education and
stop putting people in cages for doing

679
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,770
things.
They want to do like coke,

680
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,790
so when he wants to do coke,
let them go do coke.

681
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,630
What do you give a fuck?
They can go drink whiskey and die and

682
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,530
everybody's fine with that,
and then people go,

683
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:11,240
oh,
well they.

684
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,550
They do coke and they commit crimes.
Well then arrest them for the crimes.

685
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,450
You don't arrest them for the coke.
Alcohol is a huge factor in.

686
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:19,840
In crimes.
Yeah.

687
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,500
How many people have committed horrible
crimes because they'd been drunk?

688
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,590
Yeah,
it's and fights and beating the shit out

689
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:27,270
of people.
That's all alcohol.

690
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,700
I was running a gang of drunk people
last night.

691
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,330
Stone sober.
It's not.

692
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,820
Not a good time.
Not a good time.

693
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,020
Not a good time.
And people are.

694
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,290
They get fucking crazy.
Especially.

695
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,350
I would hate to be a woman at a bar.
Yeah,

696
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,220
fucking

697
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,580
sleazeballs and is the thing.
I love drinking.

698
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,120
I love my whiskey.
I'm fucking big fan,

699
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,000
but if you can't handle it,
want to drink right now.

700
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,550
Now I got to drive.
Drive somewhere.

701
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,740
I was little drinky poos.
Just one little slip,

702
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:59,060
but the good stuff.
We're going to little Daniel.

703
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,550
Oh yeah,
man.

704
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,310
Booze is a sketchy drug because I enjoy
it.

705
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,440
I like it.
But is it for everybody?

706
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,900
It's like there's a lot of things like
that though.

707
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,720
Try.
How about how come you can just go to a

708
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:17,590
Chevrolet dealership and buy a corvette?
Do you know how to drive that thing?

709
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,320
You know how to drive.
I know you know how to hit your blinker.

710
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,770
You don't have to handle a 600
horsepower fucking demon ride.

711
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,770
You could just buy that these cars
today,

712
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,840
because of the horsepower wars,
every year,

713
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:30,640
they're ramping up their speed,
their ramping up,

714
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:32,920
their handling,
the ramp it up to the breaking,

715
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,950
like the distance between like zero to
60 breaking or $60,

716
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,290
zero the day.
Those things are super cars now and any

717
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,530
regular kid,
if you have enough money to like what?

718
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,300
What's the corvette like?
50,000 or $60,000.

719
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,550
If you can,
you can get that money together somehow

720
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:51,580
and get that loan.
You can have something that's insane,

721
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,460
right?
You could just drive right into people

722
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:57,700
and kill people.
Like the responsibility having a big

723
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,130
giant truck.
The responsibility of driving that

724
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,980
thing,
like all those things are dangerous

725
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,620
and we allow people to do it

726
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,560
and so yeah,
I mean,

727
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,690
yeah,
we accept that there is a certain level

728
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:13,220
of harm or death for things that we want
as freedoms and that should be.

729
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,010
That should go through a lot of things.
It should go through with drugs.

730
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:18,980
It's like there's a certain level of pl
harm or death people might do to

731
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:20,450
themselves and they start doing it to
others.

732
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:21,320
We arrest them for that.

733
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,490
One of the things I was thinking about
when I brought up the,

734
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:24,510
uh,
the car thing,

735
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:28,740
so I wanted to ask you how you feel
about this oncoming onset of autonomous

736
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:30,490
cars.
So that's happening now.

737
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,680
So here I talked about this last night
in my,

738
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:36,320
in my standup.
So Uber is now put self driving cars in

739
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:38,420
Pittsburgh.
They're trying it out and this is gonna.

740
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,450
This is a massive employer in our
country is transportation.

741
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,480
That's huge.
And those are going away.

742
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:48,710
Those jobs are going to go away soon and
I think that's fine because what that

743
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:51,830
should do if we were fucking rational
beings,

744
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,640
is that should though that time of that
time and money savings should go to

745
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,050
people,
it should go to all of us.

746
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,660
We should all be,
if we hate our job,

747
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:02,330
which we work in less because the
technology can handle it now instead,

748
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:06,590
everybody's just working that goddamn
asses off at jobs they hate because all

749
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,960
of that time and savings is going to
the,

750
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,600
you know,
the elites that run these corporations.

751
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,270
It's not going to the people we are.
We are.

752
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,300
People are working themselves to death
to feed a family.

753
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,080
It's completely nonsense,
but how does that have to do with the

754
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,580
Uber thing though?
What is it?

755
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,460
Transportation is a major employment.
What is it?

756
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,990
Isn't it like 40 something percent of
all white men over a certain age work in

757
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,880
some sort of an industry where they
drive a vehicle?

758
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,800
I'm not sure,
but I'm going up.

759
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,540
I'll use values to say I'm a according
to Joe Rogan

760
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,450
and people will go,
oh,

761
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,190
and they just raise their eyebrows.
Oh,

762
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,530
fear factor.
Guys got opinions on driving,

763
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,990
but no,
I think self driving cars should be

764
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:49,280
great.
They're gonna get better and better and

765
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,580
then the light bulb that when you say
like that,

766
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,640
the money is going away because it's not
really right because someone has to make

767
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,230
those cars.
Someone has to maintain those cars.

768
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:04,010
Someone has to run the uber software.
It's just the driver aspect of it is

769
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,240
going away.
The human labor part is going right,

770
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,480
right,
but all we're making all those cars to

771
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:13,481
begin with,
but if it's way safer and people's lives

772
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:18,470
are saved over people having jobs that
are not like a lot of fun anyway,

773
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,730
like shouldn't that person like for
technological progress,

774
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:24,560
when you look at the future of our
culture,

775
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,220
as much as I love automobiles,
I love them.

776
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,640
I love engineering.
I'm a giant fan of auto engineering,

777
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,060
but they're going to go away.
You're going to have autonomous

778
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:36,770
vehicles.
It's going to happen just like everybody

779
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,120
has a cell phone.
It's almost,

780
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,340
you can't find it.
The hard thing is going to be getting a

781
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:45,070
license to drive a car on your own
without any sort of that electronic to

782
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,340
be sad.
I didn't even think of that.

783
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,380
That's what's going to happen,
man.

784
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:49,400
You gonna have to have a.
like if you have an old corvette or

785
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,080
something like that,
you're going to have to have a license

786
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:55,030
to drive that old corvette with your
shitty has drum brakes and skillset

787
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,590
fucked up tires.
And people like to think,

788
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,360
oh no,
the autonomous thing won't happen

789
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,590
because you know,
on a telesummit,

790
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,440
autonomous car,
autonomous car will kill someone and

791
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,880
then it's like,
well,

792
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,320
yeah,
but they don't need to be better.

793
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,510
They don't need to be the best ever.
They just need to be better than humans.

794
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,750
Humans quickly.
Yeah.

795
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,590
Like they're going to be instantly
better than humans.

796
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,140
And by the way,
with all those sensors that they could

797
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,350
put on those things,
if you ever seen how they respond that

798
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,300
they're really good at responding to
like cars swerving at them,

799
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:22,850
they hit the brakes and if they're all
doing that,

800
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,090
as long as the code is good and the
machinery is good and nothing gets

801
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:28,190
fucked up,
but that's the big thing.

802
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,860
If it gets fucked up,
will it have enough checkpoints like to

803
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,060
be able to do an assessment of itself
and know whether or not should be

804
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,120
driving.
Although here's the,

805
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,990
here's the big question is it'll take
it'll inch,

806
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,900
it'll eventually get to a point where
it's taken away our freedom and a lot of

807
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:45,020
ways because these things are going to
drive the speed limit and you're gonna.

808
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,390
It's gonna drive a fucking nuts.
That's true.

809
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,200
You'd be sitting there and it's going to
become illegal to go above the speed

810
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,270
limit because it's driving.
Cars will go the speed limit.

811
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,900
You're going to have to follow.
The rules can be awful.

812
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,040
We'll just have to find some Russian
dude who knows a guy with a chip hot rod

813
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,900
out your shit.
I got one of those second one of the

814
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,000
bots that breaks the law,
one of the criminal butts.

815
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,510
I mean,
but if if we're going to progress and go

816
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:14,900
from here to some new state of
technological excellence,

817
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,990
which undoubtedly will if we stay alive,
right?

818
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,860
I mean every civilization,
every culture in this country as far as

819
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,960
we've been measuring,
it just keeps getting better and better

820
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,000
and better at figuring things out more
and more efficient.

821
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:29,410
Although we're polluting more and
damaging the earth more than what our

822
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,450
capabilities keep getting more and more
powerful.

823
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,700
There's.
There's gonna come a point in time I

824
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:38,520
think where it was inevitable that
people had stopped powering

825
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,370
machines with their hands.
Like we should probably get out of that

826
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:45,840
as quick as we can and concentrating
using our brains like and like the idea

827
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,880
that the person who drives the car could
only drive the car.

828
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,680
That's kind of crazy because I used to
drive cars.

829
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Did you ever drive cars before?
I drove limos,

830
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,980
so I just drive and deliver newspapers.
So I've been in driving jobs.

831
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,810
Right.
And I can do other stuff like other can

832
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,290
do other stuff.
People can do other stuff.

833
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,770
You can find another thing that you'd
like to do.

834
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,990
It's not like this guy lost his job.
The only way feeds his family.

835
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,090
Okay.
I feel terrible that you lost your job.

836
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,370
I'll feel terrible.
Then anybody loses their job and they

837
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:15,930
have a hard time feeding their family.
But when you're talking about a job,

838
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:20,370
I know it's hard to get jobs,
but people lose and gain jobs all the

839
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,780
time.
It does happen.

840
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,150
Yeah,
but I got to find one that's better than

841
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:24,660
this one,

842
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,171
right?
I.

843
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:25,921
I mean,
I agree,

844
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,240
but.
But for one thing,

845
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,660
not everyone is smart enough to get a
headset and really intelligent jobs.

846
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,410
There's a lot of families.
There's a lot of dummy fix that will the

847
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:37,920
Alex Jones Britt genius pills from the
CIA,

848
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,650
basement.
Luther Vandross hold of these 1984 and

849
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,530
there was a period of six months where
he didn't sing because they had him

850
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:50,940
locked up in the basement.
The Dungeon and Virginia colloidal

851
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:54,720
silver will fix you.
You ever see that dude who drank too

852
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:55,554
much?
Cool little silver?

853
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,750
He turned blue.
Oh yeah,

854
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,110
I did see the blue guy.
He died when he died,

855
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,270
but he was old.
He died.

856
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,880
He didn't die from being below blue.
I don't think so.

857
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,420
We might have.
I don't think.

858
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,210
Maybe I'm wrong.
I think he just died.

859
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,830
I'm waiting for one day for Alex Jones
and go,

860
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,860
guys,
I need to tell you.

861
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,780
I don't have the papers,
I don't have the documents.

862
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:18,180
I've been lying.
I've been lying the whole time,

863
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,540
but right here I don't have.
I lost the documents.

864
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,470
I lost.
I had them.

865
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,890
I spilled coffee on him,
but he had some documents.

866
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:26,970
That's the fucking problem.

867
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,200
Did you ever see he had a documentary
that one of them.

868
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,030
No.
Really opened my eyes.

869
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,790
It was nine one,
one a road to tyranny and there's was

870
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:39,670
another typical ouch Jones to touch on.
You know it.

871
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,280
He's talking about the demise of
civilization and all these different

872
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:45,940
things,
but then he goes into the WTO,

873
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,840
the WTO protests,
and this is where it got really crazy.

874
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,310
Ninety nine.
Yeah,

875
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:56,020
and he showed that all of these
anarchists came in.

876
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:59,950
There's all these peaceful protesters
and then all these anarchists came in

877
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,130
with ski masks on and government issued
boots and started smashing everything.

878
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:07,750
They're literally wearing military issue
boots.

879
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,930
They start knocking over newspaper
dispensers and smashing car windows and

880
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:16,150
storefronts and stuff like that to move
in to.

881
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,480
The cops have to move in,
so then these guys get wrapped up into

882
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,160
some building.
They get like quartered in some

883
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:23,290
building.
They negotiate their release and then

884
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,430
they're released without charges.

885
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,570
Oh yeah.
The provocateur thing that.

886
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,720
That shit happens all the time.
Where I mean at the end of occupy,

887
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:33,780
it's like half of those camps were
infiltrated cops.

888
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,000
Like we're just plain cops.
Well,

889
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,770
here's what they did with,
with Seattle.

890
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,700
Was it Seattle?
The WTF?

891
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,140
They made people take off.
They had badges.

892
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,420
Like,
like if someone had like a pin that

893
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,610
you're wearing that hat a WTO with a red
line through it.

894
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,410
They said this is a no protest zone.
You can't get through this zone with any

895
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:57,700
form of protest.
So even a pin that says WTO with a red

896
00:38:57,701 --> 00:38:59,350
line through it.
They were telling people,

897
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,300
you can't get to your job with that.

898
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,020
You know,
you gotta you gotta be in the freedom of

899
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:05,300
speech zone.
We've fenced off four feet.

900
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,070
That's the freedom of speech zone.
Dude.

901
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:08,720
That's what's happening in standing rock
right now.

902
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,630
Have you talked about Sandra and.
I haven't.

903
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,190
We have.
We've talked about it very briefly

904
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,770
because I've been trying to pay
attention to it.

905
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,640
It's getting crazier from all sides.
You know,

906
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,490
this,
this,

907
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,880
this group,
standing rock,

908
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:22,520
the standing rock Sioux.
They don't want an oil pipeline through

909
00:39:22,521 --> 00:39:24,130
the fucking water supply.
That's a,

910
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,230
it should be the right and instead it's
this corporation,

911
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,890
it's just plowing through their sacred
land and you know,

912
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:31,660
the,
the cops.

913
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,130
I,
a girl had her arm nearly blown off.

914
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:37,220
They didn't quite have to amputate with
a concussion grenade by the cop.

915
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,370
I heard that.
And then the conspiracy theory online

916
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:44,150
was that it wasn't a concussion grenade
that it was something that they had

917
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:48,380
launched and then it went bad because
there was more than one propane tank

918
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:51,230
grenade or some shit.
See if you could find out,

919
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,760
get to the bottom of it,
Jamie.

920
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,200
But uh,
yeah,

921
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:57,050
I saw them spraying water on the
protesters.

922
00:39:57,051 --> 00:39:59,000
It was like 40 degrees out there hosing
these people.

923
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,420
It was 23 degrees though subfreezing
temperatures wasn't really.

924
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,360
And they're hosing them in water and now
this is the best part.

925
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,840
On top of that,
the governor signed a mandatory eviction

926
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,180
thing for,
for all of them saying it's because of

927
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:13,340
cold temperatures and we're worried
about your safety.

928
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,140
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

929
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,730
Yeah.
I wasn't real worried about,

930
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,800
we're going to hit you with concussion
grenades because we're worried about

931
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:20,750
your safety.
People are getting jacked by those

932
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,910
rubber bullets to rubber bullets can
take an eye out.

933
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:24,350
Folks.
Those things are no joke.

934
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,300
I can hurt you.
Bad to know a girl who lost an eye to a,

935
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,490
a face shot,
a tear gas canister that hit her,

936
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,010
hit her in the eye.

937
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,120
Oh my God.

938
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:35,810
Yeah.
No.

939
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,910
These,
these less than lethal rounds can

940
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:38,744
fucking do some damage.

941
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,640
Yes.
He can't.

942
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,680
He can't just,
that's,

943
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,270
that's,
that's like really weak assault.

944
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,390
That's like going up to someone.
You say you didn't start a fight,

945
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,580
but you start spitting out him and
slapping him.

946
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,710
You know,
like you're not trying to kill them,

947
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,720
but you definitely hurting them.
Like,

948
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,030
what do you do?
What the fuck are you doing,

949
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,410
nick?
Going after reporters.

950
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,060
This girl,
Erin Schrode,

951
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:59,610
she's been on ABC as a,
as a commentator and stuff.

952
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,740
She was down there.
There's video of her,

953
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,430
a viral video of her where she's
interviewing a guy as she's

954
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:08,550
interviewing,
she gets shot by a sniper with a rubber

955
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:11,170
bullet for doing nothing for just
interviewing her.

956
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,620
I've seen that.
Yeah.

957
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,940
Jamie,
have you seen that does.

958
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
It's incredible.
She just sitting there talking to

959
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:20,610
somebody and she gets shot.
They just fucking.

960
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,590
They just take pot shots at you.
Yeah man.

961
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:29,180
It's and it also creates this us versus
them environment where these guys who

962
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:34,181
are hired to be the cops that get rid of
the protesters are just regular people

963
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,110
and they've been given orders to get rid
of these protestors and in the protest

964
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:41,360
has become the enemy and then it becomes
an US versus them scenario,

965
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,950
which we're so accustomed to

966
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,650
and a lot of them are coming.
You are.

967
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,400
They coming back from Iraq and
Afghanistan and they're used to war

968
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:51,410
zones and they shouldn't be a war zone.
This a peaceful protest twos,

969
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,100
which it is.

970
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,360
Exactly.
You know,

971
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:56,180
I don't know what the answer is to
something like that.

972
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,440
I don't know how you stop what's already
been done and I don't know how he ever

973
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:05,210
got permission to go through somebody's
land if the land is public.

974
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:06,800
Okay.
That's one thing.

975
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,560
If you want to have a debate on whether
or not we can do what we can do with our

976
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,730
own national public lands.
I'm,

977
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,320
I'm,
uh,

978
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm against that.
I'm against.

979
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:17,120
I'm against.
I think we fucked up so much of this

980
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:19,190
country as it is.
Let's stop.

981
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,850
Let's not do anymore of that.
But if that's private land,

982
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,980
if it's privately with they own the
land.

983
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,350
Do they have a treaty land?
Yeah.

984
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,160
Yeah.
It's a rancher on the land to right?

985
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,790
If they're like,
no.

986
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,150
Yeah,
yeah.

987
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,990
The rancher who are ranchers lands.

988
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,270
There's another woman in Iowa St
pipeline though.

989
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,590
Dakota access.
Cindy Coppola.

990
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,660
She's a farmer.
She,

991
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,600
she's not native Americans.
He's a white woman farmer in Iowa.

992
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:43,840
They're coming through her own farm.
They arrested her for getting in their

993
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:44,180
way.

994
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,740
Yeah.
They said that they had to have access.

995
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:47,180
Yeah.
And so they made some sort of an

996
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,014
easement,
right?

997
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:48,961
They just,
yeah,

998
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:50,120
they just started.
They just,

999
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,960
they go into the city council and they
get something passed and the eminent

1000
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,290
domain and they just take the land.

1001
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,580
See,
that's what the problem is,

1002
00:42:56,581 --> 00:42:57,990
folks.
This is a company,

1003
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,260
this is not the United States government
safety commission that needs this oil to

1004
00:43:04,411 --> 00:43:08,430
protect us from impending invaders.
There's nothing like in your best

1005
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:11,360
interest about this.
This is all money that they're not going

1006
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:13,080
to give you free oil because they got
that oil.

1007
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:15,510
Most of it shipped overseas don't even
go to us.

1008
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,400
It's billions of dollars in profit.

1009
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,880
That's the darkness of this is that
they're going through land that's not

1010
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,160
theirs and they think they just can
because they want oil.

1011
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,590
Like I've seen people argue that,
you know,

1012
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:27,480
oh,
this is exaggerated or that's

1013
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:30,020
exaggerated,
but here's the cold faculty can't

1014
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,310
ignore.
They're going through somebody else's

1015
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:36,090
land against their will.
So either it's their land or it's not

1016
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:37,890
their land.
It's their land.

1017
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,660
Did you,
do they have a treaty?

1018
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,010
Yes.
Does this guy have a ranch?

1019
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:41,791
Yes.
Does he own it?

1020
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,020
Yes.
Stop.

1021
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,420
You're the government,
right?

1022
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:46,740
You know what that means?
Your people.

1023
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,120
People can't go through other people's
fucking ground because they think they

1024
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:53,130
want to.
You can't just do that.

1025
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,491
The,
the,

1026
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:54,031
the,
the,

1027
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,730
the idea.
The hypothetical idea is that we elected

1028
00:43:56,731 --> 00:44:00,870
these people to do our bidding,
not to do the corporations bidding.

1029
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,730
Whatever the fuck they want to make
profit.

1030
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,750
Yeah.
Whether you left wing or right wing,

1031
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,050
that's the most insane proposition is
giving the government that kind of power

1032
00:44:08,051 --> 00:44:13,051
to just go through private land and and
pumping oil pipeline under a fucking

1033
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,360
river and that's where what

1034
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,650
and that's where mostly the left and
right come together.

1035
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:18,930
It's like Libertarians,
the left and nobody.

1036
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,940
Nobody wants to just be like,
oh yeah,

1037
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,340
you can just plow through someone's land
where they want it or not.

1038
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,970
And it's convenient for people to poopoo
because it's not your land.

1039
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,100
But if it was your land,
what if you had this bitch and stream in

1040
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,530
your backyard?
And he used to like catch in it and

1041
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:32,460
you're like,
God dammit baby.

1042
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,610
We found the perfect spot to build a
house and you set up and everything's

1043
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:38,690
good and then one day you go out and the
fish are fucking belly up and the

1044
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,930
water's rainbow hued because it's filled
with oil and you're like,

1045
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,190
oh no,
the pipelines leaking that pipe under

1046
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:48,960
your house that they forced you to have

1047
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,290
gang.
They're going through the Missouri River

1048
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:56,290
and it's a drinking water for 18 million
people and that's what they're fighting.

1049
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:00,980
I know a guy who had bone cancer and his
entire neighborhood had cancer because

1050
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:03,620
they live next to a golf course and the
golf course,

1051
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:04,940
the water from all the.
Well,

1052
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,250
the pesticides,
it was getting into the groundwater and

1053
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,220
drinking out a well.
Water is as these people got Jack.

1054
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,650
Yeah,
that's.

1055
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,280
That's.
That's what you really see it as when

1056
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,360
like a whole neighborhood.
There was a whole neighborhood in

1057
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:18,330
greenpoint,
Brooklyn that had brain tumors or stuff

1058
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:21,090
because the oil spill underneath the
streets.

1059
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,740
Oh,
it's crazy.

1060
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,860
Jesus.
Jamie just did it.

1061
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:26,810
Two,
three,

1062
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,780
three and one,
two,

1063
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,490
threes.
What have you done?

1064
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,800
What have you done to Jamie?
Did you come in here with a spell?

1065
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,920
Was there some sort of magic you have?
Lee Camp,

1066
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,810
some sort of lefty magic,
dump water all over control panels,

1067
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,063
man.
It's just.

1068
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,960
It just makes me sad.
Oh,

1069
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:49,080
here we go.
P police brain blame will lansky's

1070
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,350
injury on protestors.
While we could not reach law

1071
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:54,750
enforcement.
A Morton County sheriff's department

1072
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,270
have released a statement on facebook on
the 23rd of November,

1073
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,520
2016,
saying the injury was caused by an

1074
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:02,850
exploding propane canister that
protesters were handling.

1075
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,500
They later removed the post,
but Wayne Wilansky Willinsky Lansky told

1076
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:12,210
us the statement is false if he had no
burns on her and while making a major

1077
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:14,610
portion,
while major portion of her lower arm was

1078
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,720
blown out.
Oh my God,

1079
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,380
her hand was still attached by the own.
The bone making a claim that she was a

1080
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,870
victim of a fire explosion seem
unlikely.

1081
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,830
He said she was totally lucid after
being injured and recounted being struck

1082
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:29,310
by a grenade like object and exploded on
contact with her arm.

1083
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,130
So it's a flash grenade.
It's a flash grenade.

1084
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,470
Okay.
So the other thing was the Ra.

1085
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,530
Well,
when crazy things like this happen,

1086
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,270
there's always a lot of stories floating
around.

1087
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,360
It's hard to figure out what is it?

1088
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,220
Oh,
there's some viral posts that everyone's

1089
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,780
sending me of a woman,
a native American woman saying they're

1090
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:46,781
dumping chemicals on the protesters.
And yet if you talk to anybody else,

1091
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:50,900
it's not true or,
or it doesn't seem verified and yet

1092
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,070
every,
it's so viral.

1093
00:46:52,071 --> 00:46:55,390
Everybody's emailing me this post of
them dumping chemicals on protesting.

1094
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,220
Yeah.
Well that's what people do.

1095
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,660
Um,
did you see the,

1096
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,910
I think it was,
um,

1097
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,520
I forget what one of the online
magazines caught up with a guy who

1098
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:07,540
creates fake news stories and they asked
him why he did it.

1099
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,640
And it's really interesting.
It was not dig the other day.

1100
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,410
Well,
not just that,

1101
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,300
it was also a,
he is,

1102
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,760
um,
he's actually a democrat.

1103
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:18,100
The guy who did it,
who they interviewed and they said that

1104
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:23,101
he was trying to expose how vulnerable
the right is in particular to really

1105
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:27,190
obviously fake stories.
So He'd make these really obviously fake

1106
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:29,640
stories that anybody could like a
seconds

1107
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,820
about the pope endorsing trump went
viral in the right.

1108
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,900
What was one of them about a paid
protestor?

1109
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:40,740
How much protesters getting these
protests are getting $300 an hour or

1110
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,910
something like just ridiculous shit.
And then they.

1111
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,830
These fucking people ran with it.
George Soros is paying those prototypes.

1112
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,150
All these arrows just given free hand
jobs to every protest.

1113
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,430
Dude.
I was in New York for the protests.

1114
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:57,870
It was fascinating.
It was really like a lot of protests

1115
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,480
right after trump won.
Oh,

1116
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,170
it seemed like so much weird energy.
Someone's like,

1117
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,810
chaotic.
We're lost energy.

1118
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,820
Like to see the streets filled with
people.

1119
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,930
I was like,
wow,

1120
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:12,010
this has been Nana's like this is like
they close down streets.

1121
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:14,440
He closed that entire streets was
hundreds of thousands of people.

1122
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,330
Millions just walking down the street
screaming out slogans.

1123
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,190
I made my.
My point is yeah,

1124
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,140
they have.
They should be furious,

1125
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:25,510
but they should have been furious five
years ago.

1126
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,580
Like,
why wait until this?

1127
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,630
Because we have bills,
bro.

1128
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,800
Shit to think about it.
Got Problems.

1129
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,730
My bowling games down,
dude.

1130
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:38,190
Westworld is good.
It was good.

1131
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,200
My kids keep flunking school.
People have all sorts of things,

1132
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,240
so they got.
They got shit to do with them.

1133
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,900
They got shit to do.
That's why I think just even the idea of

1134
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:49,150
a person being president is fucking
ridiculous.

1135
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,010
Like how's this guy gonna run the way he
does.

1136
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,990
He have a life.
He has an actual life.

1137
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,210
He has family does.
It doesn't even play golf.

1138
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,760
Doesn't have like things you like to do.
Does he read?

1139
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,130
How the fuck is this guy?
Good time to do all that stuff.

1140
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,590
Hey Bush.
Had time to take more vacation days than

1141
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,970
anyone had ever.
Probably a good move.

1142
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,610
It's really good.
I mean we all knew that Dick Cheney,

1143
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,830
who was running the show anyway,
I know we think we think we know we've

1144
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,140
given increasing power to the president
when the president was supposed to be

1145
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:18,520
one of three factors going on and now we
just keep feeding more and more power to

1146
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,430
the president and that's the thing.
People that like Obama,

1147
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:26,431
it's like he did not give away any power
that no president gives away any power

1148
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,080
they've gotten.
So they just keep gaining and gaining

1149
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:30,360
power.
Yeah.

1150
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:35,430
Well that was the big question.
When the NDA was proposed it they said,

1151
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,130
what happens if Obama was very
reasonable guy?

1152
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,650
Most likely he won't use indefinite
detention.

1153
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,300
Right?
But what if you get some new president?

1154
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,230
That's crazy.
And then liquid happened.

1155
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,120
Here,
let me,

1156
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,720
let me give you a dictator's toolkit.
The largest surveillance infrastructure

1157
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:54,820
ever.
Let me give you a the right to lock up

1158
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:58,060
journalist without a trial or charges.
Let me give you the right to drone bomb.

1159
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:03,061
Americans and American was.
It was a executed in drone bombings.

1160
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,870
And as long as it's not an over here,
as long as it's not in our patch of

1161
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,650
dirt,
we're cool with you killing Americans.

1162
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,960
Flying Robots.
No trial,

1163
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:14,920
no trial.
What was he,

1164
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,960
what was he in?
Al Qaeda guy was the isis.

1165
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,230
He joined isis or something.
And here's the thing is,

1166
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,180
and I don't want to say the names
because I'll get them wrong,

1167
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:22,931
but,
but his,

1168
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,450
uh,
his father was preaching terrorism,

1169
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:27,980
so they executed him and then executed
16 year old son.

1170
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,350
Nowhere near him.
They just took out the sun.

1171
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,570
They just decided the sun was too risky.
They are like,

1172
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,404
AH,
why not?

1173
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,010
Whoa.
That's some game of thrones shit,

1174
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,790
isn't it?
That is right.

1175
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,570
That's some game of thrones type shit.
You got to kill the sign.

1176
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:43,340
And literally when they,
when they were finally answered as to

1177
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,700
why they had executed the sun go,
one of them,

1178
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,240
one of the press secretary's,
someone goes,

1179
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,111
well,
you know,

1180
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,580
he shouldn't have had a father like
that.

1181
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,770
Can you imagine if everyone were
responsible for what their father did?

1182
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:59,000
Jesus,
imagine if every father was responsible

1183
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:00,440
for their kid.
Did exactly.

1184
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:03,020
My argument has always been,
how come if your dog bites someone,

1185
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,050
you can get sued.
If your kid shoots up a post office,

1186
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:10,130
you're not liable.
You know,

1187
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,120
like up to a certain age.
You should be liable for your kids like

1188
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,980
23.
And you want to go that far?

1189
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:17,260
Twenty three?
Yeah.

1190
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,840
Yeah,
yeah.

1191
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,580
You'll really work hard at doing a good
job.

1192
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,670
Make sure you don't unleash that little
monster in the world.

1193
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:24,080
So we have to deal with it.
Listen,

1194
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,640
you dropped him 12 times and fed him Mac
and cheese all his life.

1195
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,680
So what you have done,
if he fucked him now,

1196
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:32,510
I mean how many people were out there?
Fucking their kids.

1197
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,870
It happens.
A lot of monsters out there.

1198
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:39,920
People need hotter pets and then they'd
leave the kids alone and hotter.

1199
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:41,000
Pets.
Kidding.

1200
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,200
These reality joke.
What the fuck?

1201
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,530
I've gone off the rail.
I was going to say something.

1202
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:51,860
I totally derailed.
That will fry your brain right there.

1203
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:53,390
Yeah,
I'm not that.

1204
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:55,490
I really think that people should be
responsible for the kids.

1205
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,370
It's just,
it's odd what we are and aren't

1206
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,970
responsible.
It's just amazing how easy it is to just

1207
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,550
have a kid and they just do a shitty job
raising it.

1208
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:09,470
Like you don't have a license to pump
out these fleshy idiots into the world.

1209
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,260
Well,
it's not that you want to stop anybody

1210
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:13,730
from doing it because who are you to
tell?

1211
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,910
I mean somebody might want to tell you
that lead camp and all this bullshit

1212
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:19,040
about the elite.
You think that fucking asshole should

1213
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:19,880
have a kid?
Yeah.

1214
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:21,790
He's going to have the kid.
That little lefty fucking

1215
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,090
argue about some shit that I know is
wrong.

1216
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,090
I mean they're going to decide that you
shouldn't have a kid.

1217
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,190
So who the fuck?
You know,

1218
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,290
there's a lot of people wait fucking
smarter than me and it became an

1219
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,290
argument between who gets to breed.
Me or them they're going to win,

1220
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,570
but I like having kids.
So what the fuck?

1221
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,850
Great.
How many kids?

1222
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,230
I have three.
I had to think about it for a second.

1223
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:45,740
I thought you said I like having kids.
I thought we were going to hear like

1224
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:47,420
seven or something.
Now I think about it because we were

1225
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,100
talking to John Jones yesterday.
He's got four.

1226
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,270
I left.
I was like,

1227
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,550
God damn.
I got four kids already.

1228
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,490
He's trying for a boy.
But my point being,

1229
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:00,750
it's an uber complicated experience to
just hand off to everybody and the

1230
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:06,700
outcome is a developed human being.
So we're counting on everybody to do a

1231
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:11,090
good job developing us.
It lists at the beginning of idiocracy

1232
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,560
is the truest thing that's ever been
created.

1233
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:14,160
Do you remember that movie?
I never saw it.

1234
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,950
Never saw it.
I have a bit.

1235
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,650
Apparently that's extremely similar to
the premise of it.

1236
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,840
Oh,
really came out before the movie on

1237
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:21,860
showtime,
Luckily.

1238
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,980
So it's documented and that movie was so
in

1239
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,740
the fucking knew what was gonna happen
at the very,

1240
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:31,410
very beginning of the movie is just,
it's just too.

1241
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,520
They just show a split screen of a
really dumb idiot couple,

1242
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,040
you know,
uh,

1243
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,480
maybe rednecks,
but just like,

1244
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,030
they're,
they're fucking morons.

1245
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:41,430
They clearly don't know what the fuck's
going on and they're just pumping out

1246
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,640
kids.
They just fucking dust into kids and

1247
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:45,760
then they answer these,
you know,

1248
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:51,140
little liberal elite couple living in a
brownstone in New York deciding whether

1249
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,880
to have a child.
And each year goes by and they're like,

1250
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,520
no,
we decided not yet.

1251
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,050
We will do it soon and,
and they never have the kid,

1252
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:02,370
meanwhile the rednecks and pumped out 42
kids and it's like,

1253
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:03,300
well that's your world.

1254
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,770
That is what happens.
People that are career oriented,

1255
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:07,380
especially if the,
you know,

1256
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,540
the husband and the wife can't decide
who's going to stay home with the kid if

1257
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:12,190
they,
they're both career oriented.

1258
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,960
It becomes a thing like,
hey,

1259
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:15,580
let's wait until we're 36.
Hey,

1260
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:16,960
let's wait until we're 42.
Hey,

1261
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:18,130
let's freeze my eggs,
you know,

1262
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,700
hey,
let's,

1263
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,500
you know,
and then next thing you know,

1264
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:23,060
you adopt,
I think you should be allowed to freeze

1265
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,040
a kid.
At least,

1266
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,070
you know,
up to five.

1267
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:30,040
Adopting you know,
is a great idea and it's,

1268
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,160
it's awesome that a lot of people do it,
but people want their own kids.

1269
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,780
You know.
That's the other weird thing about it,

1270
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:38,230
about DNA is like,
you want your own DNA DNA pumped into my

1271
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,270
boy.
That's my boy John.

1272
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:45,340
You came right out of my own body.
I'll teach you the way,

1273
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,310
the way of the Mayan.
Yeah.

1274
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:49,120
It's,
um,

1275
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,400
it's a very odd thing that we do it so
often though,

1276
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,140
you know,
like even me,

1277
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:54,640
I'm guilty.
I told you I've got three of them,

1278
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,890
but I look around,
there's 7 billion people on this planet.

1279
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:57,311
I'm like,
man,

1280
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:59,320
maybe got,
we got too many people.

1281
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,100
Sit down the kids and talk to them.
Hey guys,

1282
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:05,740
let's do this guys.
I think all of us hang together.

1283
00:55:05,741 --> 00:55:08,270
You don't need your own kids.
Come on,

1284
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:11,260
I had you get a get a dog,
get a nice dog,

1285
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,490
snuck a nice little dog.
Has a shitload

1286
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,200
paypal.
We,

1287
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,510
that's the thing is America as we're way
out numbered.

1288
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,940
Oh yeah.
Way Out numbered here.

1289
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,350
The world,
you know,

1290
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:22,303
India.

1291
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,350
Well that's a cool thing about America
when you fly over,

1292
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:27,200
like if the shit gets really bad,
we have so many places to expand.

1293
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:30,410
We have so many new subdivisions we
could open up in the middle of nowhere.

1294
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,200
Like when you're flying over and you see
nothing but like empty space,

1295
00:55:33,201 --> 00:55:33,591
like,
oh,

1296
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,690
we could fucking live here.
Yeah,

1297
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,510
yeah.
Lots of rooms play a space.

1298
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,730
We just uh,
just kinda settled down.

1299
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,270
Breeding.
You think about that when you're sitting

1300
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,530
in la traffic,
you're like,

1301
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:44,000
you know,

1302
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,330
pays there is out there.
Why are we all in four feet in la?

1303
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:51,620
Traffic is no hang right worldwide.
I've been to Mexico City,

1304
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,190
Mexico City like stoplights aren't even
the suggestion.

1305
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,610
They're just bullshit.
Nobody's paying attention to anything.

1306
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,440
It's a perpetual traffic jam and people
just weaseling left and right and like

1307
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:07,610
in trying to merge into the stream of
perpetual gridlock,

1308
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,740
they just go for it,
go for it,

1309
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,270
and all of a sudden they're in the
middle and they go for it.

1310
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,670
No one's letting anybody in.
You got to catch people that are

1311
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,890
sleeping in or you just got to be really
rude about it.

1312
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,000
And do you think people are people that
people in Mexico City was just like that

1313
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,830
initially or do you think that came from
like,

1314
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:23,140
no cop wants to pull someone over
because they don't want to get shot?

1315
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,190
I think it's the population.

1316
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,440
It's too high.
It's just too high.

1317
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,750
Mexico City has an incredible
population.

1318
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:32,110
I think it's the number one city in the
world is Mexico City.

1319
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:35,190
Number one,
Tokyo is number was $35 million into

1320
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,770
really 35 dude in Tokyo.
They have.

1321
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,450
They have people whose job it is to cram
people onto the subway.

1322
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:46,480
I've seen just the elbow.
The people in the subways.

1323
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,321
Yeah.
How about that?

1324
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,380
Thirty 5 million people in the ground
moves every couple of years.

1325
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,630
Good luck.
Have Fun.

1326
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,650
Stay.
Stay together.

1327
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:56,830
Keep it together people.
But that's interesting.

1328
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,050
Thirty 7 million.
Oh my God.

1329
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,150
Thirty 7 million.
800,000 in Tokyo.

1330
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,180
Holy Shit.
So that's number one and I haven't even.

1331
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,890
Mexico City.
I'll probably not nearly as many as

1332
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:07,180
that.
I want to say it's.

1333
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:10,420
I want to say 30,
21.

1334
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:12,580
We'll go with.
Let's go with.

1335
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,190
Let's go with the better.
When I said 30.

1336
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,430
Either way it's a totally congested
city.

1337
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:21,520
It's completely jammed up with people,
but

1338
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,300
la is on the way to that.
It's on its way.

1339
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,300
It's not going to get there tomorrow.
We'll get there in 20 years.

1340
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,040
Yeah,
it's.

1341
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,880
I don't know.
We should all go live out in the middle

1342
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:34,714
of nowhere.
Well,

1343
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,070
problem is.
This is a really good spot.

1344
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,170
You know what else,
speaking of how open the country is,

1345
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,930
people fucking are buying up all the
land,

1346
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,160
like the scientologists own all the land
and who was it?

1347
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:46,240
Ted Turner,
a seed guy who created CNN.

1348
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,630
He owns enough land in America that it's
equivalent to the size of Delaware.

1349
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,480
Whoa.
He's balling out of control people,

1350
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:56,050
but he got rid of Jane Fonda because she
came Christian.

1351
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,640
Is that true?
Yeah.

1352
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,230
No,
definitely.

1353
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,780
Probably other factors.
I mean,

1354
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,020
I'm just saying it because it's a good
soundbite and that's what I read online.

1355
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,820
She was great and knew who the fuck
knows.

1356
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,500
I mean maybe they just stopped liking
each other.

1357
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,630
Maybe what do I know?
What do I give a fuck?

1358
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,660
But I just thought it was fascinating
that she became a Christian,

1359
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,200
like really late in life and he was
like,

1360
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,230
check.
Yeah,

1361
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,240
no,
I'd be the same way.

1362
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,790
You can't show up Christian and my door.
Come on,

1363
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,220
but if you're dating a girl and she was
like super cool,

1364
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,190
but she got into yoga and then she got
an idea cities.

1365
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:27,760
Then she got his writings of Christ.
He came home one day and she's reading

1366
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,800
the Bible,
what are you doing?

1367
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,710
That's just an interesting book.
Yeah.

1368
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,280
Well,
I picked up this novel and I said,

1369
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:39,070
I'm going to live my life by head Turner
Ranch Ted Turner's Weird Faq.

1370
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,990
I keep saying Mr Turner,
Mr Turner,

1371
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:43,420
that you say frequently asked questions.

1372
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,830
How large or Mr Turner's landholdings.
Mr Turner is the second largest

1373
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,440
individual land owner in the united in
North America with the POC summit.

1374
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,520
Oh my God.
Approximately 2 million acres of

1375
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:58,510
personal and ranch land and the 12 us
states and Argentina.

1376
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,670
Wow.
Argentina.

1377
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:04,300
So now look up how many million acres of
Delaware and we'll see whether I'm

1378
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,960
making shit up,
whether there's something weird about

1379
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,630
like owning a ranch in Argentina.
What's going on,

1380
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:12,760
Bro?
You have a branch here.

1381
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:15,100
You have 2 million acres here and you've
got a ranch in Argentina.

1382
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,290
Are you going to live forever?
What's happening,

1383
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:17,891
sir?
Well,

1384
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,960
yeah.
Well that you get to the brain in the

1385
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:21,500
jar.
Him and the Koch are going to have their

1386
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:25,820
brains in jars running the big almost
twice the size of Delaware.

1387
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,200
Wow.
That's incredible.

1388
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,410
That's incredible.
He's got more property than Delaware

1389
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,410
Bowling.
Probably more entertaining.

1390
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:36,140
The Delaware balling out of control.

1391
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,790
He's got a girlfriend.
Just ships in Russians probably when you

1392
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:42,740
get to that much money,
you just have Russian orgy,

1393
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:43,491
so I think.
Yeah,

1394
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:45,010
they just show up,
dude.

1395
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,780
Have you heard the sumner redstone tapes
during the trial?

1396
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,160
What's that?
He's like,

1397
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:52,250
so he had this big trial and he's like
98 or whatever it is,

1398
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:55,880
96 or something and the tapes that they
played to show that he was with it were

1399
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,610
him arranging and worksheet.
Oh my God,

1400
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,560
he's,
he's in his nineties.

1401
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,850
He's like,
you know,

1402
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:06,230
then you'll suck me off.
And on this guy sumner redstone,

1403
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,870
he's one of the biggest media owners in
the world or whatever.

1404
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,330
And how they filled him doing this.
It was a tape,

1405
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,480
I don't know how it was recorded,
but it was a taped phone call that they

1406
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:17,990
submitted to show that he was mentally
with lucid,

1407
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:20,420
but he was lucid because they were
trying to take his company from him.

1408
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,610
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1409
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:24,980
So he submitted that.
What does it,

1410
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:26,600
Ted Turner,
the 73 year old billionaire,

1411
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:29,480
founder of CNN,
has revealed that he has for

1412
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:32,150
girlfriends,
each of which whom he spends one week

1413
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:33,860
with a month.
Wow.

1414
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,130
I love the idea of having four
girlfriends,

1415
01:00:36,131 --> 01:00:37,760
but they've got you nailed down per
week.

1416
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,340
I love him.
I love him.

1417
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,270
Jane Fonda's probably screaming when
she's reading this.

1418
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:48,870
Just looking at our screen
that says

1419
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,890
she went to standing rock though Jane
Fonda went to standing rock and fed the

1420
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:57,520
protesters.
They let her off the hook after that.

1421
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:01,790
Hanoi Jane stuff that thinks she's
finally gotten past that poor girl.

1422
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,310
Don't get in the tank down.
Get getting the tank when you're like,

1423
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,800
how old was she at the time?
I have no idea.

1424
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,740
Twenties.
Yeah,

1425
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,890
and when you're that young,
hey look,

1426
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,460
ma involved and well being in the tank
wasn't right,

1427
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,900
but most people would agree she was
probably right.

1428
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,130
That Vietnam shouldn't have been
happening.

1429
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,820
We shouldn't have been bombing hundred
percent.

1430
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:18,890
One hundred percent.
Right.

1431
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:24,350
It's just that message was so confusing
to people because it was the first war

1432
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,680
that we shouldn't have done.
Like all the sudden we're the bad guy,

1433
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,040
whereas when we're killing native
Americans might have some qualms with

1434
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,630
first we shouldn't have done,
but uh,

1435
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,880
but you know what I mean,
it was the first native American was

1436
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:38,330
more of a genocide that he was a war,
but I mean the battles,

1437
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,260
but I mean like,
uh,

1438
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,800
an army shipping off to do battle with
opposing army.

1439
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:44,450
This is the first time like,
Whoa,

1440
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:45,910
we're,
we're wrong here.

1441
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,260
And on TV you're seeing the body's.
Yeah.

1442
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,470
Yeah.
So there was a lot of people that were

1443
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:54,710
trying to protest it.
And then when you're 20 or in your

1444
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,650
twenties,
you're so clumsy as it is you.

1445
01:01:57,651 --> 01:02:01,250
So it's so likely you're going to get
the message out wrong.

1446
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,870
Yeah.
She,

1447
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,840
that was the wrong way to do it.
She fucked up.

1448
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,790
But I know it Jane,
man,

1449
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,910
that stuck with her forever,
for decades.

1450
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,250
Many of twitter was around back then.
Shit.

1451
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:17,030
Oh God.
Oh my God.

1452
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,100
You'd be tarred

1453
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,450
and feathered so quickly.

1454
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:24,710
Yeah.
Like if she did a reddit ask me anything

1455
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:25,544
in the seventies,

1456
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:31,950
I'm in a tank and asked me anything.
Oh my God.

1457
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,550
Oh,
whoops.

1458
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,970
Do you.
What are your thoughts on like the,

1459
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,740
the public shaming,
the mob just get out of hand sometimes.

1460
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,900
Too Fun for people.
That's the problem is it becomes too fun

1461
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,100
to fun to attack

1462
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,300
and they love to see people that got you
going

1463
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:48,080
fall 100 percent.
Yeah.

1464
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:50,480
People love that.
It's unfortunate.

1465
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,500
It's unfortunate because it's new power
that people have and we're yielding and

1466
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:57,080
against each other sometimes for the
wrong reasons.

1467
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,940
Sometimes for the right reasons.
I mean,

1468
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,730
I think um,
I think certain people who've done

1469
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:04,550
terrible shit.
I mean I couldn't think of any offhand I

1470
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:06,740
could think of like a lot of those
football players,

1471
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,580
like the one guy knocked his girlfriend
out and in,

1472
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,310
in the elevator like that.
That guy deserved all that shame.

1473
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,700
You know,
like what the fuck man,

1474
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:15,380
you just,
you punched her in the face,

1475
01:03:15,381 --> 01:03:17,210
like you can't restrain her.
She's trying to hit you.

1476
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,060
So you left hooked her.
Can you grab a hold of her man?

1477
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:21,530
You're a giant,
big,

1478
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,410
giant super athlete and you killed your
wife.

1479
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,450
That's fucked up.
Right.

1480
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,860
I think a lot of us had that sort of
feeling and so when a guy like that gets

1481
01:03:30,861 --> 01:03:33,560
all this blow back for something like
that,

1482
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,290
it,
you know,

1483
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,880
it's deserved.
But there's been some people that have

1484
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:39,770
been attacked for some shit that didn't
make any sense.

1485
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,750
Oh,
absolutely.

1486
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:41,830
Absolutely.
Some.

1487
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,630
Yeah.
I mean hell,

1488
01:03:43,631 --> 01:03:45,670
there's that new documentary out on
Amanda Knox.

1489
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,800
Like what do you think about that?
She's totally innocent if you watch the

1490
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,830
watch the document.
I.

1491
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,680
So here's the thing,
I went little fill out the story for

1492
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,580
people in Italy,
right?

1493
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,150
I went in with kind of a blank mind
because I didn't pay attention to almost

1494
01:03:58,151 --> 01:03:58,984
any of it.
Uh,

1495
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,670
when it was happening,
she was,

1496
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,160
she was dumb and I just mean like young
dumb.

1497
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:06,730
I don't mean young.
I just being young,

1498
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:10,600
dumb a exchange student or whatever.
And she's in Italy and she's,

1499
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:14,320
when she's in a housing unit with a girl
she's kind of friendly with,

1500
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,330
she goes and stays at her boyfriend's
place,

1501
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:19,630
comes back the next day the door's
locked and I can't get it open,

1502
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:22,090
but they see some blood on the car.
But they call the cops,

1503
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,590
they opened the door,
the girls,

1504
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:25,240
dad,
there's blood everywhere.

1505
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:29,780
She's been raped and stabbed and beaten
and then they,

1506
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:34,510
they found the guy that did it,
but they were so keen on going after

1507
01:04:34,511 --> 01:04:35,740
Amanda Knox.
It was just like,

1508
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,380
it's gotta be her.
And then honestly I think what indicted

1509
01:04:38,381 --> 01:04:41,530
or is she seems to be a little off.
She seemed that maybe have some

1510
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:45,100
asperger's or something so she wasn't
behaving emotionally.

1511
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:48,850
Like people are used to someone behaving
and that's all it was.

1512
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:52,900
It's like she had for sure,
I think pretty for sure.

1513
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,300
Yeah.
And,

1514
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,510
and so they convicted her,
then they,

1515
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:01,000
then they found her not guilty and then
they ultimately found her not guilty

1516
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,080
again.
So.

1517
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,080
And she,
they,

1518
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:04,870
they tried to bring her back to the
country.

1519
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:06,400
Right.
They tried to bring her back for the

1520
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:09,130
supreme court trial,
but they went along with it anyway.

1521
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:11,800
She didn't come back and.
But she was found not guilty again

1522
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:14,680
because the DNA evidence was bullshit.
It was so contaminated.

1523
01:05:14,681 --> 01:05:15,050
It was.

1524
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:18,130
And if someone does get pronounced not

1525
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:22,150
guilty and they've been put through that
Har for all those years,

1526
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:24,490
did they get any compensation for that?
No.

1527
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,600
Nothing.
Nothing you can do.

1528
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,850
That's scary.
Occasionally when you've got a guy like

1529
01:05:28,851 --> 01:05:30,860
in theu ,
s has been in jail for 30 years.

1530
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:32,540
They'll give them like a million dollars
or something,

1531
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:34,340
but it doesn't.
It doesn't bring their life back.

1532
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,490
That's scary.
That's crazy.

1533
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,660
Yeah.
No,

1534
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:41,090
she.
I mean her life and her boyfriend's life

1535
01:05:41,091 --> 01:05:42,740
were just destroyed and she spent.

1536
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:48,090
Do you remember that fucking guy who got
accused of being the Olympic Village

1537
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,660
bomber and he was a security guard and
they smeared his name.

1538
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,140
What was his name?
Richard.

1539
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,020
Richard Jewel.
I'm pretty dude.

1540
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,630
They put that guy on TV.
They said he was the bomber and he was

1541
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:04,470
just a regular old security guard.
Didn't do anything wrong.

1542
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,910
I was.
I was a kid at that Olympics and we were

1543
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:10,840
deciding whether to go to the next day
after the bombing bomb blew up.

1544
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:13,670
Did he kill anybody?
Killed one person won't bleed.

1545
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,610
He died of a heart attack.
I believe I was there that night.

1546
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,400
It wasn't there when a bomb went off,
but I was going to be like,

1547
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:19,870
we were going to go to a basketball
game.

1548
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:24,270
There was like the US Dream Team was
playing and we went to the one sculptor,

1549
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,720
woodlands buy tickets,
so he left,

1550
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:29,140
but on our way home that happened like
we were on the subway going out to a

1551
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:31,750
suburb.
My mom was calling everyone around us

1552
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:35,140
thinking like we got caught in it.
I have video of the park,

1553
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,120
the park and whoever was on stage that
day,

1554
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,570
but we met.
I'm not like a really cool because I

1555
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:42,620
wasn't in the bomb,
but like it was there that

1556
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:47,000
Callan was in New York City and I'm
Gotham comedy club.

1557
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:50,240
When the most recent bomb went off,
he was six blocks away from me.

1558
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,270
He will that.
What was it?

1559
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,950
What was the pressure cooker bomb?
It hurt a lot of people.

1560
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:56,990
It didn't kill anybody,
but it hurt a lot of people.

1561
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,530
It was an unknown.
One of those remote controlled pressure

1562
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,500
cooker jammies or they set it and he
just walked away from it.

1563
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,300
Say this God,
the fact that someone could just do that

1564
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:12,200
just indiscriminately blow up a bunch of
people and blow shrapnel into their

1565
01:07:12,201 --> 01:07:17,201
body,
but that guy got accused that jewel,

1566
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,380
Richard Jewel guy.
The guy got accused publicly.

1567
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,020
The news ran with it.
They didn't have any evidence.

1568
01:07:24,021 --> 01:07:27,830
It was all wrong.
He didn't do anything and everybody was

1569
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:28,531
like,
oh,

1570
01:07:28,531 --> 01:07:31,550
they found him.
They found him.

1571
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,270
They put his picture on the fucking
newspaper cover.

1572
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:36,680
Oh,
oh,

1573
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,590
that guy after the Boston bombing,
another pressure cooker after the Boston

1574
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:42,380
bombing,
they put those guys on the front of the

1575
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,910
New York Post or whatever it was,
stone remember,

1576
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:44,631
and it wasn't.
Well,

1577
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:44,931
no,
no,

1578
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:47,990
that was a real guy.
These are the innocent guys that they

1579
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,490
did.
They did put them on.

1580
01:07:49,491 --> 01:07:51,680
They were like,
FBI is looking for this guy,

1581
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,260
and it was like his life was torn apart
and he's like on facebook,

1582
01:07:54,261 --> 01:07:55,790
like I didn't bomb.
Anyway.

1583
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,970
What do you have those?
See if he could find that photo.

1584
01:07:58,971 --> 01:08:00,920
Jamie,
I freaked out about that until you just

1585
01:08:00,921 --> 01:08:03,180
brought that up.
Within the first day,

1586
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:07,280
one day his life was destroyed because
you're walking down the street.

1587
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:09,050
People think they're looking at the
Boston monomer.

1588
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,860
That's so ridiculous.
That's so ridiculous.

1589
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,000
And that's,
that's the fucking running

1590
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,810
with information we don't have yet.

1591
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,540
Well,
that's why people that have that sort of

1592
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:21,800
responsibility,
like you're,

1593
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:23,630
you're,
you're the media.

1594
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:26,450
The,
the official stamped media.

1595
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,280
That's why,
you know,

1596
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,370
rolling stone took so much heat when
they had that cute bomber on the cover

1597
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:33,160
of Hanson Hanson.
Bummer.

1598
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,450
It's like that guy could have got so
much tail.

1599
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,990
Was he on?
Was he on the fucking cover of rolling

1600
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:40,880
stone to being a bomber?
He shouldn't be out there.

1601
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,760
Getting chicks does seem like if these
guys got laid a little more,

1602
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:48,080
they wouldn't have done this shit back
and seek these two pictures at Boston

1603
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:48,861
marathon.
Meanwhile,

1604
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:51,320
they're just fucking dudes and that kind
of blue.

1605
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,960
Like next day he's walking down the
street being called a bomber.

1606
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,960
God dammit.
Yeah.

1607
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:58,880
Those,
those big mistakes.

1608
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,350
There it is.
Sorry.

1609
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,990
Dewey Beats Truman.
They get that guy in Dallas shooting

1610
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:04,520
too.
That was walking around with a gun that

1611
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,600
it thought it was him because people saw
a picture of him with a gun walking

1612
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:10,750
around the street,
but he had actually turned in the gun to

1613
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,560
police officer.
Remember that?

1614
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,200
I'm talking about.
I do remember that,

1615
01:09:14,201 --> 01:09:15,590
but vaguely.
Oh yeah,

1616
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:16,041
yeah,
yeah.

1617
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:16,874
In Dallas.
Yeah.

1618
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,670
Uh,
go ahead.

1619
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:20,563
I'm sorry.
Please go ahead.

1620
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,111
Well,
no,

1621
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:21,944
I was going to say,
Oh,

1622
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,390
you know what I wish people were still
talking about with the Boston bombing is

1623
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,900
there was a third guy who wasn't there.
They said he was friends with the

1624
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:28,280
bombers,
so they wanted to interview him.

1625
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,650
The FBI goes down to what?
Florida,

1626
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:32,900
Georgia,
somewhere interviews and four times the

1627
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,120
fourth time.
And they admit he was unarmed.

1628
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,340
They shoot him seven times.
Once in the back of the head.

1629
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,260
Yeah.
Abraham to have just executed the guy.

1630
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:41,780
Yeah.

1631
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,400
The FBI did.
And then they came out and said,

1632
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,180
oh,
he had a gun.

1633
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,110
Oh,
he had a knife,

1634
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:45,641
A.
Oh,

1635
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:46,880
nevermind.
He had a stick.

1636
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,861
Oh,
well we,

1637
01:09:47,861 --> 01:09:50,720
he didn't have any weapons,
but we feared for our lives and it's

1638
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:52,640
like you're the fourth interview with
the guy.

1639
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,620
You just execute him.
It's crazy.

1640
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:01,020
Wow.
But what better way to get the cute boy

1641
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:05,420
on the rolling stone cover to talk to
the pump?

1642
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:07,640
Seven bullets into your friend,
his friend.

1643
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:11,000
I mean,
that's how you get to do the talk and

1644
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,500
here's a picture of your friend.
Yeah.

1645
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,850
Yeah.
I just shot him in the fucking head.

1646
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:17,390
I'm going to shoot you to tell me.
Tell me who told you to do this.

1647
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,270
You have to do this.
Fuck fuckface here's a video on my

1648
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:21,620
phone.
Just so you know that I really shot your

1649
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,270
friend.
But that's.

1650
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,590
But that's our media.
How is that not a story basically.

1651
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,580
Basically never mentioned in the
meeting.

1652
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,370
Like really briefly mentioned.
So,

1653
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,270
so briefly that I forgot about it until
you just brought it up.

1654
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,450
I had totally forgotten about that.
I'm like,

1655
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,450
Oh yeah,
the Jack Back Guy,

1656
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,260
you know,
but we're like fucking guy's a bad guy.

1657
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:42,890
Friends.
He was friends with fucked up,

1658
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,680
fucked up shit.
Been hanging around.

1659
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,190
Thought about who his father was,
she thought about those friends were too

1660
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:53,060
God damn.
It's people that have that kind of

1661
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:56,570
power.
Like that's an enormous responsibility.

1662
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:59,210
You have a gun,
you're job is part of your job is to

1663
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,010
shoot people when they fuck up.
Like,

1664
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:01,910
whoa.
Yeah,

1665
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,500
and you're at the highest level,
right?

1666
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,300
You're the FBI,
you're there to protect national

1667
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:07,700
security,
Federal Bureau of Information.

1668
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,330
I feel like they're not taught how to
deescalate shit.

1669
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:13,440
They're only taught how to ask you.
I'm sure they're taught how to

1670
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,040
deescalate.

1671
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,260
I'm absolutely sure that they don't
stick with that training.

1672
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:19,500
Let's just say that there are people.
There's a real problem with giving

1673
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:20,790
people power,
you know,

1674
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,340
giving anyone power over other people.
It's like that's a,

1675
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:29,010
it's a very intoxicating position.
Especially like the kind of life or

1676
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:32,190
death power someone with a gun has and
people don't want to listen to you.

1677
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,690
You know?
And the other thing is like how many

1678
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:40,050
people could handle that kind of
pressure day in,

1679
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:43,490
day out for 10 years or 20 years.
I totally agree.

1680
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,030
Those guys,
a shitload of pressure,

1681
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:47,070
but that still means we're doing
something wrong.

1682
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:48,310
If they're executing people,
oh,

1683
01:11:48,311 --> 01:11:48,930
this,
oh look,

1684
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,150
it's 100 percent wrong.
It's 100 percent wrong,

1685
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,410
but the whole stew is wrong from
everything we've discussed from people,

1686
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,230
anybody being able to have a person,
which I don't have any solution for.

1687
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,170
I'm not a eugenics guy.
I'm not saying I'm not offering up any

1688
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:05,130
sort of crazy solution.
All I'm saying is we all agree that part

1689
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:07,740
of the problem is people get raised by
horrible,

1690
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:11,940
awful people who abused them and beat
them and rape them and they're subjected

1691
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:15,150
to all sorts of horrible shit as are
growing up and they develop all fucked

1692
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:18,840
up and we all know people like that.
They're just all fucked up and those

1693
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:20,160
people would just cast out into the
world.

1694
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,590
And this is,
this is what our world is made up.

1695
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,140
Our world is made out of people.
I mean our civilization at least.

1696
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,300
Well,
this is why I think,

1697
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,490
and maybe people will get behind me on
this there,

1698
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,010
so the numbers are.
It's rough,

1699
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,520
but they think in a sociopath test about
pet test,

1700
01:12:35,521 --> 01:12:40,290
about one out of every hundred people is
a sociopath and those people usually do

1701
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,850
really well in business.

1702
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,690
They get to the top of corporations,
they become president of United States

1703
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:49,460
and it's like we should have a sociopath
test for high ranking of it.

1704
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:53,940
You'd have to completely define it as
someone who really doesn't have feelings

1705
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:54,870
for other people.
Right.

1706
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,120
You'd have to be able to really nail
that down,

1707
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:01,530
but feelings are so emotions and
emotional connections and empathy.

1708
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,700
It's such a poorly defined thing because
someone who watches a lot of movies and

1709
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:07,920
reads a lot of books,
you can say the right words.

1710
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:11,070
If you're a manipulator.
I without actually feeling it,

1711
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:13,110
you could say all the right words,
you know?

1712
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:14,650
Yup.
It happens to people all the time in

1713
01:13:14,651 --> 01:13:16,470
relationships.
Like,

1714
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,490
you know,
girl me to guy,

1715
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:20,880
he's charming and he tells her he loves
her and I mean really just as like he's

1716
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,400
doing stuff that he saw in a movie and
then,

1717
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,440
you know,
maybe four or five months in she

1718
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:26,131
realizes,
oh my God,

1719
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:27,480
he's a total psychopath.

1720
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:31,830
And like he's just saying things not to
say anything.

1721
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,700
He just knew how to say the right things
were the right Cologne,

1722
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,050
whatever it was,
say the right things at the right time

1723
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,650
because he's had a lot of practice and
at the end of it,

1724
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,350
and there's a person who's like
literally barely a person,

1725
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:46,410
like some sort of a robot reciting
things,

1726
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,293
you know what I mean?
That was,

1727
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:48,590
did you ever read,
um,

1728
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,300
um,
was the Bret Easton Ellis book?

1729
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,090
They turned into a movie.
Bradley Cooper.

1730
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,050
What?
American psycho.

1731
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,143
Yeah.
Right.

1732
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,770
Psycho.
But that's a Christian Bale.

1733
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:00,680
Yeah.
Bret Easton Ellis.

1734
01:14:00,681 --> 01:14:03,030
This book,
the book is terrifying.

1735
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:05,100
It's way more terrifying than the movie.
I didn't,

1736
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,050
I didn't read the book.
The book is awful.

1737
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,540
I remember like people not awful like a
bad book,

1738
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,100
like it's really well written,
but it's awful like holy

1739
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,680
shit and by the way,
how much did the trump kids look like?

1740
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:16,990
American psycho.
It's like they're trying,

1741
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,850
well,
how do you look if your dad's a

1742
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,770
billionaire?
He probably can't look any other way.

1743
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,230
I have two options.
You go all in with pops and you join the

1744
01:14:25,231 --> 01:14:30,180
family business or you become like that
surfer dude who like a band.

1745
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:32,910
When we really got into drugs and we
brought in into counseling,

1746
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,200
fell far from the tree.
You can be like in the Malibu,

1747
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:38,430
Rehab,
perfect.

1748
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:42,900
Permanently with flip flops on you feet
up and they keep you sober,

1749
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,140
but you know,
you just like to surf.

1750
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:46,890
Your Dad just pays for your treatment.

1751
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,510
I mean they have like a special kind of
hair gel for like the kids of

1752
01:14:50,511 --> 01:14:52,340
billionaires.
I don't know how they slick it back like

1753
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:52,940
that.

1754
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,440
Well,
it's liberal tears.

1755
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:58,940
They just scoop amount of buckets of
Hillary Clinton rallies.

1756
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,300
They just kick liberals in the balls,
collect the tears.

1757
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,940
They just went around that night.
We all,

1758
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:07,460
the people were crying when Hillary
lost.

1759
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:11,630
They just gathered them up,
gathered up those tears and nice slick

1760
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,550
their hair back.
Yeah,

1761
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,540
I think that's it.
It's going to be interesting.

1762
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,640
It's going to be interesting.
You know,

1763
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,950
we're gonna.
Find out how much power the president

1764
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,010
actually has to.
Because like that,

1765
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:25,940
this trump election,
let us know,

1766
01:15:25,941 --> 01:15:28,310
hey,
the system actually does work.

1767
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,690
Like someone can come in that's not
being represented by their party.

1768
01:15:32,691 --> 01:15:35,960
The party didn't want him in.
Someone can come in and still win,

1769
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,740
but sadly,
so far Bernie Sanders got closed.

1770
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,290
But right now,
only if you have a billion dollars.

1771
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,570
Right?
But I think

1772
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,160
that's going to change.
First of all,

1773
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,590
no one liked Bernie ever existed before
Bernie.

1774
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:48,370
Right?
Agreed.

1775
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,840
So all of a sudden,
Bernie comes in.

1776
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,890
Now here's the thing.
If trump's policies start working out,

1777
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:54,993
that's when everyone's

1778
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,390
fucked.
If he,

1779
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,520
if all of a sudden we realize,
oh,

1780
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,870
well,
here were the log jams.

1781
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,700
He's right,
like Holy Shit,

1782
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,130
we're prospering is holy shit.
Look,

1783
01:16:04,131 --> 01:16:07,580
all this good stuff that's happening
does have massive infrastructure

1784
01:16:07,581 --> 01:16:11,360
projects that put people to work so that
he can have his name trump across the

1785
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:13,040
bullets to the trump train,
the trump,

1786
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:13,874
this,
trump that.

1787
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:16,700
Even if he just does that,
that could make people pretty happy.

1788
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,110
People very happy.
Yeah.

1789
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:20,740
It's interesting.
It's interesting because he's a total

1790
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:25,180
outsider who has paid off the insiders
for a long time.

1791
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,430
If now he's in.
If he follows through,

1792
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:30,400
here's the scary thing is,
is in a way,

1793
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:35,430
if he follows through with just
bringing us back from bombing every

1794
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,440
country,
it's like that alone could be a big step

1795
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:38,981
and it's like,
oh,

1796
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:41,950
we needed a fucking crazy motherfucker
to do that.

1797
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,250
To finally say,
why are we in all these other countries

1798
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:49,420
and start to say this for me.
He was already basic.

1799
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:49,960
Well,
okay.

1800
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,350
Protestors and him stopped the TPP,
the transpacific partnership,

1801
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:57,910
the fucking largest corporate coo that's
ever been devised and basically,

1802
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:59,680
you know,
he said he wasn't going to sign it.

1803
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:00,940
Now here's the thing,
he's not.

1804
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,370
He's going to create a new trade deals,
so it's going to be awful.

1805
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:06,940
He's going to put that forward so it's
not like he's done creating havoc in

1806
01:17:06,941 --> 01:17:09,800
that way,
but the fact that the TPP is over is a

1807
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:10,280
huge

1808
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,420
step.
It is.

1809
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:14,930
It's an interesting step and what I was
saying earlier that one of the things

1810
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:19,520
that a lot of people said that I agree
with is that I think him being a

1811
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:23,300
populist and him being really interested
in public's opinion and what people

1812
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:28,301
think about him is actually a good thing
because when certain things he says like

1813
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:32,690
you off the cuff says shit off the cuff,
and then he finds out that is really a

1814
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:36,590
stupid thing to say.
He amends like what he says and I think

1815
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:41,510
that's kind of interesting because like
if he starts to talk about some specific

1816
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:44,930
set of regulations or rules and then the
public starts freaking out about it,

1817
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,380
it's very likely he might reconsider if
it makes sense.

1818
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,320
Well,
this is how he's kind of like a standup

1819
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,460
comic because he was going from speech
to speech.

1820
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,030
Basically.

1821
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:55,760
He would weed out the stuff that wasn't
getting a huge reaction.

1822
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:59,090
Keep the stuff that got a big reaction
and it was just a greatest hits.

1823
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,010
He was just playing the hits,
just doing a set.

1824
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,780
You have a strong set and yeah,
but dude,

1825
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:05,780
by the end of the election,
like after all the grab the pussy stuff

1826
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:10,250
and after the last debate he was doing a
run of these speeches and I tuned into

1827
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:13,190
one of them and I was like,
the guy sounds pretty reasonable right

1828
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:14,930
now.
Like right now in this moment,

1829
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,200
if you could like take this snippet
instead of the other snippets when he's

1830
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:20,210
gone to the wall,
just got 10 feet higher.

1831
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,580
Instead of that take this snippet and
you go with this guy.

1832
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,300
Very reasonable.
He's talking about corruption.

1833
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,480
He's talking about deep suited,
the deep seated red tape.

1834
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:33,080
It's almost impossible to remove because
it's an ecosystem and all these people,

1835
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,160
they had been feeding off of each other
and the bureaucracy roots run deep and

1836
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:38,180
you just got to pull it out.

1837
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:40,790
You've got to drain the swamp.
I totally agree with all that.

1838
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:42,500
The problem is now you look at his
cabinet,

1839
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:45,860
he's grabbing the same swan things.
Putting them,

1840
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,210
well billionaire,
but he's putting the swamp things baggy.

1841
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,730
No,
he's talking about Patraeus.

1842
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:51,440
It's like,
and all these,

1843
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,270
all these assholes.
It was,

1844
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:53,840
it.
Uh,

1845
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,850
I can't,
I don't know who he ended up going with

1846
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:57,890
for treasury secretary,
but he was talking about Jamie diamond

1847
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:00,230
for awhile.
The fucking head of Citibank.

1848
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:04,220
I mean,
sorry jp Morgan Chase that was behind

1849
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,290
the collabs bind what created.
Occupied.

1850
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:11,750
Like he's putting the swamp things back
in the swamp he's drained at and now

1851
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:14,080
he's putting.
What was he trying to portray us in for?

1852
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,580
Had a defense.
Right.

1853
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,590
That's an interesting choice.
I don't know.

1854
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:22,280
You might want to verify that trace
thing is fascinating because portrays,

1855
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:24,740
didn't do anything that was really that
awful.

1856
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,010
He had an affair.
He leaked information.

1857
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:29,090
Right.
But what did he do?

1858
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:31,400
He leaked information to this girlfriend
that he was dating.

1859
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:34,190
She will follow up with it.
How heavy was it?

1860
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,030
Like what was the information?
I don't know what the information.

1861
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,220
Was it top secret?
I don't know.

1862
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:41,180
A secretary of state supporters he was
looking for.

1863
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,171
Yeah.
Well,

1864
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:44,450
he's um,
he's an interesting case because he's a

1865
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:49,250
case of the FBI and the CIA don't like
each other that much.

1866
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,890
That's where this came from.
This is what's so fascinating about it.

1867
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:56,900
Patraeus was running the CIA,
the FBI does an investigation on the CIA

1868
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,340
because portray us is banging this chick
and she's crazy and she likes to send

1869
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:02,960
crazy emails to people.
He was,

1870
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:07,600
he was banging some nutty abroad and uh,
and so that's what sunk this,

1871
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,440
this crazy lady was making some noise
threatening people.

1872
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,290
She was threatening certain people and
then they want who's,

1873
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,520
what's going on here?
And it turns out there collect kinda

1874
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:20,550
swinger type characters or something.
Petraeus was hitting it hollow and next

1875
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:25,350
thing you know this and then portray has
had an affair with this other woman

1876
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:27,420
who's writing an autobiography on,
that's what it was.

1877
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:32,040
Now I'm remembering the autobiography
woman and the other lady got into it and

1878
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,620
then I didn't follow any of those.
Yeah,

1879
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,170
yeah,
yeah.

1880
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:38,610
And so the CIA was like a what?
And then the FBI was like,

1881
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:41,730
fuck's going on over here?
And then that's how we wound up getting

1882
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:43,980
in trouble.
That's where it all went down.

1883
01:20:43,981 --> 01:20:45,060
That's why he got stripped.

1884
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,340
I covered him when he.
So he got into fracking.

1885
01:20:49,341 --> 01:20:53,170
He was the front of a corporation that
was pushing fracking around the US,

1886
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,720
post his.
I'm removed from the army after that and

1887
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:59,680
uh,
he had a year or two doing this and they

1888
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,870
said they fly him out to North Dakota
where all the fracking is going on.

1889
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:08,000
And he's introduced by the one of the
higher ups in North Dakota government.

1890
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:10,760
I can't remember if it was a,
I can't remember what her job was,

1891
01:21:10,761 --> 01:21:12,830
but you know,
lieutenant governor or something and she

1892
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,110
introduces him and she's clearly not
very bright and she introduces him.

1893
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:17,860
She goes,
it was such a privilege to have David

1894
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:18,890
Petraeus here.
He's here,

1895
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:23,270
he's talking about fracking so that we
never have to go overseas to get the oil

1896
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:26,630
we need like we did in Iraq.
And it was like,

1897
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,820
that's,
you're not supposed to admit that we

1898
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:30,450
went to get the oil.
That's part of it.

1899
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:31,940
That's part of the secret.
Right.

1900
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:33,650
And so,
and he goes up and he's just like,

1901
01:21:33,651 --> 01:21:35,420
thank you for that lovely introduction.
And I'm like,

1902
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,380
she just said that

1903
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:40,070
went to war for oil.
That is not supposed to be what you're

1904
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,630
admitting.
Like you,

1905
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:42,690
you're supposed to say,
hey,

1906
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:44,190
we went to war for freedom.
Right.

1907
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,630
We're given an Iraqi freedom whenever
they go,

1908
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,380
wow works.
But he's not responsible for her.

1909
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:51,660
He's probably just being polite.
I didn't want to have to correct her

1910
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:53,760
ma'am.
We actually went to war for freedom.

1911
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:55,140
For Freedom.
Yes.

1912
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,720
This is a,
this is incorrect.

1913
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,120
I can continue.
Yeah,

1914
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:02,730
he was,
he was teaching at City College.

1915
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:06,300
And do you ever see those protests where
he'd walk to his car and they'd be

1916
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:11,301
screaming criminal war commodore and
it's great war criminals.

1917
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,920
I think that these kids need to face
that shit.

1918
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:16,260
They should see people in their driveway
yelling at him.

1919
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,390
Yeah.
It's um,

1920
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,020
it's real interesting that you could get
taken down like him just because you

1921
01:22:25,411 --> 01:22:26,790
were having an affair.
Like he,

1922
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:31,500
they got him out because of that,
like a because of adultery and because

1923
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:33,030
the,
the top secret clearance stuff.

1924
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,080
Right.
Well,

1925
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:36,870
I think the adults or anything but just
to make him look bad,

1926
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:40,860
but it was really the leaking leg to his
girlfriend who was writing books.

1927
01:22:40,861 --> 01:22:41,694
Right?
Yeah.

1928
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,280
That's crazy.
Isn't it funny that like the,

1929
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:48,260
the most powerful military people are
still just vulnerable to the.

1930
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:49,491
Well,
yeah.

1931
01:22:49,491 --> 01:22:53,470
But here's the thing.
He could have been at the Deq pillowtalk

1932
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,610
Ya.
He could have been having an affair is

1933
01:22:55,611 --> 01:22:57,410
all over the place.
No one would have tried to stop him

1934
01:22:57,411 --> 01:23:00,560
because he's top of the military.
But once you started leaking the

1935
01:23:00,561 --> 01:23:02,390
information and things change.

1936
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,400
Hey,
what was your opinion of that journalist

1937
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:10,650
that wound up allegedly committing
suicide by driving his car head on into

1938
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:14,110
a tree?
Remember Michael Hastings.

1939
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,220
Hastings.
Yeah.

1940
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:19,330
What did you think about it?
I think that I think that there's a lot

1941
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:21,940
of evidence that he was probably taken
out

1942
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:31,520
because it's got the right doing this 19
late Harvey Oswald acted alone.

1943
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,680
And,
and it is.

1944
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,680
Here's the thing.
So we know he emailed and by the way,

1945
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,750
it's,
it's fucking sad and horrific weather

1946
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,120
whether he was taken out or not taken
out.

1947
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,610
It's fucking horrific.
Uh,

1948
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:50,800
because he was such an amazing reporter
and amazing ability did wrote the story

1949
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:54,010
for Rolling Stones for rolling stone
about Petraeus and about some of those

1950
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:57,100
guys was another,
it was actually another general two and

1951
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,530
he,
there was something that the general,

1952
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:04,531
it's said like in some way mocking the
president [inaudible] and he printed

1953
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:05,914
that.
Yeah.

1954
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,760
And it set off this whole chain of
events that guy went up stepping down

1955
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:14,890
and people were furious at him for
making this guy stepped down when he was

1956
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:16,930
embedded,
was embedded for an extended period of

1957
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:19,600
time because he was only supposed to be
there for a shorter amount of time.

1958
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:22,810
And then he stayed for a longer time
because something had happened.

1959
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:24,550
They couldn't get them out of that.
He did the right thing,

1960
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:27,160
which is you're not supposed to become
best buddies with these guys.

1961
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,500
She was supposed to keep being a
legitimate reporter.

1962
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:31,060
And most people,
most people embedded,

1963
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,980
don't they?
They become friends with them.

1964
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:34,210
And,
but uh,

1965
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,470
here's the thing a lot of people don't
know is he sent an email to buzz feed.

1966
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:38,770
That's where he was working at the time,
right.

1967
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:39,910
Saying,
Hey,

1968
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:42,080
I'm onto something pig.
I'm not going to.

1969
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:45,880
Might not hear from me for awhile if the
FBI shows up to the offices,

1970
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:48,790
uh,
tell them you need a lawyer and don't

1971
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,840
talk to them.
So that email goes out like it's like 24

1972
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:57,730
hours or something before his car
explodes in a fiery mass here in la.

1973
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,870
And uh,
it,

1974
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,700
it seems like they definitely could have
been hacking of the,

1975
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,650
you know,
who's going 100 miles an hour now.

1976
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,960
I've also heard some people saying he
was,

1977
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:08,910
he was into some wild stuff and while
driving,

1978
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:10,530
but I don't know,
will they,

1979
01:25:10,531 --> 01:25:13,050
um,
they definitely found methodist system

1980
01:25:13,051 --> 01:25:16,140
allegedly according to the coroner who
was absolutely not paid off,

1981
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:17,820
he asked.
But if you read,

1982
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:21,480
if you read the full coroner's report,
it says not at a level that would have

1983
01:25:21,481 --> 01:25:25,440
impaired driving.
It's like a trace of some stuff of math.

1984
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,900
Yeah.
But what I was going to say was that,

1985
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,640
um,
I think,

1986
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,910
correct me if I'm wrong,
I think if you take adderall,

1987
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:37,140
he took a lot of adderall in particular.
I think that has almost exact same

1988
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:39,060
chemicals as math.
Right.

1989
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:42,780
Wouldn't you test positive for meth if
you were taking a lot of adderall?

1990
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,710
I,
that's a good question.

1991
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:45,030
I have no idea.
Please look that up.

1992
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:46,320
Jamie,
do you think,

1993
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:47,430
what do you think?
Let's just guess.

1994
01:25:47,431 --> 01:25:50,450
Let's play
test positive for meth.

1995
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:53,490
If you're taken adderall,
I think that you could test positive for

1996
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:56,220
meth if there's probably certain certain
other chemicals in your system.

1997
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:59,790
The unrelated to math,
what the urinalysis test for any and all

1998
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:03,440
amphetamines and methamphetamines is
just one derivative.

1999
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:04,130
Similarly,

2000
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:08,270
adderall is a combination drug comprise
of two amphetamine salts,

2001
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:10,940
Dextro,
amphetamine,

2002
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:15,970
and level amphetamine.
Any of the three will show positive for

2003
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:20,270
amphetamines in a urine drug test,
so they all get on well done.

2004
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,840
Wow.
Joe Rogan,

2005
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:24,950
everybody adderalls math,
so he could have been just taken

2006
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:27,140
adderall,
which is super common amongst writers.

2007
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:29,000
When you have a deadline you have to
bang out something.

2008
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:32,210
You're exhausted.
I mean it is almost mandatory amongst a

2009
01:26:32,211 --> 01:26:33,150
lot of writers.
Yeah.

2010
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:34,183
Yeah.
But so,

2011
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,800
I mean,
and even so it's like trace amounts

2012
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:40,580
wouldn't have impaired driving and he's
going 100 miles an hour and these cars

2013
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:42,500
are,
the car he was in was,

2014
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,300
had a hackable computer.
Oh yeah.

2015
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,600
Well they can do it now for sure.
I mean that's what we're talking about

2016
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:49,160
previously.
All these autonomous cars,

2017
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:53,090
there's a lot of cars now like the Tesla
where you can get on the road and you

2018
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:55,550
could press a button and take your
fucking hands off the wheel.

2019
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,310
And the navigation system drives the car
100 percent.

2020
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:02,660
My buddy texted me from his fucking car.
He's like sitting there texting me while

2021
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:05,990
he's driving.
So this is a car right now today that

2022
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:07,130
can do that.
So if you,

2023
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:10,040
if there is no requirement that you keep
looking at the road,

2024
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,070
well you're supposed to actually have
your hands on the wheel,

2025
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:16,940
but you don't have to.
The BMW seven series apparently has a

2026
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:20,270
very similar technology,
but you have to hold onto the wheel.

2027
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,610
Like it'll do all the driving.
It'll do all the breaking.

2028
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,950
There's a lot of acceleration,
but it wants your hands on the wheel

2029
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:28,220
just in case some shit goes down like
please pay attention as much as

2030
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,630
possible.
We're gonna make it as safe as possible.

2031
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,850
We're going to do all the work,
but right here at 10 and two,

2032
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,120
10 to buddy.
I wonder who do.

2033
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:38,120
Does the human or the computer when,
if like you were accelerating into a

2034
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:41,540
tree with the computer stuff or would it
just be like,

2035
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:42,870
oh,
it's a very good question.

2036
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:44,030
I don't know.
He's a very good question.

2037
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:45,710
Humans got it covered.
Yeah,

2038
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:47,000
that's a very good question.
Yeah.

2039
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:50,300
This guy's trying to commit a homicide.
There isn't a question,

2040
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:52,760
but what happened if there's like people
crossing the street with the car hit the

2041
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:54,290
people are safe.
The people in the car,

2042
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,250
which is almost a better question.
That's a very good question.

2043
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:00,080
A moral judgment calls like,
what do you do if an animal runs in

2044
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,610
front of your car?
What does the car do?

2045
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:04,190
Because the car looking at these trees
to the right trees,

2046
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:06,860
to the left and an animal runs in front
of the car.

2047
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:08,750
What do you do?
Well and if it slams on the brakes,

2048
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:10,170
the guy behind you could plow into you.

2049
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:13,340
Maybe if it's like maybe there's a size
limit,

2050
01:28:13,341 --> 01:28:17,990
like if it's a rat you just kill it.
But if it's a dog slam on the brakes,

2051
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,870
maybe don't want anybody to lose their
dog.

2052
01:28:19,871 --> 01:28:21,260
Has a cuteness test.
Yes.

2053
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:22,370
Or the animal.
Yeah.

2054
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:24,680
Like if it's a rat you kill it.
But if it's a squirrel you tried to

2055
01:28:24,681 --> 01:28:26,450
swerve,
you're really sad.

2056
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:28,430
If you hit a button,
right?

2057
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,890
If it's a deer,
fuck it.

2058
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,830
But if it's a bunny,
obviously that one word guy hits a bear

2059
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:36,340
was going like 60 miles an hour.
That one,

2060
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:40,490
the really recent one.
This guy is driving and he's talking.

2061
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:42,500
I think he's talking about getting baked
too,

2062
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:46,760
which is really funny and this fucking
bear just jumps out of nowhere.

2063
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:50,270
I really think he was talking about
getting high while it happened.

2064
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,920
So this guy's drive and he's
accelerating and as he's driving down

2065
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:56,960
the road,
this bear just jumps in front of his

2066
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:59,870
car.
He slams into the bear and the bear

2067
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:01,950
literally goes launching the air.

2068
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:04,810
And then the bear gets up and runs off
into the woods.

2069
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:07,260
So there was fine dude that probably
not,

2070
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,600
probably had massive internal injuries.
Watch this.

2071
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:11,380
Here it goes.
Ah,

2072
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:14,180
hold on.
Let me give me the full volume.

2073
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:17,180
Do it from the beginning.
Jesus,

2074
01:29:17,181 --> 01:29:20,360
listen,
I want to go home and smoke a fucking

2075
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:25,361
huge fucking.
So he's talking about getting baked shit

2076
01:29:27,081 --> 01:29:30,490
out of a fucking bear.
And he just slammed into this bear dude.

2077
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,750
The bears.
No,

2078
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,170
no,
no.

2079
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:36,080
That Paris dead
hobbled off,

2080
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:38,540
but it's going to die.
I'm pretty sure it's going to die.

2081
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,670
That the impact.
Watching one more time because I enjoy

2082
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:42,920
these things.
One more time.

2083
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,600
Why should more volume?
Please

2084
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,840
do that as not a financial.
There's no way that animals find bears

2085
01:29:53,841 --> 01:29:55,880
are pretty tough.
Pretty tough.

2086
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:59,000
I would imagine that thing's dead.
I would imagine you're dealing with

2087
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:02,570
massive internal hemorrhages.
He just slammed into that thing and went

2088
01:30:02,571 --> 01:30:03,261
flat.
I mean,

2089
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:05,210
how many feet do you think it went?
Let's see.

2090
01:30:05,211 --> 01:30:06,021
The impact.
One more time.

2091
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:08,600
Please do it.
It's just really roll one more time.

2092
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:15,200
It's amazing that I can walk.
It hits the ground.

2093
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,410
It gets up and starts hobbling off into
the woods.

2094
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,280
You're going to make this your ringtone
or you know,

2095
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,350
let's go champ.
Let's go chat.

2096
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,390
Inspiring toe.
Man.

2097
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:28,280
That's crazy.
I'm going to go home and smoke it.

2098
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:35,100
But that is obviously in the animal that
your car would stop for so big ass

2099
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,480
animals and does it.
So the coach just assumes there's no Mac

2100
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,270
truck behind you.
That's just gonna drive over to.

2101
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:43,240
Very good question.
It's a very good question.

2102
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,850
Yeah,
I mean that doesn't make judgment calls

2103
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:49,390
and you could make the wrong one and
maybe its calculations will be more

2104
01:30:49,391 --> 01:30:52,240
accurate than yours,
but maybe it'll just be going slower in

2105
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:54,730
the first place so that it won't be as
much of an issue.

2106
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,500
So it,
if these cars are going the speed limit,

2107
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:57,430
I'm going to lose my shit.

2108
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,610
Like if that guy was going exactly.
I was driving down the road and he was

2109
01:31:00,611 --> 01:31:03,850
going 10 miles an hour slower.
He might've been able to slam on the

2110
01:31:03,851 --> 01:31:07,090
brakes and avoid that.
They're showing you yesterday.

2111
01:31:07,091 --> 01:31:08,770
But uh,
well I thought it was going around

2112
01:31:08,771 --> 01:31:11,530
because it was new.
But this Tesla slams into the back of

2113
01:31:11,531 --> 01:31:12,760
this van.
Oh No.

2114
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:14,800
See at the last second.
Because that car.

2115
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:20,190
Oh well I guess there's some verbiage in
that autonomous driving that it may not

2116
01:31:20,651 --> 01:31:22,900
see parked vehicles on highways or
something.

2117
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:25,420
Oh my God.
So like if you're going 60 miles an

2118
01:31:25,421 --> 01:31:28,180
hour.
So it was the computers were watching

2119
01:31:28,181 --> 01:31:32,260
the moving car and ignored the stuffed
time to see it or recognize.

2120
01:31:32,261 --> 01:31:33,870
So there's a bunch of them,
but you know what?

2121
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,040
That's to be expected with some new
technology.

2122
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:39,220
There's no way it's going to come out of
the bat and it's going to be out of the

2123
01:31:39,221 --> 01:31:41,420
bat,
Bat,

2124
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:44,770
bat out of the barn with this Goddamn
hyperloop.

2125
01:31:44,830 --> 01:31:46,570
I got questions.
Elon Musk.

2126
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,120
I know nothing about the hyperloop.
He's putting a Goddamn.

2127
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:52,090
It goes as fast as a jet,
but it's on the ground.

2128
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,340
Just put putting the Goddamn ground jet
and jet to ground isn't around yet,

2129
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,620
but he's living in his goddamn yet

2130
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,600
putting it in our sacred land.
Why is there not a bullet train across

2131
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:06,220
to us though?
Because that to me,

2132
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:09,340
because people can just decide.
She just wants them to jump in front of

2133
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:11,840
the bullet train and that's like having
a.

2134
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:13,330
If you were at a plane,
okay.

2135
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:16,000
If how,
how much more dangerous would air flight

2136
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:20,170
be if any asshole at any point in time
could instantly put a telephone pole up

2137
01:32:20,171 --> 01:32:24,770
right in front of the plane
when I'm traveling or a bear plane.

2138
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:29,260
Travel or
travel would be so much more fucking

2139
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:30,220
dangerous.
Right.

2140
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,260
If anybody could just randomly decided
we.

2141
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:35,950
Most people wouldn't ask,
but if they decided to trains out of the

2142
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:38,230
cow catchers and knock the cows out of
the way.

2143
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,360
Yeah,
but does that always work?

2144
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:42,940
I mean,
there's a lot of shit you could put on

2145
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:44,590
the track.
The train couldn't just knock out of the

2146
01:32:44,591 --> 01:32:44,830
way.

2147
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:48,630
You can move some boulders in place.
He could put some explosives and some

2148
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,460
boulders,
boulders.

2149
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,910
Fuck La Cena guy.
He puts the dynamite in the hale and he

2150
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:55,930
times it.
Right?

2151
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,760
I mean,
Dave [inaudible] for sure can stick

2152
01:32:57,761 --> 01:32:59,800
something in front of that train.
That sucks if you hit it,

2153
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,620
you know,
some sort of a bomb type situation.

2154
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,060
I mean,
it's essentially what are you going do

2155
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:08,350
you have TSA agents every 50 feet across
the United States to damn Amtrak goes

2156
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:09,640
along.
Nobody's trying to stop them.

2157
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,830
Rosary in their hand,
glassy eyed Zombie look leaps off the

2158
01:33:14,831 --> 01:33:16,000
top,
boom.

2159
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:18,400
It hits the window and you can get them
on all sides.

2160
01:33:18,401 --> 01:33:20,700
They could just jump in.
Still I.

2161
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:23,200
It's worth it.
So it works for a month and then you

2162
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:26,500
plaster a couple of guys and it works
for another month before you put it all

2163
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:29,230
into ground and starts earthquakes
quicker than fracking.

2164
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,990
That's the other thing.
They we're going to do one up to San

2165
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:32,501
Francisco.
How about that?

2166
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:35,560
Going 700 miles an hour on the ground
and the fucking earth moves.

2167
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,030
Yeah.
How about that?

2168
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:39,160
I Dunno.
I Dunno how La has a metro.

2169
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:42,010
I don't really get how it works.
What didn't that thing gonna collapse in

2170
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:44,110
the moment.
There's nothing really well built,

2171
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:48,940
but San Francisco goes one better.
They have the bart system which goes

2172
01:33:48,941 --> 01:33:51,970
under the funk and old.
Was it?

2173
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:56,980
That's it goes onto the bay.
Is this know how I found out I was high

2174
01:33:56,981 --> 01:34:00,430
as fuck and I was hanging out with the
crew at fear factor and we decided to

2175
01:34:00,431 --> 01:34:01,630
go.
We're filming in Oakland.

2176
01:34:01,631 --> 01:34:03,400
We decided to go for dinner in San
Francisco.

2177
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:05,560
So we all got together.
We got on this train and I'm like,

2178
01:34:05,561 --> 01:34:08,620
why my ears popping and they go
[inaudible] we're underneath the bay.

2179
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:09,820
Uh,
I was like,

2180
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:15,100
Shit.
Underneath Alcatraz.

2181
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,930
I was already super paranoid.
That was already super duper high on

2182
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:23,320
edibles.
I mean it was like the worst time to

2183
01:34:23,321 --> 01:34:26,100
underestimate the power of vegetables.
And I was under the water.

2184
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:30,700
That's feeling my ears pop
was a real moment where I came

2185
01:34:30,701 --> 01:34:31,900
downstairs.
This is,

2186
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:35,470
I came downstairs from my hotel room and
I met all my friends in the lobby and I

2187
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:40,471
was just so beyond barbecued that I had
this illusion,

2188
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:45,730
this a hallucination of people being
this two dimensional,

2189
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:47,460
like cut out,
like say like,

2190
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,470
like those a preview things that you see
at the movies we see like a,

2191
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:54,150
a two dimensional cutout of an action
figure.

2192
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,190
That's what people were.
And then behind that I would see peeking

2193
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,220
out their true self.

2194
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,450
Like,
Oh shit.

2195
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:02,090
It was like poking out from behind
there.

2196
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:04,400
I would sleep.
The problem is you don't know which one

2197
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:06,110
to punch.
Which one do you punch where all my

2198
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:07,650
friends just want to punch.
It was just like,

2199
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:11,810
are you really taking me or am I ears
popping?

2200
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,440
That thing moves.
The ground moves there and they're under

2201
01:35:15,441 --> 01:35:17,300
the goddamn ocean.
San Francisco is.

2202
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:21,260
It's built unlike mud.
It's filled with sharks,

2203
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:23,750
surrounded by sharks and the ground
moves.

2204
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,660
It's trying to kill you.
Sharks are walking down the street,

2205
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:29,450
but it doesn't matter.
It's trying to kill you.

2206
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,680
A lot of mountain lions up there too.
Yeah,

2207
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,460
they eat.
Dogs are dogs and cats.

2208
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:35,990
They.
They catch what?

2209
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,820
Good for them.
I say,

2210
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,390
listen,
some of nature needs to fucking be

2211
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:43,020
winning.
Some of nature needs three.

2212
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,210
Winning.
I think it's great.

2213
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,970
Not on my watch.
I think it should eat a bunch of

2214
01:35:46,971 --> 01:35:47,804
poodles.

2215
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,220
Yeah.
But occasionally we'll get your

2216
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:50,330
girlfriend.
Oh,

2217
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,410
that's not good.
Yeah.

2218
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:54,590
Joggers,
they like to go off to joggers.

2219
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:56,930
Buyers.
I remember it was hiking once and I saw

2220
01:35:56,931 --> 01:36:00,710
a sign would be where of mountain lions
and the the advice on the sign was throw

2221
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,200
sticks and rocks at it,
but not if you have to bend down to get

2222
01:36:03,201 --> 01:36:03,981
them.
I was like,

2223
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:06,560
what are you walking around with?
Bundles of sticks and rocks.

2224
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,940
Fuck.
He talking about.

2225
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,550
Yeah,
you got to be careful because you,

2226
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:11,180
you,
you want to be scary,

2227
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:14,690
but you don't want to be challenging.
It's a very tricky fucking dance.

2228
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:17,900
He was like,
if it attacks fight back.

2229
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,730
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

2230
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,190
There was a.
I saw signed recently when I was up in

2231
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:24,500
San Francisco.
I put it up on my instagram that that

2232
01:36:24,501 --> 01:36:26,810
was the very,
the very advice that if you see a

2233
01:36:26,811 --> 01:36:28,400
mountain lion,
a mountain lion attacks,

2234
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:29,990
you fight back like,
Oh God,

2235
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:31,160
do you have.

2236
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,440
Can you show me an instructional dude?
Give me like,

2237
01:36:33,441 --> 01:36:36,740
what are the number one,
how much you'd get laid if you won that

2238
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:39,080
fight though?
There's student candidate killed him

2239
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:40,400
with the knife.
He was in his sixties.

2240
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,200
Mountain lion jumped him and he's like,
Fuck,

2241
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:48,620
because fucking jab today's.
That guy's been waiting his whole life

2242
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:51,500
for that moment.
Maybe it was just a man.

2243
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:57,290
It's the man with a knife,
maybe other giant ass fucking crocodile

2244
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,730
dundee knife,
and it was

2245
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,370
just the idea that we're supposed to
just let those things run around.

2246
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,220
There's a big protest.
Nature shouldn't be winning in some ways

2247
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:10,310
of eating some eating.
Some dogs you.

2248
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,430
They dogs,
dogs out here,

2249
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:14,930
so they do occasionally.
Yeah,

2250
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,940
they definitely little dogs,
but it's interesting.

2251
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:20,150
There's been reading this book forever.
I swear I'll get it done soon.

2252
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:24,290
Folks is a Dan Flores book called a
Coyote America.

2253
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,940
It's actually about a history of the
coyotes.

2254
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:26,750
He,
he,

2255
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:31,730
he's arguing or he's saying that most of
what goes on when coyotes kill cats and

2256
01:37:31,731 --> 01:37:32,570
dogs,
they're cute.

2257
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:35,330
They're killing competing predators.
That's how they look at it.

2258
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,770
Like they're going to eat the cat,
the dog,

2259
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,560
but really what's going on as they.
They're killing the competitor not doing

2260
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,281
food.
Well,

2261
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:42,680
cats kill an exorbitant amount of
animals.

2262
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,090
You probably know about that,
right?

2263
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:48,170
Tons of number one killer of birds.
I think his cats in America.

2264
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:49,940
Yeah,
feral cats are.

2265
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:55,030
They just don't kill just a little.
They kill billions of mammals and B I

2266
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:57,960
and people like there's no way.
Yeah.

2267
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:01,740
There was a whole article about how
these scientists did this longterm study

2268
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,710
and it blew them away.
They had literally had no one.

2269
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:07,740
Once they start doing the calculations,
like how many cats there are,

2270
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,710
how many animals have cat is capable of
killing the cats outside.

2271
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:13,100
How many animals will encounter.
Well,

2272
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,740
and that's why it's bullshit.
When you know,

2273
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,500
anti environmentalists are like,
oh,

2274
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:20,420
the solar panel system is frying birds,
fries.

2275
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,880
A minimal number of birds compared to
the number of cats are taken out.

2276
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:26,040
Jack and everything.
Man.

2277
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:29,880
Cats are just monsters.
There really are.

2278
01:38:30,030 --> 01:38:33,420
I also read that if you die in your
apartment dogs,

2279
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:35,790
we'll leave you alone because they your
face,

2280
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,100
they start with your lips,
but dogs are dogs.

2281
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:39,090
Olivia.
Yeah,

2282
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,720
that's cat's.
I thin again,

2283
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:43,500
I love cats.
I think they're cool as fuck,

2284
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,420
but they just designed by nature.

2285
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,450
There's a whole system and cats are at
the top of the system.

2286
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,470
The biggest ones are like you ever seen
that video of the crocodile coming out

2287
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:55,980
of the water with its mouth open and the
lion goes in the water and stairs it

2288
01:38:55,981 --> 01:38:58,620
down and the crocodiles like,
fuck this.

2289
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:04,200
A crocodile backed off from alliance.
There's another video of a regular cat

2290
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:06,660
getting a crocodile or alligator to back
down,

2291
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:09,650
just like a regular ass kept being like,
oh,

2292
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,310
it's a bear.
They're seeing the cat swat.

2293
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:14,670
The bare metal comes to look at the cat,
the cat hisses and slaps the bear in the

2294
01:39:14,671 --> 01:39:15,960
nose.
And the parents are like,

2295
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:16,610
all right,
all right.

2296
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:17,680
All right,
chill out.

2297
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,930
If I could each Jesus don't want to
fight,

2298
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,520
just trying to eat and just relax a
little

2299
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:29,320
big cats in our neighborhood.
There's one in Malibu that they're gonna

2300
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,930
kill now because,
uh,

2301
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,300
it's in the mountains of malleable and
they just got the.

2302
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,060
It's really controversial.
I've been getting all these tweets about

2303
01:39:36,061 --> 01:39:37,140
it.
People are so upset.

2304
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:39,900
We got to say this mountain lion,
but it's specific one.

2305
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,330
Yeah.
They have a radio collar on this fucker.

2306
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:45,750
Know where he's been and he's
slaughtering things up there because

2307
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:49,020
there's an Alpaca farm and flossing his
teeth.

2308
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:51,990
The dog collars hold up the killed dogs
too.

2309
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,290
He's killed a lot of shit,
but he's killed a lot of shit recently.

2310
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:58,230
Like 12 animals or something crazy like
that.

2311
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,180
Say,
listen,

2312
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:01,470
don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

2313
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:05,670
Mountain and mountain lion in Malibu.
Killed.

2314
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:09,690
Here it goes.
Pee Forty five suspected of killing 11.

2315
01:40:09,691 --> 01:40:12,550
ALPAC is in a goat cheese.
He just,

2316
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:15,800
and he's not doing it is in two days.
He just,

2317
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,090
in two days he's done this.
Listen,

2318
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,890
he's a monster.
Have hobbies.

2319
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,870
He's out there,
Jack and shit.

2320
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,480
That's what he does.

2321
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,000
Just put them in a zoo and let them
keep,

2322
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:27,420
you know,
I would rather kill them and put them in

2323
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:28,830
a zoo.
Uh,

2324
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:31,590
not that I want to kill them either.
I just think he should probably be moved

2325
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:34,710
to somewhere.
We could have a more fruitful life.

2326
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:38,490
Take them to Africa and put them out on
the Savannah is just not good when he's

2327
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:41,850
living around people and he's choosing
to kill their pets and livestock.

2328
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,400
Either you're going to kill them or are
you going to move on,

2329
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:46,860
but we chose to be in his way.
He has 10 days.

2330
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:49,710
The permit allows the rancher,
it's called a depredation permit.

2331
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,890
They allow the ranch or 10 days to
search for p 45 within a 10 mile range

2332
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,070
of the ranch.
The ranch may also hire a hunter under

2333
01:40:57,071 --> 01:40:58,780
the terms of the depredation order.
See,

2334
01:40:58,781 --> 01:40:59,590
that's what they do.

2335
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,670
They hire hunter and the hunter comes
with dogs and the dogs find the mountain

2336
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:04,750
lion.
Because guess what bitch?

2337
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,180
You're not finding them outline.
If the mountain lion doesn't want you to

2338
01:41:07,181 --> 01:41:08,290
find them,
you're not finding them.

2339
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,720
Most people that live up to it,
even with a tracking device,

2340
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:12,280
no,
you're not going to find them.

2341
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:14,320
You're going to know where he is,
but you won't be able to get near him.

2342
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:16,390
Uh,
he's going to know where you are unless

2343
01:41:16,391 --> 01:41:21,391
you figured out a way to circle the area
where he is and have like a large number

2344
01:41:21,401 --> 01:41:22,390
of people,
you know,

2345
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:25,330
like an army and the old timey days and
then come at each other with spears.

2346
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,090
And then just start moving in,
but you would have to have so many

2347
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:30,940
fucking people.
You'd circle an enormous area because

2348
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:34,180
he's going to be what?
He's going to smell you from a mile

2349
01:41:34,181 --> 01:41:35,650
away,
like literally a mile away.

2350
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,000
They'll run.
When they smell you,

2351
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:38,830
he could see you way better than you
could see.

2352
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:40,510
I appreciate that.
Let them go.

2353
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,880
It's pretty dope.
But it's not.

2354
01:41:42,881 --> 01:41:45,160
I don't appreciate it in a,
in a zoo.

2355
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:46,570
I think in a zoo,
I think that's the,

2356
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:48,880
that's the worst thing.
You could do it a lot of,

2357
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:50,770
one minute to do,
but I also don't want them good.

2358
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,890
But why is he,
isn't it more dead to be in a zoo then

2359
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:56,530
to give your life to the organisms in
the ground,

2360
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:59,590
like nature intended that was put out
there in the wild.

2361
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:02,920
I mean if you have that Alpaca killing
monster,

2362
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:05,290
that goat slaying monster just gets
shot.

2363
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:06,880
The coyotes.
Itam.

2364
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:08,740
Everybody eats them.
Everybody gets off.

2365
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,720
We're fine.
And we're models or you know,

2366
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:13,630
maybe he'll put them in the zoo and
eventually he'll escaping.

2367
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:15,070
Grab a kid there too.

2368
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,140
Did you see that one?
The zoo that killed a Koala,

2369
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,500
the La Zoo.
Critical.

2370
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:22,450
No.
Climbed a fucking barbwire fence.

2371
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,780
Got into the Koala cage,
killed the Koala.

2372
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,280
Those must look so appetizing after
you've been in your cage for a year.

2373
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:33,130
Like I am this.
There's snacks living next door,

2374
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:35,710
but he's not in a cage though.
He's outside.

2375
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:39,280
He's outside.
He's a legit wild mountain and he saw

2376
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:40,300
this thing.
It was a qual.

2377
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:42,380
Was it a qualler Panda Koala?
Yeah.

2378
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,680
He saw the things like,
I can fucking definitely that too.

2379
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,280
And he realized he's like,
there's a whole pin of snacks right

2380
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,370
there so I don't get in there.
It was so baffled like how did he get

2381
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:54,280
over the barbed wire?
He figured out a way to get over the

2382
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:56,950
bar.
You got to the rafters,

2383
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,650
figured out how to open door handles.
Dude.

2384
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,620
Amazing creation.
It's just.

2385
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:07,180
It's so cool that nature has all these
varieties of amazing things that you

2386
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:10,840
could kind of pay attention to if you
really want to really spend a day

2387
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:14,670
looking at all the wide variety of
bizarre animals were playing a video the

2388
01:43:14,671 --> 01:43:17,260
other day of a road runner that kills
and eats rattlesnake.

2389
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,610
Did you know that road runners eat
rattlesnakes now,

2390
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:22,650
dude.
So crazy like it to death with.

2391
01:43:22,651 --> 01:43:25,510
Does rabbit by the head and then smash
his head on rocks.

2392
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:29,470
That's playful.
Playful.

2393
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:31,300
He need to see this.
You see this?

2394
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:32,860
I couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it.

2395
01:43:32,861 --> 01:43:33,551
I saw it.
I was like,

2396
01:43:33,551 --> 01:43:34,600
this,
this can't be real.

2397
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,340
Did you see the one with the.
Was it a road runner was on.

2398
01:43:37,390 --> 01:43:42,390
It was chasing like bikers on by on
bicycles and it's just like going with

2399
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:45,160
them for like miles.
Yeah,

2400
01:43:45,161 --> 01:43:46,750
he is.
Look at this bad motherfucker.

2401
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:50,410
A little more of the video there.
I guess they were in a fight before he

2402
01:43:50,411 --> 01:43:53,300
got ahold of him.
They go at it for awhile and pull them

2403
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,570
so he gets them by the top of the head
and not why.

2404
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:56,900
Look how he does doesn't mean here,
man,

2405
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:01,960
smash bleed is fucking dinosaur,
man.

2406
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:05,360
Bang,
getting bitten because he's got a hold

2407
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:07,160
of him.
He's got a hold of his job.

2408
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:10,880
Look what he did to his jaw.
He figured out a way to bite his top jaw

2409
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:14,660
and then smash his head on the rocks.
Just killed it.

2410
01:44:15,230 --> 01:44:17,160
And then he starts eating it.
Which Watch,

2411
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:17,901
watch.
When he eats it,

2412
01:44:17,901 --> 01:44:20,090
it's even more bizarre because it's so
big.

2413
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,720
That's an amazing creation.
Look at it.

2414
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:28,390
He's eating this snake.
She's down in one bite.

2415
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:32,950
This is insane.
What a crazy dinosaur.

2416
01:44:32,951 --> 01:44:37,720
Like tiny animal.
Have you ever heard of terror birds?

2417
01:44:38,170 --> 01:44:40,440
No terror birds were like,
um,

2418
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:42,370
uh,
like a road runner type bird,

2419
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:43,630
but nine feet

2420
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:44,803
tall,

2421
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:48,580
nice flightless birds that lived,
uh,

2422
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:52,690
in a thing in the Jurassic or the select
pterodactyls.

2423
01:44:52,691 --> 01:44:53,950
But yeah,
no,

2424
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:54,761
it wasn't.
No,

2425
01:44:54,761 --> 01:44:58,000
it wasn't the Jurassic.
I think it was like somewhere around

2426
01:44:58,001 --> 01:44:59,500
like 15,
16,000 years ago.

2427
01:44:59,501 --> 01:44:59,850
Maybe.
I'm,

2428
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:01,540
I wrong about that.
When,

2429
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:04,030
when did terror birds go extinct?
Might have been a lot longer.

2430
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:05,530
It might have been like 100,000 years
ago,

2431
01:45:05,531 --> 01:45:07,780
but it wasn't so long ago that there
weren't people.

2432
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:11,710
There were people alive when these
things were alive and they were these

2433
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:14,350
giant nine foot predatory birds

2434
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:18,690
that look well because dinosaurs are
closely related to birds.

2435
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:19,611
Basically.
Burdens.

2436
01:45:19,611 --> 01:45:21,240
Yeah.
Jesus.

2437
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,870
Jesus Lee Camp Jesus.
Here's the thing.

2438
01:45:24,871 --> 01:45:26,150
You were talking a half million years
ago.

2439
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:26,790
Yeah.
Oh,

2440
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:28,980
so before,
before people am I talking about,

2441
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:30,910
but who gives me the mic?
But they should.

2442
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,970
They should have been here that we
should bring them back.

2443
01:45:32,971 --> 01:45:34,100
We can do it now.
I'm probably.

2444
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,340
Look what they looked like.
Clone them.

2445
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,590
Okay.
Those should be walking around and then

2446
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:40,050
you have fewer people than those two and
a half million years ago.

2447
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:44,130
So what was a two and a half million
years ago when we like a Australia

2448
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:45,840
[inaudible]?
Is that what we were back then?

2449
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:49,413
Wow.

2450
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:52,010
Look at that bird and the reign of
terror.

2451
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,340
Jesus Christ.
Okay.

2452
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,750
Gorging on a smorgasbord of planet.
Any mammals until the scary birds

2453
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:00,000
disappeared.
About two point 5 billion years ago.

2454
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:05,070
So if you had to guess what?
We're humans two point $5 million years

2455
01:46:05,071 --> 01:46:08,760
ago.
Like hairy ape things will make things

2456
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:11,100
sound good.
I bet they were scared of that fucking

2457
01:46:11,101 --> 01:46:12,290
thing.
Fuck yeah.

2458
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,940
That's probably why we were scary.
A little eight things.

2459
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:18,930
Maybe once that thing died off we came
out of the cave and getting our shit

2460
01:46:18,931 --> 01:46:23,931
together down from the trees.
It's weird that that's our logo to write

2461
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:27,120
an eagle.
That's our mascot.

2462
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,290
A flying tera Byrd.

2463
01:46:34,450 --> 01:46:36,850
Yeah.
Boot camps and how you feel about life

2464
01:46:36,851 --> 01:46:38,280
right now.
Yeah,

2465
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,080
but you were talking about too many
people telling you,

2466
01:46:40,081 --> 01:46:43,120
you bring back a couple terror birds.
You let them lose fewer people.

2467
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,640
Um,
that's not the way to handle it.

2468
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,710
Lee Camp,
because they're going to get you to.

2469
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,550
And they're going to get me through out
the target parking lot.

2470
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:51,511
See,
this is the problem.

2471
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:53,280
You have kids,
so you're worried that mountain lions

2472
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:55,050
going to get them.
I'm worried about my kids,

2473
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:57,720
but I'm definitely worried about me too.
What about you man?

2474
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,100
Listen,
my kids might not run.

2475
01:46:59,101 --> 01:47:03,130
You better know how to choke out a
mountain lions right to work.

2476
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,880
It's not going to work.
Do you think,

2477
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:07,530
honestly,
do you think there's too many people?

2478
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,480
Do you think it's possible that we could
balance it out?

2479
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:11,220
I think we could balance it out.

2480
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,200
I think if we use technology
appropriately,

2481
01:47:13,201 --> 01:47:14,970
I mean we throw away 40 percent of our
food,

2482
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:16,650
so it's like we really.
Yeah,

2483
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:19,350
but if we give that 40 percent away,
maybe they'll just keep fucking and

2484
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:22,350
having more babies more doing.
Eventually we'll get there too.

2485
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,200
Who's they?
Those other people.

2486
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,870
The other is what were you pulling up
over there?

2487
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:29,820
Jamie doesn't know.
Yeah,

2488
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:32,850
it's a.
It is a weird thing when you look at

2489
01:47:32,851 --> 01:47:36,360
someplace like India that has one third
of the landmass.

2490
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:41,400
We could live in a sustainable way,
but we're not doing it at all and the

2491
01:47:41,401 --> 01:47:44,730
planet is collapsing under the weight.
But how would you decide like when it

2492
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:47,580
comes to overpopulation,
without doing the China thing,

2493
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:49,770
the one baby thing,
which really didn't work at all,

2494
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:53,070
like kind of fucked up everything.
What a disaster.

2495
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,250
People throwing babies and over bridges.
Not only that,

2496
01:47:56,251 --> 01:47:58,570
they had like 70 percent men.
Yeah.

2497
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:00,480
Yeah.
They had some bizarre thing because they

2498
01:48:00,481 --> 01:48:01,830
wanted more men than women.
Yeah.

2499
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:03,090
Cool.
Well,

2500
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:05,070
because everyone,
the way their culture works is the,

2501
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:07,470
you know,
the man inherits all the.

2502
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,360
Yeah.
They wanted a boy.

2503
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:13,140
That's not a good thing.
Seventy percent men.

2504
01:48:13,141 --> 01:48:14,730
No.
That's a mess.

2505
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,460
That's a lot of sad men.
How many different continents right now

2506
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:22,470
have more than a billion people on them.
There's India have no idea if you had a

2507
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:24,570
gas,
so quiz.

2508
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:26,423
Well,
it depends on what.

2509
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:32,460
It depends on what you're considering a
continent because you've got Eurasia,

2510
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:33,780
you've got,
you know,

2511
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:36,630
we're talking landmasses.
That's true,

2512
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:39,740
right?
Yes.

2513
01:48:39,741 --> 01:48:41,090
A lot of hugging people,
countries.

2514
01:48:41,091 --> 01:48:45,020
It might only be China and India that
have over a billion.

2515
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:49,480
It's a lot of fucking people.
It's amazing.

2516
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:51,820
When you look back just a couple of
hundred years ago with the numbers of

2517
01:48:51,821 --> 01:48:56,130
people that were alive in an will,
populations go on like this.

2518
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:57,520
Yeah.
It's shooting through the roof.

2519
01:48:57,550 --> 01:48:58,250
Yeah,
it's crazy.

2520
01:48:58,250 --> 01:49:00,010
Yeah.
I think it was the 19 seventies.

2521
01:49:00,011 --> 01:49:04,420
The world population was in like $2,
billion range and now it's what?

2522
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:06,040
Seven,
7 billion?

2523
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:08,770
Yeah.
It's not good.

2524
01:49:08,771 --> 01:49:09,890
Well,
the problem is we've wiped out all the

2525
01:49:09,891 --> 01:49:11,790
diseases.
Do you need some real good diseases

2526
01:49:11,810 --> 01:49:14,800
running to really to clear out the
underbrush,

2527
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:16,690
you know,
I don't think you should say that

2528
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:22,480
I'm making you uncomfortable.
We went to the CDC wants me and Duncan

2529
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,570
Trussell for this show I was doing and
we talked to all these disease guys.

2530
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,740
You know,
what's really interesting,

2531
01:49:27,190 --> 01:49:29,500
they're terrified.
The people that run the CDC,

2532
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:32,110
they are legitimately terrified of
pandemics.

2533
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,240
Like legitimately they're like,
we're not worried about.

2534
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,160
I'm like,
will you guys worried about weaponized

2535
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:36,700
w,
you know,

2536
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:40,360
diseases and anthrax on the,
like we are worried about regular

2537
01:49:40,361 --> 01:49:45,361
diseases that just go a muck that just
go Spanish flu on people just start

2538
01:49:45,610 --> 01:49:47,380
slaughtering massive amounts.
People.

2539
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,940
Yeah.
Uh,

2540
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:52,690
and I think a large reason that they
fear that is because the overuse of

2541
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,270
antibiotics.
And a lot of that is in factory farming

2542
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,530
is.
Yeah.

2543
01:49:56,610 --> 01:49:58,740
So with these most antibiotics pump they
are,

2544
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:02,380
it's like 70 percent of antibiotics or
more than that is used in factory farms.

2545
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:04,780
They pump these animals full of it
because they're these animals that are

2546
01:50:04,781 --> 01:50:07,690
living on top of each other and each
other's shit and the only way to have

2547
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:12,560
them survive is to pump them full of
antibiotics and so then that immunity to

2548
01:50:12,561 --> 01:50:14,240
antibiotics and spreads to us.
Yeah.

2549
01:50:14,241 --> 01:50:15,860
That's where the next pandemic will come
from.

2550
01:50:15,861 --> 01:50:18,890
Factory farming.
I was watching this video online

2551
01:50:18,891 --> 01:50:22,940
yesterday of this girl who is a.
she's like a Vegan activist who had this

2552
01:50:22,941 --> 01:50:25,760
video about why do we Turkey on
Thanksgiving?

2553
01:50:25,761 --> 01:50:27,830
It's really well done video.
She's very.

2554
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,600
It's very smartly

2555
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:34,810
edited and very smartly narrated and she
starts talking about the Turkey

2556
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:36,490
industry,
but she sets it up really well.

2557
01:50:36,491 --> 01:50:39,430
Like what did we just sort of do it,
like why do we turn?

2558
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:43,540
And then she takes you to this Mike Rowe
episode where they show how they get

2559
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:48,400
Turkey come and then all these turkeys
are so they're so overbred and fucked up

2560
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:51,310
and they're so big so quick.
You literally can't physically have sex

2561
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:55,450
and then I can't walk yet.
So these artificial insemination and so

2562
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:58,990
this guy has to literally talks to talk
sweet to them.

2563
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,170
Yeah,
you gotta start sweet to them.

2564
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,840
They have this Turkey's legs clamp down
on this machine and then he's like

2565
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:10,110
touching it's prostate and with a tube
and it's like Whoa,

2566
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:13,360
because it has one hole and sucking it
in,

2567
01:51:13,361 --> 01:51:15,580
sucking it out with a straw.
Turkey's got to be like,

2568
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:18,810
what the fuck is going on?
Exactly.

2569
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:20,680
He's getting settled.
He's coming.

2570
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:23,800
This guy has a tube.
He's sucking the come out of this

2571
01:51:23,801 --> 01:51:25,190
Turkey's whole,
you know,

2572
01:51:25,191 --> 01:51:28,450
because they have like that one sort of
universal whole for everything.

2573
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:30,460
Yeah.
And as he's sucking to come out of it,

2574
01:51:30,461 --> 01:51:33,580
he has a glass of bottle water with them
because sometimes it gets in his mouth

2575
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:37,340
so he has to clean it out like kind of a
fucking job.

2576
01:51:37,341 --> 01:51:38,560
But this is the only way you can get
this done.

2577
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:41,880
Turkey rape should be illegal.
Totally illegal,

2578
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:43,790
but it's amazing that nobody talks about
that.

2579
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:48,590
But everybody talks about like force
feeding ducks to get fog was like,

2580
01:51:48,591 --> 01:51:50,300
how'd you guys missed that one?
Yeah,

2581
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,960
what could they do into that?
Turkey's

2582
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:55,640
how come you guys everybody's fucking
sick and,

2583
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:56,810
and you know,
like you're talking about.

2584
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:59,540
Then they pump them full of these
hormones to make them too big.

2585
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:04,541
It's like pigs in factory farming are
made so big that they can hardly move

2586
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:08,870
and then when they have them,
like they take them out to the killing

2587
01:52:08,871 --> 01:52:11,480
floor or whatever.
They've never really walked very far.

2588
01:52:11,481 --> 01:52:15,650
Some of them collapse under the stress
of like walking 10 feet.

2589
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:20,930
It's six system is weird too because
pigs are smart.

2590
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:22,970
Yeah,
emotionally really smart.

2591
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:25,610
There was a documentary once called my
brother's keeper.

2592
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,690
It was about these mentally challenged
guys that were being put up for murder.

2593
01:52:29,691 --> 01:52:34,610
Did you ever see it so long time ago,
but I remember when I watched it,

2594
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,540
there was a scene because they were
rural farmers and they were being

2595
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:42,830
charged with murder and apparently they
were just really mentally slow and

2596
01:52:42,831 --> 01:52:45,650
incapable of sort of understanding the
charges that are being levied against

2597
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:46,460
them,

2598
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,280
but when they were running this farm,
it was one scene where they had to

2599
01:52:49,281 --> 01:52:53,810
execute a pig and the guy pulls out the
gun and he starts going towards the pig

2600
01:52:53,811 --> 01:52:58,010
and the pig recognizes the gun and just
fucking panics like the pig who had been

2601
01:52:58,011 --> 01:53:00,380
around him all the time.
It never worried at all.

2602
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,800
Saw that gun and freak the fuck out and
just started running and running around

2603
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:08,960
and he's chasing it and then he shoots
it in the head and I remember thinking,

2604
01:53:08,961 --> 01:53:10,250
Whoa,
that pig new.

2605
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:11,080
Yeah,
like that.

2606
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,100
Peg knew what the gun was.
That's,

2607
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:17,140
that's a level of intelligence.
It's super uncomfortable and they're

2608
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:22,860
fucking smart.
But the problem with pigs is they go

2609
01:53:23,821 --> 01:53:25,830
wild.
I thought you were gonna say the problem

2610
01:53:25,831 --> 01:53:27,330
is the delicious.
No,

2611
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:31,560
I was gonna say the real problem with
pigs is what do you do with them all?

2612
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:35,250
Like pigs.
Pigs are like super prolific breeders.

2613
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:37,650
Yeah.
He received wild pigs.

2614
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,590
No,
we can't.

2615
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:43,150
I know that the too much right now.
I know that exists.

2616
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,530
Yeah,
they were um,

2617
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:48,570
all over Texas.
Texas is so crazy with them and it's not

2618
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,430
nice to call the people at Texas wild
pig.

2619
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,870
And that's what I meant,
but it's too much.

2620
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:54,900
Just that's what I'm saying.
How's Ted Cruz keep getting elected?

2621
01:53:55,170 --> 01:53:56,003
Tell me about that.
You're,

2622
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:57,300
you're,
you understand politics.

2623
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,350
What the fuck's going on there?

2624
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,560
Because he's in the middle of fucking,
you know,

2625
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,960
but how,
how do they not even look at him?

2626
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,320
Like people should be looking at Jim
Baker with his fucking furniture made

2627
01:54:06,321 --> 01:54:07,154
out of survival.

2628
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,030
How they should be looking at him the
same exact way.

2629
01:54:11,031 --> 01:54:12,190
Like,
man,

2630
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,270
they absolutely should.
They do.

2631
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:17,600
And anybody who's ever been in a room
with Ted,

2632
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:18,830
because you just see them,
they're like,

2633
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:20,150
oh,
that guy,

2634
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,190
even his own daughter,
you were that video of his daughter

2635
01:54:22,191 --> 01:54:23,320
being like,
Oh,

2636
01:54:23,610 --> 01:54:24,750
do you know the story about his
highschool?

2637
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:28,500
Or rather his college roommate who's
like his number one troll now,

2638
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:32,010
his college roommate brutalizes him on
twitter.

2639
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,860
His college roommate is really smart.
And uh,

2640
01:54:34,861 --> 01:54:39,861
I think he's a screenwriter and he mocks
Ted Cruz so openly on twitter.

2641
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,830
And he said that in order to think like
Ted Cruz,

2642
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:46,110
you have to.
And He abbreviates it out.

2643
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:48,810
I'm like,
I should be present.

2644
01:54:48,811 --> 01:54:53,811
So you should have I s,
b p before everything Ted Cruz says or

2645
01:54:54,271 --> 01:54:56,130
does,
because in his mind he should be

2646
01:54:56,131 --> 01:54:58,650
president.
So before you look at anything that he

2647
01:54:58,651 --> 01:55:01,920
says,
just put in his mind the thought I

2648
01:55:01,921 --> 01:55:05,240
should be president first.
And then he says these things like,

2649
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:07,230
oh my God,
that's so good.

2650
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:09,210
It's so good.
His twitter pages,

2651
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,260
marvelous,
marvelous.

2652
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:15,260
Uh,
and how sad that people are like,

2653
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,420
damn,
if only Ted Cruz had won fully,

2654
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:19,320
he'd beat book.
Be Trump.

2655
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:24,800
We had a real god feeling Christian and
the lighthouse instead of Tsar and

2656
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:28,220
Fella.
He was a spooky

2657
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,020
dude,
man.

2658
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:30,080
Yeah.
Here's the guys name.

2659
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:33,200
Freshman Year College Craig Mazin and
it's a.

2660
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,580
What is it?
What is it?

2661
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,480
What is his,
um,

2662
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:38,370
his cl maison c l,
m,

2663
01:55:38,371 --> 01:55:39,020
a,
Z.

2664
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:42,350
I n will cut him on twitter.
He's fucking hilarious.

2665
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:43,980
Do you saw that?
I'm sure

2666
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,600
you saw the mothering Ted Cruz in his
sleep in 1988.

2667
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,660
Getting emails blaming me for not
smothering Ted Cruz in his sleep in

2668
01:55:56,661 --> 01:55:58,460
1988.
What kind of a monster you think?

2669
01:55:58,461 --> 01:56:03,380
I am a really prescient one.
The kind knew by freshman year college

2670
01:56:03,381 --> 01:56:05,390
roommate.
Ted Cruz is going to be elected senator

2671
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:08,630
in case I hadn't made it clear.
He's also a huge asshole.

2672
01:56:11,690 --> 01:56:15,470
Things people don't have a right to
stimulate their genitals.

2673
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:20,990
This would be a new belief of his.
I was his college roommate should be a

2674
01:56:20,991 --> 01:56:24,020
new believer of it.
It's a funny dude.

2675
01:56:24,021 --> 01:56:25,340
He's.
He doesn't really funny,

2676
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:28,910
but it's like Ted Cruz,
when they had that video that came out

2677
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:32,310
where they were all making that family
like a,

2678
01:56:32,330 --> 01:56:34,310
you know,
it was supposed to be sort of a candid

2679
01:56:34,311 --> 01:56:37,010
moment with the families all sitting
around talking and they just keep

2680
01:56:37,011 --> 01:56:38,240
redoing it.
Redoing.

2681
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,330
Did you ever see that?
You never lie.

2682
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:41,780
No.
It's wonderful.

2683
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,330
It's wonderful because they couldn't
look like a real family,

2684
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:47,670
like his well all fake.
He says to his mom,

2685
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:51,920
one of the things he says is my mother
will pray about me oftentimes for hours

2686
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:56,921
a day and the mom go look
and they have like this awkward hug

2687
01:56:59,181 --> 01:57:01,230
moment where they have to Redo it.
It's like,

2688
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,830
so gross here plays out with this.

2689
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:06,020
I'm just thinking for a second.

2690
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:10,210
Who released the unedited.
Okay.

2691
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:11,083
We're still rolling.

2692
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:13,710
Why don't you say something to get him
going?

2693
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:18,230
He sees in people what they may not see
in themselves.

2694
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:24,023
That's his son.

2695
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,280
Dude.
He hates his dad.

2696
01:57:26,281 --> 01:57:28,730
Leaves more guarantee.
That kid listens to this podcast.

2697
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:31,280
Holla.
Holla at me

2698
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:36,530
when my dad was a scared teenage boy.
Listen,

2699
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:40,950
listen.
When,

2700
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:41,820
when my dad,
was it

2701
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:47,220
gift in the way of

2702
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:53,970
was his son,
his son's thinking science thing in the

2703
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:56,640
round into the chamber.

2704
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,300
Right.
Are you okay with a.

2705
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:06,320
with a way that was uncertain?
What do you mean to America?

2706
01:58:06,410 --> 01:58:10,240
What would it mean to America as a
president in Espanol.

2707
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:14,650
Heritage.
I admire Sonia.

2708
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:20,090
That's hilarious.
I'm proud of you.

2709
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:25,610
Very proud.
My thea Sonia fought against Castro in

2710
01:58:25,611 --> 01:58:26,444
Cuba.

2711
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:30,740
Fuck

2712
01:58:30,740 --> 01:58:32,700
how diddy and elected?
Well,

2713
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:35,730
this is a lot of people out there.
We're all you have to do.

2714
01:58:35,731 --> 01:58:40,731
Lee Camp is put on the right uniform.
I like how you and the.

2715
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,130
You have the right

2716
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,560
kind of hair.
You have liberal Tier Hair Gel.

2717
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,230
You're doing all the right.
Do you have an American flag on your old

2718
01:58:48,231 --> 01:58:49,210
pal?
You do.

2719
01:58:49,211 --> 01:58:51,560
You have an American flag pin on your
lapel.

2720
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,990
Everyone else's.
It's.

2721
01:58:52,991 --> 01:58:53,610
Well,
it's,

2722
01:58:53,610 --> 01:58:57,450
it's,
it's distinctive to distinct it flat,

2723
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,430
so I have to.
I have the right say the right things.

2724
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:03,950
You did appeal to the right people.
He was involved in some sort of a,

2725
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:07,270
a,
a law against or the enforcing of a

2726
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:11,500
logins dildos at one point.
So that you never saw that.

2727
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:15,280
Oh wait,
wouldn't that mean he can't be senator

2728
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:19,810
does I forget the specifics of the,
of the law?

2729
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:25,240
Not,
don't want people enjoying their sex

2730
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:26,470
lives.
Well,

2731
01:59:26,471 --> 01:59:29,860
there was a lie,
there was some sort of a law in place

2732
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:34,930
about like sexual novelty devices,
like dildos and stuff and he was

2733
01:59:34,931 --> 01:59:37,900
involved in,
I think it was like a crazy law too.

2734
01:59:37,950 --> 01:59:39,940
Like you go to jail for two years or
something like that.

2735
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:44,060
Yeah.
Ted Cruz defended a band on delay.

2736
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,800
Still did enough.
I like the look in his face like,

2737
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:51,520
like King Kong is coming in his face.
That's what it looks like right there.

2738
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:52,930
And on Dildo.
Yeah.

2739
01:59:52,931 --> 01:59:57,520
This was from 2003 to 2008 when he was a
solicitor general.

2740
01:59:57,550 --> 02:00:00,160
So what do they do with,
what do they do with Zucchinis and

2741
02:00:00,161 --> 02:00:02,470
things?
Do they ban deldot shaped fruit?

2742
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:03,881
Yeah,
I know,

2743
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:04,691
right?
Can you say anything?

2744
02:00:04,691 --> 02:00:05,920
If you're a girl,
they're so lucky.

2745
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,430
The case.
The case is an important battle

2746
02:00:09,431 --> 02:00:12,100
concerning privacy of free speech rights
in 2004.

2747
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:14,860
The companies that owned Austin stores
are selling sex toys,

2748
02:00:15,310 --> 02:00:17,170
uh,
and the retail distributor of such

2749
02:00:17,171 --> 02:00:21,340
products challenged the Texas law,
outlawing the sale and promotion of

2750
02:00:21,341 --> 02:00:23,980
supposedly obscene devices under the
law.

2751
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:27,640
A person who violated the statute could,
you could go to jail for up to two

2752
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:28,870
years.
At the time.

2753
02:00:28,871 --> 02:00:30,280
Only three states,
Mississippi,

2754
02:00:30,281 --> 02:00:32,530
Alabama,
and Virginia had similar laws,

2755
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,191
blah,
blah,

2756
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:33,521
blah,
blah,

2757
02:00:33,521 --> 02:00:33,851
blah,
blah,

2758
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:34,181
blah,
blah,

2759
02:00:34,181 --> 02:00:35,380
blah.
Okay.

2760
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:36,220
This is what happened.
Uh,

2761
02:00:36,221 --> 02:00:39,070
Texas mother,
who was a sales rep for passion parties,

2762
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:44,071
was arrested by two undercover cops for
selling vibrators and other sex related

2763
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:48,640
goods at a gathering,
a kin to a tupperware party for sex,

2764
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:50,450
toys,
you,

2765
02:00:50,490 --> 02:00:55,210
you fucking monster.
God had to be women by the way.

2766
02:00:56,010 --> 02:00:57,940
Guys will be getting their dick sucked.
The ability to look.

2767
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,250
Let's just cut the shit.
I got

2768
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:06,850
no doubt this had worried business
businesses peddling such.

2769
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:09,010
Where's the plaintiffs in this sex
device?

2770
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:11,470
Case contended this state law violated
the law,

2771
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:13,600
the right to privacy under the 14th
amendment.

2772
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:18,040
They argued that many people in Texas,
you sexual devices as an aspect of their

2773
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:20,830
sexual experiences and they claimed that
in some instances,

2774
02:01:20,831 --> 02:01:21,990
one partner,
a couple of my up,

2775
02:01:21,991 --> 02:01:22,151
up,
up,

2776
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:22,391
up,
up,

2777
02:01:22,391 --> 02:01:22,811
up,
up,

2778
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:23,251
up,
up.

2779
02:01:23,251 --> 02:01:24,100
Ah,
okay.

2780
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,050
I get it.
So anyway,

2781
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:28,090
Ted Cruz's team,
scroll down.

2782
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:30,070
So we find what he did.
You would just,

2783
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:33,640
there you go.
And 2007 Ted Cruz legal team working on

2784
02:01:33,641 --> 02:01:35,680
behalf of the then Attorney General Greg
Abbott.

2785
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:41,150
Um,
file the 76 page brief calling on the US

2786
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:41,180
Court of Appeals

2787
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:45,400
for the fifth circuit to uphold the
lower court's decision and permit a lot

2788
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:48,920
of stand.
The penal code inhibits the

2789
02:01:48,921 --> 02:01:52,880
advertisement and sale of Dildos,
artificial vaginas and other obscene

2790
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:55,310
devices.
Oh my God.

2791
02:01:55,311 --> 02:01:58,430
But does not forbid the private use of
such devices.

2792
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:01,820
That's hilarious.
So they wanted to uphold the law.

2793
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:04,750
That was a 76 page brief.
Listen,

2794
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,590
I feel the same way about this as I do
about drugs.

2795
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:11,591
Whatever you want to put in your body.
This is an even more innocuous.

2796
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:14,000
This,
this doesn't even get you drunk.

2797
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:16,350
You know,
you stick a Dildo in you,

2798
02:02:16,351 --> 02:02:17,510
you pull it out,
you're sober.

2799
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:18,860
I would imagine.
Listen,

2800
02:02:18,861 --> 02:02:21,440
you don't remember about the Dildo
massacre of 76.

2801
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:26,220
How could you file it?
People should go to.

2802
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:27,470
This.
Should go to jail.

2803
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:29,330
All of them for fraud.
First of all,

2804
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:32,210
it took you 76 pages to figure out
whether or not someone should be able to

2805
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:33,044
sell dildos.

2806
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,053
I mean it's.
Yeah,

2807
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:38,660
they should go to jail for going against
the constitution.

2808
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,400
What should it be?
Four words.

2809
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:42,140
Who gives a fuck?
That's it.

2810
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,740
Next case to what you want with your
plastic devices.

2811
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,400
Dude.
What's it like working for rt?

2812
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:51,590
That's fine.
Is it cool?

2813
02:02:51,591 --> 02:02:52,371
Do you like it?
Yeah,

2814
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:52,941
I mean,
here's the thing.

2815
02:02:52,941 --> 02:02:56,060
It's like all this shit I say I can't
say on like any other network,

2816
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:56,990
right?
They,

2817
02:02:57,110 --> 02:02:57,651
I,
you know,

2818
02:02:57,651 --> 02:02:59,070
I was on,
I was on some of these networks,

2819
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:01,280
one guest appearance and then I was at
like,

2820
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,330
what show was that?
Wow.

2821
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:05,290
You last time you played me on Fox News,
the laptop box.

2822
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:07,200
It was awesome.
I was on MSNBC.

2823
02:03:07,201 --> 02:03:10,100
You Dylan rat again.
The only time they've ever had me on,

2824
02:03:10,330 --> 02:03:13,370
I was on a Keith Olbermann only time
that ever happened.

2825
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:15,800
So it's like what happened when you and
Keith Olbermann while I was a guest

2826
02:03:15,801 --> 02:03:16,010
house.

2827
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:16,751
It wasn't him,
but,

2828
02:03:16,751 --> 02:03:17,584
uh,
Schuster,

2829
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,070
but uh,
there's nothing went wrong.

2830
02:03:19,071 --> 02:03:22,880
It's just the stuff I'm saying is not,
it's not good for corporations.

2831
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:25,400
I feel like you're a very reasonable
guy.

2832
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:29,090
I feel that way.
I don't think you're saying anything too

2833
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:31,720
crazy.
So when you work for rt,

2834
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:33,320
they pretty much let you.
I mean,

2835
02:03:33,321 --> 02:03:37,580
what kind of a editorial control they
have over your content?

2836
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:39,380
Well,
I mean technically they have editorial

2837
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:41,870
control,
but I'm not told to say anything I say.

2838
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:43,100
And that's amazing.
And yeah,

2839
02:03:43,101 --> 02:03:44,060
no,
it's huge freedom.

2840
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,380
And you know,
I think you have,

2841
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:49,040
you have our news which says on their
website we are the Russian perspective

2842
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:50,360
of the world.
And then you have red opinion,

2843
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:52,190
which is me,
Larry King,

2844
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:53,960
Jesse Ventura,
Larry King,

2845
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:57,770
Chris Hedges Hedges,
Chris Hedges.

2846
02:03:58,020 --> 02:03:59,260
Oh,
uh,

2847
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:03,110
Abby Martin used to be there obviously.
And so it's like great voices that it's

2848
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:03,944
just like,
it's,

2849
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:05,300
we're doing our opinion thing.

2850
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:06,560
We're doing the same thing we've been
doing for years.

2851
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:08,960
They try to ship Abby Martin off to
fucking Siberia.

2852
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:10,900
That was hilarious.
That was.

2853
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:13,880
That was such a catastrophe.
Not not just for them but it,

2854
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:17,390
but it was like CNN had her on.
I went with her to piers Morgan

2855
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:19,490
interview because they.
Because they thought she was going to

2856
02:04:19,491 --> 02:04:21,600
give their side of things.
They thought she was,

2857
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:22,850
oh,
she's on our team now,

2858
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:24,230
and it was like,
no,

2859
02:04:24,231 --> 02:04:25,790
Abby Martin knows what the fuck's going
on.

2860
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:26,750
And she said things.
They were.

2861
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:27,501
They were like,
wait,

2862
02:04:27,501 --> 02:04:29,270
she's going off script.
This is not what CNN thought.

2863
02:04:29,271 --> 02:04:30,230
She'd say,
yeah.

2864
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:33,020
Then they wanted to bring her to fucking
Ukraine.

2865
02:04:33,470 --> 02:04:37,980
All other people think that she got
fired from because of that.

2866
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,430
She was there for another year and then
left on her own accord.

2867
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,310
It is kind of crazy that they were
thinking of.

2868
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:45,540
They could just make her go there
though.

2869
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:46,500
Well,
they had an.

2870
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:48,360
That was funny.
She woke up that morning and they had

2871
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:51,420
announced she was going to go toward
Crimea without telling her and she was

2872
02:04:51,421 --> 02:04:52,254
like,
what?

2873
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:56,960
She's like the fuck I am the fuck I am
hilarious.

2874
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:59,680
Could you imagine if you got up and you
had heard that the,

2875
02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:05,380
the government of Russia had determined
that you're going to visit a warzone

2876
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:07,020
wow.
Wow.

2877
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,480
And I don't know that.
I don't know whether it was a PR person

2878
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:12,360
thought it'd be a good move.
I have no idea what happened.

2879
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:16,290
I bet it came from the top.
I don't think Putin spends his time,

2880
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:18,540
but he was in the middle of a botox
session.

2881
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,160
He was like,
he's like his mouth,

2882
02:05:20,161 --> 02:05:21,440
his nominees yelling out.

2883
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:28,050
It's getting botox.
Somebody needs to tell him to stop that

2884
02:05:28,130 --> 02:05:30,960
because he has to stoop fucking rugged
for Botox.

2885
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,353
So let it go,
dude.

2886
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:34,500
I was thinking a lot of the latest Brad
Pitt thing.

2887
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:37,320
I was wondering if there was some botox,
Brad Pitt,

2888
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:39,690
Brad Pitt was hanging out with Putin.
Is that what you're saying?

2889
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:40,231
No,
no,

2890
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:41,450
this is.
I saw a allied.

2891
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:42,570
It's actually a great movie.
Oh,

2892
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:45,180
his new movie.
You'll see some botox and Brad.

2893
02:05:45,860 --> 02:05:47,130
He just.
The wrinkles aren't there.

2894
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:51,320
Something's going on.
Something fishy going on and be Angelina

2895
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,590
Jolie's just got it.
That good

2896
02:05:54,370 --> 02:05:55,560
gives to you.
Stay young.

2897
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,020
They used that CGI stuff for a lot of
people.

2898
02:05:58,021 --> 02:06:00,750
Now when they're doing Hollywood movies,
do they use it throughout the whole

2899
02:06:00,751 --> 02:06:01,410
movie?
Yeah,

2900
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:04,260
and in lots of cases thought it might
look like that.

2901
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,940
Well maybe that's what it is,
is.

2902
02:06:05,970 --> 02:06:07,140
Well,
they did that for sure.

2903
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,570
With Westworld,
with Anthony Hopkins.

2904
02:06:09,900 --> 02:06:12,570
Spoiler alert.
There's one scene where the show Anthony

2905
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:16,260
Hopkins back in the day and they stay,
have him as you know,

2906
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:20,040
maybe a man in his fifties instead of in
his sixties and they do a really subtle

2907
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:24,150
job of CGI and it looks great.
It's amazing how far away from just like

2908
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:26,370
dad actors being in movies.
Oh,

2909
02:06:26,371 --> 02:06:29,160
100 percent to is touring.
You know?

2910
02:06:29,161 --> 02:06:30,350
That's true.
The hologram tour.

2911
02:06:30,351 --> 02:06:31,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

2912
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:34,080
I think um,
they're going to have almost an look at

2913
02:06:34,081 --> 02:06:34,914
that.
That's amazing.

2914
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:37,710
It's amazing.
Yeah.

2915
02:06:37,740 --> 02:06:39,810
How do you make them skinnier too?
Well,

2916
02:06:39,811 --> 02:06:41,670
they had them not just at this stage
either,

2917
02:06:41,671 --> 02:06:44,010
by the way.
They had them in more than one stage.

2918
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,650
They had them in a slightly older stage
as well.

2919
02:06:47,130 --> 02:06:49,050
It's just a.
and do you think the acting,

2920
02:06:49,051 --> 02:06:49,830
the scenes,
the,

2921
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:51,220
the,
the body,

2922
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,410
did they get a different actor?

2923
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:54,060
Vaccines?
That's a good question.

2924
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:55,200
Do they pretty sure.
Yeah.

2925
02:06:55,201 --> 02:06:57,170
It'd be a different actor and they just
put a different face on.

2926
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:59,430
Yeah.
You remember when they did that with the

2927
02:06:59,431 --> 02:07:01,830
soprano's and it was terrible.
No,

2928
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:05,970
the mom died and then they did one last
scene with the mom and you're like,

2929
02:07:05,971 --> 02:07:10,050
what in the fuck led you to think that
we would accept this

2930
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:14,230
was so bad.
It was so bad.

2931
02:07:14,231 --> 02:07:15,600
And they only had her in there for a
moment.

2932
02:07:15,601 --> 02:07:18,160
But what?
Somebody else's body or head was moving

2933
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,780
weird and just like,
look,

2934
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:21,000
here it goes.
Watch it,

2935
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,720
play it,
play it.

2936
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:22,553
Give us some volume.

2937
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:27,210
So how's it going?
What are you out of sight out of mind.

2938
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:29,910
Butch.
Some books on tape,

2939
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:34,230
but since you say you can't concentrate
to read,

2940
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:36,040
I wish the Lord would take me

2941
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,050
now.
Was it just using clips from?

2942
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,840
Yeah,
that's about all I know,

2943
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:43,750
man.
I thought there was A.

2944
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:46,390
I'm confused.
No,

2945
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:49,060
maybe this is the same scene,
I think.

2946
02:07:49,070 --> 02:07:50,620
Yeah,
those were just clips they had.

2947
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:51,490
Yeah,
that's not.

2948
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:54,520
That's not the same scene.
Why don't you google,

2949
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:59,670
what was the mom's name?
Fake Cgi mom in the soprano.

2950
02:08:00,230 --> 02:08:01,730
Maybe I'm wrong.
This is what came up.

2951
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:03,590
It says it happened.
Maybe I'm wrong,

2952
02:08:03,591 --> 02:08:05,710
but this is just the clip that pops up,
man.

2953
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:07,310
When I saw it,
I could have swore they had somebody

2954
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:09,740
else.
Six insane attempts to make movies

2955
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:14,740
starting dead movie stars that the next
thing during the sprint is the death of

2956
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:18,020
Olivia Soprano is the last time you see
whatever with poor CGI.

2957
02:08:18,021 --> 02:08:20,300
This foot.
That didn't look that bad though.

2958
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:22,970
Maybe a bit later.
And maybe it's just because we're

2959
02:08:22,971 --> 02:08:23,860
looking at,
um,

2960
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:28,370
maybe it's later in the Clinton
era there were showing her originally

2961
02:08:29,930 --> 02:08:32,600
whatever we lost Gandolfini,
bro.

2962
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:34,880
That's rough.
That's rough loss.

2963
02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:37,910
Okay.
Let's just let it go.

2964
02:08:38,150 --> 02:08:41,240
So I'm here that as the cops,
we've called them on.

2965
02:08:41,241 --> 02:08:45,100
You decided you a little too divisive
for trump's man.

2966
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:47,420
They're speaking to the cop.
There is a story going on right now.

2967
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:49,500
You guys might be interested in that.
Remember the shoe,

2968
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:52,130
I think it's the shooting of Walter
Scott was his name where the gun was

2969
02:08:52,131 --> 02:08:56,370
planted on the ground by the Cop after
they got to pee.

2970
02:08:56,810 --> 02:08:57,643
Pee.
Okay.

2971
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:58,613
Nabil,
right?

2972
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:03,500
No ears.
The cases going on right now,

2973
02:09:03,501 --> 02:09:05,060
and I guess they almost have a hung
jury,

2974
02:09:05,061 --> 02:09:07,430
like a,
it's the judge is telling them to go

2975
02:09:07,431 --> 02:09:09,740
back and deliberate and figure out how
they can handle it,

2976
02:09:09,741 --> 02:09:11,330
but they're there.
They're trying to get out of it.

2977
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:14,630
So this is the one where the guy shot
the guys who was running away and then

2978
02:09:14,631 --> 02:09:18,230
through a gun on the ground and you
could see it clearly in 55 witnesses

2979
02:09:18,231 --> 02:09:20,480
gave testimony in the case.
And

2980
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:26,570
what is there to deliberate on?
We'll find out shortly.

2981
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:30,350
They fucking shot the guy in the back.
We watched it on video and not only

2982
02:09:30,351 --> 02:09:32,960
that,
planted a gun and then drop the gun.

2983
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:36,920
Scary.
This is,

2984
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:40,100
that's the thing is like if the cubs
want us to respect them,

2985
02:09:40,101 --> 02:09:43,130
they've got to go after bad cops.
They never fucking do all these guys get

2986
02:09:43,131 --> 02:09:43,640
off.

2987
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:44,630
Yeah.
They have this,

2988
02:09:44,631 --> 02:09:45,201
um,
well,

2989
02:09:45,201 --> 02:09:49,250
I mean some cops that go after,
like that one woman who shot that guy

2990
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:52,730
who remember that he got tasered.
Then she shot him on the highway.

2991
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:53,990
He was a,
he turned around.

2992
02:09:53,991 --> 02:09:56,220
He wasn't listening to them.
He went and got back into his car.

2993
02:09:56,221 --> 02:10:00,650
They said he was on PCP.
Remember that what I had heard from

2994
02:10:00,651 --> 02:10:05,651
someone is in the tactical community was
that she made the gigantic error of

2995
02:10:05,901 --> 02:10:08,600
keeping our finger on the trigger and
that she wasn't doing anything.

2996
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:10,690
She was,
you're supposed to have total finger

2997
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:15,800
finger off the trigger because when the
guy got tasered by the other gentleman,

2998
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:18,740
the other cop,
she like reacted to it and pulled the

2999
02:10:18,741 --> 02:10:21,140
trigger.
This guy in the tactical community said,

3000
02:10:21,141 --> 02:10:24,390
it happens all the time.
That's why you have to have trigger

3001
02:10:24,391 --> 02:10:27,950
control because you don't even realize
you're doing it because you're reacting

3002
02:10:27,951 --> 02:10:29,670
to a violent moments.
Your muscles,

3003
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:32,270
whole lot.
You have your finger on the trigger and

3004
02:10:32,271 --> 02:10:33,980
then something violent happens and you

3005
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,130
just do that and you shoot them.
And that's what happened according to

3006
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:38,510
him.
I don't know if that's true,

3007
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:41,810
but I could totally see that I to fuck
that job.

3008
02:10:41,811 --> 02:10:43,370
Lee Camp,
right?

3009
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:47,250
I did there.
I think they're told that they had guns.

3010
02:10:47,251 --> 02:10:49,890
Are that,
that pulling out the gun is going to

3011
02:10:49,891 --> 02:10:52,120
solve the situation usually and it's
fucking,

3012
02:10:52,121 --> 02:10:53,640
it makes it worse half the time.

3013
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:57,610
Half the time.
But it was the other time.

3014
02:10:57,611 --> 02:11:00,250
It's perfect.
Fucking.

3015
02:11:00,251 --> 02:11:01,084
Yeah,
shoot away,

3016
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:01,871
Bang,
Bang,

3017
02:11:01,871 --> 02:11:03,980
Bang.
You leave it up to them to decide when's

3018
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:07,150
when,
when you do your show,

3019
02:11:07,740 --> 02:11:11,110
I'm on our team.
Do they have guidelines for you?

3020
02:11:11,111 --> 02:11:15,360
How much control you have over,
like what kind of stuff you do have to

3021
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,203
work with?

3022
02:11:16,270 --> 02:11:17,450
Uh,
no we have,

3023
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:19,520
we have a meeting with the news director
but uh,

3024
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:20,920
once a week.
But uh,

3025
02:11:21,010 --> 02:11:23,140
I write all my own stuff and it's
really,

3026
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:24,353
it's really pretty cool.

3027
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:27,340
That's crazy man.
What other network or give you that kind

3028
02:11:27,341 --> 02:11:28,630
of freedom.

3029
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:30,860
And here's the thing though,
is is,

3030
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:33,950
you know,
I just figured like the one thing I

3031
02:11:33,951 --> 02:11:38,951
actually do just kind of avoid
intentionally is saying nice things

3032
02:11:39,051 --> 02:11:41,510
about Russia because I know everyone's
going to think I was put up to it,

3033
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:42,980
right?
And I haven't been.

3034
02:11:42,981 --> 02:11:45,500
But I just know that's what people would
accuse me of.

3035
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:49,650
So do you,
do you find it amazing when you look

3036
02:11:49,651 --> 02:11:54,210
around in 2016,
there is a country like Korea where

3037
02:11:54,211 --> 02:11:58,740
you're completely divided and one side
is kind of American,

3038
02:11:58,741 --> 02:12:01,020
like you know,
one side South Korea.

3039
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:06,220
And then the other side is an insane
dictatorship and they live right next

3040
02:12:07,441 --> 02:12:11,640
door and they look alike and they were
once one country.

3041
02:12:12,210 --> 02:12:14,940
And this is how it could go bad and this
how can go good?

3042
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:18,530
I think it's,
I think it's a fucking major problem in

3043
02:12:18,531 --> 02:12:20,580
the way we discuss these things,
the way we talk to each other,

3044
02:12:20,581 --> 02:12:23,360
the way we view the world,
that we start to think of people as

3045
02:12:23,361 --> 02:12:25,940
their leader.
Like people thought all Americans.

3046
02:12:25,941 --> 02:12:28,820
Where George Bush,
people think all Russians are Putin.

3047
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:32,120
It's like this.
The leaders that are fucking crazy,

3048
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:35,270
it's like if you go fucking chat with a
Russian guy,

3049
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,220
you're gonna,
you're gonna love the dude.

3050
02:12:37,221 --> 02:12:39,020
Like probably like,
it was like,

3051
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:41,810
it's like everybody around the world,
we're not our leaders,

3052
02:12:41,811 --> 02:12:42,950
we're not,
you know,

3053
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:44,530
the,
the,

3054
02:12:44,610 --> 02:12:47,210
the Brits aren't,
they're crazy leader and the vus

3055
02:12:47,211 --> 02:12:48,980
trillions aren't,
they're crazy leader and it's like

3056
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:50,450
people are their own people.

3057
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:53,250
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons why having a

3058
02:12:53,251 --> 02:12:55,980
president in the first place is kinda
ridiculous.

3059
02:12:56,280 --> 02:12:58,450
Having one alpha person.
Yeah.

3060
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:01,950
Male or female running the whole show is
kind of a figurehead.

3061
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,910
Kind of preposterous.
Yeah.

3062
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:08,820
Bizarre that we still do it,
but it's,

3063
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:12,430
it's even more bizarre that someone can
still pull off a dictatorship,

3064
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:14,641
you know,
in Korea.

3065
02:13:14,641 --> 02:13:17,190
Like how does Korea and that's the big
one.

3066
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:19,440
Like how does North Korea and how does
that,

3067
02:13:19,710 --> 02:13:23,070
how does that ever resolve itself?
I have no idea.

3068
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:26,370
They're so deep in 2016,
so locked in.

3069
02:13:28,290 --> 02:13:30,860
Yeah.
Just people don't want to think that I

3070
02:13:30,861 --> 02:13:31,890
could ever happen here

3071
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:35,310
and it might not.
It absolutely could happen.

3072
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:37,680
And the other thing is,
you know,

3073
02:13:37,681 --> 02:13:40,250
in a certain way it's,
it's the best kind of slavery is you

3074
02:13:40,251 --> 02:13:42,750
don't know you're a slave.
So if you spend your whole life trying

3075
02:13:42,751 --> 02:13:46,230
to work off student debt and jobs you
hate,

3076
02:13:46,630 --> 02:13:48,300
it's like that's kind of slave.
You don't know.

3077
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:51,480
Your sleeve.
Cut to headline says Lee camp says Korea

3078
02:13:51,481 --> 02:13:54,630
is better than.
No,

3079
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:57,000
I'm not saying that Korea is fucking
awful.

3080
02:13:57,450 --> 02:14:01,890
Jesus though he can't points to
different type of slavery that makes

3081
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:06,480
America worse than everywhere.
No,

3082
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:08,250
it's.
But it's.

3083
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:09,700
Oh God,
the worst.

3084
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:13,110
Well,
Russia is a little spooky.

3085
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,850
Putin's a little spooky.

3086
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:20,000
Jack and
Jack and people

3087
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:24,250
gangster.
I mean allegedly were blowing people up.

3088
02:14:24,460 --> 02:14:25,390
Yeah,
we're doing that too.

3089
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,990
I don't know.
I don't know either.

3090
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,360
I just know you can't talk about a
proper right now.

3091
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:35,110
I made you uncomfortable talking about
something better.

3092
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:36,450
China.
China's fuck drop,

3093
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:38,580
right bro.
What's that?

3094
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:39,880
I said China's fucked up,
bro.

3095
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,740
I don't know much about him either.
I don't either.

3096
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:43,410
That's the problem.
It's a.

3097
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:47,140
it's just amazing how I couldn't even
tell you this is.

3098
02:14:47,710 --> 02:14:49,870
I shouldn't admit this.
I couldn't even tell you China's leader

3099
02:14:49,871 --> 02:14:51,220
right now.
They have a leader.

3100
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:54,820
China's president.
What do you think it would be president

3101
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,100
or would it be an emperor?
No

3102
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:01,240
president,
but I don't know his name.

3103
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:03,310
Well,
what does Canada have again?

3104
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:08,550
They have a uh,
well they have prime minister say that's

3105
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:12,370
so fucking high and Tati Trudeau.
Yeah.

3106
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,620
That's the dude trying to president.
Is that how you say z?

3107
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,620
Z?
Jin Ping.

3108
02:15:18,570 --> 02:15:22,030
It looks trustworthy.
I like him like we're doing a good job.

3109
02:15:22,370 --> 02:15:25,510
They're doing a good job over there.
Imagine running a billion people.

3110
02:15:26,650 --> 02:15:29,650
Fuck.
That's a crazy country,

3111
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:31,080
man.
Have you seen this?

3112
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:32,603
No,
I have not.

3113
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:35,020
Have you seen the cities that they
recreate in China?

3114
02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:38,080
Well,
the ghost cities that just recreate

3115
02:15:38,081 --> 02:15:38,321
that.
It's,

3116
02:15:38,321 --> 02:15:39,250
yeah.
These are two separate things,

3117
02:15:39,251 --> 02:15:40,660
but yeah,
they'll recreate where it's just like

3118
02:15:40,661 --> 02:15:41,320
Paris,
right?

3119
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:43,870
Yeah.
People just go there for our honeymoon

3120
02:15:43,871 --> 02:15:46,240
and everything's empty.
It's nuts.

3121
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:49,120
They recreate the old city.
It's nuts.

3122
02:15:49,390 --> 02:15:52,180
And the part of the reason they do that
is because they have these ghost cities

3123
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:55,180
and it's because GDP measures production
partially.

3124
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:58,630
And so to keep their GDP up,
they just build ghost cities.

3125
02:15:58,660 --> 02:15:59,530
Like fucking no one lives there.

3126
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:01,570
That's so crazy.
It's nuts.

3127
02:16:01,571 --> 02:16:06,571
Vice did a thing on it.
Now as a comic who also has a show and

3128
02:16:07,271 --> 02:16:09,250
you know,
you're this sort of observer of the

3129
02:16:09,251 --> 02:16:11,410
world.
Do you have to look at the world more

3130
02:16:11,411 --> 02:16:12,244
than you would like?

3131
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:15,470
Do I have to look at the world?
Well,

3132
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:18,770
like all the crazy chaos that you have
to kind of focus on or you just show and

3133
02:16:18,771 --> 02:16:19,990
doing standup.
I,

3134
02:16:20,030 --> 02:16:22,690
I,
I view my life because I'm,

3135
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:26,120
I've always focused on America just
simply because I'm an American in

3136
02:16:26,121 --> 02:16:30,280
America talking about American issues
and I don't honestly not educated well

3137
02:16:30,281 --> 02:16:31,720
on world issues.
Like I said,

3138
02:16:31,721 --> 02:16:34,470
I couldn't tell you certain leaders of
countries and so to me it,

3139
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:38,170
it comes from a place of ignorance.
It's like I don't know if I want to rant

3140
02:16:38,171 --> 02:16:40,450
and rave about something I don't know
the truth about.

3141
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,450
And so,
so I definitely stick to the American

3142
02:16:43,451 --> 02:16:45,040
issues,
but in terms of having to focus on the

3143
02:16:45,041 --> 02:16:46,930
chaos,
do they can get depressing to focus on

3144
02:16:46,931 --> 02:16:49,300
all the chaos,
to focus on the fucking protesters being

3145
02:16:49,301 --> 02:16:51,790
brutalized in standing rock.
It gets exhausting.

3146
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:54,790
Do you throw in the occasional cute
kitten story?

3147
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:56,540
Make things better?
Oh yeah.

3148
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,980
What can you throw in kittens?
It's not a weird thing about the news

3149
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:02,290
though.
I did one where I literally wish I just

3150
02:17:02,291 --> 02:17:05,980
showed puppy dogs over my shoulder as I
talked about it just to like show people

3151
02:17:05,981 --> 02:17:10,390
how do you feel a responsibility to show
people all of a sudden this become an

3152
02:17:10,391 --> 02:17:12,340
interview.
Try not to do those.

3153
02:17:12,341 --> 02:17:15,710
But I am curious about like what's like
to put together a show the jurors?

3154
02:17:15,950 --> 02:17:16,783
Yeah.
Every week.

3155
02:17:16,810 --> 02:17:18,430
Every week.
Do you feel like any sort of

3156
02:17:18,431 --> 02:17:22,800
responsibility to like for your content?
Like you have a platform and I feel

3157
02:17:22,810 --> 02:17:26,380
responsibility to not be too depressing
but not per story.

3158
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:27,040
So like,
I'll,

3159
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,240
I'll cover fucking depressing shit,
but I,

3160
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:32,110
I do feel a responsibility,
like in the sense of I don't think

3161
02:17:32,111 --> 02:17:35,590
people are going to keep watching,
nor will they feel active to create

3162
02:17:35,591 --> 02:17:37,000
change if they're just like,
ah,

3163
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:38,200
it's all fucked.
Fuck it.

3164
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:39,970
Like,
so I,

3165
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:42,940
I do try not to get too much on that
side of things.

3166
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:44,380
That's all

3167
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:48,430
logical but super depressing perspective
that it's all fucked.

3168
02:17:48,431 --> 02:17:50,560
Fuck it.
That's logic.

3169
02:17:50,561 --> 02:17:52,360
I get it.
I know why you would think that way.

3170
02:17:52,361 --> 02:17:53,200
But God,

3171
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:54,990
Oh,
I think there's a lot of people to think

3172
02:17:54,991 --> 02:17:56,390
that way.
Sure.

3173
02:17:56,470 --> 02:17:57,510
That give up and

3174
02:17:57,830 --> 02:18:00,950
they just decided not voting.
There's a guy that I really respect is

3175
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:04,020
get this psychedelic salon podcast.
Uh,

3176
02:18:04,050 --> 02:18:06,320
same as Lorenzo.
He's been on this podcast before.

3177
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:09,830
Really interesting guy and he runs this
amazing podcast that has all these

3178
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:15,110
psychedelic speakers like Terence
Mckenna and Alan Watts was like really

3179
02:18:15,111 --> 02:18:17,840
interesting people.
Audio recordings of them giving lectures

3180
02:18:17,841 --> 02:18:21,320
and stuff.
I'm Timothy leary and uh,

3181
02:18:21,321 --> 02:18:22,850
you know,
he went on this rant.

3182
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:23,900
He's like,
I don't,

3183
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:27,110
I don't buy an any of it anymore and I'm
tired of it.

3184
02:18:27,111 --> 02:18:28,700
I'm not doing it.
He's like,

3185
02:18:28,701 --> 02:18:30,590
I'm tired of being disappointed.
I just,

3186
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:31,550
I'm going to,
you know,

3187
02:18:31,550 --> 02:18:34,800
live my life and I'm not voting anymore,
and part of the party,

3188
02:18:34,801 --> 02:18:35,631
he goes,
Oh man,

3189
02:18:35,631 --> 02:18:37,520
you're putting the boom boom,
you know,

3190
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:38,930
party goes,
hey man,

3191
02:18:38,931 --> 02:18:40,520
that's your right.
Like I get it.

3192
02:18:40,550 --> 02:18:42,540
Like you just want to live this wild
idea.

3193
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:44,870
And especially with people like you said
earlier that they're,

3194
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:46,760
you know,
working three jobs trying to feed the

3195
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:48,260
fucking family.
It's like,

3196
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:51,740
of course they don't have time to give a
shit about five states over.

3197
02:18:51,741 --> 02:18:54,170
These people are being brutalized.
Like yeah,

3198
02:18:54,260 --> 02:18:55,940
it's too hard.
It's too hard to think about those

3199
02:18:55,941 --> 02:18:57,410
people in North Dakota,
you don't know them,

3200
02:18:58,590 --> 02:18:59,570
but.
But we have,

3201
02:18:59,571 --> 02:19:04,571
we have also created a culture that is
distinctly like good at getting people

3202
02:19:04,701 --> 02:19:09,701
to ignore what really matters.
Just like we're just under a swamp of

3203
02:19:11,001 --> 02:19:16,001
bullshit to actually pay attention to,
to important stories.

3204
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:21,700
You think that that is by design or do
you think that that is just what we were

3205
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:24,460
paying attention to it?
Like we pay attention to nonsense,

3206
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:27,740
celebrity gossip,
stuff like Brad Pitt and getting

3207
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:28,370
divorced

3208
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:29,080
and I think it's good

3209
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:32,680
combination of bydesign and just what
gets ratings.

3210
02:19:32,681 --> 02:19:35,860
You're going to get more ratings by
covering trump,

3211
02:19:35,861 --> 02:19:37,390
let's say,
or his twitter war.

3212
02:19:37,391 --> 02:19:42,391
Then you are going to get with like the
details of how these people are having a

3213
02:19:42,641 --> 02:19:45,310
really hard time because they were
kicked out of their home by the bank or

3214
02:19:45,311 --> 02:19:47,740
whatever.
So part of it is ratings,

3215
02:19:47,741 --> 02:19:50,800
but part of it is by design.
I mean the fact that occupied got very

3216
02:19:50,801 --> 02:19:52,960
little mainstream media coverage was by
design.

3217
02:19:52,961 --> 02:19:56,410
It was like if we cover this as an
important thing,

3218
02:19:56,530 --> 02:19:59,140
it's going to grow bigger and we're
going to fuel it.

3219
02:20:00,390 --> 02:20:01,910
Yeah.
No shit man.

3220
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:04,603
Yeah.
It's,

3221
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:10,760
it's interesting because the things that
we do get obsessed with that are

3222
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:13,280
ridiculous,
that take up so much of our time that

3223
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:15,200
really mean nothing.
You know,

3224
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:18,500
when you look at all the stuff that we
do ignore,

3225
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:22,250
you don't like the guy that got iced
that was under FBI care,

3226
02:20:22,310 --> 02:20:23,150
like that never,
never,

3227
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:25,820
never gets talked about whether or not
you agree with that.

3228
02:20:25,870 --> 02:20:29,000
Whether it should have shot him or not,
you're allowed to execute people now

3229
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:30,480
because that was going on,
right?

3230
02:20:30,481 --> 02:20:32,510
That that might be a big issue.
We should probably discuss it.

3231
02:20:32,570 --> 02:20:34,910
Right?
That's just one,

3232
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:36,470
right?
There's a million different stories.

3233
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:39,410
It's amazing that the standing rock
stories become as big as it is really

3234
02:20:39,820 --> 02:20:42,960
because they'll all that and Bernie
Sanders and all that.

3235
02:20:42,961 --> 02:20:46,540
Like any black lives matter.
It's like the only reason,

3236
02:20:46,541 --> 02:20:48,180
and you know,
I'm not saying everyone's gotTa love

3237
02:20:48,181 --> 02:20:51,810
Bernie or agree with all that shit,
but I'm saying I'm saying the fact that

3238
02:20:51,811 --> 02:20:55,080
those guys as big as they are,
it's all because of citizen journalism

3239
02:20:55,081 --> 02:20:57,420
and and social media and all that stuff.

3240
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:00,140
The Internet,
the ability to make your own new site.

3241
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:02,270
I mean new sites or.
No,

3242
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:05,480
this is all you need is a website.
The gatekeepers are gone.

3243
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:08,900
Not only the gone,
but like the amount of people that pay

3244
02:21:08,901 --> 02:21:13,340
attention to certain alternative media
sources far exceeds what you get an a

3245
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:17,580
daily episode of the bill o'reilly show,
like how many millions of people do

3246
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:19,180
think listening to bill o'reilly
cheeses.

3247
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:22,970
I don't even want to know.
I would like to know like what do you

3248
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:25,770
think
he might.

3249
02:21:25,890 --> 02:21:29,600
I might've been off it.
Does he get 2 million viewers or show?

3250
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:31,580
Do you think he gets 2 million views to
show Jamie?

3251
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,540
Yeah.

3252
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:37,120
Let's see.
I say yes.

3253
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:39,280
I say it gets more than 2 million to
show.

3254
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,890
That's what I.
that's kind of confidence I have in how

3255
02:21:41,891 --> 02:21:44,170
much are we going to point to how much
we betting?

3256
02:21:44,171 --> 02:21:47,740
I'll bet you five American dollars.
Did you hear about the Vegan?

3257
02:21:47,741 --> 02:21:52,060
$5 thing and in England they came out
with a new bank note and it's using

3258
02:21:52,061 --> 02:21:54,980
animal fat.
Vegans are freaking out and demanding a

3259
02:21:54,981 --> 02:21:55,814
Vegan note.

3260
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:58,500
You know what?
I got it.

3261
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:00,690
They got a good point.
I talked about this in my standup unless

3262
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:02,310
dry.
A lot of dryer sheets of animals.

3263
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:05,280
So if you're a Vegan,
that's funny.

3264
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:07,390
Oh my God,
not dryer sheets.

3265
02:22:07,391 --> 02:22:09,750
Those fucking clean free ones that make
you smell so good.

3266
02:22:09,751 --> 02:22:12,750
Naugles is a psychopath.
That's crazy.

3267
02:22:12,751 --> 02:22:16,440
It's got rendered up beings inside of
it.

3268
02:22:16,710 --> 02:22:18,000
What did we find out on?
Bill O'reilly?

3269
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:23,280
A article from earlier this year says
you averaged about 3 million.

3270
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:24,320
Thank you.
Oh,

3271
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:26,160
thank.
Thank

3272
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:31,160
you that a bunch of scared old people.
Mexicans just yelling at the screen.

3273
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:37,680
What about the age of the people that
watch your show is?

3274
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:38,730
Yeah.
No,

3275
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:40,140
it's like 50.
It's like,

3276
02:22:40,350 --> 02:22:41,070
yeah,
okay,

3277
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:42,510
let's.
Let's get really crazy.

3278
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:45,660
What's the percentage of them are white?
You think?

3279
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:48,060
Whatever you think they're going to tell
us that all of them.

3280
02:22:48,061 --> 02:22:50,310
One hundred percent.
They go through the entire United States

3281
02:22:50,311 --> 02:22:53,040
is not a single black guy like we heard
about a guy in Virginia.

3282
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:55,440
Quick.
Let's go before he shuts it off.

3283
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,730
They fucking one.
Not a Ben Carson out there.

3284
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:03,910
They said bad guy.
You're right.

3285
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:08,550
This is a black duck hunter
out there.

3286
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,420
Fucking out there.
You're so right,

3287
02:23:11,421 --> 02:23:14,070
dude.
Clarence Thomas hates black people think

3288
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:14,600
so.
Eight.

3289
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:16,530
So wow.
That's a big statement.

3290
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:19,560
Sorry,
I had no one.

3291
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:24,800
No one rules in ways that are going to
harm black people more than Clarence

3292
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:28,170
Thomas does.
He really hates him and his and his wife

3293
02:23:28,171 --> 02:23:31,340
is a.
He never said he hates his wife is a.

3294
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:34,010
she's one of the heads or head speakers
of the tea party.

3295
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:38,670
Like there's still a tea party.
Tea Board is sort of fizzled out.

3296
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:41,200
When Sarah Palin joined up.
Shit,

3297
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:44,610
I think that's like having an open party
in that crazy drunk down the street.

3298
02:23:44,611 --> 02:23:45,890
Comes in with a gun,
like

3299
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:52,950
a home party.
When is that furniture made out of

3300
02:23:52,951 --> 02:23:54,510
survival food.
I gotta go.

3301
02:23:55,330 --> 02:23:59,610
I gotta go
pick her survival food.

3302
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:04,050
Oh,
I'd love to see the first time he

3303
02:24:04,051 --> 02:24:04,920
presented that.
Listen,

3304
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:06,540
things get bad.
We started eating the furniture.

3305
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,410
I'd like to see like how they decided to
sell it that way.

3306
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:11,521
They say,
well,

3307
02:24:11,521 --> 02:24:13,840
what are people going to do with the
gym?

3308
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:18,750
They've got these big player.
Where are they going to do with these

3309
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,690
barrel weight?
They'll just put it on the table.

3310
02:24:22,550 --> 02:24:24,210
Where are your feet going to go?
Jail.

3311
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:27,870
You're going to eat from a fucking
distance away from the table.

3312
02:24:27,871 --> 02:24:30,670
You got damn con man.
Jessica,

3313
02:24:31,630 --> 02:24:34,260
where are people going to get planks of
wood to go on top?

3314
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:38,610
It's such a size six.
King Arthur's round table of survival

3315
02:24:38,611 --> 02:24:42,840
food.
Are you a fan of the Gloria standup days

3316
02:24:42,841 --> 02:24:44,910
in 19 eighties.
Kinison era too.

3317
02:24:44,911 --> 02:24:46,950
And I'm sad I went.
When did you start center?

3318
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,440
80 eight.
I'm sad I missed it.

3319
02:24:50,510 --> 02:24:51,590
I missed,
I missed.

3320
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:52,800
I missed.
I mean I was coming open.

3321
02:24:52,801 --> 02:24:55,230
Mike in the eighties.
I missed it for the most part,

3322
02:24:55,231 --> 02:24:58,710
but it was a fan,
but that was back when Jim Baker had

3323
02:24:58,711 --> 02:25:02,340
that gigantic scandal because he was
this big online minister guy.

3324
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:04,200
And he's banging his secretary.
Yeah.

3325
02:25:04,300 --> 02:25:07,560
Playboy playboy revealed it.
Yeah.

3326
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:10,170
And Gang Kennison started banging her.
What?

3327
02:25:10,230 --> 02:25:12,690
Yes,
after she left,

3328
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:15,720
she got,
she knew him from his pastor days.

3329
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:18,690
I do not think so.
I think he just zoomed in,

3330
02:25:18,691 --> 02:25:22,320
less attracted to this.
He knew those nutty Christian swinger

3331
02:25:22,321 --> 02:25:23,141
type.
She's like,

3332
02:25:23,141 --> 02:25:24,190
I know him.
I've been around

3333
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,060
them.
So he,

3334
02:25:25,061 --> 02:25:27,180
uh,
that was a bad candidate pressure by.

3335
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:30,580
And so he started banging her.
She got fake boobies.

3336
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:33,700
She posed for one of them Penn House or
something.

3337
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,200
One of the magazines.
Playboy

3338
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:37,213
days.
Yeah.

3339
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:40,590
It's just amazing to see Jim beggars
still out there rocking it.

3340
02:25:41,730 --> 02:25:46,730
Kennison long gone,
but fuck Baker furniture mixed together.

3341
02:25:48,890 --> 02:25:50,730
Eight your couch.
We'll be right back.

3342
02:25:50,731 --> 02:25:55,510
Praising Jesus failure couch cushion
with stakes in is.

3343
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:57,820
There's a scene in that video where he
has.

3344
02:25:57,821 --> 02:25:59,890
This girl was like,
you got some Mexican blood in you

3345
02:25:59,891 --> 02:26:02,560
telling me about these enchiladas.
We're not kidding.

3346
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:06,430
She's eating this enchilada.
It looks like it looks like a tampon

3347
02:26:06,431 --> 02:26:08,680
from a zoo animal.
That's what it looks like.

3348
02:26:08,681 --> 02:26:10,930
He's about to cut into this fucking
thing.

3349
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:16,140
It doesn't look anything.
Survival Enchilada,

3350
02:26:16,181 --> 02:26:18,700
and he's talking to her.
It's like you got some Mexican blood,

3351
02:26:18,701 --> 02:26:21,310
don't you?
Oh God.

3352
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:23,860
That's super deluxe guy who put that
video together.

3353
02:26:23,861 --> 02:26:25,360
He's a.
he's a beauty.

3354
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:27,730
He's a,
but he's a gift.

3355
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:31,840
A gift to all of us here on this planet.
It's a fucking hilarious video because

3356
02:26:31,841 --> 02:26:36,100
he just found the most preposterous
scenes and edited them and amazing way

3357
02:26:36,101 --> 02:26:38,910
where he closes in on his face when he
says Mike.

3358
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:42,990
Really nutty shit
guys.

3359
02:26:43,370 --> 02:26:44,710
Still rocking it,
man,

3360
02:26:45,090 --> 02:26:46,540
so I've got people in the audience

3361
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,840
stuck up people the same dad.
One I bigger than the other.

3362
02:26:51,990 --> 02:26:54,850
Not even just watching at home.
There's people that are their wall.

3363
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:58,240
Make it out to the studio.
Jim's going to give the sermon today.

3364
02:26:58,370 --> 02:27:02,240
Do you think that survival furniture do?
Please tell me that studio has a warmup

3365
02:27:02,241 --> 02:27:04,940
comic.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3366
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,950
we're going to need you to really give
it up here.

3367
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:10,190
Have you ever seen one of those guys
that does

3368
02:27:10,490 --> 02:27:12,350
Christian,
like church comedy?

3369
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:14,300
Ever seen that?
Oh No,

3370
02:27:14,301 --> 02:27:16,010
but I've heard about it.
A big thing.

3371
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,780
Number Watch.
They do enormous venues,

3372
02:27:18,920 --> 02:27:22,880
enormous 25,000 seat venue and they do
church comedy.

3373
02:27:23,690 --> 02:27:26,510
I'm not kidding.
They have standup comics that do clean

3374
02:27:26,511 --> 02:27:30,080
Christian comedy and the only perform
with these church gatherings kill

3375
02:27:30,081 --> 02:27:30,830
yourself.
Well,

3376
02:27:30,830 --> 02:27:35,450
it's a totally different sort of a vibe.
It's like this agreed upon note that

3377
02:27:35,451 --> 02:27:37,610
you're going to hit.
It's like if you were an opera singer,

3378
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:38,061
it's like,
well,

3379
02:27:38,061 --> 02:27:39,190
we can't play rap.
No,

3380
02:27:39,191 --> 02:27:41,060
no,
we do opera are right,

3381
02:27:41,210 --> 02:27:43,520
but that's what they're doing.
They're doing like a form of opera.

3382
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:46,280
Like,
I understand that for you or for me,

3383
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:50,940
that would be a horrific proposition,
but for someone who enjoys that tone,

3384
02:27:50,941 --> 02:27:53,960
right?
Like they hit that fucking Amos and

3385
02:27:53,961 --> 02:27:56,150
Andy,
you know Andy Griffith?

3386
02:27:56,890 --> 02:27:58,590
Hey,
there's someone that enjoys scooping up

3387
02:27:58,591 --> 02:28:00,280
the shit behind the elephants at the
circus.

3388
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:03,600
It's a job for everybody.
This guy is doing Jesus comedy.

3389
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:04,650
Wait,
this is the.

3390
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:09,790
Oh,
that's the guy with the TV show the

3391
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:10,633
Brown.

3392
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:13,080
Oh,
that's the guy who has the big hot dog

3393
02:28:13,081 --> 02:28:17,480
rolls in the back of his head,
the back of his neck because like hot

3394
02:28:17,481 --> 02:28:19,620
dog rolls.
That's a pastor that.

3395
02:28:19,621 --> 02:28:20,730
Yeah,
that's Mr Brown.

3396
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,980
Uh,
I

3397
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,860
always wondered where that family Sitcom
thing came from.

3398
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:25,970
That does look like.
Stand out.

3399
02:28:25,971 --> 02:28:27,410
Let me hear some of this.
Let me hear the sounds like,

3400
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:29,900
stand up on the.
What is this?

3401
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:37,080
Yeah,
he's doing standup and I know y'all pass

3402
02:28:37,090 --> 02:28:40,780
the don't do this,
but sometime my pastor starts preaching

3403
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:45,510
and I can't understand what he's saying.
Get the preaching of his

3404
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:48,893
stand up.
He's.

3405
02:28:49,150 --> 02:28:53,380
So he's doing standup 100 percent
people laughing.

3406
02:28:53,410 --> 02:28:54,850
You need to spit.

3407
02:28:56,350 --> 02:28:57,310
Oh my goodness.
No,

3408
02:28:57,311 --> 02:28:59,680
he did not,
and there bobbing up and down,

3409
02:28:59,681 --> 02:29:01,330
forward and back.
It's just,

3410
02:29:01,390 --> 02:29:03,880
that's another thing,
like it's agreed upon.

3411
02:29:05,620 --> 02:29:09,530
Agreed upon sort of quincy.
No.

3412
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:11,590
Yeah.
You got to hit in these certain notes

3413
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:14,140
and you know,
we all agree that we're,

3414
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:16,510
we're going to,
you know.

3415
02:29:16,810 --> 02:29:17,950
Yeah.
I mean that's the whole thing about

3416
02:29:17,951 --> 02:29:18,784
being a gentleman,
right?

3417
02:29:18,870 --> 02:29:19,980
Not Curse.
Yup.

3418
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:23,950
Yeah.
When you're wearing a tie and a suit and

3419
02:29:24,270 --> 02:29:27,670
a nice clothes like that,
I expect you to understand a certain

3420
02:29:27,671 --> 02:29:30,190
etiquette.
You're not a rag a bond.

3421
02:29:30,191 --> 02:29:32,650
You're not a savage.
That's some sort of hooligan.

3422
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:33,341
Right.
You know,

3423
02:29:33,341 --> 02:29:37,300
you're not some dude with fucking high
top converse on and ripped jeans and

3424
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:38,470
fucking dirty shirt.
No.

3425
02:29:38,471 --> 02:29:41,320
You're dressed in a way that I could
predict your behavior.

3426
02:29:41,770 --> 02:29:43,510
Well,
when we do the same with a sleeve of

3427
02:29:43,511 --> 02:29:44,344
tattoos,
right?

3428
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:45,430
Yeah,
for sure.

3429
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,160
A lot of people think they can predict
you or a pocket watch.

3430
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:51,850
I have a buck one,
but with the chain from a vest while I

3431
02:29:51,851 --> 02:29:54,090
have right now,
I have it hanging on my lunch.

3432
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:56,200
I was talking the other day about
everyone with a pocket watch is an

3433
02:29:56,201 --> 02:29:58,780
asshole and I have to amend that.
I like you.

3434
02:29:58,900 --> 02:29:59,621
I'm going to ask you.
Come on.

3435
02:29:59,621 --> 02:30:01,240
You're not an asshole.
You're a nice guy.

3436
02:30:01,870 --> 02:30:03,910
Let me see your pocket wash.
Because we were,

3437
02:30:03,911 --> 02:30:06,160
we were,
we looked up one that cost like how many

3438
02:30:06,161 --> 02:30:07,630
millions of dollars.
Oh No.

3439
02:30:07,631 --> 02:30:09,610
This is like,
this is $35,

3440
02:30:09,611 --> 02:30:12,160
but it was from like the 70 [inaudible].
This is dope.

3441
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,121
Alright,
I changed it.

3442
02:30:13,121 --> 02:30:16,810
I'm getting a pocket on the other way.
I'm not married to my thoughts folks.

3443
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:18,300
Okay.
You shouldn't be either key.

3444
02:30:18,350 --> 02:30:20,200
Didn't even stick to his beliefs on
pocket watch.

3445
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:22,150
This is dope.
This is dope.

3446
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:24,790
I love it.
And that's really cool.

3447
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:27,740
And I mean obviously I just for fun
because habit.

3448
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:30,310
It's fucking cool.
It's not right at all.

3449
02:30:30,570 --> 02:30:32,760
Now you got to keep you because you got
to keep wanting to again.

3450
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:35,290
Oh that's weird.
And I forget to wind up how often you

3451
02:30:35,291 --> 02:30:36,790
have to wind it.
No.

3452
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,650
Are you like several hours?
Once every few hours or.

3453
02:30:41,651 --> 02:30:43,540
That's so stupid.
Why'd you buy a cheap one?

3454
02:30:43,541 --> 02:30:44,920
Why don't you buy one that actually
works?

3455
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:48,310
Do you want people to know?
Look Man,

3456
02:30:48,311 --> 02:30:52,660
I'm at it works.
I'm a Mumford and sons video walking

3457
02:30:52,661 --> 02:30:54,310
around.
I'm

3458
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:57,701
walking,
living,

3459
02:30:57,701 --> 02:30:58,830
breathing,
Mumford and sons,

3460
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,210
and the key is you can only have one of
these things.

3461
02:31:01,211 --> 02:31:03,760
Like if I had the curly mustache too,
then you can't.

3462
02:31:03,790 --> 02:31:05,440
You can't have the biowatch and the
curly mustache.

3463
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:07,450
I couldn't have this pocket watch and
your hat right now.

3464
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:07,910
Right?
Right.

3465
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,743
That was fast.
Yeah.

3466
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:09,540
Yeah.
I know.

3467
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:13,960
I'm talking shit about wearing a build
versus a little rascals hat and I have a

3468
02:31:13,961 --> 02:31:18,110
fanny pack that's a real legit little
rascals heads.

3469
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:20,160
I'm a little upset at apple that I had
to buy

3470
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,670
this new little thing that allows me to
charge my,

3471
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:29,240
my phone and play music with an actual
set of fucking headphones instead of the

3472
02:31:30,551 --> 02:31:32,250
bullshit.
Proprietary crap.

3473
02:31:32,970 --> 02:31:34,140
Now I got it.
I got it.

3474
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:37,020
Setup.
So that's your fanny packs filled with

3475
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:41,280
those devices and weed and fear factor.
Money

3476
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:46,190
filled with fear factor.
Carry around.

3477
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:47,600
Not to comfort me.
Yeah,

3478
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:48,520
I'd get it,
but luck.

3479
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:51,060
Fuck.
Shut up.

3480
02:31:51,061 --> 02:31:52,960
You would have done it to how much are
you doing that show?

3481
02:31:52,961 --> 02:31:53,794
It was fun.

3482
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:56,770
Wow.
Was high every episode.

3483
02:31:56,980 --> 02:32:00,310
So there's always fun things every day.
And I worked with people that I really

3484
02:32:00,311 --> 02:32:02,070
loved.
They were really nice people.

3485
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:04,090
You're having a good time.
I had a great time because the people

3486
02:32:04,091 --> 02:32:05,740
that I work with,
like all the guys behind the scenes,

3487
02:32:05,950 --> 02:32:08,770
super super nice guys and I'm still
friends with to this day.

3488
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:12,070
So there was a lot of fun involved but
it wasn't what I wanted to do.

3489
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:13,530
It was just money.
So there was,

3490
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:16,870
it was moments where it was hilarious
and there's moments where I was really

3491
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:22,030
touched like I cried once when this mom
and daughter team one,

3492
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:26,050
like they were,
there was a son and father team versus a

3493
02:32:26,051 --> 02:32:29,830
mother daughter team and the southern
father team kind of Douchey and the

3494
02:32:29,831 --> 02:32:31,660
mother and daughter team.
We're kind of sweet.

3495
02:32:31,661 --> 02:32:35,190
And then you looked at them and this was
a physical stunt and the father was kind

3496
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:37,570
of in shape and the kid looks like he's
kind of shaped me.

3497
02:32:37,571 --> 02:32:39,280
Like God damn it,
these girls,

3498
02:32:39,281 --> 02:32:41,140
the mom.
And the daughter are going to lose

3499
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:46,720
and they really needed the money and the
sun was kind of insulting,

3500
02:32:46,721 --> 02:32:48,010
you know,
people play the game.

3501
02:32:48,011 --> 02:32:49,190
It's part of it.
They're encouraged,

3502
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:52,180
encouraged to be insulting,
but he fucked up.

3503
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:55,270
And then the mom and daughter one.
Wow.

3504
02:32:55,330 --> 02:32:56,650
And when they won,
like

3505
02:32:56,750 --> 02:33:00,290
the whole crew was crying camera.
People were crying.

3506
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:03,130
It actually got real.
Oh yeah.

3507
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:06,380
They were crying now because like,
oh my God,

3508
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:09,750
we want all this fucking money.
We did it and was against the odds.

3509
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:10,680
And that's cool.
Yeah.

3510
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:15,440
So I'll tell you,
years ago doing stand up,

3511
02:33:15,530 --> 02:33:18,140
it was probably when fear factory to
come back the second time or something.

3512
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:19,940
Two thousand 11.
Yeah.

3513
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,960
And I.
and I just stopped by comedies too.

3514
02:33:21,970 --> 02:33:23,880
I was watching.
It was fucking hilarious because he

3515
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,850
tainted a bit unlike,
hey listen,

3516
02:33:25,851 --> 02:33:27,120
I know I,
I,

3517
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:28,550
if you'd said to me,
would you,

3518
02:33:28,910 --> 02:33:31,820
would you be on TV?
Get Darren someone to eat a bowl penis.

3519
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:33,171
I would've said,
no,

3520
02:33:33,171 --> 02:33:34,430
I have no idea what you're talking
about.

3521
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:36,820
Yeah.
I wasn't even possible that I'm not.

3522
02:33:36,970 --> 02:33:41,970
The joke was that I'm on TV and I'm in
someone's eating an animal deck and I'm

3523
02:33:42,921 --> 02:33:43,670
like,
Hey,

3524
02:33:43,670 --> 02:33:47,360
you can do more.
You can get more in there,

3525
02:33:48,450 --> 02:33:51,920
and and the people running the show or
like,

3526
02:33:51,950 --> 02:33:53,240
good job.
That was great.

3527
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:54,180
The

3528
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:58,480
more dictate the better.
Really.

3529
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:00,630
I mean we really did serve people.
Animal Dicks.

3530
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:04,680
We served them elk,
Dick bold deck,

3531
02:34:04,860 --> 02:34:07,470
a couple of different types of dicks.
Who was the intern in charge of

3532
02:34:07,471 --> 02:34:09,660
collecting was.
It wasn't an intern.

3533
02:34:09,661 --> 02:34:13,260
It was a beast on guy.
There was a couple different ones,

3534
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:16,590
but Josh Silverman was one of the guys
who did it towards the end and he was

3535
02:34:16,591 --> 02:34:17,424
awesome at it.

3536
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,030
He knew his fucking craft,
like I knew how to get the most

3537
02:34:22,031 --> 02:34:24,820
disgusting stuff.
They all have a twisted sense of humor

3538
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:27,860
too.
They all have this very bizarre like

3539
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:31,060
realization of what they're doing,
how preposterous it is

3540
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:37,650
making people amazing.
Bob for a cow hearts in a vat of blood.

3541
02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:40,550
I think that was one of them.
These people that had bob,

3542
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:43,060
so they go into like a writer's room and
they're like,

3543
02:34:43,090 --> 02:34:44,740
what's the grossest thing we can come up
with?

3544
02:34:46,150 --> 02:34:48,760
Some of the stuff was insane.
That's nuts.

3545
02:34:48,910 --> 02:34:51,760
We went to a slaughterhouse once.
That was the one of the first times I

3546
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:54,150
ever believed.
Like when we went to the slaughterhouse

3547
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:56,740
I was like,
I really do believe that places hold a

3548
02:34:56,750 --> 02:34:59,050
feeling [inaudible],
you know,

3549
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:04,210
like I'd never been to a place where
like who knows how many thousands of

3550
02:35:04,211 --> 02:35:07,660
animals have died if not maybe a million
or maybe even more.

3551
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:08,980
I don't know how long had it been around
for,

3552
02:35:09,190 --> 02:35:12,220
but it was a like a legit big time
slaughterhouse.

3553
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:16,960
Was there a slaughtering going on?
Not what that we saw but very recently

3554
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:21,490
because we had to do the scene with
blood and when you have blood you have

3555
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:25,120
to keep it very cold and you can only
keep it that way for a short amount of

3556
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:28,870
time because it could get go bad.
You can get sick from it because these

3557
02:35:28,871 --> 02:35:32,260
people have to dunk their head into this
stuff so they have goggles on and they

3558
02:35:32,261 --> 02:35:35,350
have to dunk their headed.
They're bobbing in this freezing cold

3559
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:38,380
blood so you don't.
Your body doesn't want to do it because

3560
02:35:38,381 --> 02:35:40,650
it's so goddamn cold.
Imagine the number of lawyers involved

3561
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:42,970
too.
It's while this is going on,

3562
02:35:42,971 --> 02:35:46,600
there's a guy who's about to do the show
and he's outside and he's talking to

3563
02:35:46,601 --> 02:35:50,160
himself in the side mirror of a truck.
He's got like one of those side mirrors.

3564
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:53,050
That truck is not his truck,
but he's a competitor so he's like,

3565
02:35:53,051 --> 02:35:55,060
you found a mirror and he's like,
you are a winner.

3566
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:57,910
You are not a loser.
You will succeed.

3567
02:35:58,090 --> 02:36:01,690
You will follow through.
You will get it done and he's like doing

3568
02:36:01,691 --> 02:36:04,860
all this stuff and he just like,
he's doing like little sprints.

3569
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:08,170
The same thing Ted Cruz's kids say to
themselves before they talked to him

3570
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:11,240
probably will follow through.
You can talk to.

3571
02:36:12,170 --> 02:36:14,610
You will talk to Dad,
dad,

3572
02:36:14,611 --> 02:36:15,444
I'm gay.

3573
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:23,140
Anything else?
We can't do anything to add now.

3574
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:25,000
That's amazing.
I heard something about a,

3575
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,430
a this American life went into a
slaughter house,

3576
02:36:27,431 --> 02:36:28,910
like a pig slaughter house,
but it was Waldo.

3577
02:36:29,050 --> 02:36:34,050
It was while it was going on and like
two of them left mid segment and went

3578
02:36:35,711 --> 02:36:39,760
and vomited outside and then like it's
madness.

3579
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:43,300
Well that's one of those things like
many things in our culture,

3580
02:36:43,330 --> 02:36:45,040
it's like,
like prisons that we were talking about

3581
02:36:45,041 --> 02:36:46,720
before,
like how did it get to this point

3582
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:50,110
because we kind of realized it was at
this point as adults.

3583
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:52,300
I mean,
do you remember the day that you became

3584
02:36:52,301 --> 02:36:55,000
aware of factory farming?
You were probably a grown adult.

3585
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,681
Right?
And we,

3586
02:36:55,681 --> 02:36:58,030
we habituate to these things.
We get used to them.

3587
02:36:58,031 --> 02:37:00,430
We're just accustomed to like,
it's like it's slowly,

3588
02:37:00,431 --> 02:37:03,790
we're accustomed to so many people being
in prison and just slowly grows and we

3589
02:37:03,791 --> 02:37:07,300
slowly accept it and we sold the except
the invasion of privacy.

3590
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:09,520
It used to be without anyone watching
your email,

3591
02:37:09,521 --> 02:37:11,460
we people would talk about they were
upset.

3592
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:15,560
Now it's like everyone assumes and the
same thing can be said about factory

3593
02:37:15,561 --> 02:37:18,260
farming.
I mean the immediate answer as well.

3594
02:37:18,261 --> 02:37:20,420
Offering up a solution.
There's no solutions were.

3595
02:37:20,421 --> 02:37:22,130
What about the,
we need the numbers.

3596
02:37:22,131 --> 02:37:24,500
We need the numbers of Burgers,
so we need the numbers of chicken.

3597
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:26,720
Wow.
You know,

3598
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:28,460
we,
we,

3599
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,430
we've really painted ourselves into a
strange corner here.

3600
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:33,100
Well,
there's no reason that you know,

3601
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:35,390
hamburger.
Mcdonald's will be cheaper than like a

3602
02:37:35,391 --> 02:37:40,040
thing of Broccoli at the store.
It's like we're just subsidizing this

3603
02:37:40,070 --> 02:37:42,300
massive meat intake.
Yeah.

3604
02:37:42,620 --> 02:37:44,540
And the corn industry too.
That's another dark one.

3605
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:47,060
Three out of every four products in the
grocery store.

3606
02:37:47,061 --> 02:37:49,820
I have corn in them.
Jesus grew are basically does 90 percent

3607
02:37:49,821 --> 02:37:52,550
quarter.
Now I saw the documentary king corn.

3608
02:37:52,550 --> 02:37:54,470
Have you seen that when they test their
DNA?

3609
02:37:54,940 --> 02:37:55,701
Yeah.
Yeah.

3610
02:37:55,701 --> 02:37:57,530
They,
they test the carbon in their DNA.

3611
02:37:57,531 --> 02:38:01,970
The carbon in their fucking very virtual
being and it's like predominantly corn.

3612
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:06,710
These guys are there.
We're doing this documentary and they

3613
02:38:06,711 --> 02:38:08,650
start growing their own corner.
It's really fast.

3614
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:09,493
It's corn,
corn,

3615
02:38:09,550 --> 02:38:12,020
corn with hats on the a little bit.
Dude,

3616
02:38:12,740 --> 02:38:15,140
that's sugar corn syrup stuff that's in
everything.

3617
02:38:15,141 --> 02:38:17,300
Corn Protein.
Yeah,

3618
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:19,730
but meanwhile corn on the cob,
wonderful suicide.

3619
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:23,960
One of those things still.
It's just a good thing can be bad if

3620
02:38:23,961 --> 02:38:26,270
there's too much of it.
Right?

3621
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:28,070
Everything in moderation except for
moderation.

3622
02:38:28,071 --> 02:38:31,270
You just try and get all of that.
You can leancamp ladies.

3623
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:33,680
Gentlemen is here all week.
So often it dropping.

3624
02:38:33,681 --> 02:38:35,450
The bombs were.
Where are you?

3625
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:36,580
Where are you,
uh,

3626
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,360
doing standup where someone could come
and see you.

3627
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:39,740
Oh,
um,

3628
02:38:39,741 --> 02:38:40,210
I don't know.

3629
02:38:40,210 --> 02:38:42,580
I'm touring the country,
but we do have a live audience were

3630
02:38:42,581 --> 02:38:46,080
redacted tonight in DC.
So beautiful theses.

3631
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:48,350
You're flying out.
You're a fucking animal dude.

3632
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:51,320
There's no not tonight because he be
lying to people.

3633
02:38:51,520 --> 02:38:54,020
And I didn't say it to any politician
tonight.

3634
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:56,410
You did say tonight.
I'll redact it tonight.

3635
02:38:56,411 --> 02:38:57,880
His name is.
Oh,

3636
02:38:58,390 --> 02:39:01,810
we thought you were saying redacted to
hawes tonight.

3637
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:04,910
Now every week.
Except for this one loophole.

3638
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:07,730
The Guy got away on a loophole.
That slippery politician.

3639
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:10,160
We have a live audience and people can
come.

3640
02:39:10,490 --> 02:39:12,440
They just sweat email,
redacted ticks.

3641
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:17,110
So you do everything in our t is in,
is in dc because that's where our

3642
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:19,230
America's big studios are.
And say,

3643
02:39:19,231 --> 02:39:21,530
yeah,
what does DC like these days?

3644
02:39:21,531 --> 02:39:23,830
So to a weird environment,
that must be a hell hole.

3645
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:25,430
It was free weed though.
It's legal,

3646
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:27,140
right?
Well it's legal,

3647
02:39:27,141 --> 02:39:30,230
but you can't like be just publicly
smoking.

3648
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,490
It's like when you have to do.
Maybe I was talking,

3649
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:37,100
I was like,
what are the rules in the the.

3650
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:37,671
They were like,
oh,

3651
02:39:37,671 --> 02:39:41,120
you got to go around the corner.
The law is you got to go around the

3652
02:39:41,121 --> 02:39:42,890
corner.
What does that mean?

3653
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:47,690
You just can't be out on the sidewalk.
If you had to guess how long before

3654
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:52,640
state like countrywide legalization.
Ten years.

3655
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:54,200
Maybe less.
I think so,

3656
02:39:54,470 --> 02:39:55,820
yeah.
What makes you think that?

3657
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,350
Well,
the states that have legalized,

3658
02:39:57,351 --> 02:40:00,340
they're doing fine.
They're doing better than fiber and so

3659
02:40:00,350 --> 02:40:03,860
it's like people realize it's not the.
You just had to get past this propaganda

3660
02:40:03,861 --> 02:40:06,280
of it's like destroys lives.
It's scary.

3661
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:10,040
And once you get past that,
what do you think about that jeff

3662
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:12,680
sessions guy though that,
that trump brought in?

3663
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:15,630
That guy is a old school.
Antioch.

3664
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:17,700
He used the.
One of my favorite ones.

3665
02:40:17,701 --> 02:40:19,980
Good people don't smoke marijuana.

3666
02:40:22,730 --> 02:40:25,830
I'd love to know the list of drugs that
Donald trump has done over the salt.

3667
02:40:25,890 --> 02:40:26,651
Coke,
coke,

3668
02:40:26,651 --> 02:40:27,020
coke,
coke,

3669
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:27,441
coke,
coke,

3670
02:40:27,441 --> 02:40:28,221
adderall.
Coco,

3671
02:40:28,221 --> 02:40:29,060
Coco,
coke.

3672
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:30,800
Do you think he does drugs?
He doesn't drink.

3673
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:33,050
He doesn't drink.
Not Anymore.

3674
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:36,530
Remember when they were accusing him on
CNN of doing coke?

3675
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:38,820
It was potentially doing coke lot.
Yeah.

3676
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:41,780
I mean that was just his like,
you know,

3677
02:40:41,781 --> 02:40:43,050
buffalo brain.
Just

3678
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:49,850
bowl.
Got Her with that Zinger.

3679
02:40:50,360 --> 02:40:52,100
You'd be in jail.
Yeah.

3680
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:54,200
That was,
that was the singer of the campaign,

3681
02:40:54,201 --> 02:40:55,510
wasn't it?
It's pretty good.

3682
02:40:55,940 --> 02:40:58,610
Did you enjoy the whole festivities?
Did you enjoy the,

3683
02:40:59,110 --> 02:41:01,580
of the nonsense of it or were you upset
by it?

3684
02:41:02,050 --> 02:41:03,590
No,
I don't know.

3685
02:41:03,591 --> 02:41:05,060
I just kind of.
It's all.

3686
02:41:05,240 --> 02:41:06,920
I did one segment where I took,
honestly,

3687
02:41:06,921 --> 02:41:10,490
it was like three minutes of the two of
them talking to another debate and just

3688
02:41:10,490 --> 02:41:11,630
every half sentence I would stop it and
go,

3689
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:12,380
that's not true.

3690
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:13,700
That's not true.
That's not true.

3691
02:41:13,810 --> 02:41:14,750
That's,
that's bullshit.

3692
02:41:14,870 --> 02:41:16,650
Like every,
it's like everything,

3693
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:20,330
every word that comes out,
he's somehow manipulation and it was

3694
02:41:20,331 --> 02:41:21,320
just like,
it's,

3695
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:23,300
it's both sides on both sides.
And,

3696
02:41:23,310 --> 02:41:24,590
and I just,
I was like,

3697
02:41:24,591 --> 02:41:26,510
this is,
I tried to cover it as little as I

3698
02:41:26,511 --> 02:41:27,650
could.
I mean it's still covered it a lot,

3699
02:41:27,651 --> 02:41:30,140
but I tried to avoid it as much as I
could because it's just a fucking

3700
02:41:30,410 --> 02:41:33,610
sideshow.
My most frustrating thing of the

3701
02:41:33,620 --> 02:41:38,450
campaign wasn't just that because I was
aware that there was a lot of things

3702
02:41:38,451 --> 02:41:42,500
that were being said that weren't true
was that there was very few people doing

3703
02:41:42,501 --> 02:41:45,260
what you just said while you recovering
and on both sides.

3704
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:47,120
Saying that's not true.
That's not true.

3705
02:41:47,121 --> 02:41:48,230
That's not true.
That's not true.

3706
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:50,330
Yeah.
Like if you go back and forth from a

3707
02:41:50,331 --> 02:41:53,480
right wing show to a left wing show,
it's hard to pay attention.

3708
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:55,190
It's hard to know what the hell is
really going on,

3709
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:56,540
right?
Student for realities.

3710
02:41:56,570 --> 02:41:58,310
And no one was doing like what you just
said.

3711
02:41:58,311 --> 02:42:00,020
You didn't go with the whole thing like,
hey,

3712
02:42:00,021 --> 02:42:01,580
this is all crazy.
Yeah,

3713
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:04,580
because people are lying.
They're wrong.

3714
02:42:04,581 --> 02:42:05,414
They're lying.

3715
02:42:07,230 --> 02:42:08,910
Now I want Lee camp.
What do we do?

3716
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:12,120
Do we energize Bernie?
We got to get them on hormone

3717
02:42:12,121 --> 02:42:14,370
replacement therapy and keep them alive
longer.

3718
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:17,170
I think you should go get him on a
training regimen.

3719
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:18,670
I want to get them doing deadlifts.
Yeah.

3720
02:42:18,730 --> 02:42:21,300
Got To get them to fix that posture to
this shit.

3721
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:22,860
You can't.
Nobody wants it.

3722
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:27,260
I'll just take it.
I want you to put it under your chin on

3723
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:29,090
up.
Every day when you woke up one,

3724
02:42:29,110 --> 02:42:31,140
just sit up straight.
This is very important.

3725
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:32,890
Bernie.
You can't be doing this.

3726
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:33,751
Listen,
this comes.

3727
02:42:33,751 --> 02:42:36,690
This comes from the 30 years of trying
to change the government.

3728
02:42:37,140 --> 02:42:39,500
That just.
It just wastes time.

3729
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:44,080
It just shrinks you into a diamond plus
snow shoveling in Vermont.

3730
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:46,470
I think what he should do is he should
run in four years,

3731
02:42:46,471 --> 02:42:49,020
but he should say,
I'm only going to serve for four years.

3732
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:53,220
Nobody wants that could make a
difference in the stamina to go eight,

3733
02:42:53,310 --> 02:42:55,740
and then trump's going to come in.
I don't have insurance.

3734
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,290
I've got a winning attitude and he's
going to win again.

3735
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:02,160
Trump's like overweight.
He doesn't need that looks great though.

3736
02:43:02,190 --> 02:43:05,040
It doesn't look whatever cocktail he's
on his fucking carrying them through

3737
02:43:05,041 --> 02:43:06,810
like a champ.
I'm telling you.

3738
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:09,210
Look,
you could say about his appearance all

3739
02:43:09,211 --> 02:43:10,290
you want.
Now you.

3740
02:43:10,291 --> 02:43:11,800
You'd be absolutely correct,
but

3741
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,980
he never showed any signs of physical
deterioration.

3742
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:16,590
No,
I think he's okay,

3743
02:43:16,591 --> 02:43:18,660
but he is.
He is relatively overweight.

3744
02:43:18,661 --> 02:43:20,580
He's not a healthy man.

3745
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:22,210
Definitely not.
Yeah.

3746
02:43:22,211 --> 02:43:23,920
No.
If I was his friend,

3747
02:43:24,220 --> 02:43:26,500
I would definitely get them on some sort
of an excellent diet.

3748
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:28,750
I'd be like,
there's a way to do this better.

3749
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:30,850
You know,
you allow even more energy and you're a

3750
02:43:30,851 --> 02:43:35,380
god dynamo as it is.
That was a real concern to the Hillary

3751
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:36,970
Clinton health concern and when you
would bring it up,

3752
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:41,560
people would say you're an asshole for
discussing and that you're a sexist or

3753
02:43:41,561 --> 02:43:43,390
you're enabling and some sort of a way.
Like,

3754
02:43:43,710 --> 02:43:44,350
no,
these,

3755
02:43:44,350 --> 02:43:46,630
these are legitimate concerns.
She had a stroke.

3756
02:43:47,370 --> 02:43:48,440
Yeah,
I mean,

3757
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,070
and I,
I don't,

3758
02:43:50,071 --> 02:43:51,240
I don't honestly,
a lot of it,

3759
02:43:51,241 --> 02:43:51,620
I don't know,

3760
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:52,740
tradition.
Say she had a stroke.

3761
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,760
She had,
excuse me,

3762
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:55,170
she,
she fainted,

3763
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:56,700
she blacked out.
She had a seizure,

3764
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:59,490
fell and cracked her head.
That's been,

3765
02:43:59,550 --> 02:44:04,170
that's been confirmed and then she had
another seizure apparently in 2015 that

3766
02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:04,980
was discussed

3767
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:08,250
during the week and then what was the
one where where Bill Clinton in an

3768
02:44:08,251 --> 02:44:09,180
interview.
He was like.

3769
02:44:09,181 --> 02:44:09,841
He was like,
Oh yeah,

3770
02:44:09,841 --> 02:44:12,900
she has these spells every once in
awhile and anyway,

3771
02:44:12,901 --> 02:44:14,310
the point is like,
I don't know what the,

3772
02:44:14,330 --> 02:44:16,680
what the truth of every last detail that
is,

3773
02:44:16,681 --> 02:44:19,770
but it was like it was like they're not.
They're not talking about that in a

3774
02:44:19,771 --> 02:44:21,690
legitimate way.
They're not talking about the fact that

3775
02:44:21,691 --> 02:44:23,370
Donald Trump won't release his medical
records.

3776
02:44:23,371 --> 02:44:25,450
He had one doctor write a five minute
thing and said,

3777
02:44:25,460 --> 02:44:26,700
oh,
it's the healthiest guy that's ever

3778
02:44:26,701 --> 02:44:28,680
lived.
What the fuck is that Dick?

3779
02:44:30,090 --> 02:44:34,200
Not Orange pay regular color.
That'd be weird that you cannot be

3780
02:44:34,201 --> 02:44:36,030
addicted to of color from the face.
He got it.

3781
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:38,970
If you're going to go on and you got to
go all orange all the way down on his

3782
02:44:38,971 --> 02:44:40,080
toes,
his orange,

3783
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:43,410
except like a little strip down as
butthole,

3784
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:47,370
like when people like Tan spray tanning
thing and then do porno.

3785
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:50,520
That'd be amazing.
If he had just a really tiny bikini

3786
02:44:50,521 --> 02:44:52,530
line,
well you know,

3787
02:44:52,531 --> 02:44:54,900
people like if you.
Do you remember what it be like if

3788
02:44:54,901 --> 02:44:57,900
people would sit in a tanning bed like
tanning beds have kind of gotten out of

3789
02:44:57,901 --> 02:44:59,580
favor,
but one of the things about tanning

3790
02:44:59,581 --> 02:45:01,560
beds,
they would leave weird sort of semi

3791
02:45:01,561 --> 02:45:06,561
white spots on your butt because your
cheeks kind of compress and so like your

3792
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:10,020
cheeks touch each other when you're
lying flat on that thing,

3793
02:45:10,021 --> 02:45:12,390
so in between your butt cheeks gets
Pale,

3794
02:45:12,780 --> 02:45:16,800
like unless you're making a real
concerted effort to spread your asshole

3795
02:45:16,801 --> 02:45:19,590
out and sort of hover over.

3796
02:45:19,590 --> 02:45:24,210
That opened that Suntan booth for a good
solid 20 minutes or how long it takes

3797
02:45:24,211 --> 02:45:26,670
you.
I'm sure Donald Trump has people spread

3798
02:45:26,671 --> 02:45:28,940
his cheeks for it.
Probably in the tanner.

3799
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:31,830
They just smooth it all out.
Let's get my cheeks spreaders.

3800
02:45:31,890 --> 02:45:36,890
Get them in here in.
Yeah.

3801
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:39,150
I don't think he's using.
I think it's,

3802
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:41,610
it's probably a spray tanning type
thing.

3803
02:45:41,611 --> 02:45:44,300
It wasn't just drinks out of character
so and were just being assholes.

3804
02:45:44,301 --> 02:45:47,250
There's no way.
Maybe there's some kind of excuse to do

3805
02:45:47,251 --> 02:45:48,380
that.
Spray Foam.

3806
02:45:49,020 --> 02:45:52,560
I've seen people do that with so much
carrot juice and orange.

3807
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:53,131
Yeah,
yeah,

3808
02:45:53,131 --> 02:45:55,440
yeah.
He was drinking so much carrot juice

3809
02:45:55,441 --> 02:45:57,840
that his fingers started getting.
He was talking about it.

3810
02:45:58,320 --> 02:46:00,900
It's apparently super common when people
do that,

3811
02:46:00,901 --> 02:46:02,280
they drink a tremendous amount of
characters.

3812
02:46:02,281 --> 02:46:03,920
It literally will change the color of
your skin.

3813
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:06,240
We didn't look too weird until he
brought it up and you're like,

3814
02:46:06,241 --> 02:46:08,070
oh wow.
Wasn't like,

3815
02:46:08,071 --> 02:46:08,940
dude,
you got you,

3816
02:46:09,440 --> 02:46:10,370
you going orange on us.

3817
02:46:10,470 --> 02:46:11,730
It's cutting corners,
not blue.

3818
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:12,603
It'll be blue.

3819
02:46:13,080 --> 02:46:13,913
That's a good thing.

3820
02:46:16,990 --> 02:46:19,960
How do you have time to do your show and
do standup?

3821
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:21,840
Is that difficult to do?
Yeah,

3822
02:46:21,850 --> 02:46:22,960
it is.
I only,

3823
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:25,090
I've only been doing stand up,
uh,

3824
02:46:25,180 --> 02:46:27,160
when I go out to cities and I do,
like,

3825
02:46:27,161 --> 02:46:30,580
I'll play a theater or something,
but I haven't been getting up as much as

3826
02:46:30,581 --> 02:46:33,670
I would like it.
So you basically just do your show and

3827
02:46:33,710 --> 02:46:36,610
like does a lot of the subject matter
just bleed out in your standup because

3828
02:46:36,660 --> 02:46:38,700
of working on this stuff?
You must find some pretty observed

3829
02:46:38,701 --> 02:46:42,370
subjects.
Most of my standup,

3830
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:44,830
uh,
it comes from stuff from the shell

3831
02:46:44,890 --> 02:46:47,830
because it's just like I can't fucking,
I basically have two,

3832
02:46:47,831 --> 02:46:50,560
I have two TV shows,
one of them and luckily as an interview

3833
02:46:50,561 --> 02:46:53,350
show so it doesn't fill up as much in my
writing time,

3834
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:55,210
but,
but I've got the right to a whole other

3835
02:46:55,211 --> 02:46:58,770
show every week and so I just don't have
time to write new standup.

3836
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:02,320
So the standup usually becomes a stuff
that was in the show.

3837
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:04,510
Are you planning on doing a special
anything anytime soon?

3838
02:47:05,110 --> 02:47:07,510
Um,
well we just filmed this a redacted

3839
02:47:07,511 --> 02:47:10,320
tonight live.
We called it or whatever and laugh

3840
02:47:10,330 --> 02:47:15,130
factory and we're going to a or portions
of that at the end of December on our

3841
02:47:15,131 --> 02:47:17,680
youtube channel.
So that'll be a bit of a special.

3842
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:19,450
Oh,
so you did it like as standup.

3843
02:47:19,510 --> 02:47:20,430
He did it like.
Yeah,

3844
02:47:20,470 --> 02:47:21,700
stand up.
Okay,

3845
02:47:21,701 --> 02:47:22,540
cool.
Yeah.

3846
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:25,570
Well accept passed by the laugh factor.
I put it up on my instagram the other

3847
02:47:25,571 --> 02:47:27,680
day I passed by the laughter.
I wouldn't look at camps.

3848
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:31,410
Does that feel weird?
Driving down,

3849
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:33,360
seeing your face?
It's weird,

3850
02:47:33,361 --> 02:47:36,000
but here's the thing,
as you will know all it means that

3851
02:47:36,001 --> 02:47:39,660
someone had some money to do.
That doesn't really mean anything.

3852
02:47:40,050 --> 02:47:41,370
I'm your friend.
Took a picture of it,

3853
02:47:41,371 --> 02:47:42,204
man.
Thank you.

3854
02:47:42,300 --> 02:47:43,600
Thank you.
Thank you.

3855
02:47:44,580 --> 02:47:45,930
You've never from one of your new
albums,

3856
02:47:45,931 --> 02:47:47,550
you've never done the laugh factory
billboard?

3857
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:49,870
No,
I've never had the laugh factory before.

3858
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:50,753
You coulda.

3859
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:54,240
Well,
I

3860
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,560
tell people what's the best way to get
ahold of you?

3861
02:47:58,561 --> 02:48:00,630
What's the best way to see your stuff?
What's the website?

3862
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:04,060
You should check out the show at
youtube.com/redacted tonight,

3863
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:08,980
but everything else is pretty much Lee
camp.net and at Camp on twitter and your

3864
02:48:08,981 --> 02:48:11,260
shows on our rte and on Youtube.
The same exact show.

3865
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:13,030
Yeah,
we put it all.

3866
02:48:13,031 --> 02:48:14,080
Yeah.
So unlike,

3867
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:16,120
unlike daily show or something,
we put it all on youtube.

3868
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:18,120
Oh,
that's nice.

3869
02:48:18,150 --> 02:48:20,100
That's very cool.
So you don't have to have our tea to get

3870
02:48:20,101 --> 02:48:20,760
it.
Nope.

3871
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:25,190
These crazy kids that are untethered,
untethered from the free as a bird and

3872
02:48:25,191 --> 02:48:27,160
don't give a fuck.
Crazy barrier out there.

3873
02:48:27,161 --> 02:48:29,520
A bit torrent and then.
All right,

3874
02:48:29,521 --> 02:48:30,540
well,
um,

3875
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:33,810
that's how you get all your stuff out,
Lee camp and when done that,

3876
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,630
when we camped on it and when can people
see again when,

3877
02:48:36,631 --> 02:48:38,130
when is your next tour date?
Where you at?

3878
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:38,900
Anywhere

3879
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:39,770
next door to it?
Yes.

3880
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:44,390
I'm playing like a Cleveland and
Pittsburgh in the new year and I have

3881
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:46,650

02:48:46,670 --> 02:48:48,290

3883
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:49,660
Very funny guy.
