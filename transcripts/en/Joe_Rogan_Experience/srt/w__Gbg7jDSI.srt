00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,630
Did you see the Philadelphia
conference that I,

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:05,201
that I sent you,

4
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,160
which is about,

5
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:06,550
uh,

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,900
about what people's guilt.

7
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,330
I'm guilty.

8
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm guilty.

9
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,230
What did they do?

10
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,760
There was a,

11
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,400
I was white.

12
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,870
There was a white privilege conference.

13
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,840
I love that article
because weighted this side,

14
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,060
I'm sure.

15
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,291
Yeah.

16
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:19,471
Yeah,

17
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:20,050
you did.

18
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,411
I was like,

19
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,460
why is my Twitter blowing up?

20
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:21,791
Oh,

21
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:22,624
Joe retweeted me.

22
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,793
Uh,

23
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,200
so there was this white
privilege conference,

24
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,350
which was a kind of
politically correct talk fest,

25
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:29,970
right?

26
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,460
Eh,

27
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,870
and it basically ended up consuming itself
entirely because the people who were

28
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:38,260
attending it decided that the
conference itself had become too white.

29
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,030
So they went,

30
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,791
they will get it.

31
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,624
They were all there.

32
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,160
So they had this Hashtag um,

33
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,600
white privilege conference.

34
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,820
So what WPC,

35
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,683
so white,

36
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,501
uh,

37
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,520
and it started after one of the speakers
there who was a white historian,

38
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,091
uh,

39
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,390
went over time and won an Asian American,

40
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,091
attend a,

41
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,640
a woman tweeted out,

42
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,720
great keynote,

43
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,490
but going over time a lot.

44
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,410
It is another example of white supremacy,

45
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,330
Hashtag white privileged
conference so wise.

46
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,360
And he also made them

47
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,530
stake of using the n word in his speech.

48
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:13,470
I mean he obviously was using it in a
historical context cause he was talking

49
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,550
about race in America.

50
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,810
But once that happened,

51
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,531
uh,

52
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,920
I mean what could possibly go wrong using
the n word at a conference about white

53
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:20,191
guilt,

54
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:20,760
right?

55
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,220
Then everyone starts tweeting inward.

56
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,170
Never acceptable from Hashtag white folks
lips deeply offensive and traumatizing

57
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,120
hashtag white privilege conference.

58
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:31,810
So white and that was from a white

59
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,291
tweeter.

60
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,930
So then it's like a snake
eating its fucking tail.

61
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:35,111
Right?

62
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,740
All these white people just accusing
one another of being too white.

63
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:39,670
You're all white.

64
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,713
We get it,

65
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,643
we get it.

66
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,320
It's would Michael Shermer
calls virtue signaling.

67
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,493
Right,

68
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,050
right.

69
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,470
It's there.

70
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,350
They're letting the good,

71
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,710
it's perfect for a term there.

72
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:54,711
They're trying to find someone who's
made some sort of an error and they're

73
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,890
attacking them with full force.

74
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,690
Yup.

75
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,780
And it's also like they're
ignoring context on purpose.

76
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,210
It's like by saying that the word is,

77
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:07,060
it's never acceptable to say the n word.

78
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,130
By saying that and
putting that in a tweet,

79
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,780
that's not true.

80
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,070
It's just not true.

81
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,670
Like,

82
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,040
if there's a reason to say it,

83
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,830
if you were explaining
something that happened,

84
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:19,000
what someone said,

85
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,230
how they said it,

86
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,270
you are allowed to repeat the word.

87
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,660
The idea that you're not allowed to
repeat the word around grown adults is to

88
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:27,130
pretend that word is magic.

89
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah.

90
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,340
So pretend that word's
going to conjure demon.

91
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,571
Well,

92
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:30,950
it also empowers the word I.

93
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,251
In fact,

94
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,840
I feel stupid for even
having used the phrase,

95
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,340
the end would cause
ordinarily I just say nigger,

96
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:37,500
if I'm talking about the existence
of that was shot the podcast on,

97
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:37,751
Hey,

98
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm Australian so I
don't understand context.

99
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,634
Right.

100
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,600
But I mean I was talking about this a,

101
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm on my podcast about,

102
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,780
I do think that we,

103
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,280
we've gotten away from like where is the
other person's heart and what is their

104
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,114
intention?

105
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,910
Yeah,

106
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,450
there's,

107
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,283
there is,

108
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,123
um,

109
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,053
let's see,

110
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,770
you could think of it like an
Amoeba around your physical body,

111
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,273
cloud

112
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,270
of,

113
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,103
um,

114
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,290
pulsating thought forms.

115
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,813
And,

116
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,390
uh,

117
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,100
as you're imagining,

118
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,113
uh,

119
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,780
you know,

120
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
a,

121
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,270
the beautiful elements of life and things,

122
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:16,780
it's,

123
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,380
it seems to be in a kind of order and uh,

124
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,590
and maybe kind of wafting upward it,

125
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,750
these are like,

126
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,173
uh,

127
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,910
the,

128
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,800
the spiritual positive,

129
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,100
uh,

130
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,520
kind of frameworks sometimes that
you're seeing life through when you're

131
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,354
tripping,

132
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,691
you know,

133
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,640
and seeing the connections between things,

134
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,710
lines forming and things like that.

135
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,470
The,

136
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,870
the more kind of organic
geometries that that show up,

137
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,230
you see this intelligence of life and the,

138
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,980
uh,

139
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,700
the,

140
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,720
the light of divine intelligence
that came through for Allison,

141
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,340
like in this language,

142
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,570
it,

143
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,770
it's seems to be weaving things together
and when you're in touch with that

144
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,000
infinite light that
seems to be the source,

145
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,170
uh,

146
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,460
then that is it.

147
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,600
You can keep it upwardly moving and
very evolutionarily caught cosmically

148
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,270
consciously moving forward.

149
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,750
And when then you're thinking regretful
thoughts or thinking negative thoughts

150
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,970
and anger and things like that.

151
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:28,760
There's a constriction that
goes on in your heart I think,

152
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,710
and kind of shuts things down in
that kind of like you were saying,

153
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,730
twisting in,

154
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,310
curling in and darkening and,

155
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
and things are,

156
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
are all,

157
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,460
uh,

158
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,430
things that when you're journeying,

159
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,610
you see them manifest literally
and you're the flow of your,

160
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,430
the theater of your imagination.

161
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,060
And so I think you really
beautifully described that.

162
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,653
Uh,

163
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,450
just in that I was totally there.

164
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,330
I think it's a disease of consciousness.

165
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,290
I think it's very similar
to catching a cold that,

166
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,120
you know,

167
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,250
uh,

168
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,570
you don't see the cold,

169
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
you don't see a disease,

170
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,611
you don't see it,

171
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:07,540
but it affects you.

172
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,870
And I think there's an analogy to be
made about diseases of consciousness that

173
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,050
you can get locked into these
terrible ways of looking at the world.

174
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,230
I found for a while I enjoyed living
within very strict guidelines.

175
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,020
It was just easier when we go to a
restaurant because I used to joke that I

176
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,200
would like to be buried and a bread
basket with a fuck ton of butter,

177
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,360
like bread and butter is my thing.

178
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,543
Um,

179
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,070
and when we go to a restaurant
and they bring the bread,

180
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,491
like I just,

181
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,324
I don't even touch it.

182
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,990
It's not mine.

183
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,241
I just,

184
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,100
it was so,

185
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,310
it was nice to not even have to
think about all these things.

186
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,563
Um,

187
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,010
but then,

188
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know,

189
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,220
I,

190
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,770
a few months ago I just thought,

191
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,950
I don't feel like this is really
doing anything for me anymore.

192
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,560
And I miss my lean cuisine dinners,

193
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,740
which is what I used to eat.

194
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,940
[inaudible] cuisine.

195
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,781
They're not bad.

196
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,614
Yes,

197
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,370
I know all the things you can miss.

198
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:04,880
I know.

199
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,211
Well,

200
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,650
healthy choice dinners as well.

201
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,470
What the fuck you doing with that process?

202
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,304
Bullshit.

203
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,980
I know I had stopped eating
the process of which I missed.

204
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,560
I missed the bullshit I missed.

205
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,220
I missed the wood pulp wood.

206
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,370
What is Wood Paul?

207
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,350
It's probably some kind
of filler in there.

208
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,340
I'm just saying there's like wood
pulp in your food in Parmesan cheese,

209
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:25,910
I think.

210
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,530
Why didn't that come out recently?

211
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,130
What?

212
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,580
Right?

213
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,030
Yeah.

214
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,470
Jamie knows Jamie,

215
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,161
what are you talking about?

216
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:31,530
What?

217
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:31,781
What?

218
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,330
What kind of Parmesan cheese and just the,

219
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,580
the,

220
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,100
you know the bottle of
Kraft parmesan cheese.

221
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,990
It came out that a certain percentage of
it is like wood shavings or something.

222
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,833
Hearts.

223
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,290
Jesus Christ.

224
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,770
Why are they putting wood in
your cheese so that there's a,

225
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,470
it's day just plants though.

226
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,431
That's right.

227
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:49,821
Cheese.

228
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,620
You sprinkle co what?

229
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,660
Cellulose.

230
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,081
Okay.

231
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,891
Hotly contested.

232
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,780
But perhaps now for reasons,

233
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:55,970
right?

234
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,430
Think FDA investigation found
that a Pennsylvania company,

235
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:02,460
castle cheese incorporated had doctored
it's so-called Parmesan with it.

236
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,970
Mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose.

237
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,070
Also known as wood pulp.

238
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,651
Oh,

239
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:08,840
well if you say cellulose,

240
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,580
that doesn't sound right.

241
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,820
Yeah.

242
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,700
Cellulose just sounds like
like fiber from plants.

243
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,570
Plant material.

244
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,463
Yeah.

245
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,130
Hmm.

246
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,710
Well there shouldn't be plant
material and fucking cheese.

247
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,544
You can't,

248
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,310
assholes should go to jail for that.

249
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,960
Putting fucking wooden cheese.

250
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:27,650
You can't just do that and you can't
mix cheddar cheese with wood and call it

251
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:28,484
Parmesan.

252
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,920
So attached should have
its own new variety name,

253
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,441
wood,

254
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:33,861
pulp,

255
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,820
cheesy thing,

256
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,280
right.

257
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,020
Just call it that.

258
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,853
Yeah.

259
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,390
People would buy it.

260
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,620
My mouth is watering.

261
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,311
Well,

262
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,810
you're eating lean cuisine and saying,

263
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,280
I don't know what it is in the
processed frozen dinners that I like,

264
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,120
but that's what I like.

265
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:48,560
Sort of like when I smoked,

266
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:48,921
I was like,

267
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:49,101
yeah,

268
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,650
I think it's the fiberglass
in the cigarettes that I like.

269
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,090
Yeah.
