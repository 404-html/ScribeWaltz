1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,440
You're not a Boston comic?

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,190
No,

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,601
not at all.

5
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,750
I grew up in Wooster in Wooster,

6
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,940
Massachusetts as I was
old enough to leave.

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,500
You are a Boston comic.

8
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,400
Whether you like it or not,

9
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,110
there's a reason why there's
so many fucking funny guys
from that shitty part of

10
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:17,790
the country and it's not shitty.

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,300
Which shit?

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,690
His shitty.

13
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,020
Yeah,

14
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,711
the weather's Shitty.

15
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,310
The girl,

16
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,510
I think everything about,

17
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:21,631
well,

18
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,464
not everything,

19
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,880
obviously hyperbole,

20
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,020
but I did not know.

21
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,760
The girls were nice till I moved to La.

22
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:28,320
I didn't know they were
capable of being nice.

23
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,360
I fucking dumb as shit.

24
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,710
We're fucking hillbillies,

25
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,190
man.

26
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,590
Eddie Bravo's any problem?

27
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,500
Probably just girl.

28
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,750
I met this girl in Boston and she,

29
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,660
it was just a fucking Hail Mary
sacrifice two in the morning,

30
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,710
move way back in the day,

31
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,131
many,

32
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:41,964
many decades ago,

33
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:42,870
and anyway.

34
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,703
She goes,

35
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,101
wow.

36
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,660
While he's like making out with her,

37
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,441
it pulls his dick out,

38
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:46,681
whatever.

39
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:47,190
He goes,

40
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,950
she goes,

41
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,980
can it tell you friends

42
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,480
about girls in Boston?

43
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,260
That's,

44
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,730
that's what I remember growing up.

45
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,250
I remember the only time I ever got
to fuck with the girls were so sloppy,

46
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:08,930
drunk and belligerent that it was like
we had to argue before we get to fuck.

47
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:09,711
And then when we did it,

48
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:10,191
when it was over,

49
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:10,550
I was like,

50
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,881
oh,

51
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:12,830
I got to go home and get
me the fuck away from this.

52
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,520
You better fucking Kwame Kwame.

53
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,160
There's still like that.

54
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,050
It's,

55
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,080
it's a cold weather.

56
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,130
Is it the fucking savages that lived there
that came over on boats from Ireland?

57
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,930
One of my first real girlfriends,

58
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:28,220
when I say 16,

59
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,054
17,

60
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,343
uh,

61
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,880
I kept in touch with her,

62
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,301
you know,

63
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,830
remotely here and again.

64
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:38,831
And I remember I had to be in my
thirties gone back and I call in.

65
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,431
Yeah,

66
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,090
we'll have a drink and I,

67
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,371
hey,

68
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,250
you look really good.

69
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:44,084
And she goes,

70
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,110
yeah.

71
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,800
She goes,

72
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,071
yeah,

73
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:49,820
well maybe if you hadn't have fucked
Sherry Munson was still beating again.

74
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,663
They're

75
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,510
17 years old.

76
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,251
Oh,

77
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,240
that's hilarious.

78
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,103
Oh,

79
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,681
oh,

80
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,000
that's so fucking funny.

81
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,631
But they do,

82
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,180
they hold on to that shit forever.

83
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,670
That's a fucking get
out of jail free card.

84
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,700
It's one of those few pat myself on the
back times in my is is is just comparing

85
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:20,090
myself to most of the people we grew up
with and knowing that one night in my

86
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,700
life would be something
they would remember.

87
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,610
That would be like the
fucking biggest shit.

88
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:26,900
I don't remember doing.

89
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,680
I've done television shows
that I don't remember.

90
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,070
Wait,

91
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,250
oh,

92
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,600
you were on my show and I'm like,

93
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,140
Eh.

94
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,250
Sounds familiar.

95
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,530
If they were on the news
once in the background,

96
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:42,500
they'd have a still photo
of it somewhere in there.

97
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,000
Fucking grubby.

98
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,120
I can Foxboro Framingham fucking
route nine route nine the auto mall.

99
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,163
Oh,

100
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,310
when I was 21 years old,

101
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:57,180
you could have easily talked me into
doing some fucking colony course.

102
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,520
Right.

103
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
I would have saved up my money.

104
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,950
Took an acting course I got was completely
ripped off when I was 18 I had a bad

105
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,130
acting teacher who was going to
earn while you learn program,

106
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,530
are they going to get you
gigs while they fucking,

107
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,940
you paid them to go weekly,

108
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,540
but we'll,

109
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
we'll get you working.

110
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,000
Get Ya to casting agents.

111
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,800
They do that with models too,

112
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,634
right?

113
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,810
How is a classic,

114
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,580
took the train to la.

115
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,980
As soon as I was 18 went
400 bucks in my pocket.

116
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,100
I get off the train at union station
and I'm going to be an actor.

117
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,460
Why?

118
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,180
It didn't work out.

119
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,050
When I was in Boston,

120
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,790
every girl had a modeling photo.

121
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,693
Remember when girls,

122
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,360
what you used to go to
modeling Casablanca?

123
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,811
Yeah,

124
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,440
and they would take a photo of the girl
or standing like this and like her hair

125
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,240
blowing in the wind and the poses.

126
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,700
They would spend all this money.

127
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,600
It was basically a huge scam where they
would just get these girls to spend a

128
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,960
fuckload of money on getting their photos
taken and then they get their photos

129
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,810
taken with this guy's logo at the bottom
of it and they would send it out and

130
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,740
nothing would ever happen.

131
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,320
But it was like these curls
like cabin doing some modeling.

132
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,600
I recently got some new shots,

133
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,203
did some modeling.

134
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,190
Every fucking God damn was a models.

135
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,470
Crazy bitches.

136
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,131
You weren't even that good.

137
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:04,550
Look at it.

138
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,810
Tell your friends

139
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,140
tell you if

140
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,430
I can't even early in the night drunk,

141
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,880
she was drunk and I was
just trying to avoid her.

142
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,750
I was trying to avoid her.

143
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,580
I was just trying to avoid
her and she goes to me,

144
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,480
you think you're off?

145
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,360
DFAC

146
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,320
younger my face with this fucking
thing in the fingers moving.

147
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,740
He thinks we have facts like those
girls get sloppy drunk every weekend.

148
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:39,900
Those are the trends.

149
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,590
They know what the fuck they're
doing is fucking just milky.

150
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,400
All believed in and

151
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
shaved pussies wiring,

152
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,840
cigarette breath and
fucking dirty ass holes.

153
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,390
It's dilute vein titties,

154
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,810
black fucking shearing socks and make
your feet sweat and it's smelling shit

155
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,410
tube top belly hair,

156
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,680
blue eyes shadow thrown up in the Torah.

157
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,110
Tell leave,

158
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,143
don't

159
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,100

160
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,420

161
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,603

162
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
my God.

163
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,670
Can you imagine having a,

164
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,060
if I ran into half the chicks I boned
as a teenager now cause they were pigs

165
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,870
then.

166
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,630
Oh I see him now at our age.

167
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,850
Oh.

168
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,410
I went and found my,

169
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,910
my original high school girlfriend on
Facebook and I opened up her thing and

170
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:56,151
said,

171
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:59,510
send her a message and I went like that
with my fingers and I hovered over the

172
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,160
keyboard and I wanted to apologize.

173
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,870
I want to apologize for being me.

174
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,670
I want to apologize for being 14 I
want to apologize for the whole fucking

175
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,031
thing.

176
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,810
I mean here,

177
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,680
but you know this is,

178
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,830
this is the first one.

179
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:14,570
This is the first one and I looked at it
and you're just fucking shut this thing

180
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,404
off.

181
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,880
Close the window.

182
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,631
Like what are we going to do?

183
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm 43 years old.

184
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm going to apologize for being a
Douche bag when I was 16 you're a con too

185
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,370

186
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,340
What's it to basis?

187
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,590
You got the fucking fat.

188
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,550
Fuck you fucking western Massachusetts.

189
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:29,390
I went there once.

190
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:30,141
It drove an hour and a half.

191
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:31,820
You didn't even fuck me
because you were mad at me.

192
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,450
I just had that Joe.

193
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:34,671
It did.

194
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,080
I tell you what happened to me with this.

195
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,541
I write it down.

196
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,374
Somebody wrote something.

197
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,753
I had this x

198
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,470
chat me on Facebook and was like,

199
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:42,711
Hey,

200
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,050
I have something very
important to tell you,

201
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:45,320
like,

202
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,711
and I'm like,

203
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:45,991
what's it?

204
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:46,340
What is it?

205
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,611
And I'm like,

206
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:46,731
no,

207
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:47,660
I need to talk to you in person.

208
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,710
I can't do this over chat.

209
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,930
And this is from like 12 years
ago or something like that.

210
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,801
And so I'm like thinking,

211
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,071
all right,

212
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:56,180
it's one of three things that either I
have a child or I have aids or she found

213
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:56,690
Jesus.

214
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,700
It's like one of the three things,

215
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:58,534
right?

216
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,350
It's like I'm going to where Facebook.

217
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,711
And I'm like,

218
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:00,921
all right,

219
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,270
these kids look kind of retarded.

220
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,060
It might be mine.

221
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,010
I don't know to kind of look,

222
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,810
it looks a little Asian or whatever.

223
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,490
So she calls me up and she goes,

224
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:07,641
Hey,

225
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,040
I just want you to know something
that you remember that abortion,

226
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,390
you paid for it and like a year.

227
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:11,781
And she goes,

228
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,010
I just need money for heroin.

229
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:15,370
I started doing heroin after we
broke up and I really needed money.

230
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:16,080
So I made,

231
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,120
I said this whole thing that we're,

232
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,954
I was pregnant.

233
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,060
Oh,

234
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,930
I thought she said,

235
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,501
you told me.

236
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,420
She said she was pregnant with
another guy and it wasn't.

237
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,383
She said

238
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,680
I was pregnant with her
new heroin friend guy,

239
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,270
but they spent so much money on heroin.

240
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,400
They needed money and
I gave her like $500.

241
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,540
It wasn't like regular,

242
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,040
like

243
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
did you ever send the money back hunt?

244
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,383
No.

245
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,610
Hi.

246
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,700
Dot four seven 50 and suck my Dick Dude.

247
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:37,941
I said,

248
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:38,091
dude,

249
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:38,950
like interest.

250
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,421
Yeah,

251
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:43,400
you should at least get an
extra 250 bucks in a blow job.

252
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,200
It was crazy cause I saw him like heroin.

253
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,143
Hey,

254
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,370
beat off on her tits rot.

255
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,180
That's why I sold my comic books.

256
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,610
I forgot Coles and shooting loads.

257
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,453
Go Black.

258
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,590
I sold my comic books.

259
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,290
I forgot I sold my whole comic book
collection to pay for this abortion.

260
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,621
Okay,

261
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,030
well now she's a fuck ton.

262
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,890
She has ruined your iron man collection.

263
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:01,724
Yeah.

264
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay.
