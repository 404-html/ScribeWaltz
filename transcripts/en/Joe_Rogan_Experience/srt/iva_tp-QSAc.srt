1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,040
Oh, just say we're live.
We're live. We're a woman.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,220
Look at this picture Brendan shops.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,650
When I ask for my money
tomorrow and fight companion,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
Eddie Bravo is so silly. The memes.
First of all, what the fuck are we doing?

5
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:25,230
Boys were up seven o'clock in the morning.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,710
We're in this fucking studio for
live fights from the Philippines.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,430
If you listening to this podcast,
this is not a regular podcast.

8
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,860
This is what we call a
fight companion podcast,

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,860
which means the fights are
on and we will bullshit.

10
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,670
And nine 99 times out of 100 word,
not even talking about the fight,

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,780
some of the most hilarious and
entertaining fight companions or fight or,

12
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,390
or podcast,
whether it turn out from this.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,800
But a bottom line is we're all,
we're all exhausted.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,400
It's really early in the morning.
Uh, my man, Eddie Bravo here,

15
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:01,020
Jujitsu master music producer. Cool
motherfucker. Best friend, Aubrey Marcus,

16
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:05,940
my brother, a warrior Sharman poet
character. What else? So cool.

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,500
Motherfucker Brennan Shab about as
cool as it gets for me. UFC fighter.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,970
Oh current. Maybe we'll see what's
up. Plus the numbers dropped.

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,940
Hosted the fighter and the kid podcasts
all around. Cool. Motherfucker again.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,210
And uh, Jamie Vernon who came with
the Krispy Kreme this morning,

21
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,990
like I motherfucker, he brought the
Krispy Kreme donut. Aubrey, by the way,

22
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:30,840
I want to applaud you on your discipline.
No,

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,280
I like haunting me that the
lid is just wafting wafting.

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,340
Abra is the only one who hasn't eaten.
Did you have any Krispy Kreme? Yeah. Yeah,

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,310
we all ate it. Fuck it. I, I'm
a little disappointed Opry.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,530
Cause now I've now I feel bad.

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,790
And you're all shredded in the
cage and he ate a donut. Oh yeah.

28
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,190
But he doesn't give up.

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,430
We are here watching highlights of Costa
Philippoussis smashing people and uh,

30
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,920
he's going to take on Kkr Mu Saucy
and look at Port Gianna Anak.

31
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,900
Brian Stann antics do hair.
How about Stan? He's like,

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,190
I could be home right now. They're
both like, he's in the Philippines.

33
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,750
He's like fucking Brad Pitt right now.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,930
You're talking about and he's
having a great time. Well,

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,870
the Philippines can imagine if you could
catch it right after Manny Pacquiao one.

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,470
Ooh, I catch that wave.
Goddamn, they'd be so happy.

37
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,480
You see those videos was photos of all
the people watching? No, there's no crime.

38
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,450
When he fights, it's the one day where
there's no crime in the Philippines.

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,040
The entire nation stops to
watch him fight. I believe
it. True Story. I believe it,

40
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,690
man.
I wonder how they're going to

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,240
fuck that dude. Watch your watch your
p's and q's. That's Manny Pacquiao, bro.

42
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,810
Well, you know that's just, I dunno.

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,700
It's like thousands of islands. I think
there's thousands. Not a thousand.

44
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,100
I think there's thousands of islands.
I didn't know that.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,030
I wish I had the energy to Google
it. God, I want my boy mark me. It

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,280
comes to when computer right here.
It would be nice. You want his last,

47
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,440
his last fight in the Philippines.
Not that I don't like Luke.

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,130
I looked Lou Barnett. Yeah. I
like Luke a lot. Mark is my,

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,820
he's just such a good boy. We need
them to win. He's such a good dude.

50
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:16,990
Tried to bet on that Eddie or why you went
Luke, what's going on? No, no, no, no, no,

51
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,660
no. Is My boy. No, but

52
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,190
people used to think I was
Filipino growing up, so fuck
that. Yeah, but you're not.

53
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,120
You're definitely not though.
People think I'm Mexican.

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,240
I don't root for cane every time.
But you're born Aaron Hernandez.

55
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,980
He gets convicted yesterday. Uh,
it looks like now. Right? He's a,

56
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,670
he's got some other side of
you just kills bitches though.

57
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,280
He's the opposite of you. Like
you're such a sweet guy. I know.

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,750
He is a very mean person. Yeah.
It can't be killing people, man.

59
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,520
It was 7,107 islands in the Philippines.
Islands must be cheap.

60
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,330
You could probably buy it to grant.
Right?

61
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,220
Sometimes they only stick around for a
couple of months and then go on to waters.

62
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,063
Why?
They're cheap.

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,870
They're like the realtors at the 30%
line right now that will be underwater

64
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,800
within five years and just look
at the islands available. Oh,

65
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:17,020
well here we got about
6,000 I have no idea.

66
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,050
That's like super gangster money if you
could buy an island. Yeah, I knew that.

67
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,740
I knew it was over a thousand.
I thought it was thousands.

68
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:26,650
I didn't think it was 7,000 all right.
Aaron Hernandez,

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,180
what do you think you
got how many years ago?

70
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,100
I know the Boston bomber didn't get
the death penalty. Makes Sense, right?

71
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,420
The fuck are we doing?
Yeah, there's a screen.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,520
Who got life? Whoa. Yeah.
He gets two more. Right?

73
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,820
Cause he's convicted of the one
murder of Odin Lloyd Wright life.

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,050
Could they escalate to death? Whoa. Maybe

75
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,230
can't kill people. Yeah, that's
not cool. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

76
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,260
Anyone who knows him said they can't
believe he made it this long without

77
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,770
getting cut. I guess he's just a
bad dude. I don't really know that.

78
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,550
I didn't look into that story.
Yeah, that's kind of everywhere.

79
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,440
And his ball players, football,
football player, super scary guy.

80
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,120
Just a gangster, super talented guy. Crazy
talent position. Does he play tied in?

81
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,000
Won a national championship and
a super ball with the Patriots.

82
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,560
Take a look at you on,
apparently it's just fall.

83
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:27,070
My football man. Very Meta. It's why
he played football. But I shit Kevin,

84
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:31,900
no football. Okay. Nando's was a big deal.
And everyone compared, the two of us was,

85
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,860
it just, was he just crazy like
what was his deal? He grew up super,

86
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,860
super hoodie and in the gang.
So this is the thing man.

87
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:43,420
So he got all that money and the one
teeny should have been drafted to was the

88
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:47,330
new England patriots cause he was from
Connecticut. So he didn't escape the game.

89
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,640
That's your ass skids.
Yeah.

90
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,860
I used to work in new haven and new, hey,
it's not Mexicans. This Puerto Rican,

91
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,063
Puerto Rican and

92
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,460
black dude. They were saying if he got
drafted by any other team, I'm mean,

93
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm sure he still would've killed itches,
but it was just way worse.

94
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,390
Cause he's had all his homies there
and then you have $40 million.

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,140
You don't get a guy like
that. $40 million. What'd
you think was gonna Happen?

96
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,990
And he had 40 million bucks,
40 million.

97
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,950
How much money they make
playing football yet load,

98
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,830
especially a guy of his caliber.
What do you think about deflate gate?

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,890
I think it's bullshit.
I think it's such bullshit.

100
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,620
I think Tom Brady would
beat them no matter what.

101
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,710
Make all the balls deflate everyone's
balls. Tell me how it goes.

102
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,780
You didn't walk away. It's bullshit is
because everybody had the same Paul. Yeah.

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,720
The other team had that
ball to see they still won.

104
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,570
Even if the ball was like
slightly deflated. No, they
did it. They didn't. Yeah,

105
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,620
it's not true. I'm going to help you out.
Yeah. Well so, so who gave me the help?

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,860
Give me that. So each team has their
own balls, right? The ball boy,

107
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,360
the quarterback before they
came a field the ball. So they,

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,710
there's an Indianapolis colts ball and
then there's a new of the Patriots Ball.

109
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,090
Well then what's the problem?
Well, there's say Tom's
was deflated so it made it,

110
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,320
it's fucking stupid. Exactly.
Deflate. Let me know how it goes.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,270
Any but all the NFL is like, it
doesn't fucking matter. It's so stupid.

112
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,280
But all the NFL things, it doesn't
matter. The players get all the papers.

113
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,730
He got Smith for games. How
many games you, ray rice gets.

114
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,820
It's better for beating the
shit out of his girlfriend to

115
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,110
follow NFL.
What the fuck are we doing?

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,600
You got it.
You fucking dummies.

117
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,790
You got to at least suspend that
guy for as many times together.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,310
Ray Rice in his girl. Yeah. Yeah. They're
married. Left. She didn't press charges.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,430
Yeah. Incredible. Have you
seen that video? I have.

120
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:44,070
He hit her with a left hook like
Mark Hunt. You can't do that, man.

121
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,960
It's like Donald's number. How raise
your product use throw that shovel hook.

122
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,400
He's still like, dude,
remember that? Oh yeah.

123
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,640
It was more like Tommy Morrison's left
Hook. Tommy Morrison's left. Took,

124
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,210
he would leap panel to power. I
just leaped in. May Worsen. No,

125
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,440
raise your Ruddock would catch pitches
moving away. Yeah, that's what he did.

126
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,290
Raise your resume. Brodick Tyson. He gave
me trouble. Okay. Did raise it right?

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,180
That was after prison? No, that was pre
prison. It was Tyson. Are you sure? Oh,

128
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,540
I'm 100% sure. Okay. Yeah,
I'm pretty sure. Yeah. He, um,

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,420
he raised her rug versus Tommy
who was actually a good fight.

130
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,750
Tommy Marson stopped him.
It was kind of a bullshit stoppage.

131
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,020
But he did rock him with a left hook,
cracked him with a left hook and hurt him.

132
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:27,320
Then just threw a bunch of punches
at his arms. That's one fine. It was,

133
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,180
I saw it cause I actually was a Tommy
Morris and Fiat fanny and I felt sorry for

134
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,350
white people.
You know what I mean?

135
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:37,910
Mexicans and blacks just killing everybody
in boxing. So I like a one white guy.

136
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm not white, but I would pull for the
white guy cause I thought, see shit man.

137
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,540
I appreciate it. Yeah. Tommy
Morris. I was like, oh, come on.

138
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,890
Like a white running back.
Yeah,

139
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,910
it was watching him in Tuesday night
fights from that shit. He thought a man,

140
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,010
he was fighting, um, uh, Michael bed.

141
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,670
He was supposed to just
go right through Michael.

142
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,690
Ben and Michael Beck just lit him.

143
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,660
It was one of the most brutal knockouts
in boxing history. He was shredded man.

144
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,570
Tell me more. So it was
Shradda his projects. He's
too nervous. He died, right?

145
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,200
Well and then, yeah, he died. Yeah, he,
he's dead. How many Morrison died? Yeah.

146
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,370
I just found this that age. I know he
had aids, but I didn't know he died.

147
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,160
Most people don't, not the healthy
you let your magic Johnson,

148
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,310
but he didn't have aids. He was
just HIV positive. He never,

149
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,000
he never even came close to having names.

150
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,640
They gave him the best way at the superior
periods. Yeah. Made them good. Um,

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,050
but Marson before he died had peck
implants. It was really crazy.

152
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:37,460
And it was meth out of his fucking
mind. He was on meth. Yeah. Well his,

153
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,130
you got to see what he looked like. Some
people call that live in brother. Yeah.

154
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,090
That's what I say. His body was all
fucking weird man. About methods.

155
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,100
There's people that have done,

156
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,260
met their whole fucking life
and they're still alive.

157
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,500
How do you go 10 years of doing
math and how does your body adapt?

158
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:58,770
How do stuff teeth start? Terry Hill,

159
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,060
the referee is standing in the middle of
the octagon. You gotta set of tits off.

160
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,350
Who is the [inaudible] the referee that
let Mark Hunt almost get his brains

161
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:11,650
beaten in by steep bamio
chick. He was British. Right.

162
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,720
That should be fine. Okay, so these
two gentlemen are going at it.

163
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,750
One of them is a diva in the
red and McCosh Marrakesh,

164
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,130
Villi. So you don't have my money? Is
that what you're saying? I got your money.

165
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:30,330
You got your money, right. Oh, this,
let's just talk about that check.

166
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,750
Well, how would you like
it? I'm kind of like a bank.

167
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,200
They made a bet during the last
UFC fight companion that uhm,

168
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,430
Brennan shops. Boy Pat Cummins was going
to beat Osp, otherwise known as, oh,

169
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:49,230
Vince St Pru over at Saint Prue shut dim
lights out. Yeah, he did a first round.

170
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,650
He's got cash for you.
He's got $1,000 cash.

171
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,250
They made 1,900 Rfu one by twister.

172
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,420
There's like $10,000 Oh no,
we didn't shake on that.

173
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,600
We did.
We were all the files,

174
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,200
all the nothing. Do you want to
go double or nothing? I got Edgar.

175
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:17,060
You got favor? No, I got,
I got Frankie. Doug. Hmm.

176
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,830
I won't Frankie. Wow, this is interesting.
Now you guys don't want to take favor.

177
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,130
I think favorite one 35 is the
man or one 45 is a motherfucker.

178
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,900
Motherfucker take him.
Well, no. Hey listen.

179
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,830
Faber's a bad motherfucker. No doubt
about it. But Frankie Edgar, man,

180
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,830
it's hard to bet against him at 45.
That's a hard pick.

181
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,760
Another solid pick another fight.
I really don't know.

182
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,150
What about Musashi Musashi?
You want full of poop now I got my sauce.

183
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,540
What about Munoz? I got Munoz. Who Do you
got? How about limb and magnate magnate?

184
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,070
I don't know. That's an interesting, your
boy bag is my boy. Who's he fighting?

185
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,350
That's a tough fight. He's fighting. H how
did he say his name? [inaudible]. Garlin.

186
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,010
Um, hold on a second. Let me pull
it up. You know what? You know what?

187
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:10,960
I'll take favor Williams. Bad mother
double or nothing. Whoa. Take favor.

188
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,830
You don't want,
I think favor is going to,

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm envisioning it and had the weeds
hit me. He's going to win this fight.

190
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,990
I got a favor. I just saw
it. Good. I just saw it.

191
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,760
I don't know
double or nothing.

192
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,120
Don't fuck around. So, so, so you get 1800

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,790
1800 yeah,
this is $900 1800 all right,

194
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,870
cool. Come on. Favorite? God dammit

195
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,300
like Kramer will.

196
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,220
His body is going to look incredible.
I could see a winning.

197
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,790
I'm really nervous now.
That's a close fight. I

198
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,290
really regret that dad. No, he
doesn't regret it. He's happy.

199
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,390
He just fucking with me.
I'm super nervous.

200
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,410
Favorite 45 is a total wildcard.
We haven't seen him in 45 and a long time.

201
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,370
At 35 I would have taken
favor right away real quick.

202
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,930
And he's never lost a
non title fight favors.

203
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,800
Never last one on title
one thing at one 45 yeah.

204
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,640
And you know Frankie fought at 55
Frankie small though man, but he's still,

205
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,350
he could handle dudes to 55 right,

206
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,680
but don't you think that favor
will like for his age, like he's,

207
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,120
I think he just turned 37 37 36
yeah, he's, he just had a birthday.

208
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,010
He's like,

209
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,730
as you get older it's probably harder
and harder to fight really well after he

210
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:43,190
cut weight. Yeah, right. You're
getting a lot of weight. I'm gonna be,

211
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,930
maybe we'll see a better. I think he, he
kept, he kept getting better, you know,

212
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:47,081
I mean,

213
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,790
you can't go back to the time he fought
for the title at 45 against Aldo because

214
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:55,600
I really feel like back then that's
a different favor than you see now.

215
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,540
I think cravers better. I
think he's better now. Yeah.

216
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,630
And remember nobody had the ground
and pound favor head back in the day.

217
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,470
He doesn't do it as a back
in the days. Yeah. He doesn't
do it anymore, but he can.

218
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:12,430
I just think his game expanded so much.
Right in the beginning, Faber's game was,

219
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm going to take you down.
I'm not even gonna try to pass your guard.

220
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,730
I'm going to stay in your guard and I'm
going to clench down on you and stack

221
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,430
you and smash you and then do like a
back extension thing. Explosion Hub.

222
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Bring the bottom dude up and then he
comes down and hits you with an elbow as

223
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:34,180
you hit the ground. He just come up
with his elbows. Nobody does that.

224
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:39,140
She can't sleep on that. Getting
either. Dammit guys figure has,

225
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,020
how's he going to be cranky
though? Skills. He's not
going to wrestle. Frankly.

226
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,970
You have to choke him.

227
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,530
Why do you think more people didn't do
ground and pound like him? Even today?

228
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,380
They don't do it like that.
Is it the guys who like you could do that.

229
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,440
He picks the ground. Remember
that Shit, whatever that Cro,

230
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:57,440
cop Daga side of the guard.

231
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,960
But to this day sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night and go, oh,

232
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,480
those are the best. Yeah, definitely.

233
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:06,170
If those weren't the best elbows in
the guard and MMA, their top three,

234
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,130
top three best elbows in the
Gar Jones and Jones is the best.

235
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,540
Brandon Vera. Yeah, but in Broomfield,

236
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,140
I mean that was really good fight.

237
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,240
But think how long John is to truth
those elbows. That's the difference.

238
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,340
It's true.
But the crow,

239
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,480
there's something really special about
cro cop doing it because first of all it

240
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,510
came out of him being on top.
So,

241
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,480
and then he'll hit him with elbows and
all he was complaining about before the

242
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,080
fight was grappling and elbows are
ruining MMA. And that's his spot.

243
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,010
Grappling and elbows one him that fight.
It was so crazy.

244
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,490
He really fucking with a lot of
fights there. Punching Shit for Roche,

245
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,850
bringing wrestler, start working his
takedowns. That's where it needs to be.

246
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:51,480
He needs to take, I just put
in the guard. You know what?

247
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,640
Standing. He's gun shy. Now let's not
get out of control here. Hey listen,

248
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:59,810
he's gun shy standing. He is
and he's worried about his
Chan. He's getting older.

249
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,430
Let's not sugarcoat it.
Yes, so I believe this.

250
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,200
I believe he should be in the garden.

251
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:10,250
Fucking people up based on
that performance. That might
be as new spot standing.

252
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,890
It seems spot. He's not.
He's telling bitches down.

253
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,260
Well they do that. He's a
strong, he's the strongest dude.

254
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,640
You ever feel strong as fuck, but he
wasn't taking me down. Come on man.

255
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:26,120
It's crazy. Well, maybe you
could learn how to take people
down. Oh yeah, for sure.

256
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,360
Every time I'm fucking 40 he's
going to switch into a grappler.

257
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,510
Isn't it weird that Weidman is
not the main event next week?

258
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,570
It seems weird to me.
Sue Weidemann Belfort.

259
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,580
That feels like the main event for me.

260
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,170
Not there's anything wrong with
Carmie a Johnson, but it's like,

261
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:46,370
you know we, we both, we all know,
we know that Jon Jones is the champ.

262
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,330
They took John Joe's title away for
non fighting activity type shit.

263
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,970
What did think about that and we talked
about John John's. No, we have it.

264
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,460
Have you talked about it? I've talked
about it. What's y'all got strip him.

265
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,140
Kind of strip him. Yeah, you
have to have two. But however,

266
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,040
even if he's not training and he's sitting
in jail, where the fuck you he's at,

267
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
he's still the best fighter on the planet.
There's no,

268
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,880
there's no legit light heavyweight
champion. Whoever wins that.

269
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,680
It's not the real champion.
Right.

270
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,660
The only one who had a chance of proven
that is rumble because of rumble beats

271
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,640
core me a, we still don't know if he
would have been able to beat jai agree.

272
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,170
[inaudible] beats rumble then
warn them like weird Tim. What?

273
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,630
We got this guy who's clearly, he's
a champ, but he's not the champ.

274
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,480
Then Johnson come fresh out of prison.

275
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,300
Just a gut ready to destroy somebody.
Yeah.

276
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,930
He's going to be a heavyweight and
come out of prison. Yeah, he might did.

277
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,610
He's going to roar. No one's going
to fuck with John's not looking.

278
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,540
Good man. Guys are probably going to test
them. Usually people just for their bat.

279
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,490
The only way it'll work out,

280
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:50,430
the only way it'll work out apparently
is if he some sort of a settlement with

281
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:53,850
the woman I, they get together and he
says, look, here's 1 million bucks.

282
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,310
What's let the shit go away?
Signs of paperwork,

283
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:59,730
which is very possible
and the smart thing to do,

284
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,820
if you don't want to go to
jail, that's priceless. Right?

285
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,100
Like you should give her 2 million.

286
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,140
That was kind only be
the civil charges though.

287
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:11,820
The criminal charges come
from the police, right. Felony
home. Yes. Yes, yes. But, um,

288
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,270
I think it's lessened in
some sort of a strange way.

289
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,870
If the woman won't press charges. It's
two felonies though, right? That is true.

290
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,890
Right. He ran from the scene of the
crime, like, yeah, he's probably,

291
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,530
he probably can't escape your left his
car and just started running. No, no, no.

292
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,400
Came back. This is where he's fucked
because if you leave the scene,

293
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:34,050
you can say whatever head trauma is
fucked up. I was out of it, so I ran.

294
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,440
But if you're smart enough to come back
and get your cash and then run off,

295
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,140
now you're fucked. That's not gonna work
because you were smart enough to go, oh,

296
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,890
hold up, my cash is there. Let me
go back and grab it. Who knows what?

297
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,930
And then he got as well, you know,
he say he got his cash like you just,

298
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,160
you've seen a fucking dude in a Hoodie,
grabbed some shit with his hand.

299
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,100
It looks like cash.

300
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,120
That could have been a bunch of other
things involved in that hand, you know?

301
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,870
I mean, who knows what the
fuck he grabbed. It's just
sad. It's Super Sad, man.

302
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,010
He ran most sad for the woman obviously
is, I think it was probably high.

303
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,000
I think he was high and he,
you got to remember he got in trouble.

304
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,620
He got in trouble before.

305
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,760
And from what I've heard
is if you leave the scene,

306
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,120
you're less likely to get in
trouble. Does that make sense? Yes.

307
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,140
I heard a cop say if you get in an
accident and you are high and you run,

308
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:25,630
that's the best case scenario.
What kind of a cop you talking to him?

309
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,630
That is true. That is shady,
shady time. Just fucking sleep.

310
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,690
Especially if you're talking about,
especially if you're high,

311
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,560
if you're high or on substance and you
run the charges or less depending on what

312
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,610
city or cause a Dui, that's gonna fuck
you up. Way Worse than fleeing the scene.

313
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,900
Now, this isn't like that
advice. If anybody's listening
here, this is terrible.

314
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,370
This is Maddie's. Maybe. Maybe that's
John Jones. Both for your own errors.

315
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,870
Don't run away.
Well,

316
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,040
I think John had already had that one
DUI and if he was in fact fucked up,

317
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,490
he was probably in full panic mode.
I mean he just got the Reebok deal.

318
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,760
He was making really good money. He's
doing all these commercials for Reebok.

319
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:06,000
Louise Hay at Instagram
pictures constantly all the
time and he knew that was

320
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,180
going away. Everything was going away.
Most likely the title's going away.

321
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,090
Public perception can be terrible.
The whole thing was a disaster.

322
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:16,530
I think he just, he just needs
to embrace this. It's awful.

323
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,040
I can't fuck you guys chose me to peruse.

324
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,190
Yeah. That's what he needs
to do. That's what's up.

325
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,440
He needs to convince the judge
to some jail. Osca I wasco.

326
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,900
We'll show him all a 30 times already.
Where are we going to say?

327
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,930
Do I need to do what? I think he embraces
the and role. No, he can't. Yeah,

328
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:37,920
like the WWE PCC,
he's got to realize that he's like,

329
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,670
he's operating on momentum and meaning
that like I think with John John's is

330
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:44,940
doing right now, I think life is
like almost out of control forum.

331
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,690
I think the overwhelming,
like all the pressure now,

332
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,350
the craziness involved in being
the youngest ever UFC champion,

333
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:54,640
the light heavyweight champion,

334
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,660
the craziest fucking fights and knowing
that some of his fights sets really

335
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,900
shitty camps,
that's what makes them great Harney in.

336
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,840
So you want to cage that line and be like
loose doesn't necessarily mean that it

337
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:08,650
doesn't make him great. Great.
No, he is great and there's that.

338
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,830
It doesn't make him great. What makes
them great as his training. It's just,

339
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:15,190
he's so good that he can get by
with all the trainings already done.

340
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,610
Being half out of shape and beat a
guy like Alexander Gustafson. True.

341
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,430
But I think if you take a guy like
that and you say, all right man,

342
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,810
you gotta quit being you and you got
to live in this house, nine to five,

343
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:28,210
go to training, come back. You
can't party. Can't do any of that.

344
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,600
He's not going to be as good or as
creative that some guy you say that the

345
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:32,381
restraints on.
Yeah,

346
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:35,230
but you only say that like we don't
know because we never seen him do it.

347
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,290
It was supposed to be doing it for this
fight. Obviously he wasn't killing,

348
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,080
you know, there's a lot.
It was a balance man. Yeah.

349
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,090
There's a lot of famous stars that
are known coke heads for sure.

350
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
People just, and they kept it from
people. Well, how about Tyson?

351
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,600
Tyson in his prime would be coked
up and fights Lawrence Taylor.

352
00:21:55,601 --> 00:22:00,601
That's not clear because when he doesn't
really say that he was high during the

353
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,480
fight. I heard, I heard. I thought
he did. He said he was high.

354
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,290
He was doing coke during that time,

355
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,380
but he's not specifically saying
that he was doing it in the fight.

356
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,110
Lawrence Taylor came out,
admitted he played high all the time.

357
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:15,340
What my cane and he's one of the
best players ever, ever. Or its tail.

358
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,370
Is it a rumor that fact that Joe
Montana was had problems with coke?

359
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,080
I'm not sure. How dare you bring
Joe? All types on tannins missing.

360
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,060
Hi Tyson and Mr being high on drugs
during major fights and using a fake penis

361
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,010
to avoid detection.
Well,

362
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,520
pretty clear that marijuana,

363
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,670
cocaine is beaten bitches up.

364
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,970
Joe's made out fuck Jones.

365
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,710
John Jones Jones may not
have had a problem with coke.

366
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:49,210
He might've just been partying one night.

367
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:53,540
Like if you're doing it that close to
a fight, you got a problem, you think,

368
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:56,800
you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.
I think what I think for him,

369
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:00,940
he's just got to reconcile who he truly
is. Like I think he tried to play this,

370
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,751
I'm nice guy.

371
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,620
And then that Kinda got busted with DC
and then he was kind of left with this

372
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:09,970
perception gap of what he was trying to
portray and what he actually knew that

373
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,170
he was inside.

374
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,980
And I think he's just got to reconcile
that and just be truly what he is.

375
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:18,160
If he's a fine,
just be a fucking savage what I'm saying,

376
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,590
just be be truly who you are.
And then

377
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,990
chocolate though was a
different kind of dude.

378
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:30,640
You know chocolate though was wild party
dude, but he wasn't like what Jon Jones,

379
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,400
his situation is first of all,
driving drunk.

380
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,240
There's a big different like chocolate
party I guaranteed probably get limos or

381
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,110
something like that.

382
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Like he never got busted drunk driving
and the driving parts of big one,

383
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,310
chocolate.
Dell embraced his celebrity

384
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,360
more than any fighter I knew.
He just, he had, he loved it.

385
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,950
He had a great time.
He was man,

386
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,440
he was on his after parties.
I mean he's just on fire.

387
00:23:57,441 --> 00:24:01,130
He's just like his after [inaudible] just
talking about how he fuck these dudes

388
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,400
up and everyone's like, fuck, this
is jug and everyone's taking shots.

389
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:09,210
He's taking shots. It's like he could just
like at the club called raw, like it's,

390
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,910
the game's changed don.

391
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:14,810
He was so fucking God damn nice.

392
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,730
And I'm not just saying that cause I have
a, he's a friend of mine. He's a bit,

393
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:23,060
yeah, he's so cool. He's one of the
coolest guys ever. He's a great guy.

394
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,100
We haven't talked about this
fight once the game's changed.

395
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,211
That's all I'm saying.

396
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:30,680
Two minutes ago I say John Jones
should just be the Choco Dolo the two

397
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:31,514
thousands.

398
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,660
I just don't you think you can make the
comparison chocolate [inaudible] never

399
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:38,330
thought it was a bad guy
and he liked to party.

400
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,770
But like people think of John as a bad
guy. Chuck was at fake either like chuck.

401
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:47,220
Chuck didn't put on this
reconciliation confused.

402
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,640
He was just a caveman with a Mohawk.

403
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,180
It's just a weird thing to see a
guy is young and talented as John.

404
00:24:56,181 --> 00:25:00,560
Repeat the same mistakes that you've seen
all these other young talented guys do.

405
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,060
It's heartbreaking, man. It is. Jay.
This is probably a really good fight.

406
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,830
I'm not mad at the trunks
old school. You know, we,

407
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,520
we literally, I have no idea who won
this fight. We barely paying attention.

408
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,260
I could not tell you this is like
watching the fights in the stands though.

409
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,850
If you watch the fights in the stands,

410
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,910
like sometimes like before
I would work for the UFC,

411
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,400
we were watch fights in the
stands and someone would go, what?

412
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:30,080
He won really when we're sure
that this isn't whole shit.

413
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,490
Every time I looked up he was kicking ass.
Dude.

414
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,720
How about those first few IFCs Zufolo
took over and we were all dreaming of that

415
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,201
day.

416
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:44,201
Well the UFC would be an ed
to MGM or Mandalay like fog.

417
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,770
One of these days did one of these
days and it fucking happened.

418
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,150
We were right there. Ringside. We had
the best seats in the fucking ass.

419
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,820
What was it? Merlin's with Montay versus
chocolate. Dell error. Yeah. Miller.

420
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,510
Bustamante no, no, no.
It's been a real boost.

421
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,670
Bustamante versus goddammit.
The fuck is his name?

422
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,110
Dave Manet.
No,

423
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,890
my computer's going off shit. How the fuck
did he fight? Oh, Matt Lindland wasn't,

424
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:14,390
that was Matt was it,
was it?

425
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,630
I know he was there for saccharine
and Matt Hughes were there for soccer.

426
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:21,620
I'm mad. He was, remember that fight and
they'd cut, they'd come over. Uh, uh,

427
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,650
Ryan Bennett would come over.
He was the roving reporter guy and Joe.

428
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,400
So what do you think of the UFC reverted
and the gel would just be like watching,

429
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:32,240
he just rattle off like the coolest line
to go. UFC is kind of like baseball,

430
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:33,320
blah blah blah blah blah blah,
blah.

431
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,400
This cool ass quote that he would just
have ready to go and then they would use

432
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:42,401
that and the promos for the next
UFC and then they just asked like,

433
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,520
shit,
when you commentate.

434
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,950
Then once he started commenting,
I'm like sitting there by myself,

435
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,260
Mike,
fuck

436
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,790
this is,
yeah,

437
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:58,120
they talked me in to work and cause it
to get those kinds of seeds to is the

438
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:58,954
maximum.

439
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,620
We're not going to give you four of those
motherfuckers are going to get killed

440
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,930
or you're going to get one and you're
going to be happy with it. Right.

441
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,580
This guys can pound it on it. Can I get
one from my girlfriend? Yeah, I know, man.

442
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,710
That's fucking great. That
was back in the day, dude.

443
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:16,810
We were there before I
even worked for the EOC,

444
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,900
so that was like 2001 and maybe two.

445
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:24,220
And there's a video that's on youtube
still wear. Uh, Brian Cowen when at once.

446
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,570
And we were having,

447
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,950
we were pregaming in the hotel room at
the MGM and it was one of those first

448
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:33,310
five UFC. He's in Vegas.
We were like in Vegas,

449
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,570
in a hotel room with Callan blips.
Callen was there this video,

450
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,720
this video somewhere. Where is that video?
What is it called? Brazilian. Brazilian.

451
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,160
This slime Cowen doing his character,

452
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,210
you know that character he does, they're
the, the male raping them. The other men,

453
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,980
you know, sometimes it doesn't
as a Brazilian, rarely.
Sometimes it's Brazilian.

454
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,360
Yeah, he does it. And it was one of
the funniest things of all time, a man.

455
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:02,620
And what we were crying,
laughing me a crying.

456
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,300
We got kicked out of the hotel because
there's like, there was so porn star,

457
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:10,110
Bj Bjj, gay porn star,
a manager at Google that

458
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,260
pop up. There it is. There it is.

459
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:21,250
This is one of the funniest goddamn
things. Brian Count if ever done.

460
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,850
You know what's fucked up about it? The
way they filmed it, it was an Easter egg.

461
00:28:24,851 --> 00:28:26,890
It was back when people put
Easter eggs in their DVD.

462
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,540
So the video you get is this tiny little
fucking video. Yeah. Like that. Yeah.

463
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,620
Like look at, look at the kick this back
and he was the kid. Oh, where's the case?

464
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,120
His back when he was the kid. He doesn't
age. Can you start it over real quick?

465
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,120
This is a, this is actually
his turn. Hold on. Hold on.

466
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,020
This is is a Henzel Gracie impression.
By the way, bring it to the beginning.

467
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,660
Young Jamie part. Hanzo part. Hinata the,
it's a combination of, yeah. You know,

468
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,280
you guys just take a guy sometimes

469
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,860
do my man.
I may

470
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,960
talk to him like dad deep.
[inaudible] my hand now.

471
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,933
Oh look,

472
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,350
nothing.
Just

473
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,090
licking his fingers. Hold him
down with that. I knew. Was that

474
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,983
okay?

475
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,700
Can you explain me?
That's my persona.

476
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,070
The SEC size guys don't understand for
me. Mike Coke, what I'm going to do now.

477
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,170
Did that go on

478
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,690
to

479
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,320
porn or something like that?
Nothing

480
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,270
gets my boils. Nah Man. Get my book

481
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,140
and this is probably 2014 years ago.

482
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,760
You guys are, how can we will call? We
got kicked out of that hotel room, dude.

483
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,860
We left that hotel room in the security
guard was coming down the hallway.

484
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,380
He goes, well you guys are making all
that noise. And we were like, Nah,

485
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:40,380
we don't know what you're talking about
man. I know what you're talking about.

486
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,260
It sounds like Hensdale right?
Oh my God, he's so funny man.

487
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,860
And that was 2001 or two somewhere else,
but I don't,

488
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,800
I wasn't even working for the
UFC back then. You're just chill.

489
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,260
You guys are just chilling. And
we were just having fun. Vegas.

490
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,670
We just went to see some fights. Yeah. And
then he, then he always have rattle off.

491
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,920
That's cool ass quote. And
then Dana, just stop man.

492
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:01,770
What you want to commentate a whole show.
And then Joe goes,

493
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:06,060
do they want me to commentate? Commentary
is fun, but this might be the shit

494
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,480
fight companions that he's not
responsible for to be tension.

495
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,700
I don't fight fight. I'm sure you won,
sir. You look like you're well powerful.

496
00:31:17,701 --> 00:31:20,370
Misha Tate in the house.
Hey Yo, what's up girl?

497
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,490
So pretty quiet. Whole,
whole degree. Be Shy. Yeah.

498
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,400
All of those. All, all of us. Just
how heavy breathing is the mic?

499
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,750
Yes. Smile at the camera. Pretty
much. He saw, swore off all of us.

500
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,850
We're lucky we're in
the scanning her face.

501
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,570
Tigall take a little bit. Did she?
She did some with those, right?

502
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,040
Something happened there. Something Great.
No one cares about that shit. People.

503
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,550
Good tip. Get a tip jar.
What I'm saying is though,

504
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:57,540
it's weird to do that
while you're fighting white
bumps. You out what? Strong.

505
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,920
Stand by me. Wrong stance. Aubrey.
I don't love for you to be friends.

506
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,360
That's a fucking IOWASCA.

507
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,640
Did you do like a bunch of weird drawing?
What do you do with them? I mean,

508
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:12,680
I dunno. Whatever you do you do with
them. Well, I'm not like nothing.

509
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,570
I'm not a big like a boob guy.
Oh, I am asked legs. Why pick?

510
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,390
You could have
it all.

511
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,210
It's all about the acid
lake is a very important,

512
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:27,630
why pick if you're getting hot enough
girls, there's no reason to panic.

513
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,830
They have pretty faces. Nice
titties. Perfect as small ways.

514
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,860
I mean the tin is just like the
rest of the body. It's like a arm.

515
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,410
We can't talk about that on the show.
What do you mean?

516
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:38,790
It's like the rest of the body.
There's,

517
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,310
it's not really a sex organ in that
maybe we can't talk to you anymore. Yeah,

518
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,590
you'd be surprised. Nonsense.
Crazy. What about when,

519
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,560
when you girls on top of, and she's
forced feeding those while riding it.

520
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,970
He told me those are awesome.
They're wonderful. Hi,

521
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm Marie.
I'm a big fan.

522
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,860
Fuck is going on over there early.

523
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:13,710
So I'm gonna give you a Holbeck
earliest fun so you get a whole dance.

524
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,873
I think

525
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,430
mammaries look better in clothes.

526
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,470
Like when they're kind of
hanging out there like nice.

527
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,080
They're fake and they're barely hanging
out. You know what I mean? That's like,

528
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,110
you know, you can't, you can't
deny that. You're just like, damn,

529
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,510
what the duties are. Just anxious to see
the nipple and you could just, you know,

530
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,230
they're real different now. The new
fake ones, they feel like real tip man.

531
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,910
It's not like a bag of water like the
olden days now it's like a silicon,

532
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,300
like gummy bears. Yeah, it's the,

533
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,340
it's very similar to the texture
of an actual breast cancer from,

534
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,460
it's just a little more firm.
It's a totally different animal now.

535
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,900
I prefer it to do you remember those
two porns where the girls be like,

536
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,700
guy would be banging the girl and they
would have these weird strike the ripples

537
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,630
underneath their tits. He
goes, I'm watching madness.

538
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,370
I'm living at madness. Something
about it. It was crazy.

539
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:17,070
I worked in a strip club industry for
10 years. I saw plenty of that. Yeah.

540
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,340
But I mean, you know it in
porn, but it was real bright.

541
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,510
So the thing about porn is that like,
you know, they're fucking close up an HD.

542
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,980
When HD came along to porn,

543
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:29,180
the whole fucking game got weird because
then you could see those nipple scars

544
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,270
where they just take a fucking apple core
to the netball and just stuff, a bag.

545
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,540
Just ditch that fucker back up.

546
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,850
Like it was a totally different
thing that you could see everything.

547
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,890
Do they still cut the nipples?

548
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,530
They can go through the warpit or nipples
they go through the armpit or below

549
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:48,650
the breast to is very popular now.
You'd never,

550
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,930
I don't think going through
the nipples a good idea.

551
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,040
It doesn't seem like a good idea.

552
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,470
It seems like your nipples are going to
look all frankensteinish powerful Uriah

553
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,940
Faber, ready to rock and Commodity
Ryan looking thing thick at life.

554
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,640
I'd be like my boy, he like Dick
Surgery going through the balls.

555
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,820
You don't want to risk very similar
Felipe.

556
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,190
No. In the house. You Chill
Nam. He's a handsome guy.

557
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,580
Maybe it will be there. He was like,
when he was on the ultimate fighter, uh,

558
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,040
Dana White thought that that dude was
going to be like the next Anderson.

559
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,120
He called him the next Anderson Silva.
Well,

560
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:29,060
he was knocking people fucking dead when
he was on the ultimate fighter. Yeah.

561
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,760
You don't call him Anderson
Silva. I know. Well there's also,

562
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:36,440
the problem was you have to really be
considering what it's hot in here. Huh?

563
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,040
Ac could put a little

564
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,340
ac on young Jamie. I'm not mad
at that. Terry is right there.

565
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,040
There he is right there.
That's him on the ultimate fighter.

566
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,280
He was fucking people up in the ultimate
fighter. It's an ultimate fighter. Yeah.

567
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:51,600
That's the thing. Like you got to think
of the level of quality of opposition.

568
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:56,130
These racing me, he looked like a killer
against good guys. Yeah, but that,

569
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,750
that's not real.
That's not the right.

570
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,330
That's why when they made it out of
the UFC to talk to guys and I'm like,

571
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,740
this is just a tryout to get on the
roster. You're not fighting killing shit.

572
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,360
Everyone's like you man.

573
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,070
And then you get in the UFC and you're
fighting legit professional UFC fighters.

574
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,180
Big different animal man.

575
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,930
I went from demicco Rogers who had three
fights that Gabriel Gonzaga within like

576
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,950
whatever, a year, year and
a half. Yeah. A difference.

577
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,430
Isn't that a weird thing that they did?

578
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,200
That is a crazy like fast track to
like elite competition almost too much.

579
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:30,120
So, right. For some guys. Yeah, for sure.
Like there's a few that could like swim.

580
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,510
They could make that swim. I think
if you had that Calvin. Yeah.

581
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,610
If you have a serious
like wrestling background,

582
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:39,570
it really helps you look at a guy
like Cain, Josh Koscheck. Yeah,

583
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,030
Calvin gas, Tulum, coven.

584
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,670
Gasoline is in the mix right now
at one seven he's one of the, well,

585
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:48,390
if he makes one 70 fights, Nate Marquardt
names who's I bet. Very interesting.

586
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,500
Very interesting fight.

587
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,850
Very interesting fight and
really interesting only
because you got to factor in

588
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:56,630
how much mileage Nate has on him.
I wish Nate,

589
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,660
Nate's a very close friend and I'm going
to bring him in here to have the Joe

590
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,493
Rogan talk.

591
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,950
I can't have it with him because then
he'll have the Jesus talk with me and

592
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:09,330
we'll be at a standstill. I know it's
going to be good podcast, you know?

593
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:14,280
I don't know him like I know you.
I love you. I know brother. I know.

594
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,170
I'm just saying with, with Nate, I,
I wish someone could get through.

595
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,600
I want them to,
when I started,

596
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,290
Nate was the baddest motherfucker ever.

597
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,890
He fucked up everybody and anybody,
you name them,

598
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,730
they would bring like GSP would
fly Nate to Montreal, Rashad Evans,

599
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:35,760
all these guys.
Nate was the baddest motherfucker I knew.

600
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,770
So now when I watch him fight him like,
oh my God,

601
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,560
he's a shell and I'm going to take some
heat for saying that from my friends.

602
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:44,700
But he is. It's true, man.
It's horrible to watch. You
could only run so many miles.

603
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:48,660
She can only get hit so many times. Your
body can only take so many body slams,

604
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:53,160
chokes, armbars head kicks. All those
things add up and you get to a point,

605
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,110
unless you've read retort Belfort.
How the fuck is this?

606
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,980
We're just looking at him right now.
I think there are different supplements.

607
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,260
Well, I don't know you do. You realize
he's tested Clinton, Bro, dare you.

608
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,131
Oh,
you gotta realize too,

609
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:10,131
Nate's been fighting hold hold since
he was 17 why beat door since he was 19

610
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,770
yeah.
He just two to a point.

611
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,690
Both at the same nutritional type. No,
I don't think so. No. I don't know.

612
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,050
Even though Nate has been busted
but different. Nate got busted.

613
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,660
His levels were so high when they
pulled him off of that fight.

614
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,700
They six story fight.
Yeah. It's like this guy.

615
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,500
Good like dye in there like we can't,

616
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:31,470
you can't let it go fight
with those levels coming.

617
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,100
This is coming right from the head of

618
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,180
the Athletic Commission to
my fucking heroes. I was on
the same card. He was like,

619
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:44,920
we can't fight like that. You can't
like, they have levels that you're,

620
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,780
you're supposed to be when
they like that was by the way,

621
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:50,460
when he was having legal TRT, his
levels were, it wasn't a matter,

622
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,920
but it was fucking wild.

623
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Cat levels still got the same Shit Tore,

624
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,560
Huh? Vitorin Brazil. They're like,
good lord man. He tested when they,

625
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,300
when he came to Vegas,
they tested him.

626
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,000
And this is one of the reasons why they
pulled the whole Party thing in the

627
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,790
first place.
They made it publicly aware.

628
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:13,420
So I'm not saying anything that people
don't know. 1,475 was his level.

629
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,620
The healthy man is like 500 like
a healthy young man in his prime.

630
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,790
800 to 1500 some stud,
some fucking Herschel Walker Stud.

631
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,013
Now this guy,

632
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:28,000
1,475 that's like you're in some alien
territory and kicking bitches in the face.

633
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,500
He knocked out. Yeah, there's still
subway did a Luke Rockhold huh?

634
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
We'll Keck. Fuck are we doing
velop kicks when there's a,

635
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,220
there's a lot of guys out there
that just stuck with boxing.

636
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,890
They never 10 remove his brother.
That's Henry Hoover. It's true.

637
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,940
That's a big part of that.
Henri Hooft is a bad motherfucker.

638
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,250
Point is such a good guy.
There's,

639
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,990
there's all these guys out there
that are just, boxing is doing.

640
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,520
You can do it to anybody.
Could do. You're totally right.

641
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:58,030
And you know the other thing happened.
He broke his hands so many times.

642
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,300
He kind of had to develop kicks.
Vito broke his hands.

643
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:06,110
He told me he had seven operations on
his hands. She says, yeah, set. And when?

644
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:09,970
When I met him in Brazil one of times I
met him in Brazil like maybe like three

645
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:10,804
years ago or so.

646
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,820
He had a pen in his hand while we were
eating Goldberg and I restaurant and

647
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,460
eating and they have,
you know,

648
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,800
they have these pins and then they
pull them out when they're done.

649
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,790
Like my daughter had to get one
when she broke her arm, the skin.

650
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,540
So he's hanging out with us and he'd
show I got to get these pulled out right

651
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,850
here, you know, he was like
totally cool about it. I'm like,

652
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,560
how many times you break your head.
Did they ever put,

653
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,060
seem to never leave the metal in?

654
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:36,170
I know they do that with
skiers and they do it some,

655
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:38,410
some really significant compound injuries,

656
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:41,820
like a normal thing and he's
just got shit on my friend.

657
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,730
Vodi has a whole like metal hand,
my whole stubs battle.

658
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,890
If you see this big scar,
my whole sub,

659
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:49,930
here's metal and I had those
same pins sticking out.

660
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,880
Your whole thumb is metaware right
here. So that's all metal? Yup.

661
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,800
Where that biggest scars? That's it get
cold as fuck. When it's that does an aix,

662
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,780
does it vibrate? I don't, I
don't think. What do you try and

663
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,120
fake titties?

664
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,250
So Felipe Novera he hasn't fought in the
UFC in a long time, right? My correct.

665
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,760
Yeah, you're correct. This is first
flight back. Is it? Pretty sure,

666
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,120
but he fought and some other
organizations I know in the UFC cut him.

667
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,020
He did still have some fights. I didn't
hear much about them though. Yeah,

668
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:23,020
he's been traded at I those and just
kind of doing work. Well wait a minute,

669
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:27,080
when fresh hair of some thing
where he would faint, didn't have,

670
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,090
he had like a medical conditions.
Dizzy goats? No, no, no.

671
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:32,770
Something was wrong with them. Like
they couldn't figure out what was wrong.

672
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,060
Is that

673
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,920
him? I'm pretty sure. I'm
pretty sure there was something,

674
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,590
something where they were saying he
might not ever be able to fight again,

675
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,660
but I guess they cured it up.
Whatever it was.

676
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,110
The Filipino Anderson Silva moving around.
Ooh.

677
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,780
[inaudible] still got good hands.

678
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,260
Phillipe Novera was when he was good.
He was very good.

679
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,300
He was a nurse from that. Yeah.
In like Brooklyn or some shit.

680
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,600
Gaylord cozy for the take
down. Hands up grace, Jujitsu

681
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,600
and lamb tries to hit that switch.
Let's see what kind of ground game.

682
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,410
No bear house. He's a Hanzo Guy,
right? Yeah. Cause he a black belt.

683
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,210
I would say yes because what was he,

684
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:16,100
he was like a purple result on the
ultimate fighter. That was a while ago.

685
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,750
He's still tapped his training.

686
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,170
Yeah.

687
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:25,060
This is interesting. It's interesting
to see a guy fight. He's Filipino.

688
00:42:25,061 --> 00:42:25,301
Right?

689
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:28,300
Which is probably one of the reasons
why they brought him in here fighting in

690
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:31,360
the Philippines. Right. Huge
reset, right? Yeah. Oh yeah.

691
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:34,930
I mean you would want to like the
one the UFC goes back to Dublin.

692
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,170
I imagine they're going to get every
fucking Irish fighter they could possibly

693
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:41,380
imagine. And put them on
the card. Makes Sense. Yeah.

694
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,020
Cause they do the same thing.
Mexico into Mexico, right? Yeah.

695
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,490
That's going to be fun,
man.

696
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,160
Mexico cane versus a Purdue for doing it.

697
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,570
That you really do. Eddie Bravo.
There's your bet are there.

698
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:01,060
If you want any interaction, you
want some more. Eddie man. Oh,

699
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:04,060
Aubrey just said he's in. Then
you're, I got your hockey bag.

700
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,250
I got Verbeek silver doom over cane.
Whoa.

701
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,700
Keynes had her fresh young 10 years off.
He's had a lot of time.

702
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,370
A lot of times he's injured every other
week. Yeah. But if it was anybody else,

703
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:19,900
I would, I would agree with you.
But Cain is superhuman. I agree.

704
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:23,170
But for or skin pad or, yes,
it's definitely getting better,

705
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,820
but I go ahead and take him down
cane. Yeah, that's true. That right.

706
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,770
And enjoy trying to ground and
pound them. I agree. You know,

707
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:33,520
according to Ryan Parsons, he said
when he was training with the King Mo,

708
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,570
he said they would take volume
down and nothing they did worked.

709
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,140
He's like none of the ground and
pound worked on them and she goes,

710
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:41,860
it's the most ridiculous thing
you've ever seen your life.

711
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,030
It's like the fade or fight.

712
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,150
Once he starts getting his feet on your
hips and manipulating you around like

713
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,380
you, you, you've never seen a guard like
that. And he's huge. Yeah. Huge, huge,

714
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,490
real heavy. You don't realize how tall
fucking redeem his man. He's a big boy.

715
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,360
Remember when he kept up and then kicked
fucking Travis Browne the body? Yeah.

716
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:03,640
Bed chipped up from his back and then
Roy Travis,

717
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,350
I think,
uh,

718
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:10,000
I think Cain Velasquez we'll
take down for dome at will. Yeah,

719
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,830
he will. But then what happens
when we get down there?

720
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,460
Because that's like a line on the earth.
That's the question.

721
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:16,880
We'll place a bet when it comes to

722
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,720
how you said try taking
him down. Oh, you meant,

723
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,730
I said taking them joy and joy that
when he went down to the ground,

724
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,970
that's not going to win you the fight.
That's true. We could see. Can get,

725
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,280
that would be crazy.

726
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,530
I thought you meant, I thought
you meant that. Uh, um,

727
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,600
he can't take you down. No, not
all day. That looking right.

728
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:43,080
He'll take nothing for doomed
wrestling's like world world class.

729
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,680
But he'll be looking to get taken
down though he doesn't care.

730
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
It's probably better for
him than getting clenched.

731
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,000
So like the sun going to be that easy.

732
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,030
You pull half guard if for
breach over due, but my Jujitsu,

733
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,730
that fucking nasty and Kmarts
gimme against cage with unhook.

734
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,520
Cool bail. I'm jumping to half
guard and we're playing my game.

735
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,260
Suggest suggesting pulling
card. Yes. That's exactly
what I'm telling you, Eddie,

736
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:12,300
about craziness. Okay, Felipe. No
bare. Meanwhile looking fucking good.

737
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,990
It's incredible. I know, man.
Felipe Novaerus looking good dude.

738
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,210
Good transitions between
striking and the grab one.

739
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,890
You see that video with for Ross
showing how to pull guard like a,

740
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:27,390
he calls it pulling web web guard
where it's like pulling guard,

741
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,600
but he's gone right for arm bars. He's
just getting right into spider web. Damn.

742
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,190
I'm sorry. Who is this for
us? For to, yeah. Yeah.

743
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,970
He's got a video out. He's
rolling. He's coached. He's really,

744
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:40,820
we're just talking about, I'm
just telling the listeners. Yeah.

745
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:45,720
He's really working on pulling guard the
males while not at all pulling guard by

746
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,340
actually doing flying armbars.
That's what he's doing.

747
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:49,950
He's been flying armbars to pull guard,

748
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,120
so he's setting it up and he's going up
and he's swaying people down and he'll

749
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:56,130
come their legs and not
necessarily going for the arm bar,

750
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,810
letting you defend using that as a hook
to get your legs and then just putting

751
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:02,420
you on your back and then finish.
You know,

752
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,730
he's such a good coach when he's really
into that right now who he is so good.

753
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,080
There's no one out there really working
on a point guard by throwing flying

754
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:10,820
armbars.

755
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,820
It's basically a flying at flying toss
or a flying swim of depending on what the

756
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:16,860
guy does.

757
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Roy McDonald tried it when he competed
in a Jujitsu match when he was playing JT

758
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:24,810
tourists. Yeah. Wow. I
didn't see that match.

759
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,150
I know he did really well
and it's common in Jujitsu.

760
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,350
He was willing to get his arm broken.
Shinya Aoki Shinier.

761
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:34,860
Nokia has a title fight coming up.

762
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,880
Fucking Shinny Oak. He has a
highlight reel of judo. Just met them.

763
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:43,200
A flying armbars. That's all
monster here. Just stuff in judo.

764
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,320
Just flying armbars in. That's
what Rhonda would do to, yeah.

765
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,990
There's some guys out there and Judah
there aren't going for the throat.

766
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:52,440
They're going for the flying armbars uh,
Dave Camereo same thing.

767
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,570
I think that they should let a,
okay.

768
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:58,020
They should've led Aoki where
those fucking tights. I, it
goes, tights are awesome.

769
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:01,650
I know. They're the best. They
look cool. I know. And it does.

770
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,550
It helps him grip you. Frog. Yeah. I mean,

771
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:09,270
if you have fucking hand wraps on
you and you have gloves at pad,

772
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:13,170
you're not going to allow you to punch,
tee off on someone with impunity.

773
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,690
Guy should have some fucking tights on.
Did they still,

774
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:20,130
do they still allow the wrestling
shoes? No. No more. No Sir.

775
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,370
So long throughout the world.

776
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,020
I'm a fan is how early is it for,

777
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,500
you want him to wear wrestling shoes
and he don't like fake titties.

778
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,120
Crazy. That uh, where
you could wear tights.

779
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,020
They could go up to your knees,
but it's illegal.

780
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:42,700
If they go to your fucking ankles,
you can tape your ankles.

781
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:47,410
All right. Right here for
some reason this, this, this,

782
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,960
uh,
the calf and the Shin.

783
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,520
If you cover that with the same material
that you're covering your ass and your

784
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:58,450
thighs with, if you cover that
part, that's illegal. We'll solder.

785
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:01,540
Rapo has tried to,
you guys tried to kind of Juke the game.

786
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,520
They had like shorts that go down almost
to the knees than they had knee sleeves

787
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:08,190
that went over the ankle sleeves.

788
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,390
All you had open was like the calf
and people were complaining, right?

789
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,010
People he was fighting was,
were complaining.

790
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:19,840
He came out with two knee braces
to ankle braces. Too much bro.

791
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,380
Technical.
They know that's totally legal.

792
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:25,720
You could wear knee sleeves and
you could wear ankle socks. I know,

793
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:26,750
but if you need all that shit,

794
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:29,320
it might be time to kind of move on with
your life. You know what I'm saying?

795
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,740
What are you talking about? That's
like saying tell wide receiver, Oh,

796
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:37,180
you're wearing gloves in the rain.
It's exactly the same thing.

797
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:40,960
If Felipe November, it was got his
back man. Damn good. Making gloves,

798
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,550
making gloves illegal in the
NFL. It's, it's exactly, no,
it's not. It's exactly the,

799
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,240
so it'd be exactly the same
thing. Ooh. Think about it.

800
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:51,880
You're just not thinking about
missing a fucking crazy fight.

801
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,240
Look at this fight looking
Novera tack off of his back.

802
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,690
God Damn. This is a good fight, man.

803
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,130
No, varies. Like really active
off of his back. Oh Shit.

804
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,140
As it gets knocked out,
he's attacking man.

805
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,550
Oh,
it

806
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,270
so close and he got cracked.
Oh Shit.

807
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:27,680
Shit on my, goddamn. That was it right
there. And he's back. Oh, he's a hough.

808
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,900
Oh, another knee. Dan tries brutal.

809
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,830
No has got some kicks to man.
He throws wild ass kicks.

810
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,690
Here's a set of quads on the Asia
does very good on the ground,

811
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,080
man. That triangle was, that was it right
there? Yeah. If he got some flexibility,

812
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,180
the flexibility, he couldn't cinch it
right away. If he had the flexibility,

813
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,080
he would've sensed it right away that
he needed time to adjust and that guide

814
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,280
them, give them time. He just drove
a shoulder and and broke down.

815
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:02,800
Just get on that Eddie Bravo program.

816
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:05,860
Start stretching all the time between
commercials. You gotta be born that way,

817
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:06,694
bro.

818
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,300
What's funny at Eddie's like I got
insane flexibility saying only in certain

819
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,700
ways and other ways he doesn't like,

820
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:18,670
like like hamstring
flexibility is a total normal.

821
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,790
I'm like 93 when it
comes to the hamstrings.

822
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,480
This is a good fight. No, very Sean's
and fucking good grappling skills.

823
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,250
It's interesting man.
That Henzel Gracie team.

824
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:38,270
What a bunch of fucking killers
they've got, Huh? Yeah, man. Hell yeah.

825
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,450
Cummings man. Eddie Cummins is the
Marcella Garcia of leg locks right now.

826
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,450
Really pay attention at that pit cash,

827
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,440
but it's one that we trials finished
everybody for four guy. Nobody can.

828
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,380
He's got leg locks down
better than anybody did he
get everybody would on walks.

829
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,160
Three dudes in Alaska, the arm
barred him. He's a good dude.

830
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,050
He coming right there when Carrington, it
was here. Yeah, that guy. Watch that guy.

831
00:51:03,051 --> 00:51:07,490
He's going to be no, he's the next big
thing. You can't stop his leg. Luxe.

832
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,300
He's John Danaher's
prodigy and super smart.

833
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,790
He's a smart dude.

834
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,540
I can I guess some kind of guy.
Real smart stroke,

835
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,870
physics major type Shit. What
a bitch. I know have it wrong.

836
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,000
It's probably something else.
But in that area,

837
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,460
John Dollars a smart ass and
you're talking to that guy.

838
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,290
They call him a simplest where they call
them. We only has like when a pork. Yeah,

839
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,150
one fork and one fucking
bowl or some shit.

840
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:36,800
Well he's also got like rules to live
your life by like rules about marriage.

841
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:39,530
Like I had a Rory on the podcast,
he was talking about daughters.

842
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,190
There's like those rules.
Like the only time you should get married,

843
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,020
the girl has to be under 25. Uh, the
girl has to be more wealthy than you.

844
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,640
Cha the girl has to like,
there's like a whole bunch of [inaudible].

845
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,400
The only way you should ever get married,
it was under these circumstances.

846
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,310
They are like impossible circumstances.
I love the guy, but he's also,

847
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,370
he's also the guy who were a
rash guard and jeans to the bar.

848
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,590
He'll wear a rash guard to a wedding.
Oh yeah.

849
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:09,380
Where's [inaudible] times roll
your ass up. I'm not mad at that.

850
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,990
He apparently has like something like
really fucked up with his knee though,

851
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:15,290
which is why he never competed.
Oh Shit. No, just got cracked.

852
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,850
But look at this reaching around.
Oh my goodness.

853
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:24,200
He's taken some ferocious ground and
pound here knows what the sponsors are and

854
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:27,740
the
little so okay.

855
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:31,960
Is when is the Reebok deal kick in?
It's not over there.

856
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,630
July, July. Good guard a cuffed him

857
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,080
too greasy. Look at that.
Everything is too greasy.

858
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,630
One round of one for sure. Wow. I haven't
been paying close enough attention to,

859
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,700
yeah, I don't, wouldn't say for
sure. For sure, for sure. For sure,

860
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,020
for sure. I wouldn't say for sure. For
sure. When am I getting one of them?

861
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:01,380
Chicken head social club shirt,
like their boss. Oh my goodness.

862
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:09,110
This ladies and gentleman fighter and the
kid.com the fight and the kid shop.com

863
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,240
it's the, yeah, they're not out
yet though. This is some hot shit.

864
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:17,340
Can we make a social culture?
I know why Eagle Dick.

865
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:20,970
When Aubrey was on the show, I see. What
drug did you tell me to do? Watch humor.

866
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,200
I said, we're going to do some
watch human many. Brian goes, yeah,

867
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,140
I'm just turning the eagles with our eagle

868
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,320
software.
Cowen you so silly.

869
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:34,950
His special May 24th shot at Cowen.
I'm open Irvine Improv.

870
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:39,951
I know it's gonna be Sodo May 24th and
his first show was already sold out.

871
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:44,400
There'll be two shows, May 24th at 7.9
priority. I think. Brian Cowen recordings,

872
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:47,160
comedy special. I don't even
know where it's going to air yet.

873
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:47,821
I don't think they know.

874
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:50,040
I think he's filming it and
he's going to sell it to people,

875
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:51,480
which is sometimes the best way to do it,

876
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:55,110
to see how hilarious he is and that
way no one will be fucking with it too.

877
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:59,010
You don't want anybody fucking with the
material. I can't wait minute. Yeah,

878
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:01,620
we're going to have a good time.
That's going to be fun. The world.

879
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:05,910
Nobody know how funny that dude is.
He's in right now. He's in New York.

880
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:10,320
If you were a New York City. Yeah, he's
at Gotham. Gotham comedy club tonight.

881
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,490
Probably sold out. I'm sure he's
been killed. A kid's killing it.

882
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:22,570
This is an interesting fight,
Phillipe Novell there.

883
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,010
I can't wait for the meeting. Yes, I'm
sorry. Yeah man. Well that's coming up.

884
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,700
Isn't that nice? Magni
first. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.

885
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:35,630
We'll go back and you gotta do to
get famous dudes once six in a row.

886
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,440
Yeah, I know. Right? You just,
you see keeps on the UFC man.

887
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,230
That's this day and age.
It's hard to get famous.

888
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,500
There's a lot of people better knocks
on bitches out. Talk some shit.

889
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,710
Somebody said there's 600 people on the
roster now. Is that the right number?

890
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:50,560
Yeah.

891
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,390
Uh, uh, it seems about right.

892
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:56,570
Last I heard it was like hi for
hundreds and that was a while ago. God,

893
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,150
that's a lot of fighters.
It's unbelievable.

894
00:54:59,151 --> 00:55:03,530
But bits cause the international scene's
growing like a motherfucker. Ooh,

895
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,870
nice takedown am Lou that

896
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,530
that was a pretty slick take down.
That was no bear working off his back.

897
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,550
What does that guard called Eddie
with the under hook on one side,

898
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:20,870
like sorta like London and the white
comes over the top. Was it New York?

899
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,730
You know what I mean? When you got
the look. He's in this position now.

900
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:29,330
The leg comes over the top and
it's not like a rubber guard,

901
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,380
not like mission control. Look at this.
Oh Shit. Is He mad at him? Is that no, no.

902
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:39,240
I'd have to see it. But you know that
thing that everybody does with a, uh,

903
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,460
like grab it like this. They got sorta
hold on like that. The London is London.

904
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,060
What does everybody else call it though?
There's another name. Shawn Williams.

905
00:55:47,061 --> 00:55:50,500
Guard. Okay. Why is that? Why did
they call it Shawn Williams guy? Uh,

906
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,960
he probably made it up
really, really, I think. Hmm.

907
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:58,040
But I thought didn't a Nino Schembri
didn't he? Oh, look at this.

908
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:02,910
Novaerus going for a guillotine.
Guillotine almost to get your writing.

909
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,570
She's going to fuck up.
Get your right knee through sun.

910
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,860
Hit your right knee through. Don't
let him get his fucking body together.

911
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,090
Oh Shit.

912
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,860
You know what I've been doing the
last year about this last week, man,

913
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,790
I did a hot yoga for the first
time in years. She liked it too.

914
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:24,010
I did two days of this week. Fucking
loved it, man. God Damn. Nothing

915
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,100
bothers me. After that. You go
to a place by your house. Yeah,

916
00:56:27,101 --> 00:56:30,650
I'm sort of started going all the time.
What do you mean method? I like the whole,

917
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,420
I don't give a fuck. You
get out of it. So relaxed.

918
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,090
Not like sore muscles after that.
Oh yeah.

919
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:39,640
You definitely get a little sore because
there's a lot of crazy stretching

920
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,590
before and then you did it. Would
it cure your soreness? No. Okay. No.

921
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:46,540
I mean it helped me with,
so it helped me with some of this.

922
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,320
I didn't camp once a week. I love it, man.
It's great to do something more like no.

923
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,630
Yeah, it's, it's really good
for your flexibility. You get
in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

924
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,210
That's the thing. That's
when I think about it, man,

925
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:00,760
I think just as a relaxation,

926
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:04,030
there's something about pulling all
the tension out of your muscles,

927
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:07,030
all the stretching and
all the holding positions.

928
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,410
You don't stress over this fucking arm.
Triangle caught in.

929
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:14,590
The guards would go 40 arm
triangle. I know, right,

930
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:17,590
but he's trying to hold that position.
If he's got the super squeeze,

931
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:21,090
he might be able to pull over shit,
turn away from the case.

932
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,860
You should grab his left leg,
his right turn away from the cage.

933
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,560
Gable grip both hands around the
knee and he'll be totally fine.

934
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:33,460
There's nothing he'll be able to do
unless you can get that impaler working

935
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:37,210
right that needed a chest ever
that to break it. Yeah, you could.

936
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:41,080
Mounting and mounting and me
on the belly will prevent that.

937
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,240
But even the mounts probably even better.

938
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:48,280
You just get more power if you got
me on the belly, but the mouth,

939
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:49,730
there's no way he could
defend it from the mountain.

940
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,470
There's no going with jailbreak strikes
me nuts turned tried to jailbreak.

941
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,170
So given that Eddie Bravo, we look
at that very nice. Jailbreak. Nah,

942
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,340
it's only jailbreak if outside control.

943
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:02,230
That was just him putting
in a butterfly hook.

944
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,260
But the stuff it in like
that good dexterity, right?

945
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,520
You could do that without your hands.

946
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:10,630
That's one of the differences between a
guy like you and a guy who doesn't have

947
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:11,920
that flexibility and dexterity.

948
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:16,480
You do that jailbreak shit and you put
your foot in a way like I would have to

949
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:20,050
like pull my foot, can be some work,
shove it in there with my hand.

950
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:24,160
Eddie could do it like whoosh.
Huge advancement in flexible. I've,

951
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,770
I have students that are
way more flexible than me.

952
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,250
They made it doesn't mean you're
not that flexible. I'll kill it.

953
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:32,210
He's doing it again. That's more
of a jail dude. It looks tight.

954
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:35,410
It was a jail break and going all the
way across the belly. That's even better.

955
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,160
See how it's turning into it? I don't get
what he's doing over here. It could be.

956
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,190
It could cause she was going away from
judge. If he'd figure for his arms,

957
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:46,780
it'd be tighter. He's oust and now
he's got one rubber arm for sure.

958
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,700
For sure that,
oh

959
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,600
good look. He got size and trolled,
man. He's went full. Ferocious.

960
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,830
Ferocious. You gotta think
that dude want it? Yeah.

961
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:04,030
You would think it's serious cardio right
there. He was gone 100% the whole time.

962
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,600
That was a good fight. We
have a yoga channel, Brandon,

963
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:11,080
if you want to do it like it's your house
really like that Black Swan Yoga TV,

964
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,290
I'd definitely be down to try that.
I kind of need a place to go though.

965
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,950
You know what I'm saying?
Just to commit to it at her.

966
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,950
It's mine that hot and you know,

967
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:19,900
have the instructor then
you can't take a pose off

968
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,030
fuck off. Usually attractive girls.
So it's motivated now where I go,

969
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,310
but the most important thing, dude, is day
heat. I agree that he needs [inaudible].

970
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,230
You walk in, you're sweating, the moment
you get in that fucking thing, the sweat,

971
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,890
the breath, the stretching and all of
it together. That's fucking hard to do.

972
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:41,060
Like that's the most amazing thing
about it is how hard it is to do.

973
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,840
And then how relaxed I am when it's over.
Oh my goodness.

974
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:49,160
All the dudes have all their shirts off
and shit. What I like doing, Jesus, man,

975
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:54,140
just tidies and guts everywhere.
It's weird policy. Uh,
no. How about your weird,

976
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,950
how about, I'm not for
sure, but your tits. Wait,

977
00:59:57,951 --> 00:59:59,470
I'm trying to do yoga
and get your titties,

978
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:03,730
my feet and the female memories.
No,

979
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,660
that I'm up for that. It's the out of
shape. Hairy dudes. Those that's, yeah.

980
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,150
You want those in your class.
One guy's,

981
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,800
that guy's less flexible
than you doing shitty poses.

982
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,160
You're trying to compete with them.

983
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:21,770
Blow my back out and knowing about dudes
that are really good at yoga. I agree.

984
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,510
Thank you man. Fuck you, Bro. I
don't have time to do that shit.

985
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,480
Especially when they're
wearing like ambulance,

986
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:35,060
ambulance beads are
Lulu Lemon on and shit.

987
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:42,640
Amulets tight. Yeah,

988
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,370
you stepped my yoga came up though. It
dudes don't wear yoga pants. It's weird.

989
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:49,760
It's exclusive to women. It's
very, very [inaudible] yoga pants,

990
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,320
all that shit. All that
shit. You're talking shit on.

991
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,130
Why I DDP Yoga? It's
blowing up. It's yoga.

992
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,650
It's not for your Mama.
I think it's not your mom's

993
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:07,880
horrible slogan. He came out to
honor it and put us all through it.

994
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:11,540
Some DDP Yoga. How was it? It was
all right. I prefer regular yoga.

995
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:14,800
I mean you do a lot of counting
and a lot of like hell yeahs and so

996
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,700
the whole purpose can I get a hell?
Yeah,

997
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:25,701
but not Chicago without the
beads and the incense on.

998
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:31,240
I liked the incense and B no over one man.
Good for him.

999
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,650
But we weren't paying attention. Yeah, we
just saw that last 37 months. We can't,

1000
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,720
we can't really say whether or not anyone
Anik with the new do sexy. Personally.

1001
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:46,340
I'm not mad at suit and tie.
Yeah.

1002
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,820
Mixed reaction from the crowd, man.
Sorry son. With all due respect,

1003
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:52,590
I thought the other guy won. It was all
due respect. We were barely attention.

1004
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,170
In fact, it was a good
fight. I watched them.

1005
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,290
You're argued about
knee braces, Eddie. Hey,

1006
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,290
you want to start with that again?
It's not the same. Exactly the same.

1007
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,770
It feels exactly the same. The receivers
that I felt would have knee braces on.

1008
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,360
No, no, no. This is what it is.

1009
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:16,160
This is why do wide receivers in
the NFL wear gloves when it's rainy.

1010
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:20,880
Why? So they can grip the ball.
They can catch yes and score. Yes.

1011
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:24,540
So they can catch in score.
The same thing with Jujitsu.

1012
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:29,990
It's easier to catch in score when there
it isn't a hot oil wrestling match with

1013
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,920
all the sweat and blood everywhere.

1014
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,900
Like why is it more manly to fight
and shorts than it is to pence?

1015
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:41,100
That's ridiculous because I don't think
it's more manly. But then why are,

1016
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,930
why is it illegal to cover your calf?
That's illegal.

1017
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:48,830
You can't comprehend candid about it.
Exactly. That's what I'm trying to tell.

1018
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:53,730
That's what I'm saying. It's like you
in a sport, you uh, they have meetings.

1019
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:57,750
The heads of the, the football teams
have meetings to increase offense.

1020
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:00,550
They do it in basketball.
What do we do to resolve?

1021
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,350
So if they banned gloves,

1022
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,370
they made it illegal for a wide receiver
to wear gloves. Those rainy games,

1023
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:11,310
those money. Again, people are just going
to be dropping balls all over the place.

1024
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,870
That would be the dumbest rule ever.

1025
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:16,450
They got to do let these motherfuckers
wearing the gloves. The beans are green.

1026
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,180
They don't help that.
But pants. Do you know,

1027
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,600
blow wide receivers wear gloves
for extra grip? Not all. Most?

1028
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,483
Most do.

1029
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:28,920
They do and they do it for extra grip
so they could catch and score and the

1030
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:33,090
league will go, yeah, we want let them if
they, if it makes them score more. Yes,

1031
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:36,270
it's a good plus. They have their spot,
their logos on them. Nike or Reebok. Gla.

1032
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:41,010
I understand, but in an MMA you can
wear tights that go up to your knees.

1033
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,660
You can wear shorts but they can't cover
the calf. I agree. That's a stupid rule.

1034
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,980
Exactly.
What I'm saying is they,

1035
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,680
if it'd be the same if they're
both wearing knee braces,

1036
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,980
you should definitely be able to wear
rash guards. Yeah, I think like, yeah,

1037
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,120
why not? Why not? Why can't
girls are wearing rash guards
and it's not a problem.

1038
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,300
It's not a promise. It's weird.
They won't wear rash guard pants.

1039
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:04,350
They can't wear Ras card sleeves though.
Girls don't fight with long sleeves.

1040
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,790
They can on the UFC,
they can't know the short sleeves.

1041
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,450
It's illegal. Now.
That's another dumb rule.

1042
01:04:12,451 --> 01:04:16,230
Why would that be illegal that
you can't cover your fucking boy?

1043
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:21,231
Magni coming young Goulam 15
look at this rumble in DC.

1044
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,000
It's a good fight.
It is a very good fight.

1045
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,680
It's just the problem is ultimately
if DC wins, that's really the problem.

1046
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:33,390
That's worst case scenario for the UFC.
Worst case, I want you to win. I want DC.

1047
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,200
Do you think that DC, if DC one
like, let's just say DC ones,

1048
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:42,270
do you think that it's conceivable the
DC can improve to the point where he

1049
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:46,500
could possibly beat John Jones? He's
just a judge Jones fresh out of prison.

1050
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,530
I'd want to see all groggy and Sean.
No, no, no. Fresh out of prison.

1051
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,500
John John's with full camp. No, no,

1052
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,170
no one in the world's being
John with a full camp.

1053
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,790
No one in the world might be close, but
people would pay to see a fight. Do it.

1054
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,350
You got to remember him first. DC. That
wasn't a good fight. He dominated DC.

1055
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:07,640
I gave DC maybe one round
if that dominated them.

1056
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:12,420
Mary took him down his first round. Yeah,
lacked right away. I went right to it

1057
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,650
wasn't a good fight, man. John
Jones is a bad motherfucker.

1058
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,130
Where do you have another

1059
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,850
one of those bars? Yeah, there's a bunch
of the to go in the kitchen, the kitchen,

1060
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,340
there's all kinds of bars.
I forgot to bring those away.

1061
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,630
I really liked those whey bars.

1062
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,470
Those are new ways on May go and get me
a coconut water. Very good. Very good.

1063
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,220
Yeah. Give me one of them CTOs to see two
o's. Rumba wouldn't mind at. Interesting.

1064
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:42,120
Fine for Jones because he
can knock anybody out dead.

1065
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:45,250
I think John would have took him down
more and most likely killed or at least

1066
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,540
there's a, at least there's
a chance for sure, but,

1067
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,700
but we all feel this every time. Oh, this
is guy gotta beat John Wrong every time.

1068
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,970
Thanks to that's how good the dude is.
Thanks and thanks for the fuck. Tough one.

1069
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:00,880
Fucked out with the debt I have.
You guys had maple water by the way.

1070
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:03,010
We were about to talk
about this the other day,

1071
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,980
but somehow or another we got to talk
to maple water. What is this shit?

1072
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,800
It comes from the maple tree
instead of a coconut tree,

1073
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:12,790
just like they make maple syrup but they
make maple water and it's like half the

1074
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:17,050
sugar of coconut water and same like
electrolytes and nutrient tastes good.

1075
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,460
It's fucking way better. I can get it
tastes way better than coconut water.

1076
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:24,970
Better. I'm telling you a minute. Then
this coconut water, I was C two O sir.

1077
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,570
How dare you. What about that harmless
harvest shit. You ever have that?

1078
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,940
That's shit fresh. Look,
I like Coco was good.

1079
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:34,150
It's not Brian Swan is next level shit.

1080
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:37,210
Like if I was a tycoon like William
Randolph Hearst or something.

1081
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:41,870
I buy all the maple trees now. Podcasts
right now. Quickly get on the podcast.

1082
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:45,760
Some fucking maple trees. Yeah, take, we
can't get this maple lines. Just Christ.

1083
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,430
I get it at a whole foods and I saw it
at the Paleo conference. Paper water.

1084
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,020
They were talking to a couple of
companies because I think it's, it's,

1085
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:58,060
it's next level. Holy Shit. I won the
trip wise. What about it's equivalent.

1086
01:06:58,061 --> 01:06:59,740
I haven't done the full gamut of research,

1087
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:03,430
but then what they're saying is that
it's equivalent to coconut water nutrient

1088
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:07,390
wise without so much sugar. Okay. What do
you, what do you think about this fight?

1089
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,550
What do you think about, call me. Yay.
And uh, not Courtenay Johnson. Oh,

1090
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,640
Weidman versus Belfort.
What'd you think about that fight?

1091
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:17,380
It's a tough call because what bell
force coming in there Belfour off TRT and

1092
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:21,190
getting tested all the time. I don't, I
don't got it right. It's a different guy.

1093
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,040
Weidman is a fucking beast.

1094
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,920
He is a big piece to me.

1095
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,360
How Weidman's not more famous and a bigger
name is crazy. He's so talented, man.

1096
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,420
He should be the face of the UFC
out tail to do. Yeah, but he's not

1097
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,150
10 you'll call me. Yeah.
Weidman's a motherfucker, dude.

1098
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:42,160
If he beats down Vito Belfort,
it might be,

1099
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:45,010
this might be like a breakout fight
for him. He needs a breakout fight.

1100
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:45,401
You know what I'm saying?

1101
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:48,190
You would think the Machita one would
have done it well if he stopped,

1102
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,240
but Cheetah, maybe that would've
done it. True thing is Machida.

1103
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,430
Him was an amazing fight, but it
was a five round, amazing war.

1104
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,280
It's tough for him because he
beats him silver twice. Right.

1105
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,160
But everyone's a cab and
she was fucked around.

1106
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:03,760
There's lake fell off in that other one
and then he gets Leo Machida and that

1107
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:06,670
fell off. It's like back and forth.
But yes, you're right though.

1108
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,450
If he destroys veto it and now we've got
a superstar. He's such a good dude too,

1109
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:13,780
man. You know vitarka probably make
welterweight now and I'm not bullshitting.

1110
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:18,710
You saw in Vegas that time? Yeah, well
that was when he was fresh off of it.

1111
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:21,830
When he was fresh off of
it. His body morph, dude.

1112
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:26,570
I mean he lost a shit ton of weight.
I don't remember him hitting Jones,

1113
01:08:26,571 --> 01:08:29,900
but they highlighted all times.
He hit Jones,

1114
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,750
come on and he's taken John Down.

1115
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:37,010
But that lasted for literally a second
and John was back up on its feet.

1116
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,840
You know, you got to look at a guy
like call me a and think I'll also,

1117
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:46,841
he's like 36 or 37 37 37 he's been
competing and wrestling his whole life.

1118
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,490
He's only been fighting MMA I think
since he was like 30, right? Yeah.

1119
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:57,080
That loves six, seven years.
We've shot Evans number four. Wow.

1120
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,510
Ryan Bader number five.
What are they going to do with Beta?

1121
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,590
Well Beta was supposed to be fighting DC.
I know that was a good fucking fight.

1122
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:04,424
Great fight.

1123
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,390
I was looking forward and were shot out
for a grip cause he tours a leg again as

1124
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,370
me. So he's out for another
year. He's all fucked guests. Uh,

1125
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:18,610
Gus has a global tech Sherif how long
has [inaudible] been out for now?

1126
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:23,600
For a long time. Two years now,
right? Yeah. Two years. Two years.

1127
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,360
Yeah. Johnson. He's big tear right
now. Look at this throwing head kicks.

1128
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,070
Rashad was telling me Anthony Johnson
owns the spotter practice cause he just

1129
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:38,750
knocks bitches even on accident. He's
like my bad man. It's just what he,

1130
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:42,380
that's his ammo cause he just like,
he goes seeker missile.

1131
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:46,790
Does he go all out or is he just hits
so hard. Just said so God damn hard.

1132
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,670
You wonder what's going to
happen to him if he gets pushed.

1133
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,420
You know now that he has like he doesn't
have the issue that he had before with

1134
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,530
losing all the weight.
He's a totally different now.

1135
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:59,510
But that was the destroyer DC
when you took out pat destroyer.

1136
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:04,940
But um, he was mad at Pat. Pat talked to
a lot of shit just to get the UFC though.

1137
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:07,880
He didn't mean it. He just did it to
get a shot handy to get that fight.

1138
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,901
But you know,

1139
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:12,380
I just wonder whether or not he could
take the heat because he couldn't take the

1140
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:13,211
heat at one 70.

1141
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:16,850
He was just so dried out then when he
would like Koscheck beat him that way,

1142
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,230
Vito or beat him that way. But as that
one 85 actually, yeah. That's why I,

1143
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:25,340
that's the fight there because if DC can
just get through that first round and

1144
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:27,290
not eat a fucking huge shot,

1145
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,650
I think he's just going to wear
Johnson out for eight rounds.

1146
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,500
But that's why I think if you
see him against Phil Davis,

1147
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,950
he was fucking on 0.3 rounds.
Hard.

1148
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:39,590
Big Difference Between DC and Phil
Davis though. Big, big difference.

1149
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:44,620
Big Difference as far as off
one kid strike to wrestle
fills more of wrestling a

1150
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:49,820
strike and he's not really mixing it up.
Okay, what do we got here and boy man,

1151
01:10:49,821 --> 01:10:54,020
come on. I know you're taking magni.
Yeah, got him mad. Really helping.

1152
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:57,200
He does something. I mean get on
the mic. Maybe big talk. Some shit,

1153
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:59,360
maybe get a Scottish accent or some shit.

1154
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:02,930
He's going to have to just keep beating
guys and then become like undeniable.

1155
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:07,640
Now that doesn't work man.
Look at John Fitch. Yeah,

1156
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,600
but John Fitch got a title shot.
He did, but he still wasn't that.

1157
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,900
He was never like a breakout star one.
Paul.

1158
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,050
If he beat GSP would have been a
breakout star shit and he gets asked.

1159
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:18,893
Worked any.

1160
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:22,980
You're just saying this this day and
age and Eoc you got do some shit.

1161
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:27,600
Man is more exciting than Fitz was thick.
Put hands on people.

1162
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,030
That's true. Tough as hell. I want to,

1163
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,570
I would say it's more exciting
the Fitch because Fitch had some,

1164
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,050
some exciting fights. It actually, yeah,

1165
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:39,630
I would say he's more excited and he's
more excited. Neil's thing is he, he's,

1166
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:43,470
he's a point spar touched
up tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

1167
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:46,020
There's no power is never tired.
I'm never tired.

1168
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,150
I called [inaudible]
name forms live gazelle.

1169
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:52,850
I'm still waiting for that to catch up.
Just stick all the gazette.

1170
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,790
Nope. It's not hitting
right. Nope. Also famous.

1171
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:02,760
Why all the Gazelle Watkins has already
already exists. Watson. Why Watson?

1172
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,820
He's not in the UFC though. He wasn't
the UFC. He fought Tj Dillashaw. No,

1173
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,880
I get that, but he's not
anymore. So many pit bulls.

1174
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:17,140
One in the UFC we should put a
cap [inaudible] the pit bull.

1175
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:25,770
The pit bull pit bull pit bull Arlovski.

1176
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,010
That's old school man. What I found
was just Andre, what's up Andre?

1177
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:33,330
He owns a pit bull that
he has at least a pip.

1178
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:37,710
Thiago Silva is the pit bull.
Yeah. I see out of this,

1179
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,200
but how Laskey was the pit
bull first, right? That's true.

1180
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,270
You got to switch up your nicknames.
A few other pit bulls there, man.

1181
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,280
There's some other dudes are like,

1182
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,780
I would go to get their nicknames at the
UFC and I'd be doing the weigh ins when

1183
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,850
I have to call them. I'm like,
I'm not saying that right.

1184
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,630
I look at their and I'm like,
yeah you can.

1185
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,120
You can't just call yourself some shit.
You know somebody has to actually do.

1186
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:02,050
You can't make up your nickname.
Otherwise I'd be like the Brown nights,

1187
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:04,580
some dope ass shit. You know
what? I'm [inaudible] Brown.

1188
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,830
Your Big Brown Callen gave me that
name and all the fans ran with it,

1189
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:10,490
so I had to switch my name so
it's like you don't pick out,

1190
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,520
pick some dope ass shit. Like
did you come up with a hybrid?

1191
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,190
I didn't come up with it. Again, you
can't pick your fucking nickname.

1192
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:21,060
Who came up with the hybrid, the producers
on the spike. A ultimate fighter.

1193
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:26,390
Why Hybrid? Because they
would a Prius. Yeah. Right.

1194
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,970
Cause they had like they would do like
a bed behind the scenes, like don't,

1195
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:34,350
not for money but just like who they
thought was going to win the show and they

1196
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:35,830
didn't know my name.
He's like I'll,

1197
01:13:35,831 --> 01:13:39,060
I'll take like that hybrid heavyweight
cause I was at that big compared to the

1198
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:41,910
other guys, but I hit like a
heavyweight. So they called me the hybrid

1199
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:46,620
and then fucking Callen just kept calling
me big brown and kept saying I was

1200
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:51,390
native American and then it's the show
got more popular. It just took off.

1201
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:56,180
I picked the Brown night though,
some Dope Shit Brown.

1202
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:00,920
But you can't pick your nose. White Brown
just cause your, your skin tone. Yeah,

1203
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:04,290
because I'm taking a shit year
round living by the beach.

1204
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:07,530
That southern California
lifestyle bitches.

1205
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:12,220
You really Pale naturally.
Nope. Always been 10 yeah.

1206
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,810
I think I'm adopted bro.
It's my family's white as shit.

1207
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,130
Super. Everyone's super, super
white and then Brown as fuck.

1208
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,510
So you're serious about that.

1209
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:26,350
You're a serious 100% you
don't look anything like your
mother or father neither.

1210
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:30,430
Nothing like that. No. Just kidding. My,
I look like my dad. My Dad's a big dude,

1211
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:33,340
athletic dude, but I'm Brown.
I'm like Kim, but Brown.

1212
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:38,560
Would you ever have any desire to do
this shit, dude? Nah. Oh, you mean, oh,

1213
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:43,150
you mean a fucking drive around?
Nah, I'm good. It looks fun, man.

1214
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:48,100
It would be fun.
It looks fun.

1215
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:53,470
I think it'd be fun to do like the f one
style track students make serious money.

1216
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:57,700
The F one cars are like driving
a like an airplane. You know?

1217
01:14:57,710 --> 01:14:59,380
It's all these things like a cockpit.

1218
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,970
It's all technical and she has chosen
Alex from a shark works is telling me he's

1219
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:08,200
going to bring down that gt three with
800 horsepower. Oh Mike. He's like, yeah,

1220
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:11,750
he's like huge organ to drive.
I'm like, Nah, I already
drove. Did you? It's manual,

1221
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:16,420
right? Yeah. It's terrible. Good Bro. Do
you know how to drive a manual? Come on.

1222
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:20,260
Yeah, I'm a Puerto Rican man. Fuck yeah.

1223
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:26,720
Don't, don't fucking out of me right
now, Joe. He can't drive a stick. I

1224
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:29,903
A lot was

1225
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:37,510
the other thing that you had on
them there was need Krispy Kreme.

1226
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:40,240
There was one of you could
wear shoes in the UFC.

1227
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,880
It's not good. It's not good. Will you
use to be able to wear shoes in pride?

1228
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:49,970
I mean, that's why I like super
old school. I just thought it was,

1229
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,050
do you remember when that Brad Kohler
kicked a Steve Jensen right in their face?

1230
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:01,090
Judd, uh, Steve Judson, he
punched him. No, no, no.

1231
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,310
Bob Ballou kicked him in the face.
That's right.

1232
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:06,830
Brad stroller doubt Steve Jobs
was one punch. That's right.

1233
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,500
It was a haymaker.

1234
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,580
Pablo beat his ass and punted
his head and he had shoes on,

1235
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:17,380
punted his head.
He was not that.

1236
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:18,730
You just declare that he is today.

1237
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:23,020
Bob Ballou in the beginning
was a Brazilian wrestler
who could box and he was

1238
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:26,080
fighting to heaven. Nobody like
him. There was nobody like Bob,

1239
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:29,890
like a Brazilian wrestler.
I've always liked Bob blue led boxing.

1240
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,740
He's a tough motherfucker, man. You know,

1241
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:37,020
Bob Lou didn't admit to choking that
dude out in his post fight interview.

1242
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,650
His whole career would have taken a
totally different turn, you know. Oh,

1243
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:44,440
where he held the choke to lung,
just didn't talk about it.

1244
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:48,520
I was interviewing him. I tried to just
go right through. I knew what he did.

1245
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:52,510
But see there's a difference to me
between the guy who holds a choke a little

1246
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:55,690
long and a guy who holds like a knee
bar a little like, or he'll hook,

1247
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:58,720
we tear someone's knee apart.
That's fucked up. One's career.

1248
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,430
One is just in it for Bob allude.

1249
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:05,800
That guy was like talking shit to him
before the fight and he was like very,

1250
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:08,920
very amped up about it.
I don't remember,

1251
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,590
I don't remember who it was,
but uh, he was mad though,

1252
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:15,110
put him to sleep and it was
a lot of blood before that.

1253
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:17,540
He'd beat the shit out of him
and then he put them to sleep.

1254
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:21,420
It looked really bad. But I remember
when I was interviewing him, he was uh,

1255
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,630
talking about how he did and you know,

1256
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:26,450
and I asked him to clarify
and then people like,

1257
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:29,210
he got upset at me thought like somehow
or another I got him in trouble.

1258
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:31,940
I'm like, dude, you're the one
who brought it up. I didn't even,

1259
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,730
I don't even want to talk about it.
I wouldn't have talked about it.

1260
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:38,290
Like he thought I didn't like
him. I'm a big Bible. A Fan. Yeah.

1261
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,520
How can you always been
a Bible for me to always,

1262
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:43,860
for some reason he's a fucking
awesome grappler to Matt and amazing.

1263
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:48,300
Really good fucking grappler. His match
with chill frustrated me. But yeah,

1264
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:53,120
he got a Hilti Jitsu Chels during his
MMA career and then like now that's what

1265
01:17:53,121 --> 01:17:55,190
he's known. He's a bright
guy, right? Yeah. Dude.

1266
01:17:55,191 --> 01:17:58,520
His fight with Dean lister in
Metamorris was very impressive.

1267
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:03,470
He had dean lister locked up. That
shit hurt. Oh, Neil's in trouble. Oh,

1268
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:08,290
he's in fucking wild,
man, dude, man. Oh, snaps.

1269
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:12,500
Just high on just time up brother.
Oh God.

1270
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:16,840
Nasty knee man.
Jesus Christ.

1271
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:19,750
That's a Korean people were tweeting
me saying, this guy's a mother fucker.

1272
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,520
He's a wild dude. What did you see
his fight with? Terrick Safa Dean.

1273
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:26,330
He's so reckless.
It was like so wild and explosive.

1274
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,120
It's just a matter of he can, can he keep
it up? But magni is just always there.

1275
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:35,390
Dude, here you, whether it's
a storm does cardiac on him.

1276
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,680
His cardio allows them to weather
the storm. Yeah. That's impressive.

1277
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:45,350
But the thing is like limb can hurt him
and he yanked me. Can't really hurt him,

1278
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:46,910
you know? Yeah. He just
sussed out point him,

1279
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:50,540
which is a bad game to play with a power
punch or sometimes Maggie's guys back,

1280
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,383
we have this,

1281
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:56,300
but he could wear his ass out if limb co
totally empties the gas tank trying to

1282
01:18:56,301 --> 01:19:01,301
take magni out prompts a Maggie for
surviving that thought it was over.

1283
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:07,370
Yeah. That dude's swings for the fences
too. He said some really fun fights.

1284
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:12,290
Yeah. He's a big dude man. Right.

1285
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:15,330
Damn. Is she gonna go to commercially
though right in the middle of them round?

1286
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:18,970
Yes. Did it go right in the middle
of the rounds? At the middle of this.

1287
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:23,730
Oh look, they went back. Oh, you
dummies. Whoever's working at Fox.

1288
01:19:23,731 --> 01:19:28,410
You're fire Jetson. Sarah stepped
in my office. You're fucking hell.

1289
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:32,060
Fuck. Oh Hell No. Oh my God.

1290
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:37,110
He'll dial back. What happened did didn't
happen. We have no idea. This is a scam.

1291
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,510
This is gonna shake. 'Em Off. This is
conspiracy. Eddie Bravo to higher c.

1292
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,180
What's the conspiracy on this?

1293
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,990
Look at these and Neil Magni a little
too high on them. Way Too high. He's,

1294
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,440
he ended up in guard. God Damn it, Neal.

1295
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,833
Yeah.

1296
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,290
Vcs. Weathering the storm.
Ferdinand Marcos Dylan power.

1297
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:01,220
That was in the 70s Oh,
fucking triangle.

1298
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:06,190
Oh Shit. On top. Very nice. Oh, taxes.

1299
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:11,790
Oh.
Oh stack him.

1300
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:18,220
Got Our chefs are real cock fight.
Come on man.

1301
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,740
Neil.
Maggie went to good das.

1302
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:26,460
Could defense at a Thompson Neil's
long.

1303
01:20:26,461 --> 01:20:28,720
So those ground and pound
works from way up there.

1304
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,360
You have very strict to Sun Mountain.
Oh yeah.

1305
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:38,920
He's very tired. Come on. Damn
Neil. Magdi my close the show here.

1306
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:41,610
Look at this.
Flag them outside.

1307
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:47,710
The body triangle doesn't have it there.
It is.

1308
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:54,200
Got To be one of the most frustrating
aspects of gloves out by how much it it

1309
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:58,360
stops. Chokes stole
full mount again. Damn.

1310
01:20:58,361 --> 01:21:01,840
Magna is on fire to maximum mother Fucker,
man.

1311
01:21:01,841 --> 01:21:05,350
He really is his guy feet.
Oh Shit.

1312
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:07,780
Oh that dude's exhausted.

1313
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,660
He is exhausted but he's still
throwing fucking hammers.

1314
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,720
Oh well this isn't good now he's got
magic stack dam but a great fight.

1315
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,450
You know.
I mean if he could recover,

1316
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:23,050
maybe he gets exhausted all the time
and then he covered. Here's a good,

1317
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,130
here's a good example.

1318
01:21:24,131 --> 01:21:28,990
Like who do you give that round two
cause clearly lim had magnet fucked up in

1319
01:21:28,991 --> 01:21:33,790
the beginning, but now then magni had
his bag. Malcolm Down Magni mounted him.

1320
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:36,100
I think at the end of the rounds,
more important than the beginning.

1321
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,490
If all that shit was solo,

1322
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,760
Neil Magni come on strong because of all
the shit I give to the nail right now.

1323
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,100
A slight edge.

1324
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:48,970
I'd like the end of the round stronger
to answer your question because if that

1325
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:52,350
shit in the first round was so bad ass,
how could,

1326
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:54,560
how did that guy come back and whip
her ass at the end of the road?

1327
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,780
So it was almost like it really,
it wasn't as bad ass as it looked right.

1328
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,090
That was a dumb ass.
I wouldn't put it that way.

1329
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,930
But I would say that it is more important
at the end because then the two guys

1330
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:08,140
have had the chance to fight and figure
out the strengths and weaknesses and

1331
01:22:08,141 --> 01:22:11,020
what's dominating over time.
Over time,

1332
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:15,400
like the ebbs and the flows of the fight
is more important that the guy has the

1333
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:18,820
ability to maintain, can keep it
together all the way through the round.

1334
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,850
And at the end of the round, he's the
one who's winning sleight of mouth.

1335
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,990
But then again,
limb hurt him more than Magni hurt him,

1336
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,610
but it was more dominant overall.
Him had him fucked.

1337
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:34,450
And at one point in time means the end
means like if that was a street fight

1338
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:38,560
right there, I would have said,
Maggie kick his ass, kicked his ass,

1339
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,490
kicked kick his ass, kicked his
ass. And you don't remember.

1340
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,440
Judges are influenced
by the end of the round.

1341
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:45,470
That's what they're going to remember.

1342
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,640
More important to look
at this moment here. Ooh,

1343
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,260
this is the end.
But here's the other thing.

1344
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,530
Maggie's going to be able to do this
for three fucking rounds. How look,

1345
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,240
I mean how exhausted his limb after
that first round we get back nine,

1346
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:02,560
it's sweating. What do,
what such good shape man,

1347
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,720
get them cause hell and it's training
in in Denver that training at altitude.

1348
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,330
Nope, but look at him. He's
like boom, look at him. Go.

1349
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,590
He's just warming up now he's confident.
Yeah. That's his biggest thing, man.

1350
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,770
If he can get his confidence inside that
ring, which he's slowly getting there.

1351
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,770
You've got a real monster on your
hands and limb is still recovering.

1352
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:22,570
She's still taking some deep breaths.

1353
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,920
He's just trying to land
this big shop and look at it.

1354
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:30,400
You can't do that with magnet now
because now magnus is going to wear on it

1355
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:34,890
takes you down though. You're in
trouble. Triple in this limousine.

1356
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,130
Exhausted the fact that limb got taken
down like that and then all mount a full

1357
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:43,450
mount with a full four minutes
of mount. Enjoy this. Well also,

1358
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:47,290
the thing about limb, he's shoes,
so that cut is probably brutal.

1359
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,730
I said he's a big fellow.
Yeah.

1360
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,710
Is Look at this fucking
back mount by Magni.

1361
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:58,300
God Damn Magni full mount again.
Very nice.

1362
01:23:58,301 --> 01:24:01,720
Very nice. Other, oh my county's beating
the shit out of them. Look at this.

1363
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:06,130
Goes to, he should keep punching. They're
going to, if you flatten them out.

1364
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:09,310
Oh Shit. Just punch here. There
you go. There to stop the fight.

1365
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,760
Quit looking for position. There you go.
Keep going. Keep going. Look at that.

1366
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:17,350
Ref is very close here. Can you feel
the ref when they're close? 100% yeah.

1367
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:21,850
That you start punching harder.
Maggie's ass. That's it. That's it.

1368
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:24,710
Car would listen to stop this fight.
That's it.

1369
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:31,000
Daniel magnate fucked. Yeah. Neil Magni
look at night even breathing. Huh?

1370
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:34,660
Do what? That's amazing. Like 10 more
times tonight. He really isn't breathing.

1371
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,740
Where did he try it again?
Denver called altitude high altitude.

1372
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:43,330
Teamhealth handled magnate. How far the,
how often do you go back and train there?

1373
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,460
A once a year.

1374
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:50,440
Okay.

1375
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:54,370
That's tough for me to leave that lay
man with everything going on your stuff.

1376
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:59,170
You're right. Nor do I want
to leave. I love La. I ain't
going nowhere. Once steel,

1377
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,410
Maggie got ahold of him and that second
round it was total domination and it was

1378
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,600
what we said.
Lynn was just too fucking tired.

1379
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,180
He's too tired from that first
round and he didn't really recover.

1380
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:12,100
That cardio of Neil magnet is a
fucking weapon. Huge weapon. A weapon,

1381
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:15,010
a huge weapon in the
position he's really good at.

1382
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:16,690
You don't keep him dominant position.

1383
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,440
What's going to be interesting about
the main event is both guys have insane

1384
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:24,730
cardio. Uriah Faber has insane
cardio and Frankie's cardio.

1385
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:28,120
It's superhuman. Five rounds.
Just going to be nuts.

1386
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:31,180
I think it's going to be going
five rounds. I don't think so.

1387
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,510
I think it's going to be three really.
I think Edgar's gonna take him out.

1388
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:39,460
Wait a minute. The fight, the
fight, five rounds. What is this?

1389
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:44,470
Wait a minute. You think
like couldn't do? Yeah, I do.

1390
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,280
Yeah. I mean just based on what,
what happened with cub, you know?

1391
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,880
I mean that was savage.
I think he finished Troy.

1392
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:55,780
Yeah. Different Games. A totally
different kind of fighter. Tuck.

1393
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,670
Cubs out a wrestle. Your eyes are way
better wrestler. Way Better grappler.

1394
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,490
Way More dangerous. Like that comes our
way back as a boy though. The Cub Swanson

1395
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:07,550
is a black buddies. Really
good grappling, grappling,

1396
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,430
finishing. As far as finishing your
right favors. Guilty, I would say.

1397
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:15,510
I don't know about that man.
You can't get to your right.

1398
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,750
Fame down favor is really good.
Edgy Jitsu.

1399
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:25,640
But Cub Swanson is as well. Look who
has more finishes. My submission. Yeah.

1400
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:30,530
Callbacks to stand and bang. Look at
the way Cup just got finished. Bye Bye.

1401
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:33,980
Max Holloway. She was hurt. He was hurt.

1402
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,630
But Max is really good too.

1403
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,670
He is really good and when a
guy's her and see you guys hurt,

1404
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,840
she gets it goes out the door.
I think it's a good decision for sure.

1405
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:44,510
No one's getting finished.
Couldn't you said some about five rounds.

1406
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:46,530
It's not fiber. It's five rounds.
All made of. It's a fiber.

1407
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,330
It's an amazing 2015 Munoz
is the main event. No.

1408
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:56,300
Are you crazy? I think Munoz
is next. Dario. Hey, saucy.

1409
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:59,680
Phillip. Who's the cord? Munoz in
Philippines. Come on. That's it.

1410
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:04,300
That's how no moon isn't even the
co main event. No Man. Musashi.

1411
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:08,140
Philip. Who's Komita that? At least
someone said so. Neil, tell me

1412
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:16,220
he's all, yeah, Gary Condit.
When nine 11 happened,

1413
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,100
man, it was getting tough.
The rest and choose one.

1414
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:24,380
It's going to be tough to live
down. Yeah, it's tough, man.

1415
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:26,340
In the [inaudible] comment I gave out,

1416
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:29,720
still get over the [inaudible]
standby for fake titties,

1417
01:27:29,721 --> 01:27:31,940
but that wrestling common.
You might want to stay off Twitter.

1418
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,840
Just want to pass on social media for a
couple days. What is this? Fight stories.

1419
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:40,790
Favorite talks to
celebrities about fights.

1420
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:44,900
They've been in [inaudible]
favor show. Yeah. Fight stories.

1421
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:48,470
Hope it's all animated. Oh,
that's hilarious. Talented it.

1422
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,500
But the story was so vulgar. They
get it. Air It. I was sitting like,

1423
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:55,640
you have to have a different story.
They Kansas story about

1424
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:02,900
New York can beat up cake ass bro.
You can't, you can't share that story.

1425
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:07,250
Wow. And the guy's like, you got to wrap
it up too man. Like this is too long.

1426
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:11,450
They just didn't air. It was, hey, I
got this. A pretty good fight story.

1427
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:16,451
I was in the fourth grade and I were
playing kickball and it was a close game

1428
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:21,860
and kickball and the bell wrong with
someone had kicked a bond and people were

1429
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:22,910
running in and it was like,

1430
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:26,150
well the game's over the bell
wrong dude is still running in.

1431
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:30,800
There was an argument and there was argued
with a fifth grader and his name was

1432
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:34,730
Enrique and I was a fourth grader and
we got an each other's faces. Fuck you.

1433
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:36,470
The bill. Wrong bottle. We won.

1434
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:42,040
And the guy just fucking swift kicked
me right in the balls tied to my knees.

1435
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:45,680
The guy could kick my ass already.
Like I was already afraid of him.

1436
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:48,260
I don't know why it was a hurricane.
There was a an important kickball game.

1437
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,560
I dropped to my knees.
Super important, so hard.

1438
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,740
All I did is look up and I just
gave him the finger. I said,

1439
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:01,980
and then I got up and just walked up to
the nurse's office and so I was really

1440
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:04,800
fucked. So he poked you? I
was crying, I was crying.

1441
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:09,120
I walked into the nerve nurse's office
crying in the nurse's office still.

1442
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:13,320
And it was that stinging pain more than
it was the ball point tip of the Dick.

1443
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,430
Like I should've been bleeding as I pest.
I should have been.

1444
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:22,080
So the nurse sends me home. It was so
bad. I'm a crier was I was humiliated.

1445
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,410
And then I find out in the wants to
kick my ass or flipping them off,

1446
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:31,290
but ruthless. But he's going to
have a sport grader, brother,

1447
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:34,020
US CSR do it for me.

1448
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:37,710
So now I've got to fight his brother
because I flipped him off. This guy,

1449
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:41,550
I didn't do shit to him. He kicked me in
the balls. So I'm fucking freaking out.

1450
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,790
My brother, the fights going to
happen. Me and SAS are eventually,

1451
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,590
so my brother's teaching me how to box.

1452
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,330
So we put on some socks around our fist
and he showed me how to sew punches and

1453
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:54,510
I thought, you know what, fuck I
could throw punches. I felt confident.

1454
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,180
So we ran into each other
at the, uh, in a, in a, uh,

1455
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:03,090
playground at school. And we got on
each other's faces. And I said, fuck,

1456
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,600
just hit him. Just hit him, just hit
him. I was like, I trained for this.

1457
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,370
I had confidence and says,
I've got on my train for those.

1458
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:11,520
You flipped off my brother,
you mother fucker.

1459
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:15,630
And I just punched him right in
the fucking stomach and nothing.

1460
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:19,020
He just stood there. I looked
at him, I said, fuck it.

1461
01:30:19,021 --> 01:30:22,500
And I just took off and he chased me.
So he's running,

1462
01:30:22,501 --> 01:30:26,730
we're running through the school. All the
kids are watching and he's chasing me.

1463
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:31,590
And I'm rolling, man. Until we ran
and I saw the principal, we ran it,

1464
01:30:31,591 --> 01:30:35,730
the principal, he stopped us and
he made us do push ups and uh,

1465
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:40,450
and the principal, or maybe you
do pushups for money. We were,

1466
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,320
we weren't supposed to be running
through the playground like that.

1467
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,270
He didn't know that this guy
was trying to kick my ass.

1468
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:48,200
He thought we were playing tag
or something. Oh, that's so,

1469
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,970
so we're doing ups there and he's looking
at me cause I'm going to fuck you up.

1470
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:52,570
And like foam mat.

1471
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,340
I had confidence but it didn't
do anything. I punched him with,

1472
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,400
I threw the first punch in the
stomach thing, threw the first punch.

1473
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:04,650
That sounds like a bad idea.
Exactly.

1474
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:09,330
And I just ran and I ran and he chased me.
But you know what?

1475
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,860
We never ended up
fighting. Uh, it was, um,

1476
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,970
I don't know if he gained respect
for me after that. I'm not sure.

1477
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:19,180
But we never ended up fighting.
But Paige vanzant blow it height.

1478
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:24,270
She's blowing up one fight. She's number
seven contender to fights each other.

1479
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:28,440
That's right. Two fights.
Number seven. Whoa.

1480
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:31,340
Women's division was impressed
with her fight with Felice Harris.

1481
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,660
She's the judge. She is a fucking
scram. She's a one two cutie pie.

1482
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:42,000
The scrambles Mapper Young,
Huh? 21. Yeah. Damn Brendan.

1483
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:46,630
Ridiculous. And she's turned,

1484
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:48,660
it sends signals out.
Oh,

1485
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:52,510
I'm done with dating UFC
ladies the big brown.

1486
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:58,260
I'm like Walmart with Rhonda, his book,
I don't need that shit in my life.

1487
01:31:58,261 --> 01:31:59,800
I'm good man.
You know,

1488
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:05,650
she talks and she taught me, she never
mentioned any names but that wasn't,

1489
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,900
you need to be mentioned.

1490
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,490
I just heard all the fans tell him he
had a Honda is so fucking huge right now.

1491
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:17,320
You go to the underground,
every third thread is about Rhonda.

1492
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:21,700
Rhonda has superstar. Yeah.
How was that possible?

1493
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:25,120
People are still like
maybe three years ago,

1494
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,840
all over the Internet saying women's
MMA will never be big, blah, blah, blah.

1495
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:31,690
This and that. I'll never watch
women's fights and look at Rhonda.

1496
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:36,520
She's arguably the most popular MMA
fighter on the planet. Right? 100% she's,

1497
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:37,090
she's,

1498
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:41,680
she's attractive and she's finishing
girls and 17 second girls that don't know

1499
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:45,130
anything or girls that aren't MMA fans.
They know who Ronda Rousey.

1500
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:48,250
She's crossed over to pop culture
cause she's an entourage. She's in.

1501
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:53,590
Whenever expendables 19 Misha said she
would be willing to fight Cyborg at one

1502
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:57,700
40 Misha said that Sony's has talked to
me, Hsa. Somebody has to sit her down.

1503
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,190
She's in at that I knocked loose,
that's like,

1504
01:33:06,270 --> 01:33:09,900
you know, which I never noticed
them. I'm not being honest,

1505
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,210
but I mean I'm being totally
honest. I used to go, dude,

1506
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:16,090
I used to date a girl at a lazy eye
and I had a lazy eye fetish for awhile.

1507
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:23,400
She was a freak and she was so hot.
It just conditioned to hear.

1508
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:27,490
She was super, super hot and
she had a lazy eye and my head,

1509
01:33:27,491 --> 01:33:29,320
I was like maybe like the lazy eye.

1510
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:32,630
It makes her try harder
because she doesn't want you
to bring up the lazy iron,

1511
01:33:32,631 --> 01:33:35,890
so she just goes for it.
She's wonderful hot chick.

1512
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:41,690
He gets, I all fucked up. You don't know
if she was looking at your Dick or, well,

1513
01:33:41,691 --> 01:33:46,570
it wasn't that Lazy Shit. That's not lazy.
That's palsy. That's a Paul the, I know.

1514
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:49,780
She just had one eye that was like
a little goofy and it was sexy.

1515
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,330
I don't know why I didn't read Ron
his book. You wouldn't read it.

1516
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,430
Read it 50 times already

1517
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:01,310
about reading anyone's biography neither.
I'm all set on that. I mean, I've,

1518
01:34:01,311 --> 01:34:02,860
I've read biographies in the past,

1519
01:34:02,861 --> 01:34:06,970
but you have to do some fucking Nikola
Tesla Shit to get me to read your

1520
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:09,490
biography. If every, some epic shit.

1521
01:34:09,491 --> 01:34:14,440
I'm all set on reading fighters
so much about her, her a career,

1522
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,570
you know. Oh Shit. Mark
Munoz. Yeah. They play here.

1523
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:20,980
Count down every other weekend if
she's fighting or not. I'm all set.

1524
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,720
Powerful. Mark Munoz. I really
do. I mean, I really do hope
he wins this. Me Too, man.

1525
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:28,660
Such a good guy.
Literally the nicest guy ever.

1526
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:32,500
I just like to see him go
out with a victory and that's
already beat Damien Maia

1527
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:37,480
tat was, uh, Abu Dhabi. The Tim
Boetsch one was a big win. Huge win.

1528
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:41,350
He's coming off two losses. Yeah.
And then, and then he got Leo.

1529
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:45,970
I'm a cheat on short notice. He
got kicked in the face. Yeah.

1530
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:50,800
And Moose Saucy beat his ass. Tom
saucy looked really good in that fight.

1531
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:54,610
And then I hope he wins
this big and keeps fighting.

1532
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:56,910
Pawn Carnero just choked him out.
I

1533
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:02,120
Hood Barnett just lose too.
I thought I was surprised by that.

1534
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:05,710
I thought that he's lost two by decision.

1535
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:11,600
By not wants to, yeah. You know, mark
a shutdown, a reign training center.

1536
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:15,800
Rain is no more. Yeah, he's,
he's retired, right? Yeah.

1537
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:19,620
But it doesn't mean you have to shut
down the gym. Really expensive download.

1538
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:22,880
Is that what it is in suits?
Well for mark it was just,

1539
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,260
he just wants time with his family.
Like you said,

1540
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,430
I think he's sick of being in the game.
Well, like when you say real expensive,

1541
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:33,020
like how much per square foot? Oh
Shit. Not where he's at. Eddie.

1542
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:37,520
I don't think 50th. Really? I don't
know what you're looking at. Me.

1543
01:35:37,530 --> 01:35:39,770
I'm asking this because you looked
at a bunch of places, right?

1544
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,910
Like you're looking at, uh, places.
I have never looked down there.

1545
01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:48,230
That's too far down south. Okay. I
don't know what it would shut. I just,

1546
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:50,920
that's what I heard people were saying,
why did he shut it down by Blah, blah,

1547
01:35:50,921 --> 01:35:53,590
blah, blah, blah. Then people will just
not killers, they expensive. He just,

1548
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:58,470
the time commitment was a beast was taken
away from his family. How he lost it.

1549
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:03,200
Lodge Roger Narvaez. Yeah,
that's what it was by that.

1550
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:08,640
And then before that he lost
a Sean Strickland. Dale. Yeah.

1551
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,750
Two split decisions in a row.

1552
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:18,280
But before that he beat
Matt Nelson and uh,

1553
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:23,660
Andrew Craig. That's a
tall order for Luke. Yeah.

1554
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:27,140
Luke's a favorite and that's,
I think is he really,

1555
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:32,690
well that's just because Munoz has
lost a bunch. Just monsters though.

1556
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,010
That's fucking monsters. Machita Musashi's
a far cry. You know what I'm saying?

1557
01:36:37,011 --> 01:36:39,490
To the competition that
Luke's been facing. Sure.

1558
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:42,090
Mark's thing is he gets so
out of shape him between camp,

1559
01:36:42,091 --> 01:36:46,460
so his camps spent just get them to lose
weight instead of focus on my game plan

1560
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:50,660
and then he's running a gym and then
he has whatever, 19 million kids,

1561
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:54,260
you know what I'm saying? So the dude
was always like worn out. How many kids?

1562
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,510
He has like seven. I think he's set six
or seven. The entire population of Canada,

1563
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:04,130
19 million. It's all, those are all
my kids. Again caught of our time.

1564
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:06,640
He's like fucking Sean camp.
That's what he does, man.

1565
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:11,540
How many kids is Sean camp had shit.

1566
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:15,440
I mean not 15 and like 15
baby mamas. Really? Yeah. Wow.

1567
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:20,130
It's so crazy. What are you, you, you'd
think after three baby mommas that, gosh,

1568
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:25,220
I bet this shit rich that he probably
thinks is 90 more cause he broke.

1569
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:28,010
I'm sure Sean camp 15 baby mamas,

1570
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:31,820
but that guy made like a sports bar.
I went to a sports bar in Seattle.

1571
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:35,000
It was shit. Hey, I'm going
to Google. Sean camp broke.

1572
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:39,650
What do you mean he needs to shitty worn
down from his chambers bay as a sports

1573
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:40,960
bar.
His sports bar

1574
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:46,820
we'll change was rough looking 50,000
women and got only a couple of them

1575
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:50,110
pregnant interest. Good record. Yeah.

1576
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:54,790
How it was still wilt the still,
he's retired. Shawn's retiring shot.

1577
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:55,703
Super retired,

1578
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:59,730
but that's not good because when you
have all that money that you have to put

1579
01:37:59,731 --> 01:38:00,510
out and then you home,

1580
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:05,510
none of it's coming in and you also
like shiny things like shiny things and

1581
01:38:05,851 --> 01:38:08,760
fatty acids. It's a dangerous
Combo, man. It gets ugly.

1582
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:12,900
You can buy Shawn Kemp socks now
from stance. Oh, that's true. Right.

1583
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:17,220
Sean Candace Seattle Supersonics. I'll
take a pair of those persons is not broke.

1584
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:22,720
He didn't sort of broke like, but he
gets like some crazy annuity. Right?

1585
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:25,020
He's not that, that documentary is
coming out. I just got interviewed.

1586
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:28,860
He said that's just a myth and like he's
doing just fine but wasn't there like

1587
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:32,730
him begging for money? It was total
bullshit says that's not true.

1588
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:36,240
Well there's difference between like
regular person broken famous broke.

1589
01:38:36,241 --> 01:38:38,940
Cause Mc Hammer told me like, you're
almost like, oh mc hammer went broke.

1590
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:40,930
He was like,
I wasn't broke us at three mills.

1591
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:45,600
Shawn Kemp made $92 million.
Well, the crazy eyes here,

1592
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:50,150
how he lost his clothes,
but here it says how he lost it all.

1593
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:55,740
Yeah,
he bought Iraqi dinars so he is broke.

1594
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:00,650
Um, this is a shitty
website here. It says, um,

1595
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:06,060
okay read the story of Sean Camp could
potentially save you $100 billion.

1596
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:11,330
The sonics forward fathered at least
seven children by six women lost most of

1597
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:15,540
his career earnings to child support
is post NBA life has included failed,

1598
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:15,961
come back,

1599
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:20,850
attempt multiple drug possession arrests
and the ultimate athlete rock bottom,

1600
01:39:20,851 --> 01:39:25,851
playing against a stocky sales
reps on pros versus joes ish.

1601
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:31,200
Wow. Okay. This is just a dickhead
website. This is a dickhead website.

1602
01:39:31,201 --> 01:39:35,520
They're trying to be snarky. Do you
remember Cromarty and his kid? Oh yeah.

1603
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:38,460
Oh yeah. Well he had five and
five, right? Way More than that.

1604
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:41,370
12 or something like that.
He's the only five. Dude,

1605
01:39:41,371 --> 01:39:43,890
you're fucked when you have different
baby mamas and you got to pay him and he

1606
01:39:43,891 --> 01:39:45,550
got it. Because you've got
to maintain that lifestyle.

1607
01:39:45,551 --> 01:39:47,820
It's your income at the
tub. Right. But it's also,

1608
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:50,640
it's not just one woman
that has all your kids,

1609
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:53,540
which would probably be better for them.
No,

1610
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,380
they say this the fast way to go broke.

1611
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:03,240
Bad idea, man. Wrap it
up. I'll get tricked.

1612
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:07,260
Some dudes just don't give a fuck.
Just none in people.

1613
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,050
But how many can I say? You have
six kids. Just like, what the fuck?

1614
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,530
Yeah. Well, it's just,
I think some people,

1615
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:21,300
it's like part of the fun doc and
chicks have been life on the edge.

1616
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:25,450
I think they like it. You know that
you'd have to after after four years,

1617
01:40:25,451 --> 01:40:26,430
just like fuck this

1618
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,930
looks relaxed and happy cause he looks
the last time he's going to walk out

1619
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:35,160
there. I was just so, you know mark real
well. So the, the grind of the training,

1620
01:40:35,161 --> 01:40:40,110
it's just real hard on him. Mom Super
hard. And He uh, he just blows up, man.

1621
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:43,830
Why does he blow up? What
does he, he loves to eat. What
does he eat? And he's like,

1622
01:40:43,831 --> 01:40:44,670
Filipino food.

1623
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:49,580
He's eating like shitload of rice and
fucking so he's going to get good marks.

1624
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,180
He retires, Huh? Oh,

1625
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:55,300
I would be willing to bet mark
will be 300 pounds and three years.

1626
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:59,050
If I was a betting man, which I am
all of a sudden get in the ring.

1627
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:01,170
It was like Pam, he's almost
Siemens show it. Right.

1628
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:05,620
He was checked out and boom is,
he's in the ring and there's tall Luke.

1629
01:41:07,210 --> 01:41:10,300
Yeah. Help me. That was my, that Luke.
It isn't that weird. Super Weird,

1630
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:14,110
but it was just weird how they just did
that because they showed him like taking

1631
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:17,370
his jacket off and then like
within a second he was in the rank.

1632
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,430
That must've been switching.
She's my cage. The octagon.

1633
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:26,140
Yeah man. Uh, Mark Mark, he did.
His thing is, is he's always just,

1634
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:28,600
he's losing all this
weight given shaping camps.

1635
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:29,890
They can't focus on the game plan.

1636
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,720
Like we would spar and he would be doing
like a six mile run before in covenant

1637
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:38,770
spar. Like what do you do in men? This
Sparwood just shit. Just to lose the word.

1638
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,060
Yeah, because he'd have to loose
weight, spar and then do the run.

1639
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:44,500
He would want to train it.

1640
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:48,100
You'd have to run after two and you'd
have come back at night to reign and do

1641
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:51,970
conditioning. Cause he, he was so behind
the weight all the time. That's so crazy.

1642
01:41:51,971 --> 01:41:54,280
That will beat you up.
Yeah man. He was exhausted.

1643
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:58,030
That's terrible for you
or injured all the time.

1644
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,580
Then he was injured all cause the
body gets worn out. It probably,

1645
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:04,480
overtraining tried to lose that weight.
You need to go to fucking Yoga Sun,

1646
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:07,450
get some hot yoga in your lab.
That to get some yoga in my life today,

1647
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,890
I'm a big fan all sudden again.
I haven't taken a yoga class in years.

1648
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:14,020
And then I took two this week.

1649
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:18,730
I'm loving it and he stepped my game up.
There's so much yoga where I'm at too.

1650
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,890
Yeah, there is. That's yoga central.

1651
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:25,350
It is the west side to buy a mat.
It's all fucking full obs,

1652
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:30,360
lemon pants. So flip flops
and big acids to Powell. Yeah,

1653
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,630
I'm not mad at that, but I'll tell you
what man. That whole yoga booty not real.

1654
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,840
Okay. Like you kind of get a little
bit of a, but you want to get a,

1655
01:42:37,841 --> 01:42:42,610
but you got to do deep squats. You lazy
but hit them. Squats, squats. Well squats,

1656
01:42:42,611 --> 01:42:45,500
dead lifts and don't let anybody tell
you any different. Oh, I have my,

1657
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:50,020
I have my girls squat and shit. Shit,
loads or rice. Just build that ass.

1658
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:54,790
Just not a carb. The time,
just carb load for that.

1659
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,680
Here we go. Come on Marky mark.
Let's see that donkey. Fast,

1660
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:03,550
fast and tall. Light on the feet.
They said he's six. Six. Good Lord.

1661
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:06,760
It's a tall drink of water. Light
on his feet. He does. It looks good.

1662
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:09,640
It looks good on his feet here.
I like Luke a lot, but I really,

1663
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:11,410
he has a whole career ahead of monies and

1664
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:16,900
Munoz is going to be super
motivated coming into this.

1665
01:43:16,901 --> 01:43:19,090
Don't not want to go on that now.
Hell No.

1666
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:23,830
Munoz got some fucking real power man.
Real power

1667
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:30,310
dude. His wrestling and transitions
nasty. So train with them two weeks ago.

1668
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:34,090
He's looking great. Did he come into
this camp overweight as well? No,

1669
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:36,680
he came in better shape. This
camp. Oh, we just had a knee. Oh,

1670
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:40,880
he's getting [inaudible]. Oh Shit.
It's not going to happen, mark. No,

1671
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:46,210
he's a beast. Was guilty. He's
transitioning. Move in. Oh Luke.

1672
01:43:46,270 --> 01:43:50,710
Very gooey mark down here as a
monster man. But Luke so long.

1673
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,680
Yeah.
Look,

1674
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,680
mark has been going with Kendall
growth to get ready for how long he is.

1675
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:55,573
Oh really?
Yep.

1676
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:59,220
Perfect training apartment mark is
nasty with his ground and pound ground

1677
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:02,660
pounding. It's absolutely fucking
ferocious and he's sick. Wrestler,

1678
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,510
dragged him to the ground.
Who this is?

1679
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:10,190
This is Mark's fucking home base here
against the cage on the side here.

1680
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:11,240
He's so good man.

1681
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:14,780
Okay.

1682
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:17,790
Lukey so long and tall. And Lucas
from England, right? So yeah.

1683
01:44:18,010 --> 01:44:21,470
Doesn't have a background in wrestling,
but he's trained that alliance,

1684
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:26,360
so he's going some tough guy. Right?
Alliance is a fucking Hell of a gym, Huh?

1685
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:30,080
Hell yeah. But they really put together
some camp down there in San Diego.

1686
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:31,183
Yeah,
they did.

1687
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:37,160
Oh Shit. We got per cut then
he's going to shoot. Oh,

1688
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,660
he's just trouble.
Trouble. He's in trouble.

1689
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:45,150
Mark with under underhook
trouble. Well, look with, oh,

1690
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,150
you tagged them again? Well, you're
my boy mark. Just feeling it.

1691
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:50,423
Don't hit a knee.

1692
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:55,730
Take them down. Marky mark. Good Body
Shot. Yeah. Oh, you own down son.

1693
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:00,440
Oh, nice. I was nice. Mark.

1694
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:06,890
Get them outside. He's so good here,
man. It's right there. Oh, missed it all.

1695
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:11,000
Mark worked on his cage work. It's
does. He just does tons of cage work.

1696
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,090
He's so good against the cage.
Organizes his camp.

1697
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,920
And why did they ever
let him get that fat?

1698
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,370
That's the prom with mark running
reign training center for a long time.

1699
01:45:19,371 --> 01:45:22,010
Mark was doing everything.
He was running his own camps too.

1700
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:25,400
He's running his own camp and then he'd
coach me and whoever else was in there

1701
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:29,060
while during his camp and when mark was
fighting Weidman, I told mark, I said,

1702
01:45:29,061 --> 01:45:30,890
hey mark, what do you think?
Why these doing right now?

1703
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:33,440
You think he's coaching other guys
is he's getting ready for you.

1704
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:38,690
But mark just loves it, man. He loves
the give back is such a nice guy,

1705
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:42,370
but it caught up with them. So,
um, what do they do with rain?

1706
01:45:42,371 --> 01:45:45,380
They just closed the doors. It's all,
yeah, they closed the doors. Oh Shit.

1707
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,130
He's hurting a man who keeps her room.
Look at these.

1708
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:51,050
You drag them right back down the Alaska.

1709
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:54,720
Him Now mark was growler cane with cog.

1710
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:59,420
Well his ground upon is like at a very
high low. That was a big right hand man.

1711
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:04,970
Oh Shit. Hammers that. He's on fire
right now. How can you not be men? Yeah.

1712
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:08,780
Oh, we just got to watch
that. I watch shows up,

1713
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:13,770
kicks watching like he's trying
to go della Hiva on him. Oh,

1714
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:17,810
just barely miss and Marky mark. Oh
God. He's gotta be careful. Yeah.

1715
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:22,450
That knee and the transition.
That'd be heartbreaking, man. Yeah,

1716
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:26,630
he's looking so good right now. This
class afield. Davidson Barnett's corner.

1717
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:31,550
Yeah. It's kind of too late to have that
good of a wrestling coach if you can't

1718
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:35,570
wrestle. You know what I'm saying? Can who
do that? That makes me laugh. Why is it,

1719
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:40,230
oh, you said that he took him
down. He did a great trail.

1720
01:46:40,330 --> 01:46:44,810
I'll look at that. Look at that.
Beautiful escape. I Munoz. Oh Shit.

1721
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,900
Ooh.
He's hurting a minute ago.

1722
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:00,580
Body. He's walking him down. Look at this.

1723
01:47:00,610 --> 01:47:02,510
Completely walking him down.
Hands up.

1724
01:47:02,511 --> 01:47:05,300
Marky mark is too long
to be doing that shit.

1725
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:10,233
Okay.

1726
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:12,480
Barnett is exhausted. How's marks? Cardio?

1727
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,540
Pretty good know we have
that wrestling background,

1728
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:20,120
especially when it comes to grappling
and grapple all damn day just in his DNA.

1729
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:22,800
So He's got to start coaching wrestling.
Is that what he's going to do?

1730
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:24,840
He does wrestling camp.
Oh,

1731
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:29,220
he does wrestling camps and then his son's
a stud wrestler and he wants to focus

1732
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:34,130
on his family. Man. What is he going to
do for a living? That's a good point.

1733
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,810
It's a great question,
Joe. You got 100 kids.

1734
01:47:38,811 --> 01:47:41,210
You've got to really take that
into consideration. 19 million.

1735
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:45,800
Joe is not like he um, made enough
money from his UFC career to retire.

1736
01:47:45,801 --> 01:47:50,360
He absolutely not. And then you're
giving up your school. Well,

1737
01:47:50,361 --> 01:47:54,680
his school, was it making money? Not the
money pit was it? He was losing myself.

1738
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:59,270
It's hard, but he, you know, he
does, he does speaking engagements.

1739
01:47:59,271 --> 01:48:02,900
He gets paid for that. Yeah, he does all
that. He does an anti bullying program.

1740
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:06,150
He does wrestling camps.
I'm sure mark Mark's a smart guy.

1741
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:08,480
He's wife's super smart.
I'm sure she's going to help him out.

1742
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:11,960
I'm sure he has a plan. Guarantee it.
I hope so. I just don't know the plan.

1743
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:19,150
So Blue Barn had loses.
Is he out three and out?

1744
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:23,320
Is that the rule or is that not only guy?
Depends on the guy.

1745
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:25,570
It also depends on what the
fight looks like. You know,

1746
01:48:25,571 --> 01:48:29,230
if you fights like this wild crazy ass
fight that might keep them around just

1747
01:48:29,231 --> 01:48:29,740
because it's,

1748
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:34,240
I mean it takes two to tango guy
was willing to throw down like that.

1749
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:38,650
Like that was what kept Dan Hardee around
and Dan Hardee was losing it was like,

1750
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:43,060
yeah, he might be losing, but this
mother fucker throw Garcia. Oh yeah.

1751
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,640
I mean he lost a shit load of fights.

1752
01:48:45,641 --> 01:48:50,200
I think foreign row five row Leonard
Garcia would throw rocks. Every premise.

1753
01:48:50,201 --> 01:48:55,090
Hips throwing rocks, just old
school from his hips, right? Yeah.

1754
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,180
He was wild. And here we go. Round dose

1755
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:05,170
in the Philippines. He's got some Super
Filipino power being in the Philippines,

1756
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:08,470
fight in his last fight, nicknames,
a Filipino wrecking machine.

1757
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,730
When went the crowds like their
first big UFC in the Philippines,

1758
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:16,660
first UFC ever in the Philippines. It's
probably not quiet like the rest of Asia,

1759
01:49:16,661 --> 01:49:19,810
right? Yeah. But it's different,
but it's different. Yeah,

1760
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:23,260
definitely that like a hand, right? Yeah.
Well is there a different kind of Asian,

1761
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:25,330
it's interesting.
It's Spanish and Filipino.

1762
01:49:25,331 --> 01:49:29,020
They all have like Spanish last name
or excuse me, finish and Chinese.

1763
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:30,940
They have Spanish last names.

1764
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:35,950
It's like a lot of really similar
like, uh, like one of the,

1765
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:37,690
the greatest pool player of all times.

1766
01:49:37,691 --> 01:49:40,330
The guy named Efren Reyes
from the Philippines.

1767
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:42,720
But I mean that sounds like a Mexican.
Yeah.

1768
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:46,870
Afrin Raeann Mexican Mark
Munoz friends Mexican. Yeah.

1769
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,020
Booster

1770
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:48,853
is another guy.

1771
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,380
Munoz with the clinch

1772
01:49:55,210 --> 01:50:00,000
fucking cardio man is so much of fighting.
That magnified.

1773
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:02,830
Proved that, huh? True.
That skills for sure.

1774
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,860
But the limb that came out and tried
to win that fight in the first round,

1775
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:09,460
not the same limb,
so tall,

1776
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:15,860
so tall and well coached. Oh Shit.
Gotta be careful. Those fuck the elbows.

1777
01:50:16,190 --> 01:50:19,720
Brown elbow. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He
said the kind of the blueprint for that

1778
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:26,890
is keeps tagging Munoz
too. Oh, she, no. Oh Shit.

1779
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:32,260
You know, fight people are talking
about on that DC card is a Oh,

1780
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:36,190
[inaudible] brown.
Oh yes.

1781
01:50:36,870 --> 01:50:41,290
That card. Oh my God. A card is
so insane. That card so insane.

1782
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:43,660
It's like there's too much to talk about.

1783
01:50:43,661 --> 01:50:48,520
Donald Cerrone moaning on the air against
who had to get a replacement. Who,

1784
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:52,900
who's just reflect Canadian
cap from Tristar. Oh yeah.
John Mc Dessie. Yeah. Yeah,

1785
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:55,600
because Habib number Grumet.
I've heard his knee again.

1786
01:50:56,570 --> 01:51:00,640
Pet has hurt his fucking arm. Really
bad man. His elbow, right? It's his arm.

1787
01:51:00,641 --> 01:51:03,130
His fucking mangled.
He got taken down.

1788
01:51:03,131 --> 01:51:07,450
His arm got trapped in the cage like
during the take down these you got some

1789
01:51:07,451 --> 01:51:11,170
pretty significant damage.
It's a bummer. Yeah,

1790
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:16,060
it's a real low. The uptake
was to touch the triangle. Yes.

1791
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:22,420
Munoz is really good ground and pound
from the guard to, yeah, really good.

1792
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,740
His passing is getting good too.

1793
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:27,700
He's been working with Casey Halstead
from 10th planet, Costa Mesa a lot,

1794
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:32,530
so we got to get a 10 plan in an Austin,
bro. I don't decide where my schools go.

1795
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,020
They just, the city's designed,
you know what I'm saying?

1796
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:40,021
There has to be some dude who's obsessed
with mastering the 10th planet system

1797
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:45,640
and whatever, and his mission in
life has to be to open up a school.

1798
01:51:45,641 --> 01:51:47,290
Those are the only guys
that can pull it off. Yeah.

1799
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:49,790
You're not doing them halfassed
yeah. Yeah. You can't go to like,

1800
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:53,610
I need to anybody interested in
doing this 10th planet stuff.

1801
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,660
It's a good system done by you.
You can't sell it.

1802
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,740
You got to have someone that's already
into it while just get someone who's into

1803
01:51:59,741 --> 01:52:04,300
it and our sell Austin to them
about work. Do you want to train?

1804
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:08,100
Is that what's going on? But yeah, it'd
be fun man. Todd whites down there. Yeah,

1805
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:11,080
I'm going to do a seminar. They're pretty
Santiago. I, it's helped me up at school.

1806
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:14,650
You met Todd white before.
Nice famous artists. Dude,

1807
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:19,210
the great dude want to John Jocks, black
belts, old training partner of mine.

1808
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,320
He just moved to Austin and he loves it
there, man. He's raving to me about it.

1809
01:52:23,321 --> 01:52:27,430
People Love Austin. Huh? To great town.
It's one of the best towns. Got Country,

1810
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,560
man. I played football there, but
I've never like hung out. You ever uh,

1811
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:36,850
do the Alex Jones show now he's ever
brought John and I see him all the time

1812
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:41,680
though. You see it just randomly.
He's super marketing. Are you serious?

1813
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:46,310
No, I see him. He's downtown a lot.
Does he recognize you? Yeah. Yeah.

1814
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,510
He's an interesting dude. He's
all divorced up now. What? Yeah.

1815
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:55,490
He got an apartment in a building that I
didn't know he got divorced helicopters.

1816
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:59,450
Wow.
He's a wild man now.

1817
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:06,610
What are the weirdest things ever
was listening to an Alex Jones,

1818
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:09,520
a voicemail on my phone
when we were in Vegas.

1819
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:14,400
We were hammered the night before
just listening to my messages.

1820
01:53:14,410 --> 01:53:19,330
It's Alex, Jonah, Eddie, uh, I dunno
what you guys are doing. I can't do that.

1821
01:53:19,331 --> 01:53:22,140
Alex Jones. It goes all the
last time. I was pretty crazy.

1822
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,520
You guys are going to get breakfast.
What time should we meet for the fight?

1823
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:32,290
We brought them to the UFC and kind of
highest fuck up block cookies. Oh Man.

1824
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:35,080
You know that guy. That guy is. I was,

1825
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:38,170
I was wondering if he'd be sick of
talking about conspiracy theories. Like,

1826
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,520
I mean he does a show where he'll talk.

1827
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:43,900
Conspiracy comes fucking thoughts me.

1828
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:50,140
He wouldn't stop. He won't stop you
love. I loved it. Every question.

1829
01:53:50,141 --> 01:53:52,510
I had some document.

1830
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:59,440
Well we have the documents if you go
back to, but when Truman was an office,

1831
01:53:59,441 --> 01:54:02,980
this is all put into place and
I'd ask him about that. Back then.

1832
01:54:02,981 --> 01:54:03,820
I was really into,

1833
01:54:03,821 --> 01:54:07,680
I was super into Ufo and stuff back
then and I was asking him about that.

1834
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:11,920
He goes, if he was into it and he's like,
that stuff that we can't prove it. I'm,

1835
01:54:11,921 --> 01:54:16,900
I'm, I'm focusing on what we can do right
now with the people, the United States.

1836
01:54:16,901 --> 01:54:18,550
I'm not focused on space,

1837
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:24,310
focus on the government and Tam and
he like to talk about space, you know,

1838
01:54:24,311 --> 01:54:27,190
you don't killed, you. Oppose
for me is ancient aliens.

1839
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,260
After a couple of seasons of that,
I'm like,

1840
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,070
I don't ever want to see
anything on Ufo was again,

1841
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:35,230
you know what killed it for me is
talking to people. And when I did that,

1842
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:38,710
Joe Rogan questions, everything, you
know, talk to the experts. I was like,

1843
01:54:38,711 --> 01:54:42,100
where's the evidence you got now you guys
got enough and no one has any, nothing

1844
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,170
massive evidence that's about,
there's massive evidence,

1845
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:52,000
but we don't have the cameras to film.
Like, it's always like, you know,

1846
01:54:52,001 --> 01:54:55,940
there's always these new films if you
will fall as you get on youtube every day.

1847
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:59,810
Bullshit.
But would have,

1848
01:54:59,910 --> 01:55:04,120
it's what they actually were spacious.
What would it actually look like?

1849
01:55:04,121 --> 01:55:05,620
It would look like a little dot.

1850
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:09,310
No one has cameras that can
capture shit the government does.

1851
01:55:09,311 --> 01:55:10,570
And I think honestly,

1852
01:55:10,571 --> 01:55:13,570
if someone can come here from an o
clock and planet damn big right here,

1853
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,220
someone can come here from another planet.

1854
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:17,570
They could be a rubber Dick and the Scott

1855
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:22,810
silver shift. It could be cloud, it
could be anything to be in total. No one,

1856
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:25,090
it looks sensible.
Assume what it looks like.

1857
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:29,440
They're really close to making
an actual cloaking device now.

1858
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:33,700
Like if you ever see those
Japanese jackets where the
entire jacket like films,

1859
01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:38,170
what's behind it? Yeah. Like it's so it's
amazing. Somebody should impossible. Yeah.

1860
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:41,510
Like you are wearing a jacket, right?
And the jacket literally will be, uh,

1861
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,980
an accurate representation of behind you.

1862
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,220
And it's like real crew technology.
It's like a screen,

1863
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:48,510
like your jag would be a screen,

1864
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:52,080
like say if we were looking at you and
your chicken head shirt was in fact that

1865
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:56,040
the background, the camera, the
whole thing. But it's behind you.

1866
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:59,220
Like Dave Verde figured out how to do
that, but it's kind of crude. Well.

1867
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:02,100
Eventually there'll be able to do it
where it's indiscernible from the sky,

1868
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,490
like you'll be moving through the sky.
Like Predator members.

1869
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:06,810
The creditor has that Shit. He
would just, it would wiggle,

1870
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:09,690
but you'd see the wiggling.
I think they're going to have that.

1871
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:14,550
You know that kind of technology for
sure within the next decade or two and

1872
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:18,780
aliens probably have that. If they can
get here, please give it up on the screen.

1873
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:20,790
Look at it up there. This
is pretty dope. Look,

1874
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:22,500
this guy's got this thing on this cape.

1875
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:25,740
Now Watch what happens when they
turn it on. It's pretty slick, man.

1876
01:56:25,950 --> 01:56:30,810
The guy standing there with this thing
and it allows them to project everything

1877
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:34,780
that's behind it. I don't need to
see all that. Yeah, here we go.

1878
01:56:34,781 --> 01:56:39,090
So look at this and that. Crazy. Look
at that. That's a real, it's not nuts.

1879
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,140
I mean I can for sure still see them,
but yeah, that's what's crude right now.

1880
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:46,110
But it's, it's going to get
to a point. Get there. Yeah.

1881
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:48,900
It's going to get to employ it in a few
decades where it works and they could

1882
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:51,900
put it on airplanes and shit. That
was pretty cool. That was pretty good.

1883
01:56:51,901 --> 01:56:53,820
Special Effects for back then in Predator.

1884
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:58,200
I can still watch that cause a lot
of that shit doesn't hold up at all.

1885
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:01,080
You can't watch clash of the titans
without it being silly right now.

1886
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:04,550
You watch a bunch of stuff like this,
some bullshit flutters legit,

1887
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:09,180
but I was just bummed out that they're
fucking, they're thermal technologies.

1888
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,520
So shitty. All you have to
do is cover yourself in mud.

1889
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:15,030
I know I can't see you come on son,
and you're still warm. I agree.

1890
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:19,050
They'll just get to be boring.
But what about of your eyeballs?

1891
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:23,130
That's the best [inaudible] ever see me.

1892
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:26,620
Come on and do it and you see me now.

1893
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:31,860
You guys seem mad, Max. I
heard it's amazing. I knew one,

1894
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,440
I heard the new ones in my,
like Tom Hart. Is it suck?

1895
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:39,630
I can't say that on a podcast.
Yes you can. A kid. Does it
suck? How bad is it? Suck.

1896
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:42,730
It's terrible. Oh my God.
Everybody says it's amazing.

1897
01:57:42,731 --> 01:57:47,520
I want to see a 90 on rotten tomatoes
the first time I saw it. Go see it then.

1898
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:51,540
Is it that bad? You know, we
probably have a lot of shit. He,

1899
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:55,020
Eddie Bravo and I do not agree on
movies. Some movies, some movies.

1900
01:57:55,021 --> 01:57:56,450
But when it comes to
like comic book movies,

1901
01:57:56,460 --> 01:57:59,850
this motherfucker hates it when you know
that the dude who's the star is going

1902
01:57:59,851 --> 01:58:03,390
to live. I can understand. I
can see that. I could see that.

1903
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:08,220
We would go to the movies. We
would go to Bloomie's. I fucking,

1904
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:10,980
I knew the whole time he was going to
be fine the whole time. I'm like, dude,

1905
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:13,150
it's a comic book movie.
Can't kill spider.

1906
01:58:13,151 --> 01:58:15,600
Run that killing iron
man in an iron man movie.

1907
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:19,390
So what's your favorite comic book?
Movie jokes?

1908
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:22,910
Like which some of your favorites. I'm
a big fan of the hulk. I love the hawk.

1909
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,760
Just cause I love the idea of a fucking
nerdy dude. Bad Max. Look at that.

1910
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:31,790
Nine out of 10 and IMD be 99% of
people move those things out dude.

1911
01:58:33,091 --> 01:58:36,960
It was terrible. It was like,
it was like the warriors,

1912
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:42,010
but instead of just killing Cyrus don't,
same day check

1913
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:46,870
his house. They took his house and then
now Cyrus is going after the warriors.

1914
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,790
He's alive now cause they took his
own. Tom Hardy. Does it make it go?

1915
01:58:49,791 --> 01:58:54,020
One of them was pregnant this
month of our warrior movie.

1916
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,150
That worry movie was dog shit.
How dare you,

1917
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:01,750
our friend Brian counts and then hear you
Jamie. You're not Mike. You fucked here.

1918
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:03,700
A guy named producer and
you're talking to the back.

1919
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:08,320
That was a terrible movie he was
in. Okay. What'd you say it? Oh,

1920
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:12,470
is it one of those? Uh, you had a side?
No, nondisclosure. Jamie goes to the,

1921
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:14,260
Jamie's one of those focus group people.

1922
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:17,590
Have you find out why movies get
changed to talk to Jamie to, okay,

1923
01:59:17,591 --> 01:59:20,810
I'm going to tell you one of those two.
Critical and shit. He loves that couple,

1924
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:23,890
I guess. Yeah, there's a guy,

1925
01:59:23,891 --> 01:59:28,810
there's like these different gangs
of a warrior. Oh look at this. Oh,

1926
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:31,870
Munoz with the takedown. Munoz.
Definitely one of this fight by the way.

1927
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,640
Three of three.
Yes.

1928
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:38,770
Eddie don't really mad max for me.
I'm not going to ruin it for her.

1929
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:41,240
I'm just going to tell you, don't get
tried to character. Do not get tray.

1930
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:45,220
There's a character who play there.
There's all these uh,

1931
01:59:46,140 --> 01:59:46,973
you know,

1932
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:51,250
a Dune buggies and all these cars with
all these guns and these warriors,

1933
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:54,070
they're like gangs,
right? And one gang has,

1934
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:58,840
they have a truck with all these apps
on it. A truck. There's a wall of amps,

1935
01:59:58,841 --> 02:00:01,990
a truck that the wall of amps and they
have a guy playing guitar in front.

1936
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,730
So whenever they go to battle,

1937
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:06,970
there's a guy in the front
of the trailer in the guitar.

1938
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:12,280
It makes me want to see it.
That sounds awesome.

1939
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:13,450
That sounds dope.

1940
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:20,230
The whole time you blanket and
it's like hit that truck of a wall.

1941
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,580
It's a truck with a wall of amps.
Oh my God.

1942
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:25,690
It's hanging in front of that sounds
amazing guitar. Yeah. I want to see that.

1943
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:28,180
Why is it that you sold?
That's great.

1944
02:00:28,220 --> 02:00:32,830
Thank [inaudible] on rotten
tomatoes. 99% I know, man.

1945
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:36,760
I don't know you a 1% or is that what's
going on? Yeah, it is. It sounds fucking,

1946
02:00:37,090 --> 02:00:40,860
it was just, you know what
if you, if you see it,

1947
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:45,130
I stay. I stayed. I didn't
think it was so ridiculous.

1948
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:47,650
It was like a cabin in
the woods type movie.

1949
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:50,830
It's so ridiculous that it's like,
well,

1950
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:55,060
you didn't go to it because you thought
it was realistic and shit. Right.

1951
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:57,870
I Love Tab.
I don't mind day.

1952
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:02,230
Are you the guy that goes to transformers
and like, I hate transform robots.

1953
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:06,490
Can't tell him I don't even go.
You're not going to catch me there.

1954
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:07,943
I'm not

1955
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:14,300
a movie about kids toys.
Robots.

1956
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:18,880
Oh, okay. Yeah, I agree.

1957
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:24,970
I haven't seen one of them transfer.
Need that Michael Bay.

1958
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:28,570
I'm sure he's getting mad pussy,
but I don't like his shit.

1959
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:32,100
I don't like that. End of that
shit. I don't know who did it.

1960
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:35,230
Did he do the Ninja Turtle movie? Who
did the Ninja Turtle? Michael Bay did.

1961
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:39,280
Nobody saw that shit. What
you saw three times? Always

1962
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,913
somebody to turtles.

1963
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,290
Ninja Turtles. My fucking
four year old. I'm not old.

1964
02:01:49,650 --> 02:01:53,630
She has Ninja Turtle. She's
awesome. She's awesome.

1965
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,870
I hear the same shit when I was a kid.
You guys are just older than me.

1966
02:01:56,990 --> 02:02:00,820
Ninja turtles or the fucking
just older than me. No,

1967
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:05,270
we're just not retarded. No.
Your turtles. Turtles Dude.

1968
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:09,620
Even if I was fucking 12 I wouldn't
be into a turtle. Yay. All right dude.

1969
02:02:09,621 --> 02:02:14,450
Cowabunga what the fuck?
Just no, no, no. They,

1970
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,420
they're,
they're business.

1971
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:20,360
They have a rat that hangs out with them
and he teaches her. Where did he learn?

1972
02:02:20,361 --> 02:02:22,150
He didn't even fucking say where
he learned it. Where's this?

1973
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:27,080
They did some fake Dojo. He's a MC
Dojo guy. Oh, he's like teaching kids.

1974
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,410
Whose teaching rats. Who is he training
with? Is he getting any sparring in?

1975
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,273
Oh yeah.

1976
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:36,680
This is the one thing not might
get back down to do with age.

1977
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:40,630
It could be eight years old.
I would think. Ninja turtles
are stupid. It's fucked.

1978
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:44,480
Do you know how long do you like Charlie
Brown? Charlie Brown. Oh wait, cartoon.

1979
02:02:44,481 --> 02:02:47,750
Did you grow up with? Um,
what did I really like?

1980
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:51,740
I was big on like the road
runner bugs bunny cartoons.

1981
02:02:51,741 --> 02:02:52,940
Cause it was a lot of violence.

1982
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:56,750
Super Love Ninja turtles
are fucking Ninja Turtles.

1983
02:02:56,751 --> 02:02:59,090
You know what's in their teenagers.
You know, it's interesting. I know,

1984
02:02:59,091 --> 02:03:00,860
I know you were into it, but
you know, it's interesting.

1985
02:03:00,861 --> 02:03:05,180
I've been watching the old, um, they
have all the old Popeye's on iTunes.

1986
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:09,080
Those are dope dude. They're
so fun. First of all,

1987
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,570
the style of animation is so weird.
Powerful.

1988
02:03:11,571 --> 02:03:16,540
Mark Munoz winter now to cry man. Cause
he's retiring right now for him. I hope.

1989
02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:19,790
I wish. I wish I could hear it.
Yeah. Crank it up. Jamie lives here.

1990
02:03:19,791 --> 02:03:21,080
So get back to Ninja Turtles.

1991
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:22,810
Cheers man.
Congratulations.

1992
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:26,903
It's not the car

1993
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:38,440
he speaks.
Tagalog is not fluid at all.

1994
02:03:38,570 --> 02:03:39,403
No.

1995
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:45,820
I want to say I love you.
My beautiful wife.

1996
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:49,180
It's gotta be a hard speech.
Right.

1997
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:58,030
You know, from the day when I was
a kid, I was watching cartoons.

1998
02:03:58,370 --> 02:04:00,980
Okay, this is going too long
already watching, cut him off

1999
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:06,640
the truck. That's a truck saying right
now for sure. His last fight, he don't,

2000
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:09,370
he don't give him the mic and you
don't let him talk about cartoons.

2001
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:13,090
The Philippines. Yeah, for sure.
Let's just Ninja Turtles for sure.

2002
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,290
Have a plan before you go in there.

2003
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,090
A lot of things guys. I tried to
be a moment for sure. Retiring

2004
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:25,100
could come back.
Yeah.

2005
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:30,880
It's gotta be so hard also to have a
fucking hard three round fight like that

2006
02:04:30,881 --> 02:04:35,800
and then give a big speech. Right. Damn.
I thought it was going to say retired.

2007
02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:38,050
He's not going to know he's retiring.

2008
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:42,050
He didn't take his gloves off and leaving
them in there. No. Oh, here we go. John,

2009
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:46,030
you'll come up with the performance of
a lifetime as you take the gloves off

2010
02:04:46,031 --> 02:04:49,480
here on the on and off for the final time.
Eddie message for sure.

2011
02:04:49,481 --> 02:04:53,980
Just cut the clothes off your ear that
the foremost gentleman in arguing as

2012
02:04:53,981 --> 02:04:56,620
classy as it gets it and
obviously what a way to go out.

2013
02:04:56,621 --> 02:05:01,440
Any final message for the fans before
you hang them up for good? You know,

2014
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:07,290
this is something I've
dreamed about and I hope for.

2015
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:10,650
I know I didn't accomplish what
I wanted to accomplish in a cage,

2016
02:05:10,651 --> 02:05:15,651
but I visit a lot of my time in lives
and I invested in in their treasures,

2017
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:21,980
in their heart and I've been able to
help change lives and impact lives in a

2018
02:05:22,111 --> 02:05:22,944
positive.

2019
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:30,510

story again be able to give to kids and

2020
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:35,880
I want to be able to teach and come back
here to the Philippines and be able to

2021
02:05:35,881 --> 02:05:38,210
get my talents,
gifts and abilities to you guys.

2022
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:43,080
I'm being able to help the Philippines,
it wrestling and that's my goal.

2023
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:45,720
Guys. I have, I have so much.

2024
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:47,690
This is such a good coach too.

2025
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:52,350
Putting my gloves in the center of the
octagon because I got so much love and

2026
02:05:52,351 --> 02:05:53,640
admiration for the support.

2027
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:57,750
Thank you to the best organization
on the planet and mixed martial arts.

2028
02:05:58,470 --> 02:06:00,360
Thank you.
You have a c thank you.

2029
02:06:03,490 --> 02:06:07,660
Don't leave frank out. They
fucked up leaving frank
outside Franks at home going,

2030
02:06:07,661 --> 02:06:11,050
what the fuck? Right? I
own 40% of this bitch.

2031
02:06:12,430 --> 02:06:17,170
C'Mon. C'Mon this fucking
guy. What if I'm frank?

2032
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:18,783
No frank

2033
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,640
and frank for from

2034
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:29,890
this fucking guy. Right, so fuck this man.

2035
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:32,750
Glory.

2036
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:35,270
Yeah. You're going to have to wrap
this up, mark. You Ma. I love you man.

2037
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:39,440
Fucking wrap itself, Bro. That's,
that's good. You know what?

2038
02:06:39,470 --> 02:06:41,600
You don't how he said he didn't
want accomplish we one too.

2039
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:45,710
I had a talk with mark before he fought
and I told him he can't look at things

2040
02:06:45,711 --> 02:06:49,140
that way, man, because if we, if we,

2041
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:53,060
if you wrap up your career and say,
because you're not the world champion,

2042
02:06:53,061 --> 02:06:56,930
your career was a failure, then 99% of
the fighters in the world are failures.

2043
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,630
You can't look at it like that.
Mark has had a great career. I said,

2044
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,940
if when you were in
college and I said to you,

2045
02:07:01,941 --> 02:07:04,760
you're going to have a seven or eight
year career in the UFC and be one of the

2046
02:07:04,761 --> 02:07:06,920
most famous middleweight in the world,
what would you say?

2047
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,140
He's that guy I would have
sent out as successful career.

2048
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:12,260
I said exactly just because
you didn't get to the belt.

2049
02:07:12,261 --> 02:07:15,350
Does it mean to you to have a successful
career no matter what your record is?

2050
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:19,010
He's had a very successful people think
that way about life in general though.

2051
02:07:19,011 --> 02:07:21,710
You'll have a relationship with somebody
and it doesn't end in marriage and

2052
02:07:21,711 --> 02:07:25,070
they'll be like, oh yeah,
that was a failure. It wasn't
a failure. You guys had fun.

2053
02:07:25,071 --> 02:07:28,660
You probably learned years. He learned.
You like know, like it's not a failure.

2054
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:31,520
Just a lot. A couple of xs. I
need you to talk to him on that.

2055
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,193
Ah,

2056
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:44,770
and back to his Ninja Turtle Shit. All
right. How dare you. Don't do this.

2057
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:48,340
Don't I grew up on fucking Ninja Turtles,
man. I want to show you some of the,

2058
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:53,050
should pull up some old Popeye Jane
would get my Ganja Donatello's sense.

2059
02:07:53,260 --> 02:07:55,870
Pull up some old pop by. This is one
of the things that have been noticing.

2060
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:58,810
I have it too. I'm watching
Popeye with my kids. First of all,

2061
02:07:58,811 --> 02:08:00,970
Popeye was sponsored by the NRA.

2062
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:04,570
How crazy is that at the beginning
of some of the Popeye episodes,

2063
02:08:04,571 --> 02:08:08,710
there's an ad for the National Rifle
Association, which is very strange.

2064
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,430
And then to Popeye is violent as fuck.

2065
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:16,900
Bluedot is always trying to rape olive
oil and everybody's beating the fuck out

2066
02:08:16,901 --> 02:08:19,240
of everybody.
It's racist as shit.

2067
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:23,320
There's some stuff with Indians and
native Americans were Popeye's beaten up.

2068
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:26,940
The Indians, they're shooting arrows at
him. Dude, you got to watch like what the,

2069
02:08:26,941 --> 02:08:31,420
the way they move popeyed meets
Sinbad. Like, look at the way they,

2070
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:34,000
they have like a little
wiggle to the way they move.

2071
02:08:34,001 --> 02:08:37,630
They don't just stand there
like, uh, like, like, you know,

2072
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:41,530
like a normal cartoon dot. Yeah.
Constantly. They're dancing,

2073
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:44,860
they dance,
they go left and right and right and left.

2074
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:47,760
Did you grow up on the Shitty, you just
got into it? No, I didn't really, I mean,

2075
02:08:47,761 --> 02:08:51,040
I guess I saw it was a little kid
and you guys are into this shit.

2076
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,930
I wasn't into it.
I wasn't in total and Jerry's,

2077
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:57,990
I'm looking at this as like
a time capsule. Like the,

2078
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,740
I didn't look at it in terms
of, uh, other constantly moving.

2079
02:09:03,690 --> 02:09:04,970
Yeah.
Everything is moving.

2080
02:09:05,010 --> 02:09:08,560
Everybody I want to see pop by himself
and all these dragons and shit.

2081
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,200
That trillions pretty legit.
Yeah,

2082
02:09:11,201 --> 02:09:14,770
look like they kind of have
like a little wiggle to them.

2083
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:18,580
And this is the color version.
Pluto huge mouth. Yeah.

2084
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:21,970
What's interesting is like
pop by, uh, started off,

2085
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:25,330
it was a black and white
thing like Betty boop. Yeah.

2086
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:29,470
They're the early s the early series.
Do you ever see Robin Williams and Papa?

2087
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:34,020
Yeah, he was good. He was
really good. That and uh,

2088
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:37,900
what about him smoking
spinach to his pipe?

2089
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:42,850
What about that leaf blower?
A leaf blower. Oh my God.
We're in the wrong spot.

2090
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:48,200
That's ridiculous.
Did have a drummer next to my studio.

2091
02:09:48,350 --> 02:09:52,590
We had so many podcasts with
drums in the background. I do.

2092
02:09:52,591 --> 02:09:56,460
Last time I did you think, did you
step away from doing your, your, your,

2093
02:09:56,461 --> 02:09:58,840
your stops rolling?
Yeah. Yeah man. I'm just

2094
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:04,600
ran out of guests. Ran Out
of gas. The gas. Come on.

2095
02:10:04,601 --> 02:10:08,100
I just need some time to chill for awhile.
Yeah. Yeah. You need a break cause it,

2096
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:12,780
yeah, just needed. Just a
little break. And you feel
like it was an obligation? No,

2097
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:17,560
no, not at all. What was it
fun anymore? No, no. It's
very fun. It's still for sure.

2098
02:10:17,561 --> 02:10:19,810
Keep doing it then.
Why'd you I don't understand.

2099
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:24,811
Then I'll come back cause I just
need time to spend on my family.

2100
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:28,460
Oh. So there's no time
for anything man. Right?

2101
02:10:28,490 --> 02:10:31,810
Like so I did them on Sunday nights.
Sunday nights man.

2102
02:10:31,811 --> 02:10:34,940
It's like that's the whole night
and I could be with my family.

2103
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:38,070
That was tough cause you would ask me
to do it on Sunday nights. Tough man.

2104
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:42,020
That's what I'm trying to chill. That's
the only time I could do it consistently.

2105
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:46,860
But that cuts into some solid
family. Yeah, for sure. So, but um,

2106
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:52,670
my wife's cool with it. So we've talked
about, I dunno, I'll be back some day.

2107
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:56,270
So just tell you a little break.
Yeah. We still have the studio. Right.

2108
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:58,120
So you can do it there anytime you want.
You know,

2109
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:59,840
you could always do it in the gym too.

2110
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,560
You could do different
kinds of fucking times.

2111
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:05,390
Going to say on the go in the gym is
just so many cool fighters that come

2112
02:11:05,391 --> 02:11:07,410
through there.
I really can't confirm anything,

2113
02:11:07,411 --> 02:11:10,610
but there is something in the works
already with ocean actual production

2114
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:17,030
shit. Some, I know, but this game,
this game, after I walked away,

2115
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:19,880
after I walked away, someone
approached me and said, hey man,

2116
02:11:19,881 --> 02:11:24,500
we could do this right. And like a legit
studio, legit production and you're not.

2117
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:27,140
I'm open to it, but nothing's
confirmed. I'm open to it,

2118
02:11:27,141 --> 02:11:30,450
but you know how right now, do you
know Eddie if, do you know idiot? Yes.

2119
02:11:30,490 --> 02:11:32,420
The Santa bought a bus.

2120
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:37,220
He bought like a school bus and converted
that bitch into a podcast studio.

2121
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:40,940
They drive and he drives it down the
Improv and they plug it into the wall.

2122
02:11:40,941 --> 02:11:45,170
Like the Wad podcasts was right on the
go. It's incredible. It's incredible.

2123
02:11:45,171 --> 02:11:47,630
I was there the other day and I
was like, oh my God. I'm like,

2124
02:11:47,631 --> 02:11:48,620
I want to steal this idea.

2125
02:11:48,621 --> 02:11:52,370
I had an idea a long time ago to do it
from one of those trailers that you pull

2126
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:56,250
around where they call it a digital
stream, Gulfstream, Gulfstream. Um,

2127
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,840
those are cool looking. Those silver
ones. I've loved those trailer. Cool.

2128
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:04,280
And I was like, this way you could get
one and just pull it around, you know,

2129
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:06,900
or I get Jamie to drive it,
but I don't trust turban

2130
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:10,600
generally looking at more of the but,

2131
02:12:11,380 --> 02:12:14,660
but what's the point of having it
on the go? Cause it bring it to um,

2132
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:16,640
like if you say, if I
have a Gig, you're like,

2133
02:12:16,641 --> 02:12:20,270
I'm doing the Irvine Improv with Cowen.
You bring the podcast studio,

2134
02:12:20,271 --> 02:12:24,950
you park the podcast studio. If it's a
trailer, park it in the back parking lot.

2135
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:28,370
You could actually, like
Eddie, if it has a screen,

2136
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:33,440
you could watch the podcast that's going
on inside his bus, outside the bus.

2137
02:12:33,530 --> 02:12:36,890
He's got a flat screen. The back window,
you know, it used to be like a window.

2138
02:12:36,891 --> 02:12:39,920
He could see. Yeah. It's not a
window anymore screen. It's a screen.

2139
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:44,540
So from the outside you can actually see
like a full HD version of what's going

2140
02:12:44,541 --> 02:12:49,100
on inside. It's really slick, pretty. So
he spent a fuck load of money on it too.

2141
02:12:49,101 --> 02:12:53,000
They had like some crazy kickstarted. I
think he spent like 65 grand on that bus.

2142
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:56,810
He's super into crossfit. Right? That's
like his thing. He a comedian crossfit,

2143
02:12:56,811 --> 02:13:00,290
right? Yeah. He got hurt though.
Like pretty bad crossfit.
It turns like that gap.

2144
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,400
If that switch trouble. How's a, your
backfilling with was pretty good.

2145
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:08,120
It's pretty good. I have a pulled
button muscle right now. That's not fun.

2146
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:10,730
I did something.
I don't know what I did.

2147
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:12,650
I have the fucking
machine got in the back.

2148
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:16,170
You load up with like 400 pounds and
just your cheeks are just fucking boom.

2149
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:20,930
He asked me to get out of there. I was, it
blew my fucking back first. Hyper. Yeah.

2150
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:24,380
Nah, I'm good. I love that machine.
But that's why you asked us all,

2151
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:28,520
I don't think swole shill out Bro.
I asked was,

2152
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:32,340
I had a little bit of a pulled like a
very minor pulled muscle and I fucked it

2153
02:13:32,341 --> 02:13:37,110
up worse. Just kept getting worse. Kicking
is putting, uh, putting Justin Myles,

2154
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:40,340
patting them up and beating the fuck
out of him. This is my favorite shit.

2155
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:45,260
Two to three, two, three days a week.
I put a chest protector on. He gave,

2156
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:46,320
wears the tie pads.

2157
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:50,400
I have these giant ass leg pads and
he puts on second leg kick him. Damn.

2158
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:53,550
And we do rounds and I will on that dude.
It's awesome.

2159
02:13:53,640 --> 02:13:56,430
If you could hire someone to let
you beat the fuck out of him,

2160
02:13:56,431 --> 02:14:00,880
like hold the hold the pads and that
body shots and some rich dude shit.

2161
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:05,820
Tremendous suffering. It's like, come
on Bro, I'll give you $10 around.

2162
02:14:06,450 --> 02:14:08,040
Hitting a bag is one thing,

2163
02:14:08,041 --> 02:14:12,840
but throwing combinations and finishing
off of the legit full power leg kick

2164
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:16,680
because there's those,
those Goddamn fairtex pads are huge.

2165
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:21,510
You could full power law. I mean I can
like Pedro his, oh, can't full power leg.

2166
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:25,810
He's got a gnarly ass fucking kick.
I would advise Justin, not today.

2167
02:14:25,810 --> 02:14:28,620
He takes Beaton's that kid.
But you know what man?

2168
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:34,940
I kid's ball pens entirely
on what kind of pad.

2169
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:38,960
I'll tell you this man.
Anybody who doesn't like
anybody who doesn't know, man,

2170
02:14:38,961 --> 02:14:43,960
he's tough as shit. Anybody who doesn't
like, um, uh, holding pads for somebody,

2171
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:47,140
tie pads,
get the Higher Bussa pads higher.

2172
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:51,930
Bussa makes this extra thick
pad with mad fucking foam in it.

2173
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:54,900
I don't know what kind of foam
they're using, but they got it down.

2174
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:59,250
Like the difference between like his
arms would go numb when I would kick them

2175
02:14:59,251 --> 02:15:03,330
with the regular one, but with the high
of Boosie, he barely even feels it.

2176
02:15:03,331 --> 02:15:08,010
I'm telling you they're different.
The hand. No. Yes, no. I'll just say,

2177
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:09,360
hey,
can

2178
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:15,880
you all hear a brother's 50 diction that
she owed from Brazil where there are

2179
02:15:15,881 --> 02:15:19,260
tough and in the students I punched
him in the head. Did you see that? Yes.

2180
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:21,780
John Wayne par showed
it to me is the dumbest.

2181
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:26,640
I've had a fake one. He did
a play one. A pretend one.

2182
02:15:26,641 --> 02:15:31,020
He posted the real one, then read created
it. Right. The real one is ridiculous.

2183
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:34,080
These guys are beating the fuck out of
their students. Punching him in the face,

2184
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:37,430
making them stand there and
take head punched. Hard, hard.

2185
02:15:37,431 --> 02:15:42,431
But 2015 2015 I mean this guy's teeing
off on the student's face and he loves

2186
02:15:43,861 --> 02:15:47,800
it. Why are you laughing? I
blame the students in the,

2187
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:52,470
is that
we're all sober.

2188
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:57,030
It's fucked up. Smoking weed at seven
in the morning. I have my limits.

2189
02:15:57,870 --> 02:16:02,280
Thought just what does it think of?
How easy would it be?

2190
02:16:02,281 --> 02:16:03,900
The parody that like,
you know what I mean?

2191
02:16:03,901 --> 02:16:08,490
Just have the camera angle and like you
could make it look like, have you seen,

2192
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:11,400
got it. You've seen the video.
It's insane. Right? Exactly.

2193
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:15,690
And it's insane how quickly everyone
seen that. You seen it to know, oh,

2194
02:16:15,691 --> 02:16:20,300
you haven't seen her. Okay.
It's so the, it's fucked up.
It's so bad. It's not cool.

2195
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:24,630
So off between Facebook and
Twitter and Instagram, Holy Shit.

2196
02:16:24,631 --> 02:16:26,970
Everything's just instant
instill that kind of stuff.

2197
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:31,030
The video like that that you could just
like instantly click and some black guys

2198
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:35,910
was trying to get a little bit,
oh my God,

2199
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:43,510
fuck is that high grades punching them.
Somebody needs a beat.

2200
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:45,190
The fucking Sony's a beat the shit out.

2201
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:47,110
That guy's giving those
people brain damage.

2202
02:16:47,710 --> 02:16:51,580
I mean the making them stand there and
take brain damage for why I have to be

2203
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:55,810
tough. You fucking idiots. They
do that just once. The new crop.

2204
02:16:55,811 --> 02:16:58,210
They want to see how people
react and you know what?

2205
02:16:58,211 --> 02:16:59,680
You're going to take a beating.
Right now.

2206
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:01,780
We're going to see how you take
the beating. We're going to study.

2207
02:17:04,390 --> 02:17:07,530
Let me tell you one thing. That red car
girl, that man kick him in the legs.

2208
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:12,280
You know like don't fuck it. That's what
they do at tiger. [inaudible] savage.

2209
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:15,010
That guy punches like a bitch by the way,

2210
02:17:15,190 --> 02:17:18,520
because anybody who punches really good
should be a knock. Those people like,

2211
02:17:18,521 --> 02:17:21,760
oh she's sorry Philip.
Who here would go

2212
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:27,130
to what school?
If you want to time this where it's at.

2213
02:17:27,131 --> 02:17:31,780
Four 48 right now for 46 you get,
you get the boot,

2214
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:34,630
the picture Musashi,
saucy and Philip do.

2215
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:41,930
It's got some good fucking hands. Yeah,
he can box good power in his hands.

2216
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:44,330
I fought with it'll kill times.
Does zero,

2217
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:48,310
zero warmup just walked out
there fucking ice cold. Really?

2218
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:50,690
He just be it there with you?
Yeah,

2219
02:17:50,691 --> 02:17:54,500
he did like three jumping jacks was like
fuck it. Why do you think he does that?

2220
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:58,910
That seems like, well there's
a, there's some people I was,

2221
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,950
I was over there sweat my
ass off doing all the shit.

2222
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:03,050
I looked over at him and he's like,
well, they just cracked his neck.

2223
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:08,300
They took him down side control. Keith
Jardine. So Nice. They don't do much,

2224
02:18:08,301 --> 02:18:10,730
man.
That's old school I think.

2225
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:12,700
Okay.

2226
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:16,000
Side control.
What's old school not warming up properly?

2227
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:20,530
I isn't that people say they do that
because the Thais don't warm up when they

2228
02:18:20,531 --> 02:18:25,150
fight. I don't know the title first round
really slow because they don't warm up.

2229
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:26,550
No,
because of the bedding.

2230
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,730
They don't place the bat
until the fight starts.

2231
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:34,330
So that ties the first round is almost
like they're playing and warming up,

2232
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:38,200
getting the money flowing. Ari
Shaffir was just in Thailand, man.

2233
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:40,390
He just went over to
Thailand for a vacation.

2234
02:18:40,391 --> 02:18:43,510
He spent like two weeks in
Thailand just having fun. Oh Man.

2235
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:46,740
Ari's balling out of control
right now. I love it. Easy. He's,

2236
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:50,590
unless he him everywhere. That's
special. This podcast is doing so good.

2237
02:18:50,591 --> 02:18:54,940
He's a funny dude, man. He's a funny
dude. He works hard and he's, he's like,

2238
02:18:54,941 --> 02:18:57,010
he's doing it the right way.
Like he went to Thailand,

2239
02:18:57,011 --> 02:18:59,980
left his computer and his phone
behind five. That's awesome.

2240
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:02,050
And his agent was like, well, what
if we have to reach you? He's like,

2241
02:19:02,051 --> 02:19:06,070
you won't can't reach me. You
got to show, I got to show.

2242
02:19:06,071 --> 02:19:08,110
I have two specials on comedy central.
You good?

2243
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:10,960
I'll do whatever I want to do
right now is over. You fucked up.

2244
02:19:10,961 --> 02:19:14,770
You let the wrong Guy Hashtag blown up.
Hashtag suck it.

2245
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:17,620
I bet he got it.

2246
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:22,540
Even though it was like a I shit talking
fast between Howard stern in him that

2247
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:27,541
got him a lot on my ankle dryness and
Howard stern lost in that 100% what would

2248
02:19:28,031 --> 02:19:30,200
our he did was he got
he trolled Howard Stern.

2249
02:19:30,201 --> 02:19:32,410
He got how it's turned to
talk shit about how certain,

2250
02:19:32,440 --> 02:19:35,070
talked about it for 25 minutes
on a show and then our,

2251
02:19:35,071 --> 02:19:39,820
he made a video showing Howard stern how
to Google his name because Howard like

2252
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:43,190
it said a bunch of like false things about
him. You know like about what he did.

2253
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:46,640
Like it's really easy. This is a thing
called Google. I want you to go to,

2254
02:19:46,641 --> 02:19:50,350
if your browser would, you probably
have like Netscape navigator company.

2255
02:19:50,930 --> 02:19:55,100
Totally mocked him and he did it like in
a really respectful way. The Smart Dude,

2256
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:56,960
very smart.
He's very smart dude

2257
02:19:59,230 --> 02:20:01,730
is a beast. You know,
they both had good points.

2258
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:07,840
The fact that Howard didn't know like
talk shit on podcasts because it's good

2259
02:20:08,901 --> 02:20:09,201
for us.

2260
02:20:09,201 --> 02:20:13,400
But it's also because it's a threat
because he's in Sirius satellite radio and

2261
02:20:13,401 --> 02:20:15,380
he's renegotiated his contract,
I'm sure.

2262
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:19,910
And the number one competition for
satellite radio is podcasts. You know,

2263
02:20:19,911 --> 02:20:23,270
like if you go through a tunnel,
okay, you go into a parking structure.

2264
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:27,830
I get pissed when I'm listening to fucking
serious and I go to the mall and I go

2265
02:20:27,831 --> 02:20:31,220
into the parking structure and the shit
cuts off. It drives me nuts. I'm like,

2266
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:35,150
this is dumb. Okay, this is dumb.
Well plus you gotta pay for it. Yeah.

2267
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:38,330
Well that doesn't bother me cause
I'm rich. But what bothers me,

2268
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:40,790
you are rich and sure that
in their son. No, I hear Ya.

2269
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:46,220
I was going to say it for you
if he did it, but it bothers me.

2270
02:20:46,221 --> 02:20:48,530
I like things being for free for sure.
Like everybody does,

2271
02:20:48,531 --> 02:20:50,930
but I don't like the technology.
I think it's stupid.

2272
02:20:51,370 --> 02:20:55,340
The whole idea that you get a beam it down
from the sky, wasn't it made on earth?

2273
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:58,040
Can't you have an earthly
distribution device?

2274
02:20:58,130 --> 02:21:01,990
Arm trouble shooting that
happened? Oh yeah. Costa Phillip.

2275
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:06,250
We'll fight it out of it. No, I
agree. I still think its limits you on

2276
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:12,290
him. I listen to Howard stern all
the time. I love how I'm a big fan.

2277
02:21:12,740 --> 02:21:17,630
I listen how listening every day I
listen to Howard stern serious and your

2278
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:21,920
Porsche with the fuck not Ahmed. How
dare you. That's your Porsche out there.

2279
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:27,050
Yes sir. Holy Shit. Hashtag. I was
wondering why it wasn't here. I'm like,

2280
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:30,950
maybe he just left his car here.
Something that's yours.

2281
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:35,330
Hashtag hauling. Wow, look
at you. What year is it?

2282
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:40,100
It's a 2014 holy shit.
Sweet car.

2283
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:44,990
How good is that God damn thing handle?
It's nine nine one. Love it man.

2284
02:21:44,991 --> 02:21:48,140
It's like they're on rails. Love
it. You have a Tesla, right? Yup.

2285
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:51,860
I drove a Tesla for a show that Bobby
Ray's ex doing. It's like, it's a,

2286
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:55,730
it's a like a talk show where
you're driving a car. Like the guy,

2287
02:21:55,731 --> 02:21:58,940
the guests is driving the car.
So that week was a Tesla.

2288
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:02,570
I love Tesla's holy Shit Dude.
Have you ever driven his car?

2289
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:06,170
He's going for that arm triangle again.
He's really, we're hammering him.

2290
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:09,840
I heard you can download things and Tesla,
we can make it sound like a certain,

2291
02:22:09,850 --> 02:22:12,610
like a fry engine. A Porsche engine.
Have you seen that? You know,

2292
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:14,900
I haven't done that.
They should take it away from you.

2293
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:20,420
Have you ever driven a Tesla drive one? It
awesome. Like, no, I've driven in his uh,

2294
02:22:20,421 --> 02:22:25,070
driven and Aubrey's the dopest shit.
Like Hentai Tesla, Joe. No, no.

2295
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:29,610
I love them. No noise. Oh, cool.
Making a fake engine noises.

2296
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,680
Dom. Super, super dumb. Have 12.

2297
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:37,860
He cannot press. He can press
a button. It, well, he'll,

2298
02:22:37,861 --> 02:22:41,940
he'll say into it like arctic monkeys
and then it'll just start pulling arctic

2299
02:22:41,941 --> 02:22:45,450
monkeys songs and we'd just be pointed
there. You can name any songs all,

2300
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:47,990
it's pretty dope. Slacker
radio. It's crazy.

2301
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,860
The computer screen just Tesla's are
Jack Jack. It's like a giant fucking,

2302
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:57,360
it's crazy. It's pretty, does that thing
go dark when it gets dark out? It does.

2303
02:22:57,361 --> 02:23:00,630
Yeah. That's good. The whole screen,
instead of being a white background,

2304
02:23:00,631 --> 02:23:02,080
it goes black background.
Yeah.

2305
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:07,400
I'm a big fan of those tax by me and
richest fuck tax break for having small,

2306
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:12,840
right. I mean it's the first
electric car that looks awesome.

2307
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:14,800
People want and that new one.
No,

2308
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:17,880
the Fisker was the first electric
car that looked dope. Those things,

2309
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:21,990
the Fisker and buy one for $50 today.
I will fucking take it. I will take it.

2310
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:24,720
You know what happened with
those Fiskars like blown up.

2311
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:29,580
The bags are like when the,
when the storm hit the east coast,

2312
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:33,720
they were at the docks in North Carolina
and they got flooded and apparently

2313
02:23:33,721 --> 02:23:36,990
when they're underwater they just
explode and then that was the end of the

2314
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:41,760
competent. 14 of them blew up on
the docks and everybody's like,

2315
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:46,320
all right, this is why I'm never
going to be under a fucking water.

2316
02:23:46,321 --> 02:23:47,940
My to scurry can happen,
man.

2317
02:23:47,941 --> 02:23:51,600
If you drive into like a
like water crossing you,

2318
02:23:51,870 --> 02:23:54,990
if you're involved in like rain, like do
you ever drive in Houston in the rain?

2319
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:59,700
Well they'll get some, there's some
times where like they get so much water.

2320
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:04,240
Like you're, you know, up to like 16
inches from her car was underwater for,

2321
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:07,110
for chief Fisker.
It'll blow up dude.

2322
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:11,700
You'll be take that flying through the
air like a Popeye cartoon by whatever we

2323
02:24:11,701 --> 02:24:12,534
leave.

2324
02:24:12,950 --> 02:24:17,670
That's the least of my word was the story
with the guy that the makers of Tesla,

2325
02:24:17,671 --> 02:24:21,190
the company didn't they give away
like the patents? Yeah, the pants.

2326
02:24:21,191 --> 02:24:25,210
So that other car companies can
you run a mosque is a bad frenzy.

2327
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:29,520
Elon Musk is no joke in Brentwood
and it's genius doesn't cause,

2328
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:33,030
cause if he does that
then there's an industry,

2329
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:34,740
he needs the industry to survive.

2330
02:24:34,741 --> 02:24:37,980
So he needs the competition
because once they follow suit,

2331
02:24:37,981 --> 02:24:39,870
he's like he's the king forever.
And that's true.

2332
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:42,450
But it's just not scarcity picking.
It's abundant thinking.

2333
02:24:44,130 --> 02:24:47,130
People are still gonna buy a test is
even if someone else made guy's a genius,

2334
02:24:47,131 --> 02:24:50,520
his kids work out at box and burn in
Brentwood and I see those little rich

2335
02:24:50,521 --> 02:24:54,220
bastards. You best believe,
I've talked about the Tesla
home battery. Best believe,

2336
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:57,870
I'm trying to get the new ideas from
their dad is a Tesla home battery so it's

2337
02:24:57,871 --> 02:25:00,990
like a generator but it's all electric
goes up through solar and you get like

2338
02:25:00,991 --> 02:25:04,860
three days of power on this battery in
your garage and you could stack them.

2339
02:25:04,861 --> 02:25:07,950
So you could have nine of these
batteries on your wall. And what,

2340
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:12,540
like what are you saying amounts?
Solar power. Not only that, it's, it's,

2341
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:14,400
it's off the grid.
Solar power.

2342
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:18,080
So like a lot of solar power is
still dependent upon the grid. It's,

2343
02:25:18,090 --> 02:25:21,720
which is really fucking stupid.
Meaning you get solar power,

2344
02:25:21,721 --> 02:25:24,520
but when the grid goes down,
so does your power,

2345
02:25:24,521 --> 02:25:26,590
which seems to me to be dumb as fuck.

2346
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:30,520
So they can set it up differently where
it doesn't go down if the grid goes down,

2347
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:31,600
but it's kind of archaic.

2348
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:35,500
You have a battery room and he solved
all that shit with this wall thing that

2349
02:25:35,501 --> 02:25:40,150
he's got and it looks cool.
You get ready.

2350
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:44,580
They're all sold out. But then you can
rely on that for power. I isn't. He's got,

2351
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:47,160
there's gotta be people trying
to shut him down now. There

2352
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:53,440
was, it happened, right? Oh Shit.

2353
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:56,980
Probably go get on that motherfucker
with the test. They just let that shit.

2354
02:25:57,550 --> 02:26:01,030
He's too small. It's too
late. Sorry. Sorry about it.

2355
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:04,610
Is that what you were personally? No,
I don't. I don't know about it though.

2356
02:26:05,410 --> 02:26:09,160
There's the things like what was his
life like? What does, what does he,

2357
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:13,870
he's just obsessed with work.
He's Batman car injuries. Well,

2358
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:17,950
he's got that. He's got that
space companies. He's just
the building wants to do,

2359
02:26:17,951 --> 02:26:21,850
he wants to change the fucking
universe. Oh really? Hm.

2360
02:26:22,350 --> 02:26:26,680
Cost of smelling poop.
It's getting Ilan Musk documentary on him.

2361
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:29,710
Not Elon Musk.
There's a bunch of shit on him though.

2362
02:26:30,810 --> 02:26:35,380
I mean that those Teslas are awesome.
I want one. Yeah, they're pretty cool.

2363
02:26:35,381 --> 02:26:40,381
But you can't drive it to Vegas and if
you leave it sitting out like you are,

2364
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:43,480
you had a problem with that. Right? Like
you took off, went on vacation, came back,

2365
02:26:43,481 --> 02:26:45,690
the bitch was like barely
able to get you home. Yeah.

2366
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:50,050
But I think some sneaky fucks might've
been driving it was, I'm not sure.

2367
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:51,970
Yeah cause that was unusual.
But it's stressful.

2368
02:26:51,971 --> 02:26:54,270
Like I drove up to Fort Hood
cause he sold, look at this,

2369
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:57,190
look at this Musashi looking for Komora.

2370
02:26:57,370 --> 02:27:01,800
I think it's weird that you're allowed
to grab your shorts to the Fed.

2371
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,900
You can drive your own shirts but why?
Why not?

2372
02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:08,260
But then you can't grab him but you
can't grab somebody else's shade.

2373
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:12,170
But isn't that weird cuts a little
weird that you can grab Carlos.

2374
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:15,250
There's nothing wrong with that.
North south.

2375
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:19,210
I just think short grabbing should
be legal all the way around. Yeah.

2376
02:27:19,240 --> 02:27:22,360
Philip was going to make it just to
defend a submission should be legally.

2377
02:27:22,890 --> 02:27:25,210
It's weird. What's all
over. What else is there?

2378
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:28,390
If you could have the shorts trying to
take someone down and if any of that

2379
02:27:29,030 --> 02:27:32,650
going to have shorts, you shouldn't grab
anybody's clothing. That's ridiculous.

2380
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:35,320
The only reason to hash out the people's
clothes. Like if you have shorts,

2381
02:27:35,321 --> 02:27:37,160
you're going to grab this fucking shorts.
What are these wines?

2382
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:41,440
There'd be pants at the side. Yeah.
I don't give a fuck to the side.

2383
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:42,760
What are you gonna do with that?

2384
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:45,820
What I'm understanding
tried to embarrass the guy.

2385
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:53,080
Look at check Congo. Travis Browne. Dude.
Look at big dairy Goodrich. The Pedro.

2386
02:27:53,230 --> 02:27:54,063
Yes.

2387
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:58,210
That one over that Garrett Goodridge
reached into the Pedro's fucking pants and

2388
02:27:58,211 --> 02:28:02,800
grabbed his dick peanut butter.
He said that he goes,

2389
02:28:02,801 --> 02:28:04,210
I made peanut butter out of his nuts.

2390
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:10,990
Some guys to put his feet inside
his book. Yeah, both feet.

2391
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:16,930
There's no rule for that. But he reached
in there and grabbed it, crushed it.

2392
02:28:17,900 --> 02:28:20,830
And I'm not kidding.
And somehow or another the Pedro stayed.

2393
02:28:23,230 --> 02:28:28,010
He didn't faint. Wow. Casa
filled was getting hammered
in getting, we have no idea.

2394
02:28:28,011 --> 02:28:32,270
Look at this. He's holding his one risk
down and punching the shit out of him.

2395
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:37,580
Damn.
These are real net crank that crank this.

2396
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:43,460
Ouch. Nope. We got out of town. He's
working on, he's working on this.

2397
02:28:43,461 --> 02:28:47,570
It's totally not getting hit ever.
He's barely getting hit. Someone's out.

2398
02:28:47,571 --> 02:28:51,450
Philip who said did you bet? Did you
guys better than plenty? You watch over

2399
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:57,670
the over. What'd you bet on?
I bet on being over around
and a half. Oh, so you won.

2400
02:28:57,940 --> 02:29:02,000
Congratulations. Great Bookie, right Ben?

2401
02:29:02,450 --> 02:29:06,230
We're not even in Vegas.
My friend in Vegas.

2402
02:29:06,231 --> 02:29:08,020
Of course you bet on Frankie your eye.

2403
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:11,720
Maybe you bet it out the soles
to get finished in the third.

2404
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:15,620
I actually bet under cause there is so
far ahead of the game right now when it

2405
02:29:15,621 --> 02:29:20,100
comes to bets in the UFC, he's so far
ahead of the game. He's laughing at me.

2406
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:24,050
Might be like at a strong 80
plus percent all time winning.

2407
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:25,131
We had a couple of,

2408
02:29:25,131 --> 02:29:28,760
we had a couple of runs we had some
months we would sit down and have lunch

2409
02:29:28,761 --> 02:29:33,360
before the fights and I would pick
out some fucking gems and uh, like we,

2410
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:38,090
we went like, shit, we
won't like nine for 11.

2411
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:41,050
You're the best guy to ask a
fucking the couple of ones in a row.

2412
02:29:41,051 --> 02:29:43,970
It's like eight out of nine,
nine out of 10 I wish I had,

2413
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:46,890
if we were to hit that nine out of nine
there would have been like, Bro, you,

2414
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:49,910
you know, it's not a bad bet right
now. And I love Conor Mcgregor,

2415
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:53,630
but he's the favorite again. It's all
doing Vegas. Is he a favorite against

2416
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:59,420
raise? Not Mad at that. I'm not mad at
taking all though. I want color to win.

2417
02:29:59,480 --> 02:30:04,150
I'm a cotter fan,
but I like money and all those.

2418
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:08,720
Not a bad bet. I see him. Let me,
Eddie, don't tempt me, mother. Fuck.

2419
02:30:08,721 --> 02:30:12,950
I just can't believe I'm hearing what
you're saying. But what do you think?

2420
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:16,880
I'm just fucking,
I'll dose so god good.

2421
02:30:16,881 --> 02:30:20,900
I can't imagine Conard be a favor when
he's never fought anybody remotely as

2422
02:30:20,901 --> 02:30:25,670
good. I got my money on con Gregor minus
one. Oh, all those are favorite dude.

2423
02:30:26,840 --> 02:30:30,440
No, it's moving around. Well,
we'll look at it as, yeah,

2424
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:35,860
well I think that it's a, it's closed.
So that's a big spread actually.

2425
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:38,320
Minus one 20 fight.

2426
02:30:39,580 --> 02:30:42,860
That was a bucks I got caught or
you've got all that. Oh my goodness.

2427
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:47,750
What is going on, Eddie Bravo.
Crazy thousand dollar gambler.

2428
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:50,500
Once you give him a bankroll racist.

2429
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:54,590
It's like you're riot.
Favorite wins tonight.

2430
02:30:54,591 --> 02:30:57,680
Eddie Bravo was going to open
up a school and your honor,

2431
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:03,200
he's going to use officer.
You're going to be paying,

2432
02:31:03,201 --> 02:31:05,840
his mortgage is going to be,
he's going to be getting you every month.

2433
02:31:06,910 --> 02:31:11,000
Imagine if you just keep chasing
bad money in every month. Oh, Eddie,

2434
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:13,183
what the fuck?

2435
02:31:13,220 --> 02:31:16,730
He texted me last night and asked if
it was okay if you bought a check,

2436
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:18,770
you were fucking with me, right? Yeah.

2437
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:24,770
We did bring a stack of cast
stack oak cash staco cash.

2438
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:28,150
Damn. Musashi looks very sad.
You're strike club money.

2439
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:33,240
Yes it is. Can you walk into, you're
single right now, right? No, I'm not.

2440
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:38,220
I got a bad ass fucking leg kick and
forget it. I was going to say though,

2441
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:41,340
I like to have a good time.
No, if you were saying

2442
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:47,280
let's not get it twisted.
Committed. I would,

2443
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:51,990
I was going to ask you if, uh, going
to a strip club was something uh,

2444
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:55,150
you'd like to do. Cause it's just, no,
I hate it. Oh, you hate it. I hate it.

2445
02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:58,950
Hate chip clubs. Yeah. He can't stand
them. They make no sense. Why? Why?

2446
02:31:59,190 --> 02:32:00,850
I just don't want to see land.
It's fancy.

2447
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:05,160
I just go to God and I pick up where
you walk in and the girl to scaling it.

2448
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:06,090
You know what I'm saying?

2449
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:08,970
And you can look at them because you
don't want them to fucking ask you for a

2450
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:13,410
lap dance. It's a twilight
zone. It was honey dick.

2451
02:32:13,411 --> 02:32:15,220
Yet the whole time is what?
Your money.

2452
02:32:15,370 --> 02:32:19,000
It's the only club gets
off there to regular club.

2453
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:23,520
No girls are making eye contact
with you. I disagree. Maybe you,

2454
02:32:23,580 --> 02:32:27,300
I'm talking about the normal guy like
me when they see a tall fucking UFC

2455
02:32:27,330 --> 02:32:31,320
fighter, he fights UFC. Oh my God. Is
that how they do it? What's that face?

2456
02:32:31,321 --> 02:32:35,640
What's wrong with their lips?
People have palsy.

2457
02:32:37,140 --> 02:32:40,770
They got bell's Palsy in the club.
I don't want that.

2458
02:32:40,771 --> 02:32:45,290
Oh look at how beautiful
brand. Normal guys.

2459
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:48,810
Not like you. Okay. I'm saying for me
personally, strip clubs don't make sense.

2460
02:32:48,811 --> 02:32:51,090
I go to a bar and meet a nice girl.
We have a fun time.

2461
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:55,350
Well that's a great answer.
Thanks. A good answer. Well,

2462
02:32:55,351 --> 02:32:58,410
there's a lot of people that aren't,
are normal guys that feel the same way.

2463
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,500
There's a lot of people that just
get upset at the whole process.

2464
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:02,370
I don't want shit stains on my tee shirt,
man.

2465
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:04,230
Them rubbing their ass on me and shit.

2466
02:33:04,820 --> 02:33:08,730
Strip clubs need that Fogo de
Chao Red Red Green Button. That's

2467
02:33:10,390 --> 02:33:10,890
brilliant.

2468
02:33:10,890 --> 02:33:15,210
That's a good to do a combination of
Fogo de Chao Strip club because it's

2469
02:33:15,211 --> 02:33:16,980
exhausting to chips.

2470
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:21,340
One of them is pink and something else
and one of them is green and red. Yeah.

2471
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:22,980
So the the pink,
what would it be?

2472
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:27,150
Pink and what would be the
brown red red for that too.

2473
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:30,750
Would you like a Dan? Pink means
bring it over here. Good dance.

2474
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:34,230
But I want to discriminate against my
strong sisters out there that are also

2475
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:38,500
stripping. So I guess shaped
the hustle. I'm not mad at me.

2476
02:33:38,501 --> 02:33:41,880
Black girls so can be pink.
Well that's what I said. Pride.

2477
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:46,230
But Brown is probably good too. Yeah.
Brown's not bad like Brown and red.

2478
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:49,750
Maybe me mom who saucy is just uh,

2479
02:33:49,890 --> 02:33:54,180
just beaten on the ground man.
Dominating him on the ground.

2480
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:57,390
Every time we look over, he's
on top. How could you say that?

2481
02:33:57,391 --> 02:33:59,380
Why you guys aren't even
watching the fight? Nah,

2482
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:02,940
I do watch it enough watching little
of this. He's just dominated him.

2483
02:34:02,950 --> 02:34:07,350
Grounded Pouch. You have a big
following in Iran. Did they,

2484
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:11,310
do they have the UFC there? Move
Saucy? Yeah. Um, I don't know.

2485
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:14,820
He's Iranian shore from Holland actually,

2486
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:20,080
but a Iranian heritage.
Ooh, hard elbow. Oh,

2487
02:34:20,081 --> 02:34:23,950
another one.
Good girl.

2488
02:34:24,280 --> 02:34:28,000
Slice them that slicing elbows.
So nasty. They're novel, right?

2489
02:34:28,400 --> 02:34:32,350
Goes across you very good passer.
He gets,

2490
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:36,770
he gets a top half easily.
Yeah.

2491
02:34:36,771 --> 02:34:38,030
He's got a strong ground game.

2492
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:39,623
Yeah.

2493
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:42,460
That Henderson fight was sad to see,
man.

2494
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:46,060
I just had to see Henderson get
rock so easy. Yeah. I was like,

2495
02:34:46,061 --> 02:34:51,061
this doesn't even seem like the same guy
I can Nursen used to be when to just to

2496
02:34:51,271 --> 02:34:55,600
just fight it. He just knocked
out Henderson the first
round. Which saucy did. Oh,

2497
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:59,530
Henderson used to be able to take like
the most insane amount of punishment.

2498
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:02,470
Musashi seem to almost feel
bad about that. Henderson.

2499
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:07,500
I know it's also Henderson's first fight
post TRT because he was on the TRT when

2500
02:35:08,951 --> 02:35:12,610
he fought shogun. That was like
the last approved tea. Our tea.

2501
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:18,040
Well now he's fighting Tim boat for
the main event. New Orleans. Yeah.

2502
02:35:18,041 --> 02:35:19,330
It was kind of crazy.
Five rounds.

2503
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:23,170
What was supposed to be the main event
and that fight DC. Ryan Bader. Oh,

2504
02:35:23,171 --> 02:35:26,680
that's right. Yeah, and then
that became that. That's weird.

2505
02:35:27,490 --> 02:35:32,380
It's a weird man event,
but I'm not jumping out of my seat for it.

2506
02:35:33,870 --> 02:35:35,520
For a main events,
like if you,

2507
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:39,260
if they set up Weidman versus
Anderson or whatever else,

2508
02:35:39,490 --> 02:35:43,420
would they have a backup two oh five or
the train to look like now in a training

2509
02:35:43,421 --> 02:35:47,260
camp? No, nothing planned. But if
they know, if, if you know a big time,

2510
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:51,010
two oh five or has a fight like down the
road and he's tray the, call him first.

2511
02:35:51,070 --> 02:35:54,520
Well Rockhold said that he was going to
prepare for, for Belford to pull out.

2512
02:35:54,521 --> 02:35:58,790
Yeah. I don't think the UFC is
telling them, you know, they mark,

2513
02:35:59,050 --> 02:36:02,770
that'd be smart. You put together a
fight and then you designate a backup.

2514
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:06,850
If they start doing like the next guy,
the next guy in line, either you'd have,

2515
02:36:06,851 --> 02:36:10,150
I pay him some sort of otherwise,
what's the point? Give them some money.

2516
02:36:10,151 --> 02:36:12,880
Cause then if anything happens,
it avoids disaster.

2517
02:36:13,310 --> 02:36:16,030
That's tight on a fighter
though. Hey, I had an idea.

2518
02:36:16,140 --> 02:36:17,950
Tell me about any ways
you give them a fight.

2519
02:36:17,951 --> 02:36:20,980
An easy fight and he's training for that.
He's on the same card.

2520
02:36:21,490 --> 02:36:25,630
And then if anything happens,
boom, he just jumps to the
main event. I got an idea.

2521
02:36:25,631 --> 02:36:28,510
Tell me if this is valid. I was
trying to, I was thinking last night,

2522
02:36:28,511 --> 02:36:31,620
I'm even going to call Dana and
asked him about this. Um, uh,

2523
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:35,770
giving guys opportunities
to have sponsorships, right?
Like everybody's like, well,

2524
02:36:35,771 --> 02:36:39,340
Reebok's the only sponsor. Yeah, guys
are going to lose money. What about this?

2525
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:44,410
What about guys release like
almost daily training footage.

2526
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:48,340
Yeah, training footage sponsored
by whatever company it is.

2527
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:53,140
So over a long period of time, like
you're talking about a bunch of videos.

2528
02:36:53,480 --> 02:36:55,810
If you're training for a fight,
you got six, eight weeks.

2529
02:36:56,050 --> 02:36:59,800
I don't know about you guys, but I fucking
love watching training footage. Allow.

2530
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:03,610
Love it. I get an inspired, I
love watching dudes hit the pads.

2531
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:06,250
I like watching dudes do strength
and conditioning routines.

2532
02:37:06,251 --> 02:37:09,490
I like watching dudes get
exhausted. I like watch a p. I just,

2533
02:37:09,491 --> 02:37:11,740
I liked watching the training.
Montage has,

2534
02:37:11,741 --> 02:37:15,740
I think training videos are like really
good and you don't even need like a

2535
02:37:15,741 --> 02:37:18,020
narrator really. I mean,
you may maybe like,

2536
02:37:18,021 --> 02:37:22,160
you could have somebody explain what
what's going on or have some text at the

2537
02:37:22,161 --> 02:37:24,920
bottom, you know, 7:15 AM, you know,

2538
02:37:25,030 --> 02:37:29,210
westside barbell in a matte brown shows
up for work. And then they're like, right,

2539
02:37:29,211 --> 02:37:29,871
let's go,
let's go,

2540
02:37:29,871 --> 02:37:34,610
let's go and have a fucking flipped t
have that sponsored by whatever company.

2541
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:38,600
You're all 700 guys. I don't think
you could do it for 700 guys.

2542
02:37:38,601 --> 02:37:41,730
But I think you could do it for
a lot of guys and I think you,

2543
02:37:41,780 --> 02:37:44,960
well you might be able to do it for
700 guys. Just people wouldn't watch.

2544
02:37:44,961 --> 02:37:48,670
People aren't gonna Watch
what they wouldn't count.
They'll happens the capitol,

2545
02:37:48,671 --> 02:37:51,970
if they're not watching, then
there's sponsorships. That
worth must much. Anyways,

2546
02:37:52,010 --> 02:37:55,730
countdown show, you're catching the guy
like talking to his kid on fucking show.

2547
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:58,820
You know, they show his trainer.
Let's show a little bit of,

2548
02:37:58,830 --> 02:38:02,550
if you have 700 guys though, who the fuck
you know who's going to watch Neil bag,

2549
02:38:02,551 --> 02:38:03,500
knees training.

2550
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:08,530
I would watch you and I would cause
we're avid fucking well the hardcore fans

2551
02:38:08,601 --> 02:38:11,200
are going to watch it for sure.
He gets a sponsor right there.

2552
02:38:11,201 --> 02:38:12,350
He's getting sponsors,
right.

2553
02:38:12,470 --> 02:38:16,580
He wouldn't get sponsors if it wasn't
for the fact that he's in the UFC.

2554
02:38:16,581 --> 02:38:19,830
It got some attention. I do this
already though. I do like a,

2555
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:23,420
when I fought Travis Browne and I fought
Arlovski, I asked the EOC, I said, hey,

2556
02:38:23,421 --> 02:38:27,260
I'm on the countdown. They said
no. I said, cool. Got a camera guy.

2557
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:30,350
Got It sponsored by a company who paid me.
Follow me around for four weeks.

2558
02:38:30,351 --> 02:38:34,370
I did my own four series videos.
You're very smart with that shit.

2559
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:35,840
You're very smart with marketing man.

2560
02:38:35,841 --> 02:38:38,720
You're very smart with the tee shirt
marketing for fighter and the kid.

2561
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:42,170
You got great cool t shirts like I can't
tell you how many shows I show up at a

2562
02:38:42,171 --> 02:38:46,130
dude's have fighter in the kid tee shirts.
That's awesome. Super, super common.

2563
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:48,200
Especially the the master Kim.

2564
02:38:51,130 --> 02:38:51,500
We just,

2565
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:54,860
I brought you guys takes about domestic
kid takes that dropped this Wednesday.

2566
02:38:54,890 --> 02:38:59,630
Gigantic. The mastercam is
gigantic. Yeah. As far as that.

2567
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:02,960
The whole Reebok in the sponge thing.
I can talk about it here.

2568
02:39:03,090 --> 02:39:07,460
A little talk about it. Dana
called you a liar and he said, and,

2569
02:39:07,461 --> 02:39:11,660
and I know you're not a liar and
I, you know, I love Dana. He's,

2570
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:15,770
he's been my friend for a long fucking
time. And if it wasn't for him,

2571
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:18,770
I wouldn't even be working for the UFC,
the UFC,

2572
02:39:18,771 --> 02:39:23,270
if he quit or the UFC got sold to someone
else, I would probably stop doing it.

2573
02:39:23,271 --> 02:39:26,270
I really would because I wouldn't
really want to work in any other kind of

2574
02:39:26,271 --> 02:39:28,190
environment working for ridiculous dude.

2575
02:39:28,191 --> 02:39:32,810
Like Dana is probably the only way I
could ever like be a sports commentator in

2576
02:39:32,811 --> 02:39:35,780
the first place.
But I know you're not a liar.

2577
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:38,990
So when he did that interview the other
day and he called you a liar, I was like,

2578
02:39:39,410 --> 02:39:43,880
this is a very unfortunate rift
between you two that I hate.

2579
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:48,350
Yeah. Drives me nuts. Well, the the thing
for me, I thought about it all last night.

2580
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:51,830
It's actually been keeping
me up. Um, really it has,

2581
02:39:51,831 --> 02:39:54,440
and I talked to my dad about
it whenever I knew this stuff.

2582
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:59,230
I talked to friends and family and May,

2583
02:39:59,510 --> 02:40:03,290
maybe I'm the, I'm not lying, but it
does nothing for me to prove this and,

2584
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:06,770
and do all this stuff. Because first
thing, first I'm team UFC, man,

2585
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,000
I want to have this platform.

2586
02:40:08,001 --> 02:40:11,000
I wouldn't have this fame or I won't be
able to make money that I'm doing now if

2587
02:40:11,001 --> 02:40:14,790
it wasn't for Dana White in the UFC.
So I'm anti Yossi in the least bit.

2588
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:19,410
So I'll talk to my dad. And it was, it
was kind of bothering me and my dad goes,

2589
02:40:19,411 --> 02:40:21,960
you don't know the,
the grand scheme of everything.

2590
02:40:21,990 --> 02:40:23,700
Maybe it helps out other fighters.

2591
02:40:23,701 --> 02:40:27,000
Maybe you're the exception where he made
great money and other fighters weren't

2592
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:30,480
and no one me,
he knows damn well I'd co sign on this if,

2593
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,510
cause I don't know the overall
plan of this Reebok deal.

2594
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:37,620
So if it helps the majority of fighters,
I'm on board, man. Like I said,

2595
02:40:37,621 --> 02:40:38,420
I'm team UFC.

2596
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:43,420
If it legitimizes the UFC with all the
other major sports programs I'm in,

2597
02:40:43,981 --> 02:40:44,880
man,
I'm in.

2598
02:40:44,920 --> 02:40:49,440
You were just eating a facto about your
sponsorships and that's where it got

2599
02:40:49,441 --> 02:40:54,140
weird because he said you were lying
about your sponsors, but, but then,

2600
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:57,440
but I talked to Dan, so I don't know
when that interview was. I talked to Dan.

2601
02:40:57,450 --> 02:40:58,051
He called me,

2602
02:40:58,051 --> 02:41:01,890
went over the sponsors and those sponsors
that he read on the show that that's

2603
02:41:01,891 --> 02:41:04,320
from a, that's from a banner.
Those aren't sponsors.

2604
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:07,110
Those are gyms that I train it.
Those aren't even sponsors.

2605
02:41:07,111 --> 02:41:10,050
And one sponsor that he said,
I just think he was misinformed.

2606
02:41:10,051 --> 02:41:13,110
Someone misinform them. I've never
heard that. That's not my sponsor.

2607
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:16,380
That's naming sponsor. I work.
When you have all the lists,

2608
02:41:16,381 --> 02:41:17,460
you mean you gave it to me.

2609
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:20,820
You gave me a list of all your sponsors
and what you actually got paid. Yeah,

2610
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:24,300
I can have it. I have proof. I have
tax returns. It's not about that.

2611
02:41:24,301 --> 02:41:26,520
It's not a bad thing you sent me.
Was that a tax return?

2612
02:41:26,950 --> 02:41:30,450
If that's the initial breakdown.
Yeah. Yeah. Well that's, that's it.

2613
02:41:30,451 --> 02:41:33,240
That settles the argument is
released that cause I don't want it.

2614
02:41:33,250 --> 02:41:37,140
It's not about that. I don't want to
get into this pissing contest with Dana.

2615
02:41:37,141 --> 02:41:40,650
I late you think two lanes? I
disagree. You're in a pissing contest.

2616
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:43,830
He pissed Tanya. Well, in
some on that Landsberg show,

2617
02:41:43,831 --> 02:41:46,990
he basically pulled his dick out. Peed
all over here. I agree. But my so,

2618
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:50,370
so what am I going to go to go to war
with Dan over this? Like I said, no,

2619
02:41:50,371 --> 02:41:52,940
you don't have to do anything.
I'm not the, I don't,

2620
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:55,560
I don't wanna be the Tito Ortiz of this
Reebok. Do you know what I'm saying?

2621
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:59,970
I fucking love the UFC man.
I love working for the UFC.

2622
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:03,480
There's a bigger picture here.
Beat. I might be the exception.

2623
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:07,710
I feel like fucking Adam Sandler and
Billy Madison when he's in class and he's

2624
02:42:07,711 --> 02:42:12,690
all core fill more like bore fell and
thinks it's funny and no one says shit.

2625
02:42:13,080 --> 02:42:18,080
Well I was the guy who went boar fill
and every other UFC fighters. Shit. Uh,

2626
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:22,530
we like this deal and I was like, Oh shit.
All right, well that's not true though.

2627
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:25,190
A lot of people don't like this deal.
So this is,

2628
02:42:25,290 --> 02:42:28,920
this is a deal that a lot of people
criticized that that's fine and you can't

2629
02:42:28,921 --> 02:42:30,330
criticize,
but listen to this,

2630
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:34,990
you'll see is no different than than a
Microsoft or an apple. There's gonna.

2631
02:42:35,010 --> 02:42:36,660
You gotta crack some
eggs to make an Omelet,

2632
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:40,530
so there's going to be some guy's upset.
But in the grand scheme of things,

2633
02:42:40,531 --> 02:42:44,850
it might be better for the overall
concept of all the UFC fighters. I Dunno.

2634
02:42:44,851 --> 02:42:46,680
Maybe I'm the exception,
you know what I'm saying?

2635
02:42:46,830 --> 02:42:50,640
But it doesn't do me any good to release
all this stuff and say, Dana's wrong.

2636
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:51,660
That's not what I'm about.

2637
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:56,310
I'm about being part of something bigger
than just myself, if that makes sense.

2638
02:42:56,610 --> 02:43:00,300
Okay. Yeah. I mean, look, it's
up to totally up to you. I mean,

2639
02:43:00,301 --> 02:43:04,890
you do what you gotta do. I don't have
to do any, if somebody might me liar,

2640
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:08,280
I would release the papers.
If I knew that I had everything on paper,

2641
02:43:08,281 --> 02:43:10,980
they would show that it wasn't a liar.
Like it doesn't make sense.

2642
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:12,700
Call you a liar.
It makes sense.

2643
02:43:12,701 --> 02:43:16,600
I ask you what you were getting paid
and then well can you send me that?

2644
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:20,380
That's like a rational conversation but
gets irrational when someone calls you a

2645
02:43:20,381 --> 02:43:24,130
liar when you know you're not a liar
and you do have the tax returns.

2646
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:27,820
That seems to me like the rational
response to that is to just show and then

2647
02:43:27,821 --> 02:43:31,540
maybe you guys could have like,
okay I was wrong. You know? Okay.

2648
02:43:31,541 --> 02:43:34,690
I didn't know that people were making
that much money cause I don't know if he

2649
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:39,070
actually knew how much money guys
like you who are very clever with your

2650
02:43:39,071 --> 02:43:42,610
marketing and really good at promoting
yourself, how much they were making.

2651
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:46,270
I mean he didn't obviously didn't talk
to you about it, how quickly talk to me,

2652
02:43:46,271 --> 02:43:49,980
but did you mean about the banner?
She said he was, he was talking about,

2653
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:53,410
and Dana doesn't owe me any fest thing.
Dana though it doesn't have to do shit.

2654
02:43:53,411 --> 02:43:55,330
Right. He's the captain of
the ship. I'm just, you know,

2655
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:57,910
I'm just watching this thing, man.
I'm just a guy that works on the ship.

2656
02:43:57,911 --> 02:44:00,430
So for Dana being the captain,
he doesn't owe me anything.

2657
02:44:00,431 --> 02:44:04,060
But if anyone just told me, said,
listen, Brendan, it's not about you.

2658
02:44:04,061 --> 02:44:08,230
It's better for the UFC. Cool. Oh Man.

2659
02:44:08,350 --> 02:44:12,190
I'm in a fortunate position where, listen
man, I don't ever have to fight again.

2660
02:44:12,191 --> 02:44:16,690
I've won. I've won the game. I'm not here
to fight this fight. I've won the game,

2661
02:44:16,691 --> 02:44:21,370
man. I don't ever have to fight again.
Do I want to? Yeah, I do. Do I have to?

2662
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:25,540
Nah, man. I don't have to do shit of a
successful podcasts of a sisal merchandise

2663
02:44:25,541 --> 02:44:26,140
business.

2664
02:44:26,140 --> 02:44:30,250
I surround myself with very successful
people are way smarter money like Joe

2665
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:33,280
Rogan, Brian Callen. You know what I'm
saying? Brian counts not smarter than you.

2666
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:37,360
I'll tell you right now,
dude. He definitely, you
know what I'm saying? So, so,

2667
02:44:37,420 --> 02:44:40,970
so for me, I do not, I'm not
getting this pissing contest right.

2668
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:44,230
If it's good for the UFC, it's
good for Brendan Shot. Okay, cool.

2669
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:47,040
Well that's not the answer I wanted
to here. Damn. I know people,

2670
02:44:47,170 --> 02:44:49,630
people wanted me to throw
grenades. Man. That's not my fight.

2671
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:53,430
I know it's not my fight. You know
how it goes, rather than I work.

2672
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:55,660
I was the one who wanted to get
you guys together and just like,

2673
02:44:55,661 --> 02:44:56,381
I love both of you.

2674
02:44:56,381 --> 02:44:59,140
I wanted to get you guys together and
just stop all this fucking Dick wave and

2675
02:44:59,141 --> 02:45:02,980
bullshit. I would love that, man. I'd
love to just sit down with them now.

2676
02:45:03,010 --> 02:45:05,320
Maybe we could do it. Yeah. Meanwhile,

2677
02:45:05,321 --> 02:45:09,880
we got the fucking main event coming
up here and take the time on this three

2678
02:45:09,881 --> 02:45:12,590
hour. How are we really, I just got
to reset everything so we don't, well,

2679
02:45:12,750 --> 02:45:15,520
let's reset it now. We'll
be right back, folks.

2680
02:45:15,521 --> 02:45:17,230
We're going to reset
this for the main event.
