1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,630
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,350
me and Brian,

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:02,921
this is like a,

4
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:05,470
we're almost at our sixth
anniversary right now.

5
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,910
This is our 600 versus,

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,660
I'm pretty sure it was,

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,260
it was totally this month,

8
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,461
but whenever it was,

9
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:13,450
it was definitely this month,

10
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,343
six years ago.

11
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,560
It's just fucking around on Ustream.

12
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,591
Just,

13
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:18,280
uh,

14
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,270
answering questions,

15
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:19,810

16
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,850
pre hib days.

17
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:21,780
I,

18
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,341
I mean,

19
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:23,450
I've banged a swinger,

20
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,840
uh,

21
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,740
in front of his wife,

22
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,680
Oh,

23
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,570
sorry,

24
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:26,951
in front of,

25
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,670
in front of him,

26
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,251
in front of him.

27
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,084
That dude,

28
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,880
I bang the wife,

29
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,280
the husband was watching,

30
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,930
why would you want that?

31
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,810
And I'm like,

32
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:36,951
right,

33
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,400
as long as we're,

34
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,600
nobody's fucking touching me,

35
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm good at just as long
as it's just women on me,

36
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:41,954
I'm good.

37
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,030
And this has got beaten off or anything.

38
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,710
The husbands and the
corn just stroking it.

39
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,140
When I was in la,

40
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:52,100
I moved a couple times.

41
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,670
I moved to Sierra Benita here in West
Hollywood and I moved into this shitty

42
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:56,960
building and the guy goes,

43
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,640
and this is before anybody
who knew Mitch was,

44
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,540
or he goes,

45
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,081
you're a comedian.

46
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:00,351
And I go,

47
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:00,501
yeah.

48
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:00,681
He goes,

49
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:00,801
well,

50
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,850
this is a standup comedian.

51
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:02,690
He lives right next to you.

52
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:03,410
And I go,

53
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,070
what's his name?

54
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,311
He goes,

55
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:04,551
I don't know,

56
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:05,241
Mitch something,

57
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:05,421
no,

58
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:06,254
whatever.

59
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,651
And I'm like,

60
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,071
I know it.

61
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:07,940
Never fucking heard of him.

62
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,420
And then you know about,

63
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,720
I'd say a month and a half later,

64
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,070
two months later I'm watching TV.

65
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,560
I was on the road somewhere
and he and my neighbors on the,

66
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:16,250
on Letterman.

67
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,521
And I go,

68
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:18,590
this guy's is funny as anybody
I've ever fucking heard of my life.

69
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,610
Scott lives next to me.

70
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,610
And then he did a joke about me
cause I used to bang on his wall,

71
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,960
play guitar or his wife
or his girlfriend did.

72
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,300
They used to have me sing alongs and shit,

73
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,031
not bang on the wall.

74
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:29,864
I could shut the fuck up.

75
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,763
And uh,

76
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,800
and I'm in shock crop.

77
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,013
Yeah.

78
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,741
And uh,

79
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:39,110
so Zoe from the Improv,

80
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,993
so yeah,

81
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,940
she was in New York one night.

82
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:41,331
She goes,

83
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,830
she was there to help Mitch put his,

84
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:43,430
let him and said,

85
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,821
she goes,

86
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,001
you know,

87
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:44,661
he has a bit,

88
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:48,230
it says Depaulo on the Napkin
that says Depalo on the Napkin.

89
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,350
And that's the bit of make
banging on the wall and he goes,

90
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,130
there's no doorknob.

91
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,963
Come around at some,

92
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,860
but something about the
door opening and a wall.

93
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,401
That's it.

94
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:58,880
It's up.

95
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,181

I've never said there'll
be a date I refuse.

108
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,240
Especially if people from La

Mark Babbitt.

115
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,340
I sent them a blank tape.

116
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,873
Okay.

117
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,280
You're earning your keep.

118
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,610
That's one thing I'd rather know
where I stand and get fucked with.

119
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,990
That's the leg I'm talking about.

120
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,830
Really?

121
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,730
You need a tape of me.

122
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,560
You just saw him at the store.

123
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,030
What the fuck do you leave?

124
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,090
If I'm good enough for Mitzi shore.

125
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,650
Why do you want to tape?

126
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,420
Who the fuck are you and your fucking
shit down to want to take from me?

127
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,490
I'm not the fucking major league.

128
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,880
Oh,

130
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,830
The comedy store.

You call me.

132
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,723
You want a date?

133
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,170
Go Fuck Yourself.

134
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm not sending you a fucking day.

135
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,100
It's against my fucking will.

136
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,820
I called like three or
four girls or girls.

137
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,091
Hey,

138
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,140
I think I've herpes.

139
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,123
Uh,

140
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:12,971
uh,

141
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:13,330
you should,

142
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,090
you should go get tested
and stop fucking dammit.

143
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,821
Like why am I,

144
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,651
I have a outbreak.

145
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,350
I have a herpes out.

146
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,420
There's no way there's anything else.

147
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
I have a herpes outbreak.

148
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,131
Yeah.

149
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,150
Cause what else could it be?

150
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,830
You just don't wake up and have a scab.

151
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,430
Exactly.

152
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,020
And then while I was hanging out,

153
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,920
I was hanging out the stand.

154
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,223
How many club?

155
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,730
Maybe the best club in New York.

156
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,310
But I'm talking to the owner and Pete Lee,

157
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:36,560
this comedian and tell them my problem.

158
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,513
And Pete was like,

159
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,451
where is it?

160
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,230
Like right underneath
the hood of Your Dick?

161
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:40,491
And I'm like,

162
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:40,731
yeah,

163
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:41,564
right there.

164
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,801
He's like,

165
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,690
I had something like this once.

166
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,070
It was like a penile tear.

167
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,680
Have you done anything like rough lately?

168
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,241
And I was like,

169
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:50,810
yeah,

170
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,900
actually I noticed it right
after unlubricated anal sex.

171
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,260
That's when I first noticed it,

172
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,110
but it just didn't go away.

173
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,490
And lucky you're alive.

174
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm lucky I'm alive.

175
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,020
And then I,

176
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,890
that's what it turned out to be.

177
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
How do you have unlubricated anal sex?

178
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,820
That's like fucking hard bro.

179
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,590
I worked with a Rickles this summer.

180
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,370
Oh,

181
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,203
so great.

182
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,960
My whole objective those two days
was I just want to be shit on by him.

183
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,640
I just watch.

184
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,510
I was just lobbing
stuff and I'm like done.

185
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,261
So,

186
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
uh,

187
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,660
we were working together two nights,

188
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:23,440
so like,

189
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,741
you know,

190
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,150
I have to that we're going to
know each other pretty well.

191
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,080
You think when we get back to la,

192
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:26,914
we're going to hang out.

193
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,680
Well,

194
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,450
don't push it.

195
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:28,961
Yeah.

196
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,321
You know,

197
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,610
and then I'm like waiting for him.

198
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:30,850
Right.

199
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,650
Just totally that I liked done.

200
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,503
Uh,

201
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,930
are you gonna Watch my act tonight?

202
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,860
I really appreciate it.

203
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:36,694
If you watch my act,

204
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,200
I am a little busy

205
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,601
and I get very involved.

206
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:42,070
I get involved in politics in Britain,

207
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,840
but not party politics.

208
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,520
But this lobbying for this,

209
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,200
spend money on the young,

210
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,910
spend money on the education system,

211
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,650
spend money on inspiration.

212
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,830
Make sure that there's a generation of
these great engineers and scientists that

213
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,120
the America is currently,

214
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:58,954
we're leading in.

215
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,823
Absolutely.

216
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,080
Um,

217
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,600
and make sure that they're still there.

218
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:03,100
It makes you,

219
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,911
and how do you get them?

220
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,744
How do you inspire them?

221
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,230
I don't want kids to one and be a singer
is actually particularly annex fact.

222
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,461
It's there.

223
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,510
I don't want them to be famous.

224
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,460
There's a survey done recently,

225
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:12,701
I think,

226
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,780
where they said to low skilled kids,

227
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,800
what'd you want to be when you grow up?

228
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,180
And,

229
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,371
and,

230
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,270
and a lot of them said,

231
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,104
famous.

232
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,310
Famous.

233
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,630
What do you mean famous?

234
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,890
You want to walk on the moon?

235
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:21,541
Don't you want to,

236
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,910
do you want to invent the
world's fastest computer?

237
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,753
Don't you do one then?

238
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,960
What'd you mean famous?

239
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,670
You've got to be famous for something.

240
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,060
So what are you or make you think
wearables is on the verge of extinction?

241
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,410
There's articles written about it.

242
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,670
Oh,

243
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,670
the instances of genital
crabs have drastically reduced
since the implementation

244
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,330
of pornographic,

245
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,164
visual,

246
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,360
vagina trimming and penis trimming.

247
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,680
Oh Wow.

248
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:44,831
Yeah,

249
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,430
because people would shave their pussies
and does not me not you let it wild.

250
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:48,990
Yeah.

251
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,160
100% man has got a afro pick in it,

252
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,800
but then the tires will come into the
change room and instead looking at,

253
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,480
they'll come and feel
your arms like a horse.

254
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,740
See how fit you are.

255
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,380
Look you up and down like
you're just a piece of meat.

256
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,390
Should I put money on him?

257
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,631
Yeah,

258
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:05,960
sure.

259
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,380
It looks pretty good or
it looks a bit flabby.

260
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,750
Nah,

261
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,051
Nah.

262
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:09,884
But on the other guy.

263
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,590
So we'll just check you out and talk
and to come and fill you and every touch

264
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,790
you touch your belly to see
if you have a strong stomach.

265
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,720
These are just gamblers,

266
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,650
gamblers,

267
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,640
and then fucking weird.

268
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,520
And then at them,

269
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,750
the change rooms next to
the Thai toilets as well.

270
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,070
So as they're coming in for a piece,

271
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:27,370
they might come out and
fill your ass white.

272
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,880
So kind of [inaudible] you got
pretty much pretty bizarre.

273
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,680
So a lightning bet is you assign a number,

274
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,480
an amount of money to each point
that the bat goes over or under,

275
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,290
which means if you lightening bet $1,000
on an over at one 80 once you hit the

276
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,814
over,

277
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,220
I get the chills saying,

278
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,910
once you hit the over every single
basket that gets hit in the game,

279
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,000
you win $1,000 every from both teams.

280
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Both teams on a basket from the
field is to grant a three pointers,

281
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,420
three grams every single bed housing.

282
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,910
So like the shakes you start to
get while you're watching her,

283
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,030
literally like they're,

284
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:18,920
they're visible.

285
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,641
It's almost like,

286
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,360
you know,

287
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,610
you're having a connection
and you have drank,

288
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,970
maybe coax calm you down and every
time a shot goes up it's like,

289
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,093
eh.

290
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,680
And to me it's the purest form of
degenerate gambling I've ever seen.

291
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,730
I brought you something.

292
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,050
Oh,

293
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,883
those yours.

294
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,870
Do you recognize those reading glasses?

295
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:39,770
Do you recognize those?

296
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,131
No,

297
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:40,750
I don't.

298
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,540
Sure.

299
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,320
Yes,

300
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,280
I think you left those bitches
at my house and like 2009 uh,

301
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,980
I think Lisa Loeb left these at
your house or your housing and nine,

302
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,470
they might be confused.

303
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,963
Sure.

304
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm,

305
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,141
I'm pretty sure.

306
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,974
Yeah.

307
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,103
Thanks brother.

308
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,170
Thanks for getting that same routes.

309
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,990
Adam is gentleman in a long
running tradition of people
leaving shit behind the

310
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:06,770
podcast.

311
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,470
Adam Corolla has left behind his glasses.

312
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,690
Oh my goodness.

313
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,610
I don't want to have your fucking glasses.

314
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,240
It'll talk to you

315
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,041
when you're surviving.

316
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,070
Getting teachers spirit,

317
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,580
animal food in plastic and then eat it
and then poop it out and eat it later.

318
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,530
Like I'm take the plastic off and eat it.

319
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,030
Jesus Christ.

320
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,080
It seems like it could work.

321
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,480
That's a technique I've never thought.

322
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,701
I mean,

323
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,890
if you're going to be like
on your own for five days,

324
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:32,850
you can eat a bunch of food,

325
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:35,970
but wrap it up in plastic and then later
poop it out then and take it out with

326
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:36,110
them.

327
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,070
How would you get the nutrients
from the food in the first place?

328
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,470
When we go to your stomach
in a piece of plot?

329
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:39,810
What is this?

330
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,620
Poop it out and understand and then you
poop it out like before you leave for

331
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:44,041
your trip,

332
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,340
go to go get stuffed like a
loss of market or something

333
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,260
where you're poorly thought out ideas
and they get a bunch of plastic.

334
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't tell him stop.

335
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,510
Can't,

336
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,770
can't tell guy to eat as poop.

337
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,250
No,

338
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,371
no,

339
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,204
no.

340
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,430
I'm saying like eat like a big meal
before you're about to leave and he would

341
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,264
eat his own food.

342
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,030
It's called the youth.

343
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,430
It's called second harvest and then
native Americans and maybe take a bunch of

344
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,250
like protein bars,

345
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,200
wrap them up in plastic,

346
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,250
eat it and then poop it out in a couple
of days and then unwrap the plastic they

347
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:13,590
need.

348
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,460
What kind of Shit?

349
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,160
Really think a fucking whole protein
bar in plastic can make it through your

350
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:20,994
digestive track.

351
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,350
Carry the bars in my backpack and
just eat him three days later.

352
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:29,460
Porous understanding of the
human digestive tract ever
exhibited on a podcast.

353
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,110
I was trying to figure
out what you were saying.

354
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,280
I thought you were saying eating poop.

355
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,050
You're not talking about a little Baggie
of heroin that a drug mule swallow.

356
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,960
I was thinking like,

357
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,310
maybe we're going to make you survive.

358
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:38,520
You'll,

359
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,400
you'll get another hour's worth of
energy from that little heroin bag.

360
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,820
What about petite filets and

361
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,280
he hated ounces wrapped in plastic.

362
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,270
You're going to die.

363
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,830
How long has uncle Paul been around for?

364
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,100
Well,

365
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,731
he started,

366
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:51,920
uncle Paul started is,

367
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,930
I've been doing calculus for years and
relationships long before I did them on

368
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:55,231
the radio.

369
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,470
I didn't to I my girlfriends,

370
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,610
he was uncle Larry many years ago.

371
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,970
There was Roger Davis or
Roger [inaudible] and uh,

372
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,880
this is long before chip that was
Roger and Roger had a brother Lester,

373
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,750
who was burned in a fire and unless was,

374
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,990
you've got a whole time,

375
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,130
like all storyline.

376
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,480
Lester was burned everywhere,

377
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,830
but his knees and his,

378
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,710
until he would always wear knickers to
show off his legs was a whole thing.

379
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,700
And Uncle Roger,

380
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,450
I know uncle,

381
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,890
uncle Larry and then emerged into
chip who my girlfriend hated so much.

382
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,550
Chip became the fucking
cause they would chip,

383
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,660
would embarrass people.

384
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,600
I did had literally before I
ever thought I'd do on the radio,

385
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,990
I would be out with girlfriends
and embarrass them by doing that.

386
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:34,260
Like we,

387
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,190
I'll just be making bad jokes in
the cab and my girlfriend and I,

388
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,100
you know a a gen and even grow up go home.

389
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,810
We just go shut the fuck up.

390
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,250
It's not funny and it made me so happy
and like this is what we're drive Jenny

391
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,260
crazy.

392
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,280
He'd be like a really nice steakhouse
and the way they would come over and she

393
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,380
would order like the salmon
and then chip just goes,

394
00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,250
how much is that?

395
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,050
I would ask the way
there and she was like,

396
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,370
do you know how humiliating it is
that people think I fucked that guy?

397
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,890
He puts think I'm fucking this guy

398
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,110
first.

399
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,330
I'm going to talk about the so called
philosophical issue of how long would we

400
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,164
want to live.

401
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,730
I find that quite remarkable that people
worry about this simply because it's

402
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:24,590
not the way that people actually
think about anything else.

403
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,650
When people ask me they
things off sometimes say,

404
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,993
okay,

405
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,840
take yourself back to the
first time you got light.

406
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,390
Oh yeah.

407
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:33,970
All right.

408
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,960
Now think about what you
were thinking at the time.

409
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,610
What are you thinking?

410
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,271
Oh my God.

411
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:40,691
Oh my God,

412
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:43,720
I have to get this person into bed right
now because I've only got another 60

413
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,710
years to live.

414
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,081
So what?

415
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,640
I mean it's just ridiculous.

416
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
The difference between

417
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,800
the feeling you get when you hear,

418
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:53,920
oh it was brain damage.

419
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,920
I sort of have that
feeling about everything.

420
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:57,731
You know,

421
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,051
if you,

422
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:58,241
if,

423
00:11:58,241 --> 00:11:58,940
if we,

424
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,130
if he gets a brain scan,

425
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,870
if he goes to trial now he
gets a brain scan and we,

426
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,710
and we find that his brain is just
massively damaged and all the right areas

427
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,140
that would have eroded
his impulse control.

428
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,131
Right.

429
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,950
That would seem to let him
off the hook a little bit.

430
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,860
Which he would,

431
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,570
he would look like someone who is unlucky
more than he would look like a bad

432
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,404
person.

433
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,160
Right.

434
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,560
And I sort of see bad
people as unlucky to,

435
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,140
I recognize that there's certain people
who are quite classically bad people.

436
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:27,430
There are psychopaths who you just,

437
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,680
not only can you not rely on them,

438
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:29,791
you,

439
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,740
you can rely on them to be bad actors,

440
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:32,951
you know,

441
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:33,201
so you,

442
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:33,361
you,

443
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,194
you have to,

444
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,200
you have to be in a posture of,

445
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,020
of self defense with
respect to these people.

446
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:38,960
But um,

447
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,700
I do view them as an unlucky
on some fundamental level

448
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,160
and hair was more of like
an eyelash for the vagina,

449
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,270
for periods and stuff.

450
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:50,120
So when and get everywhere
and that's why girls are,

451
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,013
that's not what it is.

452
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,861
The uh,

453
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,810
the butthole hair was
always disturbing though.

454
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,201
Yeah.

455
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,590
I don't like nobody ever liked the buddle
here cause some gals just did not know

456
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:59,120
what they're doing when Kim to wiping.

457
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:02,210
And back then nobody had a bad
day and nobody had baby wipes.

458
00:13:02,211 --> 00:13:03,920
It was toilet paper sometimes.

459
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,040
Some of it stuck around.

460
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,910
I said joints for a little GI.

461
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:08,744
Joe

462
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,440
[inaudible] super tightly rolled up.

463
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,370
This is hilarious.

464
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,851
Boy,

465
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:19,870
this is so bizarre.

466
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:20,704
Watching.

467
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,073
Hey,

468
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,770
get out of there.

469
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,770
So we're watching Kevin
Pereira and it's the attack on,

470
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,850
on twitch.

471
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,273
We'll get it gone.

472
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,850
I see your hearing loss looks,

473
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:36,280
Bro.

474
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,113
Fuck today.

475
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,790
Back with that.

476
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,653
Let's bring it out.

477
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:40,931
Wow.

478
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,100
This is very strange

479
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,110
studio Joe.

480
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:44,501
Just wait.

481
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,334
I'm going to give you the

482
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,763
now.

483
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,320
This is interesting.

484
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,560
[inaudible] it's freaking
me out now we've got the

485
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,063
bar

486
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,040
watching US watching them.

487
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,370
This is fucking rain.

488
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,510
I think we can time travel somehow.

489
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,590
I think we just did.

490
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,783
Look what we're doing.

491
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,140
We're showing his dick again.

492
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,320
Joe's got a full head of hair.

493
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:13,154
What's good?

494
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,050
Cause he's all so bizarre.

495
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,760
It's like a mailbox or whatever.

496
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,020
That movie was my voice.

497
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:18,830
She's got deeper.

498
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,600
Just ginger's trying too hard,

499
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:20,860
right?

500
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,760
Marianne's got a straw hat on Marianne
is she's the girl in the barn given out

501
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,380
handjobs no,

502
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:27,711
no,

503
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:27,891
no.

504
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:28,910
You marry your bro.

505
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:29,744
What the fuck?

506
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,400
No,

507
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
you married Mrs Howl.

508
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,120
Okay.

509
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
You gotta bring her a lot of jewelry,

510
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,700
but you married her look.

511
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh,

512
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,220
look at you.

513
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,790
Look at Maryanne's body in that.

514
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,270
Holy Shit.

515
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,350
She had that seventies body
to a little wider in the hips.

516
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,360
A little thick at the top of the leg,

517
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,000
but the flat ass

518
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,620
belly with the recess belly button.

519
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,430
Oh my God.

520
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,390
Any shots of the feet.

521
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,700
Joe Walsh is first of all,

522
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,280
an absolute king.

523
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:05,790
Like,

524
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,391
let me tell you,

525
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,900
he's one of the nicest guys
I've ever opened for a,

526
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,490
he's like so cool.

527
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:12,810
You'd think it'd be Joe was like,

528
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,021
Hey,

529
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm in the eagles.

530
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:14,910
Who the fuck are those?

531
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,170
It wasn't like that at all,

532
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:21,171
but we're eating a a deli tray and he
comes into the dressing room and he says,

533
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:21,961
Hey,

534
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:22,710
uh,

535
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,940
don't eat that shit.

536
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,811
And we're like,

537
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:25,230
well,

538
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,531
why?

539
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:25,861
And he goes,

540
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:26,091
ah,

541
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,520
you,

542
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,710
you don't know what's in there man.

543
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:29,161
You know,

544
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,690
it was just a Shitty Deli tray.

545
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:31,524
Don't eat it.

546
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,071
He's all,

547
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:33,300
I got sick before.

548
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:33,840
And I was like,

549
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,051
oh,

550
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:34,381
really?

551
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:34,681
And he goes,

552
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:34,891
yeah,

553
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:35,521
let me tell you.

554
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:35,870
He goes,

555
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,240
after he was out of the eagles,

556
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,740
he had a real low spot where he is
partying hard and cancel on gigs all the

557
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:44,400
time.

558
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,310
So he cleaned up and uh,

559
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,221
the manager said,

560
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,210
we're book a tour,

561
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,280
but if you cancel one show,

562
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,750
all the shows will be gone.

563
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,520
So the first night of the tour,

564
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,090
he's backstage eaten on the
Deli tray after sound check.

565
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,860
And about a couple of hours later he gets
mad food poisoning and he starts just

566
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:05,340
shitting and shitting and he's like,

567
00:16:05,341 --> 00:16:05,701
what am I,

568
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,441
I got to cancel.

569
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,081
And the manager goes,

570
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,550
you cancel this Gig.

571
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,880
The entire tour is gone.

572
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,080
So they go to Kmart or whatever was open
and they get the rubber fishing waders.

573
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,260
He puts him on the ones
that go up to your tits.

574
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:19,800
They were like,

575
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,910
we river runs through it,

576
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:21,744
fly fishing.

577
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,280
He gets on stage and just going at it,

578
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,420
why are you shitting?

579
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,440
Like every couple,

580
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,580
like every few minutes.

581
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,750
Oh,

582
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,210
oh,

583
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,043
you're

584
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,250
shitting into rubber winning

585
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,201
Joe.

586
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,550
He didn't expect this.

587
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,520
But the heat from the lamp
started burning the diary

588
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,560
acids on his legs

589
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,750
and no one looked at Joe Walsh awareness
cause he wore weird shit all the time.

590
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,160
He showed tonight

591
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,970
shitting himself with just
sometimes mean regular fresh say.

592
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,913
Oh.

593
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,270
Sounded like last night
I thought yesterday.

594
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:12,960
I,

595
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,201
you know,

596
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,890
when you stay away from seafood
for awhile and then reintroduce it,

597
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,630
there's bacteria in like,

598
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:18,811
you know,

599
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,300
it's different since shellfish and Sushi.

600
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,120
And I,

601
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,953
I,

602
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,611
I thought when,

603
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,450
I guess when I farted,

604
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:27,990
it sounded like somebody was throwing
up like the front sounded like a guy

605
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:28,824
going,

606
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,181
you know,

607
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:30,331
I,

608
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,410
I've only shaved my ass once in my life,

609
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,710
but once I did,

610
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,431
oh my God,

611
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,050
my farts sounded so different.

612
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,520
Really?

613
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,631
Oh,

614
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:39,480
they were all like wet and sloppy.

615
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,040
It's a hair kind of different.

616
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,730
The hair on your ass literally changes
the way your farts smell or sound rather.

617
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,100
Right.

618
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,000
Smell this smell the same,

619
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,320
but they sound different.

620
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,693
Plop,

621
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,000
plop,

622
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,833
plop.

623
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,910
Somebody tells me king
her but doesn't shave.

624
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,130
That's a whole new area he'd get into.

625
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:03,300
That's a whole monster.

626
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,830
That guy dating that guy.

627
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,110
He doesn't have a
girlfriend or girlfriend.

628
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,290
He scrapes up his youtube,

629
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,420
like add video money.

630
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,150
Then then he gets a hooker farts on her.

631
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:20,911
Like,

632
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,241
no,

633
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,074
I hate it.

634
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,700
You fucking loser

635
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,893
my videos of,

636
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,670
no you don't.

637
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,040
And then you come out of it and you
slowly come out of it and you were like,

638
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:39,760
noise canceling headphones.

639
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,140
I'm just at a doctor's office,

640
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:42,250
like in a weird,

641
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,031
not even weird,

642
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:47,380
like those like 1970s doctors'
offices that you see in la,

643
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:50,350
like just sort of a shitty
elevator and whatever.

644
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,743
Um,

645
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,620
so when I came out of the first one,

646
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:54,454
I was like,

647
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,130
it was rough because hey,

648
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,610
I didn't know it was
going a trip like that.

649
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,020
And B,

650
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,040
I had been,

651
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,370
I didn't get a ton of sleep
the night before and uh,

652
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,300
so I was,

653
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,320
and I'd flown that day.

654
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,780
It was just kind of groggy and uh,

655
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,260
and I felt really shitty
and it took me like,

656
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:11,860
I was like,

657
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,760
after I was done,

658
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:15,910
I probably laid in the bed
there for like an hour.

659
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,690
So it was like,

660
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,190
I can't do shit right now.

661
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,970
Like I can't,

662
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,170
I could barely stand.

663
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,680
So the first it was rough and,

664
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:24,160
uh,

665
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,731
and that,

666
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,340
and I still felt shitty
that night and I was like,

667
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,660
I don't think I'm going to do it again.

668
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,920
Like that was too rough.

669
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,761
And,

670
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:31,594
um,

671
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,650
then I woke up Tuesday morning
and felt fucking great.

672
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,440
I was like,

673
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,273
oh,

674
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,070
um,

675
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,060
I got to do it again.

676
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,200
666 podcasts dunk and he
could do whatever you want.

677
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,890
It can be only one for the
666 podcasts to be you,

678
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:48,950
Jim,

679
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,140
or have a grill you dated.

680
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:50,974
Kill herself.

681
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,713
No,

682
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,873
they should have.

683
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,640
I put that fucking helmet Grad Committee.

684
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,530
You fucking Dick

685
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,410
to yourself the first time and
when you get to your destination,

686
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,910
I'll say Karen.

687
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,401
Yeah,

688
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:09,880
she was cool.

689
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,530
Smart.

690
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,060
Oh,

691
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,700
she cool.

692
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:11,930
Shoot.

693
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,763
When you went like this.

694
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:13,983
She was,

695
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,003
she's all right.

696
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:15,641
Smart Guy.

697
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:16,780
I wouldn't go with fucking great.

698
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,340
Great's intense.

699
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,171
Great.

700
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,130
Might be a little intense
and too much of a big word.

701
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,000
It'd be a little hyperbole there may
never seen one of her parents about that.

702
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,113
Fuck.

703
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,030
I swear to God,

704
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,700
I have never seen her not wanting,

705
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,600
never seen her work.

706
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,031
Not all.

707
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,080
How dare you not do
research for that episode.

708
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:34,810
Yeah.

709
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:34,991
Well,

710
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:35,500
I know she's,

711
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,333
I went,

712
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,060
yeah,

713
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,240
she does some heavy shit to
almost too much where you go,

714
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:40,481
okay,

715
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,220
well that can't be,

716
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,571
well I,

717
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,101
my podcast,

718
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:42,840
she said,

719
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,673
uh,

720
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,940
her skin was bad because she was
taking in her van and Tom said,

721
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:47,140
I,

722
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,910
you're taking in too much testosterone.

723
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,140
Too many loads.

724
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,973
Yeah.

725
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,843
Jesus Christ.

726
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,010
You got a whore on your
hands for testing cure.

727
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,940
Imagine if you'd taken somebody loads
and it changes your biological profile.

728
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,380
You imagine if you're just dating a girl,

729
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,640
shut down my fucking face.

730
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,391
Keeps breaking out.

731
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:04,870
What's happening?

732
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,700
These fucking guys
busting all over my face,

733
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,840
man in her.

734
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,050
Oh,

735
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,561
you're in Jeff.

736
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,110
So much come in her body.

737
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,380
Yeah,

738
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,131
probably annually.

739
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,770
A lot of it and go,

740
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,663
ah,

741
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,710
it doesn't make that
noise when I'm coming,

742
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:21,544
unless I'm fine.

743
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,410
Yeah,

744
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,420
I've never had that noise
cause something hot about that.

745
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,050
There's something hot about that though.

746
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,840
I would agree with you with asa.

747
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,163
I agree.

748
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,350
I like a turbo slot and so I always have
always will do to like contact asa and

749
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,630
have her print up that shirt

750
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,120
with glitter.

751
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,230
I'll bake you a shirt.

752
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Asa Hashtag [inaudible] why don't
we make them all wear turbans.

753
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,790
Talked to mark it my map too.

754
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,001
No,

755
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:49,670
it's not.

756
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,503
No,

757
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,150
I met a,

758
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,210
I met a woman at one of
my shows in Brooklyn.

759
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:06,960
She had no hands or feet.

760
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,003
What happened to her?

761
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,580
Well,

762
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,080
she came up to me after the show and
she like wanted to like give me a hug.

763
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:13,351
She was like,

764
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:14,280
you're so funny.

765
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,470
And she had like these stubs and she said,

766
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,770
you remind me of the girls who
did my nails when I had hands.

767
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,363
And I was like,

768
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,383
whoa.

769
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,300
Then like I said so much to tape,

770
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,580
it was like racism,

771
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,513
Korea,

772
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,443
Vietnam,

773
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,080
what the fuck?

774
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,933
Oh,

775
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,973
I was like,

776
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,570
I was thinking like I want to bring
it up if I just met her any other way.

777
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,990
Right.

778
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,660
But since she brought up her hand,

779
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,171
I was like,

780
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:48,120
what happened to your hands?

781
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,820
And she said that she had,

782
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:51,110
um,

783
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,010
something wrong with her appendix went
to the hospital and the doctor put the

784
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:56,844
wrong name,

785
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,070
like mixed up her charts and they
amputated her hands and her feet

786
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,740
when she was only supposed to get
her appendix taken out or something.

787
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,603
Very minor.

788
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,350
What?

789
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,233
Yeah,

790
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,451
like I did,

791
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:13,990
uh,

792
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,130
my friend Sam Cedars,

793
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,040
a podcast a couple of weeks back and,

794
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,540
and he said,

795
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,950
I don't want to give away with the movies.

796
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,281
I said,

797
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:21,911
listen man,

798
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:25,390
it's not that kind of movie in a hinges
largely on the fact that I survived

799
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:26,530
rapes as a child.

800
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:26,651
Well,

801
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:26,950
I got,

802
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,480
I heard from several people said,

803
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,291
you know,

804
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,360
you really should have had
a trigger warning on there.

805
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,050
And it's like,

806
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,260
what the fuck do you shake?

807
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:34,094
I was doing,

808
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,620
what the fuck do you think I was doing
when I said it hinges largely I was

809
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,170
warning you that what it
was about right there.

810
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,870
But someone has empowered you to,

811
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,220
to have a way to take
issue with me because

812
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,890
I'm not completely basing.

813
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,733
I like,

814
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,340
you know,

815
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,080
the whole world isn't based around me.

816
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,180
Even though I got raped
when I was four years old.

817
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,240
Everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms
of that all the time because they'd

818
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,670
been through their own shit and they're
dealing with their own shit and they're

819
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,570
trying to survive.

820
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,880
So if I can make them more
sensitive to this issue,

821
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:03,890
if I can show them that
it matters to them,

822
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,770
the,

823
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,760
that they deal with other people who
have been through this kind of trauma and

824
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:11,270
we want to reduce it as
much as absolutely possible,

825
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,403
that's good.

826
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,370
But after that,

827
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,630
if I'm going to find a way to set up a
situation where I'm always the injured

828
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:22,550
party and that prove again and again
that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking

829
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:23,570
in terms of me,

830
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,690
then I'm never going
to get fucking hailed.

831
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,530
I'm never going to get fucking healed.

832
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,100
So one I did was I went out
and I try to help other people.

833
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:32,510
When I help other people,

834
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,160
I realized how far along I've come and I
realized there's really something in it

835
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,600
for me to do that.

836
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,670
And it's not like I'm this altruistic guy.

837
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:42,440
It's like I'm saving my own life.

838
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,801
And you know,

839
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,500
looked at AOL investigation
that took such courage to do it.

840
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,220
No.

841
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,100
What would have taken courage was turning
my back on those kids and walking away

842
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,390
going like,

843
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,631
Ooh,

844
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,120
I don't want to know
what's going on in there.

845
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,610
I,

846
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,980
how would I live with that guy?

847
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,600
How would I live with myself then?

848
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,151
But they,

849
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:57,351
you know,

850
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:57,651
like I,

851
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,101
it was nice.

852
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:58,700
Everyone said,

853
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,311
Oh gee,

854
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,610
that what he went through when
he was doing that investigation.

855
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:03,620
What about the kids in
the fucking pictures?

856
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,540
That's what I want everyone to know about.

857
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,040
Thanks for caring about me.

858
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,470
But it's the kids in the
pictures I give a shit about.

859
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,840
It's the kids that are suffering
right now somewhere within the Sada,

860
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,693
my voice,

861
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,230
someone you know,

862
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,900
I mean in this broadcast,

863
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,910
like where this is on someone in the
next apartment or wherever some kid is

864
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:24,440
going through this shit,

865
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,420
have the courage to know about it.

866
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,260
That's all I asked.

867
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:32,000
You have the courage to know about it
and save the contemporary children so you

868
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:34,310
don't have to deal with
a much a fucking maniac.

869
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,710
Abuse survivors went up.

870
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,730
That's all.

871
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,480
And if anybody can diffuse the
arounds Cape guys coming in now,

872
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,000
not everybody agrees.

873
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,571
I don't,

874
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,570
I don't know anybody who doesn't
think that these shootings,

875
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,700
police shootings are horrific,

876
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,950
but to to interrupt a guy who
is easily the most liberal.

877
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,660
That's what was going to say is that
of all the candidates for president,

878
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,490
a guy who is the most diverse and guy who
march with Martin Luther fucking king.

879
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,970
Yeah,

880
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,100
he marched in the civil rights movement.

881
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,340
He's been a civil rights advocate
since the 1960s and they interrupt his

882
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,770
presidential speeches.

883
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,630
You don't have a theory
that a lot of these,

884
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,920
a lot of these folks,

885
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,100
the Che Avera wearing
tee shirt wearing guys,

886
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,850
they want to feel part of a greater cause.

887
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,510
Yes.

888
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,910
So even though many of those
battles have passed them by they,

889
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,680
they'd been one,

890
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,240
I mean rights,

891
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,941
civil rights.

892
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:29,151
I mean,

893
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:30,320
of course there's still racism,

894
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,320
but in terms of institutionalized
and then a criticism,

895
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,630
we certainly are much better
than we were 50 years ago.

896
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,231
But yet,

897
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:36,441
you know,

898
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,310
they're young kids,

899
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:38,390
they revolutionary,

900
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:39,620
they're wearing Che Guevara,

901
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,370
you know,

902
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,890
Viva La Revolution and they have
to engage in this kind of behavior.

903
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,000
30 years from now,

904
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,700
they'll watch that youtube clip and
they'll think they're a bunch of buffoons.

905
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:47,881
Well,

906
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:48,780
I think anytime you,

907
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,760
you could spend resources on something
that's going to directly affect the youth

908
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,970
of society and sending them a message
about what is right and what is wrong.

909
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,090
Um,

910
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,391
you know,

911
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,300
having grown up in a,

912
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,380
in a sporting household myself,

913
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,090
a three daughters,

914
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,650
which,

915
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:06,901
you know,

916
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,950
played sports growing up and I look at
kind of what I went through and what my

917
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:14,820
daughters have gone through in the life's
lessons that you learn in sports that

918
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:18,450
transcends sports and learn
how to work under pressure,

919
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:20,370
how to work as a team,

920
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,900
how to individually succeed.

921
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,910
There's so many great
lessons to be learned,

922
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,980
the health aspects of,

923
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,221
you know,

924
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,480
being healthy and working out.

925
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,660
All of a sudden you
introduce into that equation,

926
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:31,801
number one,

927
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,430
breaking the rules,

928
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,420
breaking the rules.

929
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,351
And so there's,

930
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,184
you know,

931
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,200
the ethics to look at surrounding it.

932
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,790
And number two,

933
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,301
you know,

934
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:43,920
ultimately there can be risk and health
consequences with using these things,

935
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,360
especially if you're young doing that.

936
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,194
So,

937
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,650
you know,

938
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,011
again,

939
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:48,630
going back to the message,

940
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:53,631
I think that it's sent to our kids and
two parents with where I think society

941
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:58,470
was going back then with the
pervasive use of drugs in sports,

942
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:02,010
I think was a positive one that's
going to benefit people positively.

943
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,060
And I think it did.

944
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,200
It did have an impact.

945
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,650
How much does that guy way
about how tall is he rather uh,

946
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,520
find the stats,

947
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,310
but yeah,

948
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,143
find a stats.

949
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:10,710
If he,

950
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,400
it depends.

951
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,330
I mean he could be like five,

952
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:15,750
seven and he'd still be
230 pounds built like that.

953
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:16,950
He's a fucking giant.

954
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:17,784
He's beautiful.

955
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,663
You like it?

956
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,951
Six feet tall,

957
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:20,784
two 20.

958
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,840
It's just an ape filled with
fucking testosterone and fury.

959
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,611
God Damn,

960
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,444
that's an athlete.

961
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,510
That's about as strong an athlete is.

962
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,760
You get human vans there,

963
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,360
like,

964
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,193
you know,

965
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,480
great slave auction back in the day.

966
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,400
And this is just a stat that,

967
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,670
that I like to sum that grips my heart.

968
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:46,110
So that's why I want to say it now.

969
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:46,321
But,

970
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:47,070
um,

971
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,610
I mean,

972
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:47,820
I,

973
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,990
I think I looked it up right before I
got in in here and it was around 11,000

974
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,790
people that a bullet took,

975
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,620
took out 11,000 people.

976
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:56,454
That's a ton.

977
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,150
It's a ton.

978
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,380
It's a brutal crisis.

979
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,500
But I just remember the uproar that,

980
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,030
that and the fear,

981
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,040
like the outcry that that
happened publicly all over
the United States and only

982
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,830
a couple people got it here and then,

983
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,971
and still,

984
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:12,660
that's terrible.

985
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,493
Um,

986
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,360
but whenever I compare that 11,000
people total in this Ebola crisis,

987
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,670
and then the stat for children,

988
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,260
and this is on water for his website
and stuff and on ours and dude,

989
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:28,440
it's what I want to fight and let people
know because there should be a real

990
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,730
public outcry and uproar that 5,000 kids,

991
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,820
5,000 kids under the
age of five years old,

992
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,490
die every single day,

993
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,590
every single day because of dirty water,

994
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,360
because of water borne disease,

995
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,730
because of waterborne illness.

996
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,270
That's a legit stat from like UNICEF
or one of those like legit places,

997
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,201
5,000,

998
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,490
5,000 a day.

999
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,570
It's like,

1000
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,890
it fluctuates from like 4,700
or something to 5,000 a day.

1001
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,091
And like for me,

1002
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:58,331
man,

1003
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:58,630
I've,

1004
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:58,930
I've,

1005
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,310
I've held two of those children.

1006
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:00,700
You know,

1007
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,030
I've,

1008
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,450
I've,

1009
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,530
I've dug the grave,

1010
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,000
I've had blisters on my hands.

1011
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:08,440
I've had a little dude named Andy
bow his blood on my hands and like,

1012
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,220
like Bro,

1013
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,053
it's,

1014
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,470
it,

1015
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,430
it wrecks me.

1016
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,070
And like that's why I'm so
passionate about this thing.

1017
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:15,904
And like

1018
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,460
I come back and like I,

1019
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,050
I get it a bolus terrible and we need to
knock it out because it can take out so

1020
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:23,621
many people,

1021
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,490
but why?

1022
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,550
Why are people not like,

1023
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,230
why don't they have their eyes open?

1024
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:34,231
Their ears open their heart
open to hearing about 5,000
kids dying every day up

1025
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,160
into the funeral of five other kids.

1026
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,670
I've seen the grave of nine or
10 others besides that like,

1027
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,110
and these are just among the pygmies.

1028
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,280
I've been to the,

1029
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,990
I've seen the funerals going on of the,

1030
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:44,890
of their oppressors,

1031
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:48,310
like the slave masters and the Mokpala
than on pygmies that surround them.

1032
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,040
Their kids are dying to
dirty water and it's not,

1033
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,780
I don't,

1034
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,770
I don't mean to go crazy,

1035
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:54,251
but no,

1036
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,120
it's not crazy at all.

1037
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,100
It's an that that statistic is crazy.

1038
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:57,290
Yeah.

1039
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,111
Most adorable,

1040
00:30:58,111 --> 00:30:59,340
nicest people in their world,

1041
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,174
but yet look at that.

1042
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,350
You said [inaudible].

1043
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,260
Do you not like the word world?

1044
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,580
I don't like world.

1045
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,020
Is that how you say world?

1046
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,370
How do you say it?

1047
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,910
W O r a l d r before the,

1048
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,210
oh,

1049
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,210
it rolls off the tongue easier then
go world world world world Bor old.

1050
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,820
How do you say that world?

1051
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:20,730
No,

1052
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,310
no you don't say it like I said the world.

1053
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,200
How'd he say we're old now?

1054
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:26,070
That's the right way.

1055
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,180
That's why I say no.

1056
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:28,530
You say rural old.

1057
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,790
How does he say at Jamie?

1058
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,710
You say Debbie entourage.

1059
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,870
It's the best thing in the world.

1060
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,540
World world.

1061
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,801
Okay,

1062
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:41,700
keep saying it like that.

1063
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:42,534
We're good.

1064
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,530
You say world world world.

1065
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,610
No,

1066
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,470
he doesn't even say world world.

1067
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,420
This is a world w.

1068
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,161
R o.

1069
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:53,670
L.

1070
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:53,671
D.

1071
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:54,271
That's what you say.

1072
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:55,830
We're all old rod.

1073
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,721
The best thing of the war,

1074
00:31:56,721 --> 00:32:01,140
all the old wound doesn't matter
if you are do nothing bitch.

1075
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:04,740
All you do is spend somebody else's money
and try to look pretty like that's all

1076
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,270
you do is you use stuff up,

1077
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,350
you use up resources and you give nothing
and so you're pretty much a drain on

1078
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:11,184
society.

1079
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,260
That's what I think they,

1080
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,580
they don't think it that way.

1081
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,110
They think what they are is something
that all these men want to fuck low.

1082
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,100
So in,

1083
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:22,770
in working really hard to attain this,

1084
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,880
this appearance and all
these men want to fuck that.

1085
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,440
Uh,

1086
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,201
the what they are,

1087
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:28,411
they've,

1088
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:30,030
they've created capital.

1089
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,160
They've created like a need for this.

1090
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,080
I was just brought up to think that it
wasn't your mission in life to be happy.

1091
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,250
It was your mission in life to leave
world better than how you found

1092
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,431
it.

1093
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,480
And by being a comeback,

1094
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:41,631
right,

1095
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:42,464
you're not going to do that.

1096
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,920
So I go to Chicago and it's this Italian,

1097
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,090
I'm not gonna use any real names
because if people are still around,

1098
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,500
so it was the one,

1099
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,330
this thing instead of golf course,

1100
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,380
and they say to me,

1101
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,431
listen,

1102
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,390
there's a priest here,

1103
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:56,931
so can you,

1104
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:57,980
so keep your act,

1105
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:58,360
you know,

1106
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,801
clean it.

1107
00:32:58,801 --> 00:32:59,650
Then I said,

1108
00:32:59,680 --> 00:32:59,931
okay,

1109
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:00,764
fine.

1110
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,671
So I got up on,

1111
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:02,960
I do my little act to find,

1112
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:03,261
thank you,

1113
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:03,621
applause,

1114
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:04,460
applause to sit down.

1115
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,550
So this gangster guy gets up,

1116
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:07,970
you know,

1117
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,211
he goes,

1118
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:08,390
oh,

1119
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,630
welcome y'alls tutors.

1120
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,580
You notice this place
and wasn't going to say,

1121
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,421
Oh shit,

1122
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:14,691
I forgot.

1123
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,524
I was going to say,

1124
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:15,891
and what?

1125
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:16,131
He said,

1126
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:16,461
Shit.

1127
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,294
The priest went

1128
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,120
like this.

1129
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,511
The guy goes,

1130
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:21,344
well,

1131
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,741
hey,

1132
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:22,574
fuck,

1133
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,470
you got your 10 grand on a fucking bag.

1134
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,830
It just goes crazy and has got,

1135
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,650
and then places just,

1136
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,570
everybody's just just frozen with theater.

1137
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:33,951
This guy,

1138
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:36,080
he's just like crazy
and the priest was like,

1139
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,050
he's holding this bag
with the 10 grand in it,

1140
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,480
you know?

1141
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,320
And then he sits now

1142
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,551
sometimes I'm sitting there,

1143
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:42,111
the guy come late,

1144
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:42,301
Jay,

1145
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:43,070
come in.

1146
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,251
He goes,

1147
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,120
let me ask you something.

1148
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,021
You know,

1149
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,531
stolen,

1150
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:45,800
right?

1151
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:45,971
I said,

1152
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:46,061
why?

1153
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:47,930
I don't know him but
you rocky just come out.

1154
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:50,390
This is 1976 I said,

1155
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:50,961
I don't know him.

1156
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,381
I mean,

1157
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,214
I met him,

1158
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:52,480
you know,

1159
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,930
we ask them to do this dinner,

1160
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,340
this benefit today.

1161
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:55,761
And he said,

1162
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:56,570
no.

1163
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,403
He said No.

1164
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,633
And I said,

1165
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,150
well,

1166
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,500
I mean maybe he was busy.

1167
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,400
He scratch screaming at me.

1168
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:04,980
I go,

1169
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,571
you're right.

1170
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:07,730
I'm sure be fine.

1171
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,833
He goes up,

1172
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,823
he goes up,

1173
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,551
this is,

1174
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:10,821
come on,

1175
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:11,660
let's play some golf.

1176
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,200
Honestly,

1177
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,033
I don't really play golf.

1178
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,740
Play golf on our golf carts and my point
in this golf cart and we drive out to

1179
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:19,850
about the 12th hole.

1180
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:20,990
Let me get to the 12th hole.

1181
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,080
And there are these kind of 50,

1182
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,490
60 year old prostitutes,

1183
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,160
topless with leopard skin print,

1184
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,300
mini skirts,

1185
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,320
handing out drinks.

1186
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:33,140
It was like the craziest day of my life.

1187
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:36,770
But this guy was like
a true psycho criminal.

1188
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,053
Get fucking

1189
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,750
all the agents in there and
being like speaking of lucrative,

1190
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:43,090
I was winning with Ian
Edwards this weekend.

1191
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,380
I know Greg Fitzsimmons and Ian and I
were a flying home and we were at the

1192
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:47,841
terminal.

1193
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:49,420
What we ran into this girl that,

1194
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:49,750
uh,

1195
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,583
Ian knew,

1196
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:50,950
uh,

1197
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,020
from the store and
apparently she's a stripper.

1198
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:53,861
And,

1199
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:54,220
uh,

1200
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,671
she,

1201
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:54,821
uh,

1202
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,370
we were sitting down having a coffee
and she asked if she could sit with us.

1203
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:57,581
I said,

1204
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:57,790
yeah,

1205
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,180
sure,

1206
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,421
go ahead.

1207
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:59,170
Sit with us.

1208
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,730
And so she started talking about working
at spearmint Rhino Strip in and this

1209
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:04,091
and that.

1210
00:35:04,091 --> 00:35:07,580
And she worked this weekend and
she was coming back and you know,

1211
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,550
she was just talking to him,

1212
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,340
you know,

1213
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,980
everybody was cheap and this and that,

1214
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:11,814
that and this.

1215
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,410
And then she said she was
working with this girl,

1216
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:16,780
she's working with this girl and the girl.

1217
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,170
Uh,

1218
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,003
and I go,

1219
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,401
I go,

1220
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:23,170
what percentage of the girls that you
work with are willing to have sex with

1221
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,004
guys for money?

1222
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,090
And she's like,

1223
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,923
um,

1224
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,160
there's quite a few.

1225
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,821
She goes,

1226
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,490
I worked with this one girl
this weekend who was like,

1227
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,340
how lucrative do you get?

1228
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,531
And she goes,

1229
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:35,100
what?

1230
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,521
She goes,

1231
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,780
how lucrative too you get.

1232
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,420
Cause I get,

1233
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,490
I be getting lucrative.

1234
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,910
And,

1235
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,730
and she goes,

1236
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,920
what do you mean Luke?

1237
00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:46,500
And if she is,

1238
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,161
I'll go,

1239
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,070
I'll go back to a dude's
hotel room for $1,000.

1240
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:50,904
I'll get lucrative,

1241
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,940
lucrative,

1242
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,773
lucrative.

1243
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,990
And this girl was married to a guy,

1244
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,540
apparently that is not gay,

1245
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,170
but is a dancer and dances for men.

1246
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,710
And he does,

1247
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,730
he's gay for pay.

1248
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:05,881
Yeah,

1249
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:06,440
he's gay.

1250
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,490
It's like her husband is her husband.

1251
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,900
He's like,

1252
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,440
five guys were on a train on,

1253
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,870
it's so fucking unacceptable,

1254
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,350
dude.

1255
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:16,860
Hey,

1256
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,080
one night he doesn't have to
work for the rest of the month.

1257
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,093
Okay,

1258
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,993
how's that?

1259
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,860
How's your sleep?

1260
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:23,694
Are you sleeping well?

1261
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,683
Is Everything good

1262
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,230
you out of your fucking mind?

1263
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,240
He's lucrative.

1264
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,193
He's real.

1265
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,670
But he's that guy now
that really is who he is.

1266
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,290
He's like all the time,

1267
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,050
24 hours.

1268
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,150
You call him up in the
middle of the night.

1269
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:39,984
He's dice man.

1270
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:40,700
Yeah.

1271
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,640
He became that guy.

1272
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,551
Yeah,

1273
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:43,384
we uh,

1274
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,100
I opened up for him for like two,

1275
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,931
three years.

1276
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:46,701
She really,

1277
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:46,960
yeah,

1278
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,120
he picked me out of the comedy story.

1279
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:50,740
He came up to me and uh,

1280
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,000
at first he goes,

1281
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,834
um,

1282
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,940
you know what you should do.

1283
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,700
I said,

1284
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,533
what?

1285
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,490
When you go on stage,

1286
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,290
put a shock

1287
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,250
pants and then you'll be like the
comedian who's just got a big cock

1288
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,883
and this is like,

1289
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,150
this is like my guy I looked up to

1290
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,660
and he's telling me.

1291
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,730
And then I actually went home that night.

1292
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:16,564
Gone.

1293
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,603
Should I do,

1294
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,030
should I be cat gay,

1295
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,603
uh,

1296
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,200
fucking Connor exam?

1297
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,590
Man.

1298
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,080
I appreciate the fuck out of that guy.

1299
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,983
That guy is doing.

1300
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,370
He's getting the eyes on the sport.

1301
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,340
Yeah,

1302
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,150
he rob.

1303
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,100
You're really pisses me off.

1304
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:35,190
I feel like just tell him when
he was in the fucking pressure,

1305
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,730
but I wanted to rape him so bad.

1306
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,241
Of course.

1307
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:37,761
Wanting to kill him.

1308
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:38,141
I want to back.

1309
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:40,300
You know what car you can blow
me like a cup of hot soup.

1310
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,940
You son of a bitch but low
me on like a cup of hot soup.

1311
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,873
How's that work?

1312
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,730
You blow on a cup of hot soup.

1313
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,563
Is that what it is?

1314
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,070
Yeah.

1315
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,903
Okay.

1316
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,173
I don't,

1317
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,810
but if he just blows you like that.

1318
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,630
That's why it's confusing.

1319
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,040
The vernacular is really odd.

1320
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,300
Like blow jobs.

1321
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,380
I don't understand where that

1322
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,481
blow me.

1323
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:00,880
Like a couple hot soup first time.

1324
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,631
First Time.

1325
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:02,464
There you go.

1326
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:02,790
Yeah.

1327
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,670
I've never heard that one before.

1328
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:04,504
I've been around

1329
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,320
the destination of the species,

1330
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,870
the way that men and women
interact with each other.

1331
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,470
It's becoming poisoned by these people.

1332
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,780
You grotesquely underestimate
their influence.

1333
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:16,780
If you write them off as a few
mad crazies in student unions,

1334
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,950
but they have gigantic purchase on,

1335
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:22,960
on the media and therefore on politicians.

1336
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,111
Well,

1337
00:38:23,111 --> 00:38:25,940
they certainly do when it
comes to schools and schools

1338
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,480
for women getting getting
sexually assaulted on campus.

1339
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,450
Listen though,

1340
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,650
your president is parroting
these myths from these of that.

1341
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,430
Yes,

1342
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,110
the Obama has repeated the,

1343
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:38,380
um,

1344
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,340
the sexual Harrison myth.

1345
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,860
Obama has also repeated the wage gap myth.

1346
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,100
You're dismissing these people are
sort of powerless fringe crazies.

1347
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,520
The president of the United States
is repeating their talking points.

1348
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,110
Don't tell me these
people aren't influential.

1349
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:50,944
It's nuts.

1350
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,401
Well,

1351
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:52,450
that's a different thing,

1352
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:52,930
isn't it?

1353
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,231
I mean,

1354
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:57,540
when the president and the president is
really just a guy who supposed to parrot

1355
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,070
what everybody else sort
of already believes anyway.

1356
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,410
And if that's what the
progressive democratic person,

1357
00:39:02,411 --> 00:39:04,900
I don't know if the Republican
president would be any different,

1358
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,220
there'll be a lot more Jesus talk.

1359
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:06,940
What else would be different?

1360
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,840
It will tell the truth.

1361
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,010
Trump would tell the truth.

1362
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,200
Do you really like Trump or is this
a troll not accusing me of trolling?

1363
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,034
What a horrible allegations.

1364
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,383
I don't,

1365
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,370
I don't know how we got from Beta
comedian skull fucking passed out girls to

1366
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:24,990
this,

1367
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,710
but I'm trying men and men are different.

1368
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,450
Uh,

1369
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,040
that's the big picture and feminism is
something that's created by men as a

1370
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:33,830
false narrative.

1371
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:33,951
Yeah.

1372
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,110
Women have bought it hook,

1373
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:38,620
line and sinker where there really
should be at home protecting those very,

1374
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,740
very valuable three years from 26 to 29
before their ervery's turned to sand or

1375
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:48,040
something like that that you're being
sarcastic because I'm listening to you

1376
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:48,700
going,

1377
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,533
yes,

1378
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,873
well done.

1379
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,330
Just keep on that
feeling is understanding.

1380
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,950
Go on and deeply at a light and go deeply
yet letting go deeply in Ladd and go

1381
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,450
10 times more deeply and that
didn't go deeply in letting go.

1382
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:18,010
I'm going to time it
bladder and go deeply.

1383
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,943
Yeah,

1384
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,760
I had to go.

1385
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:19,961
Yeah.

1386
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:24,230
Have fully take him in
letting go take command,

1387
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,640
letting go

1388
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,653
in,

1389
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,180
go.

1390
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,140
No hesitation.

1391
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,010
I do this with the ovary and Matt
as well and it feels wonderful.

1392
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,341
Yeah.

1393
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,030
I may have been whenever,

1394
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,240
like they said the salmon and something
else word like people are like the not

1395
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:39,601
people.

1396
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:40,231
One Guy,

1397
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:43,890
I remember one guy like the shit
on the fucking ground and was like,

1398
00:40:43,891 --> 00:40:44,770
break dancing in it.

1399
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,613
Like trying to like,

1400
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,490
I mean it sounds like I'm making it up.

1401
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,480
I swear I'm not dude.

1402
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,051
He was,

1403
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:53,850
his goal was to like smear it around

1404
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,181
as much as he could.

1405
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:57,420
And this is in the room with you?

1406
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:57,651
No,

1407
00:40:57,651 --> 00:40:57,750
no.

1408
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,650
That was in the hallway.

1409
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,111
In the hallway.

1410
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:01,944
It was another dude.

1411
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,780
It's breakdancing to his own shit.

1412
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:05,040
I mean it looked like
it was break dancing,

1413
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:05,491
but he was like,

1414
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:06,181
you took a shit.

1415
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:08,080
And he's trying to smear it
around as much as he could.

1416
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,010
And so it just looked
like it was break dancing.

1417
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:14,300
Oh my God.

1418
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,260
Because how is

1419
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,510
when guys are telling a story,

1420
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:22,344
it's hilarious.

1421
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,520
And he's like,

1422
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,210
she came up to me and started
mad dogging me and I was like,

1423
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:29,790
what the fuck you look in
that I paid for all that shit.

1424
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,380
And you didn't say none of that.

1425
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:32,100
You just said,

1426
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,933
I was like,

1427
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,010
I had that look

1428
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
on my face,

1429
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,840
but I didn't say shit.

1430
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,160
And if you don't question,

1431
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,200
did you actually say that you're like,

1432
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:39,441
no.

1433
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:39,921
I was like,

1434
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:40,101
I was,

1435
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:42,200
I was thinking of like,

1436
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,760
well one of the ass too.

1437
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,060
You would have made it seem like you
were just bad motherfucker in this story.

1438
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,970
You didn't say shit.

1439
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,740
And I was like,

1440
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:53,630
fuck you for that shit.

1441
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,990
He said that.

1442
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,380
No,

1443
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,213
no.

1444
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,170
I thought it like I thought it.

1445
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,540
Fuck you and all.

1446
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,510
And where you came from,

1447
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:06,080
bitch,

1448
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,190
did you actually say it to him?

1449
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,024
No.

1450
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,170
What happened particularly in the academy
and I was teaching philosophy in the

1451
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:20,070
1980s and the chairman of my department
asked me to teach a course in feminist

1452
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,240
theory and I thought,

1453
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:21,810
fine,

1454
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,471
I'm a theorist,

1455
00:42:22,471 --> 00:42:23,191
I'm a feminism.

1456
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,540
I sent away for the textbooks.

1457
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,290
I was shocked by what
came through the mail.

1458
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,690
I spent the summer reading
these books and as a,

1459
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,780
as a philosophy professor of many years,

1460
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,590
I thought there was a sacred
commandment about college teaching.

1461
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,230
Thou shalt teach both
sides of the argument.

1462
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,431
It never occurred to me.

1463
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:44,400
It was my job as the teacher to
take my views about the world.

1464
00:42:44,401 --> 00:42:44,970
And,

1465
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:45,230
and,

1466
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,220
and implanting them in
the minds of my students.

1467
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:48,440
I wanted to give them the,

1468
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,880
the techniques to make
their own decisions.

1469
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,950
And you do that.

1470
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:56,370
One way to do that is to give them the
best that was thought and said on both

1471
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:57,990
sides of a contentious issue.

1472
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:58,441
Well,

1473
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:00,480
these textbooks were not like that.

1474
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:05,070
They were a series of mutually reinforcing
readings and it was a conspiracy

1475
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:10,050
theory about the patriarchy
buttressed by inflated statistics.

1476
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,850
So I,

1477
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,900
after spending a summer reading this book,

1478
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,430
I wrote a paper and and gave,

1479
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,920
I went to the American Philosophical
Association and presented it.

1480
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:20,821
And I will tell you,

1481
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:23,250
typically at the American
Philosophical Association,

1482
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,510
if you give a paper,

1483
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,940
people are,

1484
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,630
it's very combative,

1485
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,710
Eh,

1486
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:29,880
but then you go out for drinks.

1487
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,540
Well,

1488
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,950
we did not go out for drinks.

1489
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,250
Uh,

1490
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,210
I gave this paper.

1491
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,570
Women mostly women in the
audience were hissing and booing.

1492
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,620
And I was excommunicated from a
religion I didn't even know existed.

1493
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,500
The church of feminism I was,

1494
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,060
I was considered a,

1495
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,010
that I'd committed an act of Harrison.

1496
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,610
We're bringing him and I are
talking about actually presents a,

1497
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,770
a possible solution to what could have
brought this planet out of the Ice Age.

1498
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,350
Something on a grand cosmic scale.

1499
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,640
And the other point I think I'd like
to make is that we have to really to

1500
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:03,710
understand our planet as a system,

1501
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,870
we have to realize that it's part of a
cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been

1502
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,800
a much bigger player in what's been
going on down here than has been a

1503
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:13,471
previously.

1504
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:13,940
Yeah.

1505
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,280
Understood or appreciated.

1506
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,680
Yeah.

1507
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,820
And I think our ancestors
probably did understand,

1508
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,990
they did understand it.

1509
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:20,640
They,

1510
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,460
the,

1511
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,730
the focus on the back
then there was all that.

1512
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:25,660
What were you wearing?

1513
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:25,781
Well,

1514
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:27,280
what did you think was going to happen?

1515
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,720
I mean it was really,

1516
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,613
uh,

1517
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:31,201
it was,

1518
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:31,591
yeah,

1519
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:31,921
dude,

1520
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:32,040
it

1521
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,640
was,

1522
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:32,941
I mean,

1523
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:33,774
all of that,

1524
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,830
that um,

1525
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:36,180
uh,

1526
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,230
frat boys shit,

1527
00:44:37,231 --> 00:44:39,270
all of that reputation was earned.

1528
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,860
Just some of the sh dude,

1529
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,340
I,

1530
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,210
I've talked to guys like 10 years older
than me and they tell me like half the

1531
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:45,990
shit that they,

1532
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,823
you know,

1533
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,250
not have to ship a sizable chunk of some
of their stories with the hazing and

1534
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,460
shit they did with chicks.

1535
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:53,791
It'd be like,

1536
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:53,971
dude,

1537
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:55,980
you guys would all be in fucking jail,

1538
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:56,180
man.

1539
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,100
A long time.

1540
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,720
Yeah.

1541
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,100
Like the 70s,

1542
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,830
those guys that came of age in the 70s,

1543
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:02,911
I remember how,

1544
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:03,420
God,

1545
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,840
I can't,

1546
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,140
I'm not,

1547
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,973
I'm not gonna name names.

1548
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,143
One,

1549
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,760
one night I'm riding in a car.

1550
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:13,410
It was me and another comic and this
other comic who was older and we would

1551
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,490
drive and killing time.

1552
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,230
We started telling pussy stories,

1553
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,591
dude.

1554
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:17,940
And this guy stories

1555
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,000
every fucking other story.

1556
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:21,811
Me and the other comic,

1557
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:22,700
we'll look at each other like,

1558
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:22,980
dude,

1559
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,910
what the fuck?

1560
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,010
I remember one of his stories ended with,

1561
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,701
yeah,

1562
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:28,320
there were a lot of no's that night.

1563
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,611
It just like,

1564
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:30,444
do,

1565
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,720
we literally changed the subject,

1566
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,423
Jesus Christ.

1567
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:40,560
And he was sitting there laughing
because like to him there wasn't,

1568
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:41,820
that was what was done.

1569
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,103
So,

1570
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,580
you know,

1571
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,413
uh,

1572
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,810
I,

1573
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,300
I don't any anybody that says from back
then that that was done to them after

1574
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:53,670
just listening to that
guy talking about the 70s.

1575
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:53,941
I'm like,

1576
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:55,620
Jesus Christ with the 60s were like,

1577
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:56,700
so I believe,

1578
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:57,751
you know,

1579
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,320
all of them.

1580
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,480
It's,

1581
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,290
dude,

1582
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,310
it's a very strange,

1583
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:03,040
like girls are joining and
they're getting killed.

1584
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,710
You know,

1585
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,210
there's one,

1586
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,020
one of the girls recently got beaten
to death and another one got murdered.

1587
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:08,854
It's like,

1588
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,630
what is going on?

1589
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,260
I thought it was closeted homosexuals at
first I thought Alteryx tariffs where I

1590
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,800
thought they were all just closeted
homosexual gonna come after him.

1591
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,900
Kreischer don't say my
worrying about comp.

1592
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,190
You've worried about comedy central,

1593
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:24,581
but you know,

1594
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,510
worried about saying that.

1595
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,273
Yes.

1596
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,480
That's hilarious.

1597
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,670
Now you've been drawing Muhammad.

1598
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,783
That's fine.

1599
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,740
That's hilarious.

1600
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,810
A lot of like,

1601
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:38,320
like,

1602
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,260
like homosexuality.

1603
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:43,070
So kept down there like maybe
they're just guys that are fucking,

1604
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,701
no,

1605
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:44,690
I don't think that's what it is.

1606
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:45,441
Sitting in a cave.

1607
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:45,621
Like,

1608
00:46:45,621 --> 00:46:45,781
Hey,

1609
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:46,611
when I call blow,

1610
00:46:46,611 --> 00:46:47,241
you and the guys are like,

1611
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:47,541
what?

1612
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:47,820
And he's like,

1613
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,070
I said,

1614
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:48,441
blow up.

1615
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:49,310
Let's go blow each other up.

1616
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,361
Oh,

1617
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:51,194
no,

1618
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,660
I had Jeff Novitsky on
the guy who busted him.

1619
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:55,743
Um,

1620
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,560
after he was on,

1621
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,010
uh,

1622
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,720
lance contacted me and a,

1623
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,400
I had a conversation with him
on the phone and he lands,

1624
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,530
he may or may not do the podcast
because he wants to tell his story.

1625
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,730
By and large people can have
the perspective that you have.

1626
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,301
They can say,

1627
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:10,560
look,

1628
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,040
it looks to me like everybody did it.

1629
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,150
So,

1630
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:13,983
okay.

1631
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:14,980
Uh,

1632
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,510
then they can look to the line and they,

1633
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,160
that's where they really
start to not like it.

1634
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,470
They say this guy lied to us repeatedly,

1635
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,340
but of course you get,

1636
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:21,761
you know,

1637
00:47:21,761 --> 00:47:22,120
my,

1638
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,200
there's no defense to that.

1639
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:24,034
But if I could,

1640
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,650
if I could share any personal insight,

1641
00:47:26,651 --> 00:47:26,831
I mean,

1642
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:27,401
once you lie,

1643
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:31,180
once you just lying and keep
listening as if I'm going to sit here,

1644
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:31,890
you know,

1645
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,730
this is 15 years ago and Joe,

1646
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,470
you're a nice guy and you,

1647
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:35,891
I mean,

1648
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:37,030
if I was on this podcast,

1649
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,540
I would have lied to your
fucking face a million times.

1650
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,733
Just so you know,

1651
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,760
I would have just show you now,

1652
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,633
just so you know,

1653
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,220
that's not a surprise
to you or anybody else,

1654
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,440
but once you're in there,

1655
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,281
it's not as if I'm going to go,

1656
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:51,521
you know,

1657
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:51,791
this,

1658
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:53,530
this guy Joe seems like a really nice guy.

1659
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,311
I think I'm going to be real.

1660
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,300
I'm going to be honest with him.

1661
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,530
Too much money.

1662
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,520
There's no way you can't.

1663
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,210
One second.

1664
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:58,421
Yeah.

1665
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,140
So I was,

1666
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,130
I was stuck,

1667
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,230
for lack of a better word in that,

1668
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:02,850
uh,

1669
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,900
in that does that lie or that deception?

1670
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,770
But then the way that I
took my competitive nature,

1671
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,150
which served me well in training and in
racing and took it into the real world,

1672
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,650
took it into a press conference,

1673
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:16,240
took it into a personal relationship,

1674
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,160
took it into former teammates.

1675
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:18,610
Uh,

1676
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,080
my relationship with that,

1677
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:20,260
what,

1678
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,550
that's the part where people go,

1679
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,384
okay,

1680
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,590
fuck this guy forever.

1681
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,430
Right.

1682
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,090
I'm done.

1683
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:25,923
And so,

1684
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,010
um,

1685
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:27,843
that,

1686
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:28,631
you know,

1687
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:30,340
you've got sort of three phases.

1688
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,390
None of them are good,

1689
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,890
but as it got further away,

1690
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,383
um,

1691
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,343
that,

1692
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,213
um,

1693
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:36,580
you know,

1694
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,120
lack of respect for others is
the thing that totally fucked me.

1695
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,800
And you know,

1696
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:41,981
too,

1697
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:43,480
that I would,

1698
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:46,230
I would say to anybody
that I understand and,

1699
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:46,510
um,

1700
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,400
I may be in their timeout forever.

1701
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:49,990
Um,

1702
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,823
I have,

1703
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:51,350
uh,

1704
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,760
and the only thing I will add that,

1705
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:53,100
that,

1706
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,740
that may sound like I'm trying
to defend myself as I've,

1707
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,840
I've tried to make amends
with all those people.

1708
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,580
[inaudible]

1709
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:08,740
okay.
