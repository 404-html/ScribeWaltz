1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,600
Hi. What can I do that they're your
fellow. I see what you did there. Uh,

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,580
hey everybody. What the fuck is going
on? We're back. Uh, before we get going,

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,200
we've got to get through
our business points.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,160
We've got to sell you on some shit that
you don't want or tell you about some

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,410
shit that you've already heard
about a hundred times before.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,521
That's what we like to do.

7
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:26,370
We'd like to be repetitive and
then bore the fuck out of you.

8
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,820
That way when the podcast gets
going and you're like, God,

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:34,140
this is so much better than that fucking
commercial. It's the a four players. No,

10
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,090
it's more the blue balls. You
know, it's like, you know,

11
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,030
those insecure comics that would
always bring terrible opening acts.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,270
That's what that's like.
That's what it's like.

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,680
The commercials are our version
of a terrible opening act. Uh,

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,600
one of our sponsors this week is Tang.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,630
If you go to rogan.ting.com they will
offer you a 25 bucks off or either cell

16
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,760
phone service or one of
their new android phones.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,170
Tang is a a cell phone network
that uses the sprint backbone,

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,310
but they have their own rules.
You don't have to have contracts.

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,710
They have great phones, they have great
deals, excellent international rates.

20
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,740
Like Brian had a great time
with them up in Canada.

21
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:13,530
It was like a fraction of what does at
and t bill was and he used it all the

22
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,940
time.
The service is excellent.

23
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,090
It's not like a Mickey mouse network
at Sprint and they just have it set up.

24
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,490
So they buy time on sprint and
they give you a better deal.

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,960
They also credit you for unused
minutes. Like if you, uh,

26
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,260
if you have a certain rate that you're
going for a certain amount of minutes,

27
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,080
if you use less than that, they, they, uh,

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,200
knock you down to the lower number and
then they credit you the difference when

29
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,650
your next bill. So super ethical
company. It just, it's really,

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,870
I liked the idea behind it.
I don't like contracts.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,650
I liked the idea that you can get the,
some of the best high end android phones,

32
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,700
like the Samsung Galaxy s
four. And the the, the note,

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,150
that crazy fucking tablet phone,
they have that too.

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,210
So rogan.ting.com save yourself some

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,620
money.

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,990
Speaking of save yourself some money.

37
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,070
You how gross would be if that's how I
did my commercials all serious like that.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,700
stamps.com is a,
another one of our podcast sponsors.

39
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,490
If you buy any of Brian's tee shirts,
you know Brian read Bam,

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,030
who's not here right now. He's doing
one of his uh, Tommy's store podcast.

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,450
He did all those desk squad tee shirts
that you see the kitty cat on them,

42
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:20,330
that's all his artwork and he prints
them up and then he sends them himself

43
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:24,830
using stamps.com and he openly says that
if it wasn't for stamps.com there's no

44
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,650
way you'd be able to do this because
he'd have to wait in line at the post

45
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:30,640
office and they have to measure
each box and wage box. It's,

46
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,210
it's annoying if you're trying to do,

47
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,330
if you have a small business and you're
trying to send things through the mail,

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,900
stamps.com is a fucking amazing resource.

49
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,230
You do all the shit on your
computer, you do all the you, you,

50
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,780
you enter in the addresses, you weigh
it on a digital scale that they provide.

51
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,660
And when you print it out,

52
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,070
you just stick that on your shit
and then put it out for you.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,690
But for the post man and then you're done.
You don't have to go to the mailbox.

54
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:00,100
And I have to weigh things and measure
things in a where a bunch of people are

55
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,870
mad.
You have all this shit.

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,770
If you go to stamps.com there's a
microphone in the upper right hand corner,

57
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,050
click it,
entering the code word j,

58
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,320
r e and save yourself 110 bucks.

59
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,410
You get a $55 in free postage,
coupons,

60
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,470
free digital scale and
bunch of other cool shit.

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,000
So that stamps.com and the code word is j,

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
r e and our last but not least
sponsor for today is a new one.

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,230
It's a legal zoom.
Um,

64
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,210
I've never been in trouble
with the law bobcat Goldthwait

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,900
I have been on many
occasions sharing code.

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,720
If you could've used legal zoom to get
you out of trouble. I know. You know,

67
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,870
I sat the tonight show and firing
and I, yeah, I remember that now.

68
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,963
Yeah.
I don't know.

69
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,540
Could legal zoom helped
me tonight show it was,

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,950
it was reduced to a misdemeanor.
I think it was,

71
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,250
I don't know what they ended up
calling it, but yeah, we could, could,

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,930
could legal zoom.com how,
uh, a, uh, I would, uh,

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,960
I wouldn't say I was an arsonist.
That was the thing they wanted to say.

74
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:12,470
Now show exactly. I was a,
an artist, not an arsonist.

75
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,110
Arsonists doesn't try to hide it or a
narcissist rather. We try to hide it,

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,360
did it, they wouldn't do it on
camera in front of everybody.

77
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,100
And they get horny too. And I, it's
really relaxed during the whole thing.

78
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,270
They get horny. I bet they do. Do they
get horny or since that's the whole thing,

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,540
Jesus Christ.
Listen.

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,980
So what does legal zoom do

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,280
with legal? Zoom does, it's
not a law form, not a law firm,

82
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,700
but they provide self-help services,
uh,

83
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:43,210
at your specific direction that you can
also connect you with an independent

84
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,900
attorney if you need additional guidance.
Now if you go to legal zoom,

85
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,680
like everybody knows that go into a lawyer
is very expensive and it's also very

86
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,514
time consuming.

87
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,730
And what they have done is sort of set
it up so that you can go to legal zoom

88
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,770
and you can get businesses started.

89
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:04,150
You can incorporate form an LLC and you
could do it for a lot cheaper than it

90
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,740
would be to go to a lawyer. You can
legally protect your family and assets.

91
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,600
With legalzoom, you can write a will
on legal zoom and the past 12 years,

92
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:17,980
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,420
The online process couldn't be easier and
they'll take care of you from start to

94
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,650
finish. And a you go to get a special
discount from listening to this podcast.

95
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:31,651
Just make sure you enter Rogan in the
referral box at checkout for more savings.

96
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,150
So I remember legal zoom.
It's not a law firm.

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
And they will provide you with a
contact within an independent attorney.

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,610
They'll connect to if, if it gets
squirrely and you're like, oh,

99
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:46,300
I'm fucking going to jail. Don't
worry. Just keep it together, bitch.

100
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,570
Three great ways to save money.
You could, uh, could you tell,

101
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,780
could you get a divorce and then use the
amps.com and then call the person and

102
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:58,490
say, hey, did you get divorce yet? Um,

103
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm in Canada right now and it's costing
me a lot less. I think you nailed it.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,290
I got all your sponsor.

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,770
Take all her clothes and call stamps.com
and weigh it on your scale and then

106
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,470
send it to now. And that's
all done. I need a flashlight.

107
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,300
We don't use the flashlight anymore.

108
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,710
Now in creating creative conundrum.
Oh No,

109
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,550
I actually a bonafide spit.
Take Miss,

110
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,170
miss a lot. I didn't realize. All right,
I didn't want to bring up any sore spots.

111
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,960
Let's, uh, let's finish the legal zoom.

112
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,630
Legal Zoom for wheel. It's only 69
bucks. All right. That's, that's a great,

113
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,540
you can't afford not to die. These
phrases. It doesn't get any better. Kids.

114
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm going to kill myself tonight cause
of these bargains. Use a code name.

115
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,640
You can save yourself some money and uh,
we're always brought to buy on it,

116
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,430
but this commercial gotten far too long.
So I'm gonna end it right there.

117
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,120
O n n I t is the company.
What do we sell?

118
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,150
Fitness equipment and supplements and
healthy food and bee pollen made from

119
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,230
killer bee honey and hemp protein powder
and all that good shit. If you look, uh,

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,193
at the website,

121
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,630
use a code name or Rogan and you will
save 10% off any and all supplements.

122
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,190
All right, I'm very fucking
pumped for this podcast. Please.

123
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,940
I tell you I'm too
tenacious beekeeper though.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,360
That gets the honey from the killer
bees. That is a, yeah, I like his,

125
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,430
like his sack Cuban music.

126
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,520
Jamie,
the podcast begins officially

127
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,040
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

128
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,730
This is officially where the Sirius
Satellite Park starts. All right.

129
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,870
The other part with the commercials is
only on the Internet. Got It from here.

130
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:49,200
That's why it seems like we don't need
the music, which you could probably,

131
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,460
there's probably a better way to do this.

132
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,360
It's probably a real momentum killer to
doing the commercials as a part of the

133
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,223
city and wants something.

134
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,280
I wouldn't mind if you did them through
the show because grandpa's got appeal

135
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,110
lot and the last time I was on,

136
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:05,970
I didn't know I can get
up anytime or this time.

137
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,800
Just brick a bucket. Have you ever had
a cabinet? No. Cheese and crackers.

138
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:13,830
Those are my two biggest things is
that getting a cancer, which I got.

139
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,740
So I'm over that and it really, but
you, by the time you need one you,

140
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,800
it's sweet relief. It was the
nicest thing. Anybody that's bobcat.

141
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,440
Goldthwait,
bobcat.

142
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:28,980
Goldthwait tonight I'm scratching
Goldfarb. Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,490
thanks for having me back on.
I have been being,

144
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,390
I really fucking love your big foot movie.
Watched it last night and uh,

145
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,820
I was really psyched to watch
it cause I'm a big foot dork.

146
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:42,660
I'm a big flower from way back, you
know, I know that. But I also was,

147
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,770
you're the first person that gave it
to that didn't see it with an audience.

148
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:50,570
I've been doing some screenings at film
festivals and things and I thought it,

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,060
I was worried cause I'm really happy you
liked it cause cause I didn't know if

150
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,890
it lose something sitting by yourself.

151
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,330
Oh No, no, no. Because it's fun to
watch the movie with an audience.

152
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,310
I was involved in more and um, it was
beautiful because it was a really, uh,

153
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,180
Baltimore's great and so
a really mixed crowd. Uh,

154
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,350
and I mean all races and all working
classes and stuff come to this festival.

155
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,750
So I'm sitting behind.
It was beautiful through,

156
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,260
through the movie I was sitting right
next to the couple of black guys who were

157
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,094
beautiful.

158
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,973
They're going crazy.

159
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,720
I can't tell you which part where I was
foot and they were yelling and it was

160
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:29,800
made me so happy.

161
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,580
I had to ask you about something before
we got on the air because it was such a

162
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,271
creepy movie.

163
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:37,240
There's so many moments and I didn't want
to give away any spoilers, so I knew,

164
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm like,
I kind of ask him this.

165
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,120
Well, yeah. And the, and yeah.

166
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:44,360
So I try not to talk about some
of the things that are revealed,

167
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:47,630
but I just talk about it. A lot of them
moving out. I'm really happy. Thank you.

168
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,910
I mean, this is the first review.
I mean, you've got a couple,

169
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,330
I shouldn't say there's some nice reviews
online, but, uh, that, that's really nice.

170
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,570
I loved it. I loved it. And one of
the things I loved about it is you,

171
00:09:56,571 --> 00:10:00,460
you are completely true to big foot lore.
Like you,

172
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,530
you added in all the stuff that heart,

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,420
like the knocking and the howling
sounded exactly like a real Sasquatch was

174
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,320
ugly.
I didn't go in

175
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,050
to be snarky. I mean, I think the movie's
got stuff in it. That's funny. But I,

176
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:18,160
I wasn't trying to, you know,
I wasn't trying to mock, uh,

177
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,390
believers in Sasquatch. I just,
because of a couple of reasons. One.

178
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:25,000
I've always saw myself as as an outsider,

179
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:28,540
so why am I going to pick on one of the
most picked upon? So cultures, you know,

180
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,590
I was talking to Dan Harmon and we were
breaking it down like and picked upon or

181
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,770
misunderstood groups.
It goes like ren fair enthusiasts,

182
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,160
then it goes a Taliban and then Sasquatch
enthusiasts like as far as people will

183
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,430
cut him some slack or, alright. Trying
to understand where they're coming.

184
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,590
Yeah, that's hilarious.
That's so true. Pour Sasquatch
hunters. You don't catch it.

185
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,430
Don't catch a break ever. Well,
you know I went to where the

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
Patterson Gimlin footage was shot.
That was the,

187
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:58,300
and and that was the germ of the
whole movie for me really was I, I,

188
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:01,570
it was me since I was nine years
old wanting to go to that site.

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,180
That that's really,
and then I happened to make a movie,

190
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,320
but, but that's the reality of it.
This show that I loved the tie,

191
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,640
I didn't well up, but I
did. I'm sure I went to,

192
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,570
I don't believe in that footage.

193
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:17,330
I think that Bobcat Patterson footage
is utter horse shit. But why? Well,

194
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,880
first of all, because
there was a guy that, uh,

195
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,770
that says he did it named Bob [inaudible]
Bob and is can't find it on a map

196
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,920
though. He can't find bluff creek on a
map or he couldn't, I mean, he was gone,

197
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,390
but yeah.
Well you just,

198
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,300
because I can just a lot of places I've
been and I couldn't find a map. Yeah,

199
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,810
that's true. I go home and
I go, I know I lived here.

200
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,250
I knew I lived on this street.

201
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,850
I know that's where Douggie tool
and I hit Danny with a shovel,

202
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,790
but I went back to where I went to high
school. I was like, I killed someone.

203
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,610
I want to clear that up. I did not. Where
did you go to high school and Newton,

204
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:52,611
South Jersey and Jersey was,

205
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,100
yeah,
but

206
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,590
uh, I lived in San Francisco.
It was a long story,

207
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:01,390
but it's age first one through seven.
I lived in New Jersey,

208
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,760
seven through 11 San Francisco,

209
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:08,761
11 through 13 Florida and then 13
through 25 probably in New York,

210
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,740
Boston, and then New York. It's a 25
New York, 27 La. And it keeps coming.

211
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,800
It's a, it makes for an
interesting person. Uh, the
only let your child like, yeah,

212
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:24,220
yeah, yeah. We have a new kid every
time. Everywhere, man. Really? Yeah.

213
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,820
That's why I learned martial arts.
I got tired of people fucking with me.

214
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,710
They would, they beat you up.
People always threatened to,

215
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,260
I got lucky that I avoided it. But you're
a funny guy. I mean, did you use that?

216
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,890
It wasn't very funny. You're going to be
honest. I wasn't going to head writers.

217
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,250
I mean even, you know, you know that
you've got good delivery. No, it wasn't

218
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,480
well enough to be funny.

219
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,570
I probably would have been funny around
people if I got to know them really well.

220
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,330
This class, it wasn't really quiet. Yeah.

221
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,590
And then getting picked on and
then you learn how to kick ass.

222
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:01,540
But how often did you actually have to use
it? Never. Yeah. That's the thing, right?

223
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:01,670
Yeah.

224
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,720
I've got one fight in high school. It
was really quick and uh, it was, it was,

225
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,570
you know, I probably could have avoided
it. Like sometimes I think about it,

226
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,330
I could have avoided it.

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,860
And do you regret? You didn't know a
little bit because I heard the kid.

228
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,783
Sure.

229
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,990
I didn't hurt him bad because this
stomach along with this fight,

230
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:23,640
it's pretty quick. Yeah, it was.
It was at a point where I was,

231
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:27,920
uh, I was completely like,
oh, I was competing a lot
in martial arts tournament.

232
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,490
So this guy hit you. I mean he, he
was going to and he took them out.

233
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,530
How many hits?
It was just one,

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,500
which is kind of bad ass.
But now

235
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,100
if you didn't know you could do that,
you wouldn't respect it. Well, it's also,

236
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,090
I probably did it to show off,
you know, I could have avoided it.

237
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,050
I could have avoided that even
though he's kind of a Dick Guy. Yeah.

238
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,490
He's also a young kid just like
me. We're both retarded. Great.

239
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,393
Now to your ears,

240
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,980
make mistakes sometimes just start
things you don't even want to finish,

241
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:05,700
but you're stuck in a quagmire. It
was there people around. Yeah. Yeah.

242
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,140
It had to be the last fight.

243
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,330
I mean that no one probably
messed with you after that.

244
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,870
Well, I mean, people are always,
if you are looking for trouble,

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,480
you're going to find Trump. Right. I was
never, I never looked for trouble. Right.

246
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,220
But there's, when you're in high school,
there's unavoidable situations where you,

247
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,410
you want to be somewhere you like.
You know what I mean? In your life,

248
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:28,300
you have control over what you choose
to do for an occupation a year with the

249
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:32,420
kind of people maybe like maybe my
shape and everything protected me from,

250
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,990
you know what I mean? Like if you kicked
my ass, you'd be, it's embarrassing. Oh,

251
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,880
you can go play tennis. Oh, big deal.

252
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,420
You kicked the fat doe. Hey guys. And
did you, did your fists gets stuck.

253
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,330
There was a section noises,

254
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,070
but I, I never was like, I,
I always want it to avoid,

255
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,800
you know, the only reason why I
ever learned martial arts at all,

256
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,560
it was so that I would be scary enough.
So people left me alone

257
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,150
like a mat. And I always, there's a
bit in my act about, you know, the,

258
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,990
the voice of depth and that that's,
you know, I'm going to kill you.

259
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,850
That guy's going to kill you.
You know a guy who was like,

260
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,770
I'm going to dump drunk Jack that his
buddies got to pull him off so he doesn't

261
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:12,750
get in a fight with you man.

262
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,530
So many scary people in my life as
far as like physically scary people,

263
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:19,320
especially all the years working
for the UFC. Right, right.

264
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,100
Like the idea of running around in the
same world as some of these people.

265
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:24,770
It was fucking terrifying.
You know,

266
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,100
cause it most like UFC fighters are very
calm and they get it all out in the gym.

267
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:29,640
But yeah,

268
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,030
if you zig when you should have zagged
and you run into the wrong person and the

269
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:36,540
wrong time, like many
people have your, you're,

270
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,960
it's like it's up to them
whether or not you stay safe,

271
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:43,050
it's up to them whether or not they
just beat the fucking shit out of you.

272
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,950
I've seen it happen before.
It's really just,

273
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,310
I saw a guy get knocked out in Denver.
I was at the comedy works in Denver.

274
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:54,600
It was a really cool place
and I saw something happened
that totally didn't need

275
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:55,380
to happen.

276
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,280
There was a guy who was walking down the
street and he was really fucking drunk

277
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:02,850
and there was another guy who
was sober and the guy was drunk,

278
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,280
said something stupid to the guy who
started it, but he wasn't a threat.

279
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,990
It was great. Clearly
not threatened. Right.

280
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,510
But then the guy who is sober
just beat the shit out. Right.

281
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,690
And you tell the dude was totally impaired
and the other guy was like stronger,

282
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:16,680
more athletic.
Anyway.

283
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,520
He was just looking for an excuse
to beat the shit out of something.

284
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,970
He just wanted to beat someone up.

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,400
It's like the heckler figures
out they're going to heckle.

286
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:25,490
And the guy who gets in a fight, you
know, before they even leave the house.

287
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,060
I mean,
I really,

288
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,000
I believe that some people do.
Yes.

289
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,570
Well, I don't know how we went
from big foot too to ask kicking,

290
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:35,810
but that's all right. I
mean it does, but you know,

291
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:40,340
it's like I'm not proud that,
that I have the ability to really,

292
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,830
uh, and I'm not known
for this. I mean people,

293
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,630
a lot of folks aren't familiar
that I understand that,

294
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,840
but you know that I can really decimate
someone in the audience. I can really,

295
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,120
really, really bad. And, and Shanker,

296
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,290
I truly don't usually even
my daughter and my new wife,

297
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,770
the o nine my ax is, they all
go, oh nine the, oh no, yeah,

298
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,160
she's still got the new car smell.
She's so,

299
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,680
so like the whole nine,
you know,

300
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,680
they see this like switch
go and they leave the room,

301
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,720
they get uncomfortable and it's just like
blah. And I'm really not proud of that,

302
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,910
that it's a horrible
skill, you know? Well,

303
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,120
it's a defense mechanism for doing
standup, but like you don't even, I mean,

304
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,510
when it gets going, I truly don't know.
I mean you talk about the comedy works,

305
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,300
man, it was just a, Oh my God, you know,

306
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,570
how people will yell out where they're
from and then there's this horrible

307
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:31,940
nightmare. And I love the comedy
works. I think that's probably,

308
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:34,520
if not the best club,
it's one of the best in the whole country.

309
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,970
But at one of those, you
know, a horrible shows.

310
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,250
And if people go do the
little boy, the, you know,

311
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:44,630
they want me to do this voice from the
how they know me from years ago and I'm

312
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,230
not doing it. And, and then there's a
woman in the back of the room, she goes,

313
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,070
I'm from Aurora, and I go, I know
you've learned to sit in the back.

314
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,170
And I truly didn't think of
that in advance, you know,

315
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,240
and I felt then I feel bad.

316
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,420
You don't want to such a weird response
that even the crowd like kind of didn't

317
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:07,230
go. Oh, they kind of just pretend they
didn't hear it because it was so weird and

318
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,740
horrible. But like, I really kind of,

319
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,380
the switch goes and I say things and I'm
not saying I don't take responsibility

320
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:17,790
for them, but I'm usually later on kind
of a surprise that I said, you know,

321
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,170
I berated a table full of
women this one night. And uh,

322
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,020
and they were very, you know, they're
acting like the show is all about them.

323
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,820
And I just paraded his table women.

324
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:31,380
And then one stood up sobbing and
she's like going, I, by the way,

325
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:35,580
I forgot even what I said. And it was
a couple of minutes later. By the way,

326
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,220
people love these kinds of
stories and they love watching it.

327
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,910
I mean the bars never emptied out.
You know,

328
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,510
two guys are getting along in
the parking lot. Let's watch.

329
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,430
So I'm up there and this woman
stands up crying. She goes,

330
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm not a whore. It's my birthday. Oh,

331
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,280
these are the things I'm not proud of.
So

332
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,990
do you think that there comes from doing
standup and bars or ground Boston to

333
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:03,470
building the fence? My course
in Boston, that was the hardest,

334
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:07,250
hardest place to do stand up
comedy. It was, it was horrible.

335
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,770
It was. But, but when I got started,

336
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:14,360
it created so many unique
characters and so many, you know,

337
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:19,220
I got started and it's like, uh, you know,
who came out of that group? It was like,

338
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:19,461
you know,

339
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:24,461
Lenny Clarke and Denis leary and Steven
Wright and Barry Crimmins and you know,

340
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:28,040
just all these different, unique voices
that came out of my front, Tony V.

341
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,790
And so it was really tough to do comedy,

342
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,490
Paula Poundstone but you were forced to
have your own, your own voice, you know?

343
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,740
Yeah.
You guys were ahead of me.

344
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:41,460
And when I first started doing comedy
and started doing open mic night,

345
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,720
I was really aware because of all you
guys, like what a crazy scene it was.

346
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,070
It was, I mean it was released
a few places on earth.

347
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:52,290
People are hate this on my podcasts.
Well,

348
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,300
oh they're going to talk
about Boston comedy. Sorry,

349
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,630
Bill and I have had these conversations
and I'll tell one or two bucks now.

350
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,810
It's amazing place

351
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,400
on your buckets. But, and I, and I, I
really rarely talk about it, but, but I,

352
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,120
I am, I don't drink, I don't take
drugs, but I don't tell people about it.

353
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,050
But I just did. But I, I have, I
haven't since I was 19 years old.

354
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,740
So this story is that long ago I started
doing comedy when I was 15 I got an

355
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:23,210
alarm. I was 20, so this is
like a story when I'm 18 with a,

356
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll say as Lenny Clarke
and all these guys,

357
00:20:25,401 --> 00:20:29,870
and we boarded up the doors
and the windows at the
Dingo with cardboard, right.

358
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:34,640
And we're just drinking and doing
piles of blow and um, and the,

359
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,770
and, and, and all night.

360
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:41,630
And then the door opens and it's like
smokey and backlit cause the sunlight's

361
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,590
pouring it and it's,

362
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,940
it's a bunch of cops come walking in
and I'm just high and gacked out of my,

363
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,153
and I'm going,

364
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,780
I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail.
That's all banking. And the cops go,

365
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,800
Lenny, you fucking cock sucker. I sit down
and they start doing blow and I'm like,

366
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,190
yeah. And I'm like, there is no,
there's no god. Yeah, yeah. I was down,

367
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,660
it was it Chinese comedy
club and we would,

368
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,670
we would cut lines on the, on the
ribs, you know, the pork ribs.

369
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,990
We'd be in the freezer, Chapman lines
on those orange pork ribs, the ribs,

370
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:17,750
the redwoods.

371
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh,
that's hilarious.

372
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,460
Yeah.
To be a flat surface.

373
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,410
And then I'm just thinking like these
families that get served up. Oh my God.

374
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:32,000
Blow covered pork groups,
juniors bouncing up.

375
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,810
Whenever we go to the Ding Ho,
he's so animated.

376
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,290
This was like in the 80s did you guys
get real coke back then or was it all

377
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,910
chopped up still? I think we were,
we were getting high. Yeah. No,

378
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,100
but you know what I'm saying, like don't
know the difference. I mean I really,

379
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:49,820
I've never done coke, so I did
it. And then, and like I said,

380
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:52,060
I stopped everything when I was
19 I know people don't believe

381
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,090
the folks who do it though.
We'll tell you there's like rockstar coke,

382
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:58,120
like pure code, which is
amazing. And then there's like,

383
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,470
you know Tom Sawyer from the, from
Cobbs. Sure. Tom will tell you,

384
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,360
like if you talked to them about the
old school, like rock star coach,

385
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I've talked to some of the Boston
comics who like, you know, I didn't,

386
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,640
I didn't quit because I got
syllabi I could cause of the,

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,520
cause they shit got bad,
the coat got mad,

388
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,080
disappointed in the quality of a blow.
We'll play again fucking high anymore.

389
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,730
Apparently it's very different
experiences with you get

390
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,200
real cocaine,
a hundred percent pure cocaine.

391
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:26,630
It's a very different experience than
what a lot of people are getting.

392
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:29,780
His speed. You're getting like
coke mixed with some sort of,

393
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,030
no,
because I would do,

394
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,330
I had done speed and it didn't
affect me the way the Koch did.

395
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:38,980
So that's my Pepsi Challenge.
It's very scientific.

396
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:40,660
I don't know.
They cut it with things.

397
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:44,100
I don't know what they're cutting this
baby laxative and vitamin B's. Yeah.

398
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,310
One with um, uh, XTC they
cut away, cut it with speed.

399
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,420
Apparently speed.
Sometimes you don't get all pure x.

400
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,350
You get a bunch of funky
amphetamines in there. Wow.

401
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,560
So what we're trying to say
to the kids don't do bad code.

402
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,370
No. You, yeah. So you guys were doing
it with the cops, the cops. I mean,

403
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,140
the guy's a guy would steal some guys
joke and then somebody's arm will get

404
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,570
broke. I mean, it was not, I mean,
it really, that's the reality of it.

405
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,690
Dane Cook was on the podcast once a week.

406
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,450
He and I were talking about how
they're the guys who were doing comedy,

407
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:25,430
where men like Kevin Knox and
Lenny Clarke, these, these big men,

408
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,230
it's like manly.
And it was

409
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,980
a very, it was just like if
very aggressive for, yeah.

410
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah. It wasn't like on Gavin
and people are going, oh,

411
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,040
you're in Cambridge and there
imagine that you don't got pipes.

412
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,050
And we got patches on
our sweaters. Like, Hey,

413
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,820
you're coming out with like one of
those [inaudible] suede jackets with the

414
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,220
Ambien Tasseling Dang

415
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,990
like an overstep chair with
it. And we sitting there and
talking to him about, um,

416
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,930
uh, Noel coward references and
stuff, you know, but no, it was, uh,

417
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,720
it was pretty down and dirty
and not, but, you know,

418
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:59,720
it was the best place to train.
I mean, cause you know, you, you,

419
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
you were ready for the hackles were
insane that the violence and uh,

420
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,700
it really is weird to think about how
much comedy and violence was in that

421
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,700
scene. It was a crazy
scene. It was, uh, I,

422
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,190
I'll try to keep some of the
people out of this story,

423
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,030
but one of the guys I was with one night,
you know,

424
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,500
when someone's party and then they just,

425
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,320
the switches thrown and they become Gorgo,
you know what I mean?

426
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,870
Like they're just not themselves
completely, you know what I mean?

427
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,790
And one of our buddies insisted that
he and I were vikings and he was really

428
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,610
committed to this character was he was
a viking and he was holding me in a

429
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:42,020
headlock and he wouldn't
let me go. And, uh,

430
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,790
and to the point where it got creepy,

431
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,610
like he was just dragging me
around the bar, it was funny.

432
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,520
And then it would go for a long
time. Like I was at, you know,

433
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,780
and I couldn't do anything. He was much
larger than me. And then Barry Crimmins,

434
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,450
I remember at the time I had a, um, had a,

435
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,270
a cast and the guy who
had me in a headlock,

436
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,700
who by the way is a friend and he just
had a rough night that night. He says,

437
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,080
Carmen's goes, because let him
go. And he goes, and the guy goes,

438
00:25:06,081 --> 00:25:08,060
hugged me or hit me.
And Cummins goes,

439
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,940
it was the fastest decision
I ever made in my life.

440
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,110
He just popped him with
the CAS broke his job.

441
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,710
That's a low, that was a,
that's comedy. Yeah. It was
a, it was crazy. It was ma'am.

442
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,110
It really was.
I uh,

443
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,980
I came just behind you guys and one of
my big regrets was that I never got to

444
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:29,500
perform with the Ding Ho cause
it was so legendary. Yeah.

445
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,420
Because the, the, the, the comics
were in charge basically, you know,

446
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,770
booking and the, the, all that stuff.
So it was, it was, yeah, it was crazy.

447
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,090
Well that's sort of how the
comedy store used to be,

448
00:25:40,091 --> 00:25:42,010
except for the booking aspect of it.
You know,

449
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:44,750
the comics we were never in charge of,
but there was still,

450
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,750
but was no real crowd control. There
was, it was all comics working.

451
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,030
The booth comics would work the door,
the comedy store was like,

452
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,950
it's all comics working. Well, who's,

453
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,710
this was, yeah, this
was pretty much mayhem.

454
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,410
It's guy a shun Lee.

455
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,490
He ran the Ding Ho and a
talk to me maybe twice.

456
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,550
One night I go out on stage
and I'm doing my character and,

457
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,940
and you know I'm full board. I write
and then I stop and I say, you know, hi,

458
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:16,330
this is my real voice. I'd like to
gut and clean some fish tonight.

459
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,450
Does anyone have any fish?
You know, really straight.

460
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:23,050
I'm saying this in my roommate raises
his hand, he pulls out this big fish.

461
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:27,610
Now the fish would Ben in the trunk
of his car. So it's rancid. Oh No,

462
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,170
I just got the fish and gut end
trails and trails all over the stage.

463
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,450
And this woman just contact vomit
as soon as she smelled it. Just, Oh,

464
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,230
so I'm a professional.

465
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:42,000
I put the mic right down to her so
you could hear retching over the PA

466
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,520
chicks puking up. There's fish gut
vomit all over the front of this date.

467
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,310
And then I go,
thank you.

468
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,330
Gonna in the next guy was bill
Campbell around when you're this guy,

469
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,570
really sweet guy, but his act as you know,
talking about, you know, relationships,

470
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:04,910
you know, men go to me, you
know? Yeah. It's just gets
and fishing. And he goes, uh,

471
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,470
you know, so he, his act is destroyed
because overbook, this kind of stuff.

472
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:14,410
So, yeah, very nice, wholesome
kind of heck. And then I
did this and then shun Lee.

473
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,230
There's only time, first time
he talked to me, he goes,

474
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,770
he pulls me over to talk to him.
He goes, Bob, are you weird?

475
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,550
He said, fuck. Are you weird? Wow. What
a great boss. Yeah, yeah. That was, yeah,

476
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:31,550
it was like, I still did the second show.
Don't do the fish, you know. No more,

477
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:34,950
no more fish. It's hilarious.
But yeah, so it was,

478
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,170
I don't know, I was gone by the
time it, it, it met its the mice.

479
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,570
But when did you bail you out of Boston?

480
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,290
I went to San Francisco. It
was all pretty quick. You know,

481
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:50,160
I got on Letterman and then, uh, and then
I, it was in the early eighties. I can't,

482
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,820
you know, really, I was half in and
half out of the different cities,

483
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,710
San Francisco and Boston. So
it was like 82, maybe three.

484
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,570
I started in the 88.
Oh Wow.

485
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:02,350
So it was way after the Boston comedy
scene. When did it really start?

486
00:28:02,351 --> 00:28:03,300
When was like the birth?
Yeah,

487
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,830
it was before I got there and I
got there at the, uh, like 80,

488
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:08,940
the end of 80 probably.

489
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,050
Did you see France Alameda's documentary
show? Yeah, I'm a little bit in that.

490
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:16,770
Yeah. Yeah. It tabs, some
of it, but there's still

491
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,430
stuff that was, uh, that, I mean,
he did a great job. Wasn't raw dog.

492
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,050
Well, there's just some things
in there that, you know, well,

493
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,590
the one thing is funny is that I watched
that movie with Lemmy clunk and part of

494
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:33,950
the story is that these guys don't like
me because I get on Letterman, you know?

495
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,180
And that was true. I mean. Oh yeah. And
they got really mad because, um, you know,

496
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,950
I don't know younger than them. I come
in from Syracuse. I again on Letterman,

497
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:46,490
like, you know, probably in a year
or so I would have been pissed too.

498
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,440
But you know, Lenny would be, you know,

499
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,140
and Leonie and I are friends actually
were going to do a project together but,

500
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,420
but, but at the time when he was
really pissed, he was like, you know,

501
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,283
he's throwing me into,

502
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,250
yeah,
not your 10.

503
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,360
It was almost like a union gig. It was
like you didn't put in your seniority.

504
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,050
Yeah. So, so,

505
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,180
um, that became part of
that movie. But you know,

506
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,130
I sat there and watched it with Lenny and,
and,

507
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:15,120
and we just kind of laughed
together, you know, and, and uh,

508
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,640
and I watched it with my daughter too.
It was really great for my daughter.

509
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:21,250
It was really cool to have
her watch that. Wow. Yeah.

510
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:24,880
I have a pretty good experience.
I'll tell a good story if you don't mind.

511
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,030
Can we got to go without my daughter?
So, um, my daughter is a costumer,

512
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,330
she works in commercials
and movies and stuff and,

513
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:35,170
and I'm very proud because she's
taken a creative life and she,

514
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,760
she does great work. We work
together and, uh, and, uh,

515
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,400
and my wife and I, we work, everybody

516
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,800
works. And when I'm making a movie
on my friends and family, so,

517
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,580
but I get this text from my daughter,
she's working on that project and it says,

518
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:52,820
Dad, maybe I shouldn't say it's the
one. Oh, I'm going to fuck it. I'm,

519
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,270
and so she says, she says, Dad,

520
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,500
I have a disaster. Uh, she
says as a text, she goes,

521
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,150
I have diarrhea.

522
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,260
And I went in Russell brand's dressing
room and I'm using his toilet. Oh,

523
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,420
he doesn't know I'm in here.

524
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,350
And he just came back in and
she's trapped in the bathroom.

525
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,820
I have to go back to the set.
She says, what do I do? I go,

526
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,780
I go make him feel uncomfortable. Just
open the door and go, hi Russell brand.

527
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,760
I had to change my tampon shark week.
And so,

528
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:27,960
and so my daughter texts back,
Deb, you're great. I love you. Oh,

529
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:31,630
she thinks I'm trying to help her
out of an uncomfortable situation,

530
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,820
but really I'm going,
what could I have her say?

531
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,680
So Russell brand won't try to fucker.

532
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,810
Ah, ah, so, uh,

533
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,900
because of course I'm going,
oh, this is bad, this is bad.

534
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,310
The bathroom being cute with the hitting
the charges are, yeah, I mean, you know,

535
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,950
and that's his thing, you know, and then
I'm like, and then I go, what happened?

536
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:59,680
And he goes, she was napping.
And I'm like, my feelings
are hurt too. I'm like, well,

537
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,540
he didn't try it yet,
which makes me a creep but weird in it.

538
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,990
What was the motivation for
making this big foot movie?

539
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,900
Cause this is like
completely for me. I mean, I,

540
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:16,240
I found out about this like three weeks
ago. Okay. And when, and also folks who,

541
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,450
if they are familiar, a lot of folks don't
make, I make movies but, but the, the,

542
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:19,830
it's,

543
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,120
it's completely different
than like world's greatest
dad and God bless him man.

544
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,430
It's a lot different than shakes.
Fucking great. Oh, thanks man.

545
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:29,770
So fucking great movie.
Tom Kenny and I, who,

546
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,320
whose name drop is now the voice of
Spongebob is binky the clown in the movie.

547
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,700
And he's again, cocaine. He's
doing San Francisco startup.

548
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,470
But I've known Tom since I was six.

549
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,810
We were introduced by a crying nun at St
Matthews. Well, we weren't introduced.

550
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:45,010
Tommy tells the story better,

551
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:49,050
but he says his fat kids dragged behind
this nun who's just sobbing. And she,

552
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,700
she dragged me into
his classroom and goes,

553
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,070
cause we were in two different
first grades. She's like,
I can't take him anymore.

554
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,020
And she left me in this class and I was
so, I felt horrible. I was so embarrassed.

555
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:05,380
I started crying too. But, but he thought
it was cool that I can make a nun cry.

556
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,030
So he introduced himself at lunch. So
that's Larry. We've been now, yeah,

557
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,330
we're both the, I'm 51 he'll be
51 in July. But uh, so I, yeah,

558
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,780
I've known Tom Kenny. He's binky the
clown. Him and I were watching a shake.

559
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,920
They showed shakes and people recently,

560
00:32:20,921 --> 00:32:25,120
and people showed up as characters and
they know the dialogue and there's clown

561
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:28,960
whores. They're, these women were just as
slutty clowns. And in the middle of it,

562
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,650
when he leans over to me, he goes,
what the fuck were we thinking?

563
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,990
And the crowd was really even matter.
If it was like that Shatner sketch on Snl,

564
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,610
you know, we were like,
get a life, you know,

565
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,580
we were really wigged out by that.
But you know, if you make a movie,

566
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,830
you better be willing to talk about it.
Oh yeah.

567
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,090
Because even my small indie
films that I do under the radar,

568
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:55,140
and they play festivals,

569
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,880
you're going to talk about
them for the rest of your life,

570
00:32:56,881 --> 00:33:00,540
so you better kind of stand by it.
And that's part of this movie was that I,

571
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,740
I've always been fascinated with bigfoot.

572
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,890
I've always been super interested in the
Patterson Gimlin, uh, footage, you know,

573
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:12,870
and, and so I, uh, it wasn't
that long ago, uh, the o nine,

574
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:16,680
she's like saying, she
knows me. She goes, go, go,

575
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,300
go to your big foot.

576
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,260
So I put about 1400 miles on
the car and just in California,

577
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
just driving around famous sites,

578
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:27,390
talking to different people until I
made it all the way up to Willow Creek,

579
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:31,170
you know? And so you did this just to
sort of form the idea in your head. Yeah.

580
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,800
Well, I wasn't, I didn't have a move.
I had a different movie in my head,

581
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:38,310
which I still think I'll
write because I thought it, I,

582
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,940
one of the things that's fascinating about
Sasquatch is, is it's a, it's a good,

583
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,000
everybody, I wanted to do
a thing that kind of, uh,

584
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,960
this isn't this movie,

585
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:52,800
but I had an idea for a movie that
kind of took on faith and religion and

586
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:53,311
everything,

587
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,820
and I thought maybe I'd set it in the
Sasquatch community because there's people

588
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:59,580
that just believe,
and there's people that believe and see,

589
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:03,830
there's people that are
shysters just people. I mean,
so it's a really good, uh, it,

590
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:08,340
you know, it's a good analogy for
religion, but, um, you know, uh,

591
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,960
I don't know where you sit on the pointy
head or less pointy headed big foot.

592
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,400
What I funny.
Yeah.

593
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,420
It's funny because I saw this guy go over
to another guy at a conference and the

594
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,580
guy's got a cardboard egg with a big
pointy headed bigfoot. And the guy goes,

595
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,360
you disgust me. And he goes,
wait. He goes, look at that head.

596
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,760
And so you just got, yeah.
And the other two guys

597
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,983
really,

598
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,470
I've seen big foot three times and you're
never going to see him cause you smoke.

599
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,390
Yeah. And I was like going,
it's pretty gangster.

600
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,010
Well this is beautiful. You know,
this is really amazing. It's like, so,

601
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,570
so subcultures are fascinating to me.
I love the fact that, that, that um,

602
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,041
uh,

603
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:57,360
you can get into discussions and go down
this crazy rabbit holes with everybody.

604
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,620
And um, and I, I, I do, I,
you know, here's the thing,

605
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,280
when you say you believe that means
people say you no longer impartial,

606
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,980
but I'm going to s but everybody has a,
you know, so I, I'm not impartial. I,

607
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:15,900
I do believe that there's, there's
a, a Sasquatch out there. Wow.

608
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Or, or, or I should say big foot plural.

609
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,800
You went there, you said, I believe
is a Sasquatch. Yeah. I mean,

610
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,690
when I look at my career,
what it's going to happen,

611
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
you could say bobcat goes away.

612
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:31,401
It's weird that that is one of those
subjects though where it's like a Ufo woes

613
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,320
or psychics or something
along those lines.

614
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:38,310
As soon as you start talking about it,
you're immediately a silly person.

615
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,360
Yeah. But I'm already used silly
person. Yeah. I'm so far off the radar.

616
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:45,950
I do what I do. It's
completely, you know, I,

617
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,680
about seven, eight years ago,
I really just Kinda quit.

618
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:53,310
I stopped being in stuff that I was
embarrassed of. I stopped, you know,

619
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,590
I still do something if it's
nice and the breads there,

620
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:59,190
but for the most part I just quit. You
know, I stopped trying to get jobs.

621
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,690
I didn't want to get discovered.
I did,

622
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,560
I stopped writing movies for other people
that I wasn't getting paid for that I

623
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:09,300
thought they would like or I stopped.
I stopped out all of it and I just,

624
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,150
and I was,
and I was fortunately enough,

625
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,620
Jimmy Kimmel hired me to direct the show.
And that's a big deal.

626
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,400
That's a huge deal
because, you know, I mean,

627
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,630
you did dispel show a little bit.
I did a little Chapelle.

628
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,070
We ran into each other and that
was three. Yeah, totally random.

629
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,080
And, um, so I worked on Chappelle and
that, but working for Jimmy, you know,

630
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:35,150
it kind of just gave me this freedom
is nice that someone believed in me,

631
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,330
you know, when, when pretty much
a I'd become still and possibly,

632
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,970
well we talked about it before the
podcast when the, during the commercials,

633
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:47,410
the thing with the tonight show, that
was the big thing with the chair on fire,

634
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,280
this persona that people that had an ass
load of and, and, and, and just, you know,

635
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:53,010
and, and I didn't even,
you know, I got really yeah

636
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:57,320
frustrated because I was just being
famous for being famous and this is before

637
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:02,180
then, you know, a digital age. I
just got really tired of being like,

638
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:05,970
you have booked me on a talk show,
I go crazy and people would be happy and,

639
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,070
and I really was just like so over
it really destructive, you know?

640
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,580
Well you were like rebelling against
like the police academy movies and that

641
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:17,690
sort of box that,
but also it's,

642
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,820
it's, it's rebelling truly. I think
the real thing, what was that?

643
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,540
I was, you know, Leno was nice
enough to have me on and then,

644
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,860
and then I saw this pattern that
I may have become a regular and,

645
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,620
and I've never really discussed this,
that terrified me.

646
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:36,880
They did being successful on that level
because it's easier to be a guy who

647
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:40,360
never tried and then you're in some
dopey teen comedies and you can criticize

648
00:37:40,361 --> 00:37:44,050
what everybody else does and be bitter,
but they're really put, you know,

649
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,080
to really put your cock on the
block and say, this is who I am.

650
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,390
This is going to be my material,
or this is the movies,

651
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,520
this is the products that say who I am.

652
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,040
That's terrifying because then
you're out there to be judged.

653
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,150
That's fascinating.

654
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,050
So it's almost like get a self destructive
quality because completely idea of

655
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:00,640
success was just too much pressure.
Right.

656
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,410
Because then I'd have to actually
pony up and actually, oh,

657
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:07,970
so you've been criticizing x, Y, and z?
Well, what, what do you do? You know? So,

658
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,640
so, um, I was really trying to not,

659
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:14,060
it was kind of funny because I was
trying not to be on TV anymore and I said

660
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:17,090
that the night you have a fire and then
immediately I get booked on every show.

661
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,030
People think like I was
banned from other shows.

662
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,770
I wasn't in band from the tonight show.
They actually had me on a week later. But,

663
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,390
but um, it's, it's, it's very fascinating.
It's funny, I was just writing this thing.

664
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,260
Um, you know, I toured with
Nirvana as a comedian and,

665
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,140
and there would be times
where, you know, I was,

666
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,960
it was a few nights where I was
sitting up with curtain, you know,

667
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,570
we were exchanging stories like,
you know,

668
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:45,571
him showing up and drag in a gown for
a headbangers ball and nobody getting

669
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,250
that, you know, that's pretty funny.

670
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,370
Especially it was funny to him cause
he's getting asked to go on a metal show.

671
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,790
So he thought it'd be funny to show up
and drag and everybody's like going this

672
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:59,350
guy, you know? And especially because he
wasn't running around and lipstick on.

673
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:04,320
Wow. You know, he just was comfortable
in a drag. So, uh, it was, you know,

674
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,960
and he's like, mom, nobody would give
him, you know, and it was really funny.

675
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:11,830
And then, and then, you know, like I'd,
I'd smashed up the Arsenio Hall show.

676
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,520
Did way more damage on that
show. I remember that too. Yeah,

677
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,880
I wrote paramount sucks on the back of
that cause they fired him basically and

678
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:22,840
they gave him a rod deal and it was
just me trying to end it, you know, I,

679
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:27,640
I really related more to rock
then comics. I just kind of, Ooh,

680
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,930
you know, I try to. And then

681
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,740
were you upset though that you were like,
you,

682
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:34,070
did you feel like you were getting
pushed into some like family box and it

683
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,270
wasn't representing you?

684
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:40,130
Like it was a real visionary is a
real comic that, you know, it's funny.

685
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:42,800
People,
you know,

686
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,610
I think the character would cloud people
from hearing anything I was saying,

687
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:51,250
you know, I love and meet Bob. I got
it when it was like a house. I mean,

688
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,200
when did it come out? Yeah. I don't
know. But yeah, just starting out.

689
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,570
That's funny because that album,
like people don't,

690
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,120
I don't think people understood
that I actually had material.

691
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,420
I think so just tell me in, in police
academy. So what I was going to say,

692
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,520
it was a real, it was really good comedy.
It was really good. Stand up. And uh,

693
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:12,170
I think a lot of people I remember just
thought you were like a crazy actor guy.

694
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,020
Like all the people didn't know.
Like you didn't just have stand up.

695
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:17,570
You had like really smart stand up.
It was really good stuff.

696
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:20,560
But it was weird because I think
I helped perpetuate it. Oh Gosh.

697
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,820
Ipod was possibly,
you know,

698
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,640
it's Kinda funny when you go on
stage and you do this persona,

699
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,580
even people who are rolling
their eyes start laughing.

700
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:30,290
So it's hard to jettison it.

701
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,780
Especially when you go on the
road and they're expecting it.

702
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,160
It's weird to get pigeonholed.
And I just stopped. Uh, it was,

703
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,420
I was on the road and I realized,
Oh, I don't dislike, stand up.

704
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,830
I hate this fucking care.
I did.

705
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:49,430
People try the way, expect it at all.
Yeah. And they, you know, still do,

706
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:53,570
you do the voice, you know, and they
get mad, you know, but, but it's just,

707
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:58,370
I gotta do I gotta do I gotta
be me? You know, as Corny
as that sounds, you know, I,

708
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,090
I feel you mean you got to
quit. You know, you got it.

709
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,580
Like there's this weird thing in our
society where it's like, uh, you know,

710
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:08,930
you can't quit and, and that's where you
find when you're happy, you know, he said,

711
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,230
oh, this isn't working for me. You know,
I thought, oh, this isn't working for me.

712
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:15,170
So you could end up in a place where you
go, oh, this is what's working for you.

713
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,240
Unfortunately, ended up,
they're usually about 45 well,

714
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:21,690
there's a lot of people that they,

715
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,160
they never abandon that act
and they hang onto it. Like,

716
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:29,720
just Judy Tenuta still do stand up. I
don't, I don't know. She had a great act.

717
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,640
It's funny that my wife and I brought it,

718
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,980
but he owed nine and I
brought Judy Tenuta today

719
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:38,190
on the plane because I did the
gathering of the Juggalos. Oh Wow. And,

720
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,470
and we're wondering if like, if like
they booked the wrong acts on purpose.

721
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:44,390
So we were like putting together a lineup.

722
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,920
Like it was going to be Paula Poundstone

723
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,810
and Aimee Mann at this year's
gathering of the Juggalos.

724
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,980
We may cause I think cause sometimes,
did you ever see,

725
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,480
did you ever see the

726
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,630
public sex wouldn't be gathering the
juggle? There's a movie called, uh,

727
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,320
shoot American juggle.
I think his name. No,

728
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,810
I've just watched clips on the Internet.
No,

729
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:11,330
they just have you sought Tila Tequila
get hit with Pooh. Did she really? Yeah,

730
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:15,630
man. Through pooler he ran
out of Phaco Cola. So they,

731
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,160
so they started throwing
poo and oh my God.

732
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,740
Like dudes were shitting and what
cops know, they knocked over,

733
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,750
they backed out to report upon.
Yeah.

734
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:28,220
It wasn't like GGL I may ask
someone else's pool. Yeah.
Which is, that's my point.

735
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,430
Look, uh, I'm going to digress
here. Ball. That's her on stage.

736
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,610
And that's Rowan Porter,
right? Like hypothetically.

737
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:39,560
Let's say you are, I, I give it
up. I mean, look, she, she, oh,

738
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:44,120
pull it stays in them. She,
she stays up there. Oh Jesus,

739
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:47,150
that shit just hit her legs. I love
that. She's like sitting there going,

740
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,360
you know what, a couple more minutes
I'm going to win her back late.

741
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:53,060
She just lay that I gotta give it up.
Grab her crotch.

742
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,330
Is that all shit or is it some of
the beer? No, it's Phaco Cola. They,

743
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,950
it's the soda. They like the throw.
But um, like if, here's my point,

744
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,570
if you are walking down the street and,
and you hit me with dog poop, right?

745
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:12,530
Like you saw some and threw
it, it wouldn't be a deal
breaker, but I'd be mad.

746
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:15,040
I'd be like, Joe, what the fuck
was that? And you go, I don't know.

747
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:20,030
I thought it was funny. We laugh it
off. No, but if you hit me with like,

748
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,720
you know, like Hobo, do you
know what I mean? Like poof,

749
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,900
from a person that would be the deal
breaker. I'd be like, you fucker,

750
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:28,280
I'm gonna have to see in my,

751
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:32,720
I now really swift human
shit is way more terrifying.

752
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,120
Did you ever see Gigi Allen? Uh, yeah.

753
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,400
And then he starts throwing it at people
and they get out of their way. Like,

754
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,320
like,
like military striping,

755
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:46,490
like when people have about
human poo is way worse.

756
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,620
It's terrifying. Yeah. No,
no, no, no, no. So I did that.

757
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,720
I just hose it off. Ah,
yeah. But I did the, yeah,

758
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:59,440
the gathering of the Juggalos
and, and um, and in, uh,

759
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,520
the, uh, the opening act upchuck uh,

760
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,480
the clown is trying to calm my nerves
now there's, there's no, you know,

761
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:12,590
they have their, their, their
own security. So there's
no security. It's just,

762
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,840
it's just juggle a law on this
huge piece of property. Wow.

763
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,900
So, and there's so, it was
just madness. Yeah. There's
fires going on and fire work.

764
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,060
People are always lighting
fire to like fireworks,

765
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,190
like the way people light
cigarettes. Like casually. I don't,

766
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:31,500
I saw a lot of that was really funny.
Like where people don't jump out the way.

767
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,310
It's like

768
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,870
some bath salts. You wandered around
amongst his be, are they freaking out?

769
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,230
No, because, um, I think, well,

770
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,130
they know that sometimes I get
recognized for the most part I don't get

771
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,740
recognized. But, but,
but it was, you know,

772
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,700
we took a golf cart through the
whole thing. And like I said,

773
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:53,310
there's fights and people,
I don't know what they're doing,

774
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,890
but maybe you might know what this is,
but suddenly people would drop,

775
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,340
like there'd be like a group of people
and then you just see him drop. Like,

776
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:00,990
like they were puppets in
someone cut their strings.

777
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:04,490
They just hit them like his own, they're
cheering graph thing like their Joan.

778
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:07,410
Oh No, no, like whatever they
had been doing, we just suddenly,

779
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,710
like a bunch of them would just drop.
Yeah. It'd be like three or four of them.

780
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:14,010
Obviously they just ingested or did
something. And then I'll send you Jim go,

781
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,780
don't get the done like dominoes and
then they get up. I don't know what that,

782
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,060
whatever it is is not good.
Yeah. Well, well, so, so, so, so,

783
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,620
you know, it's, it's, I understand
the idea of the Juggalos by the way.

784
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:32,790
I get it. You know, I get it. It's a, it's
a certain sec that's, that's pissed off.

785
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:35,340
And it's certain group of
people and I, and, and they,

786
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:38,400
and they do have the sense of
community and family. I do,

787
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,480
I do try to be open minded.
And they were, and by the way,

788
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:43,380
they were very nice to me,

789
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,810
I should say that it's a very
good way of putting that. But,

790
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,570
but while we were there,
you know,

791
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:52,620
up checks trying to convince me that
it's not that scary of a Gig and he's

792
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,170
driving me around on this golf
cart and he's like, you know,

793
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:59,880
you got to it and this huge cloud
just everybody's kind of either,

794
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,170
some guys are cut and clown makeup. I
is, a lot of them are, uh, or like obese,

795
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,490
you know, men and women. It's really like
an incest survivors convention. Like,

796
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:10,690
you know, nobody's going to
touch me anymore, you know.

797
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:15,570
So this guy just jumps out of nowhere
and starts punching up chuck on the golf

798
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,150
guy. He's running along and for
no reason. He's like, fuck you,

799
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:26,520
fuck you up. And he's
gutting it. And the guy said,

800
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:30,750
we lose the guy. And he's
like, ah, ah, I'm here every
year. You know, they know me,

801
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:35,580
I'm like family. And I'm like, okay.
So, so then he punched him in the face,

802
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,270
punched him right in the face, and then
he took it like, like in the shoulder.

803
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,360
And then, and then by the time we
gotten him, he got get 'em like one,

804
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:45,820
like in the kidney on the way out, like
a left. And he's hitting him hard. Yeah.

805
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,430
Yeah. Real punches. Real punches.
Jesus. So, so, and that was Columbia.

806
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,110
It was a little smudge.
He's trying to,

807
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,470
he's trying to convince me this can affect
the first kind of fake what comes in

808
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,050
and it just sprays all over
us. And uh, and he's like, uh,

809
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,310
he's so familiar with getting hit
with Vaco Cola. He goes, he goes, uh,

810
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,800
uh, it's diet. It's not going to stay.

811
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,420
I swear to God he really said that Larry.

812
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:17,010
And then one comes in and, and, and
uh, the o nine, he's got it on camera.

813
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:20,980
She had a sports setting on her,
on her camera set.

814
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,830
The shutter is like faster. So we've got
this shot. It's like the Zapruder film.

815
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:30,160
We got this can of soda.
This guy does a baseball

816
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,450
pitch and you see it whizzing seconds
before it hits them right in the temple,

817
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:39,160
no car rack.
And he just slumped over and he goes,

818
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,440
uh, lumps over the wheel
and he goes, I'm hurt.

819
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,520
I'm hurt bad by the way, he's mid sentence
because you know something like that,

820
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:52,120
when the soda is that going to happen
at a Dave Matthews come rack and he

821
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:56,650
slumped. So I was like, I'm hurt. I'm
hurt bad Bob. He's calling me Bob,

822
00:47:56,651 --> 00:48:01,090
so I know he's really fucked up, not
five. And I think he was out for a second.

823
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,860
Oh my God. So he hits, he hits the gas
and now, yeah, that's up chuck. Yeah,

824
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,780
that's, it's Joel. And so it was like the
golf cart and I was fine. That's crazy.

825
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,060
So how old were you when this
was going on, by the way?

826
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,050
Your sold 1550 years.
50 years old.

827
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,290
And so upchuck now full throttle and
I'm steering spear and we're whizzing

828
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:27,940
through the crowd, like
Mr [inaudible], wild ride,

829
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,240
Juggalos kind of. And I, I, uh, and then,

830
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,300
oh, oh, do I love this? This is actually
beautiful. You know, he was concussed.

831
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,260
His eyes were all fucked up.
I'm like, God. And he's like,

832
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,650
we just went back to the trailer and
we're just gonna be really quiet.

833
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:48,260
And then he puts in ice cold
vago on his side of his head.

834
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:54,640
He's like, he's going to look,
he's like, am I bleeding? I go,

835
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,720
I don't know where the makeup starts.
Much blood.

836
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,070
I don't know what's right

837
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,690
fucking can of sooner to the
head that, that's hard. Ard.

838
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,680
And then I'm not going to,
he may or may not,

839
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,840
it looked like he was doing some sort of
stimulant after that too, because it's,

840
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:19,730
you know, you worried about your safety
or this was all, yeah. Yeah. I, uh,

841
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,090
once I got it, yeah. You know, and, and
by the way, I'm no stranger to hi-jinks,

842
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,170
you know, I'm this the man who lit the
tonight show couch on fire, you know,

843
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:33,740
my wife says I have good ideas and bad
ideas and I don't know the difference.

844
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,650
It's just ideas.
And I treat them with enthusiasm.

845
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,770
I may or may not have lit a quarter
stick of dynamite in my backyard.

846
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,670
When I lived up,
I think it was a half a stick.

847
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,370
It was like a for stick.
Yeah. And it blew up, um,

848
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,920
this watermelon that shot all the
way, like three floors up. It was,

849
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,410
that's the way it goes in. It gets kind of
gory. But I digress. So I'm no stranger,

850
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,910
so like something explodes
and, and, and, and uh,

851
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,490
and my wife goes to set an m 80 and
I'm like, no, that's, that's dynamite.

852
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,620
Wow. So I go up, hey,
where's my party people that,

853
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:17,430
no, I, I actually did a fine set there by
the way. Crowd was, you know, one o'clock.

854
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,910
I hit the stage. They, they, they, they,
you know, they, they liked the tenacity.

855
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:24,490
If you can actually hang
their there and I, you know,

856
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,070
my oldest brother was a biker,
so I'm of familiar

857
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,960
with a kind of outlaw behavior. It
wasn't, it's never that, um, you know,

858
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,440
freaky

859
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,790
to me it seems like it's sort of an
agreed upon thing at this sort of a place.

860
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,220
If you're going to hang out with a bunch
of people at a party and there call

861
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:43,250
themselves Juggalos, you know, some
sodas going to fly through the air.

862
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:44,020
It's going to be,

863
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,320
you can't get mad about soda,
but to the point of,

864
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,050
but what you see the problem is,
is if there is no,

865
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,100
uh, there's no law, right. It's
a little lord of the flies.

866
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,240
Like some dude, they thought he
was stealing so they physically,

867
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,510
I don't know what happened to him,
but they tore his car park, like,

868
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:06,950
just dismantled it. Whoa. Yeah. So it's
a little, little lord of the flies.

869
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,580
Yeah.
I mean,

870
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:13,581
I would've got paid in a plastic trash
bag full of 20s that's actually kind of

871
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:18,030
bad ass. Yeah. And then, uh, and then,

872
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:22,360
and then the cops had just at the lip,
just, just, just taking people to jail.

873
00:51:22,361 --> 00:51:26,620
They had a bus. So you, so we pull
out right in the cabs are gone.

874
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,910
What's going on? I go, look, I got
a bag full of money. Bob. Get cold

875
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,020
comedian. I was big in the 80s you
know, they're like, yeah, you know,

876
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,420
nothing weird. You guys, whatever you
want to do, I'm completely straight.

877
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,750
And they were, they actually found
that really funny. That is funny.

878
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,540
So they were looking for people to be
drunk and then you opened up my bag of

879
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:50,280
money and they're like, I
should do comedy, you know,

880
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,130
and they're all busted my chops.
But yeah.

881
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,300
Would they looking for drunk drivers or,
oh, just raw hide out of their minds.

882
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,160
Anything. I mean they were just popping
everybody that pulled out of the this

883
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,530
street there. I love what
you said about the, uh,

884
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,580
about it being like community and the,
there's of positive things to that.

885
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,360
There. There is so, so I mean, like I
tell this story and I laugh and stuff,

886
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:13,780
but was it any different than when I
went to see the almond brothers with my

887
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:16,840
brother Tommy, and he was
tripping on acid and his brother,

888
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,200
his brother Biker, who is still
still alive, big bitch. Uh, we, uh,

889
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:27,340
who is a green baret and we're going to
see the almond brothers and he suddenly,

890
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,330
thanks everyone

891
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,710
ready? Going into the concert
is Charlie. Oh my God.

892
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,530
It was the best that,
what year was this?

893
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,760
Uh, probably like 78. Oh my God.
And I'm just like, oh. And you know,

894
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:43,130
sometimes when things go crazy.

895
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,990
That's the other thing about me
when during mayhem and chaos,

896
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:51,740
I'm actually super calm. It's pretty
cozy. You've been around it so many times,

897
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,900
but like everyday life we'll, we'll
flip me out. [inaudible] like we,

898
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,870
you're talking to her, know the line in
the post office. I can't handle correctly.

899
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:04,550
I get upset and stuff, but, but
may ham I get really calm. Really?

900
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,061
Yeah.

901
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:08,240
Like a deer jumped out in front of us
when we're up in willow creek and I just

902
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:11,480
said my wife, I go, just stopped the car.

903
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,020
I can all send Daddy. I
Dunno. It was pretty much

904
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,700
other than the other way. Yeah.
Yeah. But the, the, I know
what you're talking about,

905
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,110
about freaking out about lions
and stuff like that. If he,

906
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,200
if you can't just stand still and relax,
you know,

907
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,920
like in a line and then,
then the nicest slow.

908
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:36,330
It's probably like an ADHD thing when
people are actually really freaking out.

909
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,050
Well, it's the, it's
the, it's the, you know,

910
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,090
the whole nine caused me a,

911
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:48,091
a misanthrope and I think that is not
correct because I think what upsets me is

912
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:52,880
I actually kind of have,
I think I,

913
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,110
I tried to think the best.
I really do.

914
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:59,030
Even though I make movies
where I'm shooting people
and you know, and, and, and,

915
00:53:59,031 --> 00:54:03,000
and all these weird things, I do kind
of give people the benefit of doubt.

916
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,110
I truly do. When she said that she's, she
goes, you're missing throw up. And I said,

917
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,700
you only say that because you're a person.

918
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,230
She's always afraid that I'm going off
the grid because at night she calls it

919
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:15,610
the,
at my lake porn,

920
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,390
she comes in and says,
what are you looking at?

921
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:22,830
And it's just me looking at
like 80 acres. How Lake? Yeah,

922
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,080
it's got its own at home.
It's going to creek.

923
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,260
Oh, you looking at like houses and
get the generator going. Oh yeah,

924
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:33,670
go off the grid, dude. You and me. I think
about that shit all, it's off the grid.

925
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:39,070
Just squash all day. Just watching.
Just set up a few gifting boxes.

926
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:43,240
Now you went swatching
lear show him doing, is it,

927
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,030
did you start it? Yeah,
the show started airing.

928
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,060
It starts airing July
16th on the Scifi channel.

929
00:54:49,061 --> 00:54:52,430
It's called Joe Rogan questions
everything. And one of them is big foot.

930
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,020
I've had a big foot fascination since I
was a little kid when I was a little kid.

931
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:59,920
I was camping the Pacific
northwest with my Stepdad.

932
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,450
And there's a dude who was up there.

933
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:04,500
He was a trapper and he had like
these animal skins and shit.

934
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,190
He was killing animals like bobcats,

935
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,960
which I didn't think it was
kind of creepy at the time.

936
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,630
I think that's really creepy.
I was only seven. Yeah,

937
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,270
no, no, no. I met me. Yeah.

938
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,550
But, uh, and he told me
about, you know, that these,

939
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:21,110
all these people have had these big
foot like, uh, experiences up there.

940
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:23,330
And the way he was describing it,
I barely remember.

941
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,250
It's like a really whispery memory.

942
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,370
But I remember that's what
started me off on then I start,

943
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,290
I was always in the monsters and
shit when I was a little kid.

944
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:31,250
I loved horror movies.

945
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,520
So then I started like reading up on pig
foot and then I watched the Patterson

946
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:36,920
footage. Eventually I
saw, uh, in search of

947
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,700
and search of is the one that everybody
around and said, did you see boggy creek?

948
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:45,860
Because that was all women. So that,
that I think that had a boggy creek.

949
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:47,420
I didn't go back and revisit it,

950
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,660
but I think that movie probably had a
lot to do with my movie Willow Creek.

951
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:51,494
Actually,

952
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,320
I got addicted to that show
finding bigfoot two of you,
uh, if you want. Sure. Or

953
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,600
actually a cliff and Bobo showed up.
I showed the movie up,

954
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,350
I went back up. I went, yeah,

955
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,050
I showed it to the folks that are in it
because you know, a lot of actual um, uh,

956
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,780
folks from the big four community or in
the movie. I mean, and, and uh, and how,

957
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,800
how can we sell this movie?
I mean,

958
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:17,070
I'm just starting to play and
just started playing festivals.

959
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,040
Thing that I'm really happy is big
foot folks seem to really like it.

960
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,950
Like cliff said, this is the best
big foot movies ever saying, listen,

961
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,460
this is a great horror,

962
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,220
fun movie. It's a great
fun movie. Yeah. And

963
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,860
I don't, I try not to be cheesy
and, oh no, I didn't want,

964
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:34,360
I didn't want those guys.

965
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,780
Didn't talk too much about this movie
because I don't want to give any of it

966
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:42,060
away because I want people
to see it. It's, it's you or
me. It's, I think it's, Oh,

967
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,880
can I tell you when, when
things quickstar yeah, sure.

968
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,600
I'm having a blast. Thanks for
having me. Thanks for being on.

969
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,730
I'm having a bus too. So you've got that,
that the American Werewolf in London.

970
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:59,290
I love that movie. Yeah, me too. I,
yeah, so that blew my mind when I saw it.

971
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,440
Now where did you get that? Is that
from, this is a guy named Pat Mcgee.

972
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,710
He's a special effects guy and he does a,
he designs,

973
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,180
if you go to Magee [inaudible] dot com
he designs a couple different things.

974
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:12,610
Like he does an alien,
like from the movie alien,

975
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,690
and he just reconstructs life life size
replica. It's crazy. Yeah. He's really,

976
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,110
he's got a mold and he uses
Yak hair and it's incredible.

977
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,010
Many, I don't know if
you've ever heard this myth,

978
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:27,570
but one of the many myths about the
Patterson Gimlin footage is that it's John

979
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:31,860
Landis in the suit. Have you
ever heard that? No, I haven't
heard that. Okay. So, so,

980
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,200
so I've heard this and I that
and so one morning I and, and I,

981
00:57:36,201 --> 00:57:40,170
and I love American Werewolf. I love John,
like animal house and all that stuff.

982
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,400
I mean that was John Landis is of course
brilliant. So, but I don't know him.

983
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,960
So I get a hair up my ass and I'm like,

984
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,930
Oh and I got to get to the bottom of this.

985
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,030
So I shoot my agent an email and I say,

986
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,540
I've got this idea for a TV show for John
Landis myself. It's a total lie. I said,

987
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,460
can you get me his email?
And so she gets me his email.

988
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:07,020
So I write him an email and I'm going to
read it to you cause it cause so he and

989
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:10,200
I had this exchange and I say,
Hi John,

990
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:12,900
I'm writing an article about
the Patterson Gimlin footage.

991
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,200
I'm not just lying.
So He's,

992
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,280
thank God he's a nice guy
and was wondering would you
be kind enough to let me

993
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,080
interview? Okay. So I
go on and on and I said,

994
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:26,760
I want to clear up the rumors that John
Chambers made the suit and that you were

995
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:31,050
wearing it so quickly. I get
this email back, Deere, bobcat.

996
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,920
I am definitely not the guy in
the big foot suit in the parish.

997
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:37,770
And Kim would footage. What publication
are you writing an article for?

998
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,580
How did you get my email address?
It's funny,

999
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:47,280
but I sent him back and I, and, and,
and we went back and forth and, and uh,

1000
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,860
he was really cool actually. He, he, he,

1001
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:53,370
I think he's probably tired
of answering that question,

1002
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,460
but I'm sure one of his early, he
did a great movie. A, it's like a,

1003
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:04,120
it's called schlock where he's in a
gorilla suit. You've probably seen it.

1004
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,320
Is it like a gorilla with a
space helmet on? No, and it's,

1005
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,730
it's a kind of famous damage and
it's him directing the movie.

1006
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,160
I love the in the gorilla suit with
this space. So it really, yeah,

1007
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,620
cause I got a great,
I love this.

1008
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,930
There's a photo of me directing
shakes the clown and I,

1009
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:22,010
and I'm in a clown suit and I've just,
I'll never be in

1010
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,680
something I direct again, you know,
and I'm like fucking, you know,

1011
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:27,920
I'm like dead serious and everyone's
laughing and I look like such an ass.

1012
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,690
So no sense of humor. I'm fucking
clown suit. So it's called Schlock.

1013
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,780
Schlock. Yeah. Never heard of it.
Yeah. Let me double check. But yeah,

1014
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,610
it is called Schlock. Uh, but
so I'm a, I'm a big fan. I
wasn't coming from a, again,

1015
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,160
yeah. It's like I wasn't coming
from a big snarky place. I,

1016
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:45,860
I sincerely fan of land is and stuff.

1017
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,790
But I thought there's a lot of big foot
rumors that I kind of thought, well,

1018
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:53,900
maybe I can use, you know, my
connections. Not that I have connections,

1019
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:56,990
but you know, I could just prove
some of the things, you know, like,

1020
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:59,090
like get into the John Chambers suit.
You know,

1021
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:01,760
John Chambers is the guy who was an
Argo who did the planet of the apes.

1022
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:01,971
You know,

1023
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:06,140
there's a rumor that he may have built
the suit and he did make a big foot,

1024
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:10,280
but his big foot I've seen in a, it's
a, you know, so, so whatever it is,

1025
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:11,090
a rabbit hole,

1026
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:14,930
well it's a rabbit hole, but it's also a
rabbit hole where a guy says he did it.

1027
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:17,540
His name's Bob Herat homeless.
He walks just like that.

1028
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:21,590
He took a lie detector test and passed.
He also was a con man.

1029
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:26,150
So is Robert Patterson and
Robert Patterson also went
to jail for writing a bad

1030
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:29,690
check. Pay for the very camera
that found that footage.

1031
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,470
Yes. And you go even deeper.
Excellent. Because the con men, look,

1032
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:39,590
my thing about my belief in the pants
and footage, it boils down to the gate.

1033
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:43,190
It really does.
It boils down to that knee in that leg.

1034
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,230
And you've been listening
to a bunch of nuts.

1035
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:49,860
Trust me. That's a guy in a monkey suit.
Let's, let's play it. Let's play it.

1036
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:52,590
We'll go over it. They guy,
it's a guy with a football pad,

1037
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,170
football shoulder pads on explaining this.
Okay.

1038
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:01,530
I'm not confronting you. I know,
but why it, this is just a more,

1039
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,810
this isn't like proof,
but this is a weird thing.

1040
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,730
Why did they go to the trouble to get it?
Find that stabilized one.

1041
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:13,470
There's a stabilized one. It's better.
Why did they, um, that was, uh,

1042
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,980
Abraham Zapruder who shot
that too. He does one. Look,

1043
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,750
there's a couple of things
you'd be noticed. I want to,

1044
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:22,020
I want people to pay attention. When you
watching it, why does it have breasts?

1045
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,380
That to me is the weirdest thing.
Why doesn't have that breath?

1046
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,360
Why did they couldn't make a
suit like that in that time?

1047
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:30,780
And why would they take the [inaudible]
and there wasn't for sure if the stretch

1048
01:01:30,781 --> 01:01:32,600
fabric that looked like for it.

1049
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,090
I'm not sure if that's entirely
true to a lot of knuckleheads.

1050
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,300
And I also think that it's ridiculous to
say why would they make that looks like

1051
01:01:42,841 --> 01:01:46,200
a [inaudible] listening
to a lot of dingbats.

1052
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,810
That's what you'd been queer
whack a. Do you look at it? Move.

1053
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,340
That is a man that is that
a man not compelling to me.

1054
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:56,160
That looks like it's a
man. Are you serious? Yeah.

1055
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:59,350
The Gate looks like a dude with a
big load and he's wearing a diaper.

1056
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,180
I was going to football shoulder pads on.
It's all fucked up.

1057
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:07,440
Stupid outfit and I think you're looking
at it from, uh, you know the problem is,

1058
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:09,270
here's the problem. I
can mind. Fuck myself.

1059
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,840
The problem is we play it back over again.
I'd go, that's fucking real. Yeah, man.

1060
01:02:12,841 --> 01:02:16,260
Look at the CAF. I'll look them in the
cat's ass. Back it up a little bit.

1061
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:19,730
Let's watch it again. I'll try to, I'm
going to try to mind fuck myself here.

1062
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,600
Like a mind. Fuck myself. Ready? Oh my
God. I think it's real now. See if I can,

1063
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,710
when it goes back and forth like that,
that's the only,

1064
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:30,740
you got to play Yakety Sax. Look
at that. At eight eight, eight,

1065
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:35,250
eight Benny Hill goes out and
slaps, looking at walk, let's,

1066
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:39,120
let's,
let's zoom and stabilize on the big foot.

1067
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:46,350
That's a kind of monkey suit.
I wish I could mind fuck
myself, but I can't. I try.

1068
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:48,960
I try, but it looks so
stupid. It's so funny to you.

1069
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,790
Slightly longer hands like he's probably
got some artificial hands in the suit.

1070
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,990
And if you watch this, look up
Bob Herana mess, but his walking,

1071
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,810
there's some footage of canyon fascinates
split screen with Bob Herana Miss

1072
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,390
Walking on one side of the
screen and the Sasquatch and it,

1073
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,860
goddammit Bob [inaudible]. This was a big
gangly Sasquatch looking motherfucker.

1074
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,500
Let's take a look. And he passed the
lie detector test, but that's not,

1075
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,480
but I mean when the guy walks like a duck,
quacks like a duck story.

1076
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:21,930
So many times he started believing it's
possible he made Oj Simpson the whole

1077
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,480
thing.
I think you can do that too.

1078
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,090
I believe it a hundred percent a
hundred percent I'm gonna believe what

1079
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,490
my memory of my childhood is.
So God damn foggy, you know,

1080
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,080
I could go one way or another way.

1081
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:37,890
And start telling a story about it one
way and then by the time I get 10 years

1082
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:39,990
down the line, don't even fucking
remember what really happened.

1083
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:43,440
Your childhood is so bananas now to you.
Have you,

1084
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,460
do you spend time trying to piece
it together or you move past it?

1085
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,510
What do you mean? Well, I mean it's
pretty nuts. The moving around,

1086
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:55,260
and I've heard you talk about it in
the past, but do you around was nuts.

1087
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:59,040
But the really nutty thing was the
martial arts competing and going and

1088
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,140
competing in martial arts tournaments
throughout my high school years.

1089
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,670
That was the nuttiest thing cause I was,

1090
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:06,420
I was a child and I was having martial
arts competitions against grown men.

1091
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,573
Like my,
my,

1092
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,850
my instructor was crazy and he made me
fight grown man when I was 15 so like

1093
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:16,851
from the time when I was 15 till I was
21 all I did was full contact martial

1094
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:19,830
arts tournaments.
That was way scarier than anything.

1095
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:23,430
It was almost like I was so scared of
growing up and I was so scared of being an

1096
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:28,431
adult and I was so scared
of just interacting with
people and fitting in in any

1097
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:30,420
place. Cause I was always the
new kid and always moving.

1098
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:34,620
I was so scared of fitting in that I
just decided to do something way harder

1099
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:39,150
than that. So I didn't have to think about
that. I tried to do the most obscure,

1100
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:43,950
crazy, scary thing to me. Well,
why did, it's really weird.

1101
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,990
Uh, now it's, it's kind
of sad to hear this.

1102
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,270
No, it's not sad. It
worked out great. Well,

1103
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,320
sad is if I had to go back and be myself
as a child was often sad as a child,

1104
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:57,990
but ultimately it worked
out, you know? I mean,

1105
01:04:57,991 --> 01:05:01,230
it's not sad to go through tough
experiences and develop character.

1106
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,210
I don't think that's
sad, you know? I mean,

1107
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:06,240
I think there's a lot of people who
came out of a lot worse than me. Like I,

1108
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,040
it was fun at the comedy come about.

1109
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:11,520
That's the part the company
came about from a gallows humor,

1110
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:15,180
from going to tournaments. I used to
make my friends laugh in the locker room.

1111
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,010
It would make my friends laugh like
on buses and planes and shit. I would

1112
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,250
be the guy who was like trying to crack
the ice cause we were all terrified and

1113
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,450
I wasn't insecure around them.

1114
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:27,010
Like the guys that are trained with it
was the probably the first time in my

1115
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:30,960
life I felt confident enough to like
talk out about things and say [inaudible]

1116
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:34,320
joke about things and not to get told
to shut the fuck up or someone's gonna

1117
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,320
kick my ass or you know,

1118
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:39,130
that's what a lot of moving from town to
town when you're the new kid it's like

1119
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:42,010
you always have to defend yourself. You're
always dealing with the local bully.

1120
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:43,750
And it's like it was because
it's a constant thing.

1121
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,700
So when I started doing martial arts,

1122
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:47,980
like this guys all knew me so
I was comfortable around them.

1123
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,800
So then I would make fun of Shit to
sort of lighten the tension because

1124
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:54,760
everybody was scared. Cause when you
go to tournaments it was just fear.

1125
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,960
The bus was filled with fear and
everyone's scared. Weighing in is scary.

1126
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:01,600
And then every now and then one of
us would get knocked the fuck out.

1127
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:04,300
You get head kicked and Ah,
and you deal with your friend.

1128
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:05,980
Just got to cut cost in the thing that you

1129
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,940
do for zero money bus, go back in the
bus and get an ice pack on his head.

1130
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,320
I get black eyes and shows around.
Do you call the family

1131
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:18,320
[inaudible]? I was the only
child. Wow. Yeah, until you know,

1132
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,520
some kids came along when
I was like 19 and 20.

1133
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,720
There was some kids that joined up.

1134
01:06:23,721 --> 01:06:27,130
There was like 17 and 18 but for
the longest time I was really young.

1135
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:31,400
Have any social life? Did
you have zero zero, no party
and no drinking, no nothing.

1136
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,500
I had a couple of friends
from high school and uh,

1137
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:36,140
my best friends actually went to the
school. That was the other school.

1138
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,160
And what about, what about women?
Did you have girlfriends at all?

1139
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,930
I had a girlfriend,
almost ruined me,

1140
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:43,360
my first girlfriend because as soon
as they're starting to having sex,

1141
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,680
I just didn't want to train anymore.
I was like,

1142
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:52,120
it was like, why would I go,
Gee, this is way more fun.

1143
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,720
Does everybody know about this?
Yeah, it was ridiculous. I was like,

1144
01:06:55,721 --> 01:07:00,370
the sex is way better than martial
arts. Like getting my face. But I think,

1145
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,180
yeah, having my nose shoved into my
brain, it was always, um, all right,

1146
01:07:05,181 --> 01:07:07,930
so we were talking about
Paris said before, I,

1147
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:12,550
I don't suddenly became a shrink on you
if it walks like a duck and quacks like

1148
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:15,020
a duck, it's a duck. Okay.
I want you to watch this.

1149
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:19,570
This is Bob or autonomous walking and
then the big foot Bob looking at turning

1150
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:21,760
just like the big foot.
I mean, come on man.

1151
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,520
Put that guy in the goddamn monkey suit.

1152
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,550
It was a mistake that the knees
aren't shown here. Honestly. I mean,

1153
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:31,600
if you look at the knees and the,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1154
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:35,170
the way the calf goes up.
You ever walk with Ice Skates on?

1155
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,640
Uh, yeah. Well, you know how
ice Kate's don't bend. Right?

1156
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,150
And when you had to pick them up and
be fucking exaggerated walking motion.

1157
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,440
What he did with the big foot looks like
to me is like a dude with like a suit

1158
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:51,600
on. It's got like crazy feat on the suit
and he has to walk a certain way because

1159
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,050
they will then, you know, it's funny,

1160
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:56,950
I know I'm not giving way too much
about the movie, but there's, there's,

1161
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,860
there is footprints in the movie.
Yeah.

1162
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,550
So when we say that you
shouldn't have said, oh really?
Yeah. Stop. Stop right now.

1163
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,510
Make people, because there's so much
about this movie. It's so bad ass.

1164
01:08:07,511 --> 01:08:09,520
If your movie sucked,
I'd let you keep talking,

1165
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:14,280
but you're moving to goods from you.
Let me shoot myself. God Damn it.

1166
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,460
Don't do it.
So

1167
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,840
I'm just here to plug hot to trot tonight.

1168
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:23,520
It would be beautiful if a guy who's a
con man just happened to be the first guy

1169
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,660
to actually see big foot
and filming it would be,

1170
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:30,680
well don't you feel that way about being
a comedian now? You went out and, and,

1171
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:35,100
and where did you go? This
is the area we're not going
to fake anything. No, no, no.

1172
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:40,050
But I mean, but if you find something
there, uh, Joe Rogen, you know? Yeah, no,

1173
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:43,470
absolutely. Well, I feel
about it like, like, like, um,

1174
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,750
I'm going up to Oregon with a,
and,

1175
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:48,270
and talking to cliff and
we're going to go out, but,

1176
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:52,380
but I also feel like I tainted, you
know, the idea that, you know, if,

1177
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:54,000
if we find anything,

1178
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:58,560
I don't think so. I think if you,
you're just like me and I think you're,

1179
01:08:58,561 --> 01:09:03,240
you're feeling about it is genuine. You
know? I think it's a fascinating subject.

1180
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,030
It's very popular,
let's say bullshit.

1181
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,690
But it's also very possible that it's
not all out and say it's, it's, it's,

1182
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,680
it is fake.

1183
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,210
Okay.

1184
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,860
What is it about the subconscious
through thousands a year is that people

1185
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:19,730
continually see these things. I
mean, why is it, you know, and,

1186
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,660
and Teddy Roosevelt, it tells
a story of, of a, you know,

1187
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,830
why does it keep showing up?

1188
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,530
Okay. Finish that. Teddy Roosevelt told
his story in his book that he was unaware.

1189
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,500
A guy killed a wild man.
Yeah.

1190
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:35,010
Yeah.
And everything was destroyed.

1191
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,520
But so like all these stories
that keep cars showing up.

1192
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:41,160
I know I'm interested too in that,
like what?

1193
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,500
What is it in part of our subconscious?
What part of,

1194
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,940
why do these archetypal characters keep
showing up then it happens to be a man

1195
01:09:47,941 --> 01:09:52,360
in the woods going to be simply is
keep your kids away from bears or,

1196
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,080
or is it something bigger

1197
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:58,640
or is it a, is it a, is it an
800 pound wood ape? I mean,
you know, it's, it's, it's,

1198
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,690
it's all fascinating.

1199
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:02,390
There's so many different things to
consider when you say something like that.

1200
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:04,430
It was like, first of
all, you have to consider,

1201
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:08,330
that's probably a conglomeration of a
bunch of things and one of those things

1202
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:09,890
being that everyone's
afraid of the unknown.

1203
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,660
And when you look out into that
dark woods and you just said,

1204
01:10:12,661 --> 01:10:14,090
what the fuck is out there?

1205
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:17,150
You said that exact getting creeped
out for the first time, by the way.

1206
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,920
And I was in the woods a little
17 miles down a dirt road.

1207
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:27,890
Ooh, you know, your 11 hours from La
North. Then we go to Willow Creek,

1208
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:31,580
then you'd drive about 40 minutes to
Orleans name, you drive up this road.

1209
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:34,850
Then we'd drive two and a half hours
down a 17 mile dirt road to get to the

1210
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:36,380
location.
So there's no phones,

1211
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:40,680
there's no planes going over
to mountain lions, whoa.

1212
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:41,970
To mountain lions to,

1213
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,370
and I put the actors in the tent and
that scene and they're going, hey man,

1214
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,670
why are we here man?
We could do this in a parking lot.

1215
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,780
No, because uh, it was, uh, you know,

1216
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:01,630
it feels fucking real. There's nothing,
don't say more. Okay. You said some shit,

1217
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:04,680
but the fucker stop talking about it.
But it is,

1218
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:09,920
I am happy that people like it, that it
is scary, that there's laughs and um, uh,

1219
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:14,160
it was the most fun I had
making a movie going down a

1220
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,090
dark road and getting into the
woods or the Pacific northwest.

1221
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,620
It will give you this,

1222
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,100
this new appreciation of how
ridiculously wild that area is.

1223
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,420
Like the idea that we
have an accurate account.

1224
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,910
Did you get like a buzz when you
start the front of the tree trees?

1225
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,870
There is right,
or am there's a female moon beam.

1226
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:39,080
I mean there,
there are energy,

1227
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,520
trees are alive,
but the oxygen that they make you get,

1228
01:11:43,521 --> 01:11:46,280
you get like this weird buzz.
I was not frighten.

1229
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:50,660
Everybody else was kind of frightened.
Um, and uh, and I was just like, I,

1230
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:54,530
I, I didn't realize this about
myself. I just like dropped my trout.

1231
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,980
I'm walking around my
funder where the river,

1232
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:01,910
is that where you want to
get a lake house? Yeah. Or
even, I'm fine with a river.

1233
01:12:01,911 --> 01:12:04,530
Watch him. That's what you're doing. You
want to go up there and go scratches.

1234
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,930
Yeah, man. And, and, and uh,
I don't want to dis, I don't,

1235
01:12:08,931 --> 01:12:11,540
I'm not a prepper.
I don't like that attitude.

1236
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,530
I really don't because it's like
I don't like these preppers.

1237
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:20,450
It's like this weird end of
times a Christian Judeo bs
that they're buying into.

1238
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,240
Do you know what I mean? The world, if
we've learned anything about the world,

1239
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:28,040
it's not going to go out with one big
bang. You know, it's just like, you know,

1240
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,930
things are going to fall apart,
but it's not going to be anarchy.

1241
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:35,180
I don't know why so many people
in every movie is about, you know,

1242
01:12:35,181 --> 01:12:37,700
a scientologist saving the world.

1243
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,650
We've been through several
of those and history.

1244
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,130
I think we're better at understanding
it now because we have the written word

1245
01:12:45,131 --> 01:12:45,964
and we have history.

1246
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,300
We have all these different stories
of the past of civilizations that have

1247
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:53,340
deteriorated back when people didn't
really have access to books and knowledge,

1248
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:56,930
some weird sort of hopelessness.
That's, that's, that's, that's,

1249
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,060
and I don't buy it. I don't, I
don't, I don't, I think, I think, um,

1250
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,340
I think human beings are
so resilient and uh, uh,

1251
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,720
or there is the Carlin bit, you know,
maybe, maybe the earth need plastic,

1252
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:13,570
you know, like as us,
that's fine as a species.

1253
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:17,560
I mean, um, I think that
we probably will carry on,

1254
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,210
but it's really easily conceivable that
some natural disaster could happen that

1255
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:24,460
could wipe out most of
the population of earth.

1256
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,620
All you need is one big you could Tom
sized media that hits true and we're done.

1257
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,840
And there's hundreds of thousands
of those floating around.

1258
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:32,740
Not like three of them,

1259
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:37,180
but I'm not, I think I'm more of an
optimist I think. I think when you, you,

1260
01:13:37,181 --> 01:13:40,690
when you just prep and
decide to go underground,

1261
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:45,250
I want to go out in the woods
because I like, I liked the quiet,

1262
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:47,740
I like the smells. I like beautiful. Yeah.

1263
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,900
But everybody else with me was just
completely flipped out of there.

1264
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:55,030
But it's like this intern, there's just
a tiny crew and he's like, hey man,

1265
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:58,780
what's his different suite of bobcat?
Uh, what did you see these men,

1266
01:13:58,781 --> 01:13:59,291
a mountain lion.

1267
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:03,520
We said two of them were one and willow
creek just walking across the street and

1268
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:06,310
then one car or were you
drawing a con for the one?

1269
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:10,970
But the other one was right where we were
filming and, uh, and he goes, hey man, uh,

1270
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,070
bobcat and a mountain

1271
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,090
lion. What's the difference? I go
bobcat stocky and, um, you know,

1272
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:20,590
he's got like a short tail and a mountain
lions tall and it's got a long tail.

1273
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:25,570
He's like, yeah, I saw a mountain
lion that I go where? And I'm like,

1274
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,330
I'm like, you know, this is like a, um,

1275
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:32,290
Verner Herzog making Fitzcarraldo I'm
like out of my mind and I go where he goes

1276
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,280
to the left, I go to the
right fellows, you know, just

1277
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,460
there's a real problem with them not
allowing them to hunt mountain lines

1278
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:42,930
anymore. Mountain lions I'd find
out later on our bad ass. Well,

1279
01:14:42,931 --> 01:14:44,460
well here's the thing,
they're cats.

1280
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,110
So if you run your 200 pound mouse,
you know what I mean,

1281
01:14:49,111 --> 01:14:50,760
it's just going to take you down.
Yeah.

1282
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,890
Well they go after people on
bikes for that very reason.

1283
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:56,260
They cannot help themselves a
mouse. Yeah. And so like it's

1284
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,290
you on a bike with a light
is a laser pointer. And so,

1285
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,590
so I was like, how close were
you guys? About five feet

1286
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,280
and if you've ever seen him by the
way? Um, well cause the one I did see,

1287
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:13,950
and I have big balls, I was
in a car, but the one I saw

1288
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:17,540
was huge.
It's a lion and they just walk.

1289
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:21,320
And there he was walking with a
purpose across the road, like,

1290
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:26,070
like I'm sure he's about to eat some real
problem in California's banned hunting

1291
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:30,350
of them in some places have banned use
of dogs. You need dogs to Huntington's,

1292
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,790
otherwise you'll never find what
happens to the Doug's. I mean,

1293
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,380
the dogs bathed them,
they bark,

1294
01:15:34,381 --> 01:15:36,880
they get him up a tree and then the new
person comes along as the shoots him.

1295
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,580
Sometimes dogs get attacked though.

1296
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,510
And that was part of
that story and that's it.

1297
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,320
I'm not so happy about that either.
But now when you went in the woods,

1298
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:47,130
did you have a gun? There was a guy with
us had a gun. Yeah. Everybody kept saying,

1299
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:48,090
Oh, you got a gun. And that was

1300
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,640
gun around my nose. I know,
I know. I would never know
right now. I know. I had a,

1301
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:57,280
we had a ranger with us and,
and uh, he's out. So, uh, yeah,

1302
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,180
he, he's a, a big foot, uh,
Robert Lederman a ranger and he's,

1303
01:16:02,181 --> 01:16:05,180
uh, uh, I'd say big foot
enthusiasts. He's really sweet guy.

1304
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:09,920
Huge help on the movie actually.
And, um, and, you know,

1305
01:16:09,921 --> 01:16:14,090
it's like three, four in the morning and
he's like, you know, uh, I'm a writer too.

1306
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:17,570
And I go, oh, really good. What are
you? Ray Goes, we, you know, twilight,

1307
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,260
like a Yankees.

1308
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:23,260
I write tween a tween novel
set in the big foot world.

1309
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,020
It's a coming of age story.

1310
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:29,760
Twilight was too big for fall in love.

1311
01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:33,660
Young, young, big foot, big foot
falls in love with a person.

1312
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:37,080
I know people fall in love in
the world. I go, what's the name?

1313
01:16:37,081 --> 01:16:41,640
He's like Yeti or not at this
point. I know. And I'm like,

1314
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:44,190
I go,
this is,

1315
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,660
this is my air hose.
You know,

1316
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,430
like this guy is the only
thing keeping me alive tonight.

1317
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,460
Yeah. You're not, oh God. That was very,

1318
01:16:55,461 --> 01:17:00,000
I was very happy that he liked the movie
again. You know, these were folks, uh,

1319
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,300
in the community. Yeah. Steven stuff
for a up in, um, uh, bigfoot books.

1320
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:08,240
If you saw that in the movie, he's, the
last thing I'm going to say about it,

1321
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:10,220
that shower the house was

1322
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,110
very authentic.

1323
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,710
It's like I've heard the sounds that they
surrender oddly connect with the how.

1324
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:19,070
That's the thing, like you
listened to that stuff too. Okay.

1325
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:22,850
Let's forget the Patterson Gimlin footage.
There's so much stuff. Oh No, no, no,

1326
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:23,151
I don't.

1327
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:25,970
I don't think there's no evidence of big
foot exists and I don't think the big

1328
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:29,540
foot doesn't exist. I think that
the Patterson gave him a hoaxer.

1329
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:30,770
A guy's a bullshit artists.

1330
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:36,080
I met people when I was up in the
Pacific northwest that knew the Patterson

1331
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,070
Patterson and knew the other
dude too. Bob, give him
Herandez. Oh, oh. Herana miss.

1332
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:42,920
The guy wore a suit and they said,
those guys are bullshit artists.

1333
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:43,790
They're always trying to make money,

1334
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,500
and he'd been trying to
do it for a long time.

1335
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,120
They'd had someone else make a suit.

1336
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,460
They had had to someone else
make a suit and it didn't work,

1337
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:54,140
and so they had this city who made
that suit? Then the fuck knows.

1338
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:58,670
But you know, why is it amazing suits not
that good. Here's the problem, everybody.

1339
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,790
This is one of them. Everybody
wants to say that it's really good,

1340
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,490
but here's what's realistic.
It's blurry as fuck,

1341
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:07,790
so you're not getting a real accurate,
crisp version of what you're seeing.

1342
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,210
You're getting this smushy version of it
and so everybody wants a tribute it to

1343
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:15,320
muscles and this movement to like,
there's no design, no costume like that.

1344
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:19,160
I would buy that if you would
show me a high resolution,

1345
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:23,570
crystal clear video of what we're looking
at, but you're looking at blurry trees.

1346
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,430
The trees look blurry is fuck.

1347
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:29,540
You can't make out the very specific
branches or the texture of the bark.

1348
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,300
So what you're looking at when
you're saying that the look so good,

1349
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:34,940
you look into this blurry thing.
That might be tits.

1350
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,310
That might be a flaw in the costume.

1351
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:41,120
That might be his ass or it might
be he's wearing a fucking diaper.

1352
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,240
You're a gorilla suit.
I'm leaving. No, no,

1353
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,080
I think pull it out again.
Let's watch it one more time.

1354
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:51,890
I want to get back to the
breath stabilized. I always
think that's very weird.

1355
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,790
It's my, it's weird, but it's not,
it's not an impossible to fake charity.

1356
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,760
It's not, maybe, well, here's the
thing. Okay, how about this? Maybe they,

1357
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:03,440
they would feel like big foot
is way larger than a person.

1358
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,420
So you just pretend to
be a female big foot.

1359
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,790
Cause Bob Hieronymus is six foot five.
He's too small to be a Sasquatch.

1360
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:13,900
So they give him tits. That's way
more likely than they filmed bigfoot.

1361
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,720
Right. It's way more lard. But you say
that now. What big foot do you, uh,

1362
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,410
what evidence do you buy that there's
a lot of things that are interesting.

1363
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,900
First of all,
the footprints with the dermal ridges.

1364
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,530
That's fascinating because that's
incredibly difficult to fake. See,

1365
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:33,740
I'm looking at that man. You
know, there's, that's so blurry.

1366
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,350
Look how blurry everything is. It's
all washed out. Look at that tree.

1367
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:39,380
You don't know what the fuck that tree
really looks like. You can't see shit.

1368
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:42,120
You can't see anything.
We'll get all the bad version one.

1369
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,150
Looking at the best version you can get,
man.

1370
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,230
It's just blown up when you're
looking at everything in the distance.

1371
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:48,830
You want him shot on red?

1372
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:53,390
No Laszlo Kovacs to be the DP dude.
Be Honest.

1373
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:54,850
Look at the trees you're
looking at in front of,

1374
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,900
they want to look at the
trees in front of them.

1375
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:01,010
You can't even see any definition of
hazard trees there in meal penalties right

1376
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:05,530
now. And, and it says beyond that,

1377
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:09,420
he says, I'm out of here. Show was
that looks real to me. Jesus Christ.

1378
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:12,420
You're crazy. One more time. But
look at where you're looking at.

1379
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,390
You're looking at incredibly blurry shit.

1380
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:20,280
You're looking at incredibly blurry trees
that are all washed out and everyone

1381
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:24,150
trying to attribute all this
musculature and definition.

1382
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,090
You barely know what
you're looking at here.

1383
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,580
Why does this hold up so much?

1384
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:34,050
Doesn't why foot world,

1385
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:35,680
it doesn't hold up.
It's just a full,

1386
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:40,500
a film that has not been authenticated
or or refuted. It just hasn't been.

1387
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,740
Cause science hasn't really
spent any fucking time examining.

1388
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,190
What about bigfoot that
what the Yeti in Russia,

1389
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:52,380
the Russians spent a lot of time
examining. They were fucking with us.

1390
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:56,820
Okay. It still limits real
let them was third time.

1391
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:02,210
So we start time on this evidence that
if you're so pose ridges are fascinating.

1392
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,240
That's fascinating. The Melba
catch DNAs fascinating on the show.

1393
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,880
We just had a genetic but that,
yeah,

1394
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:13,200
but that's the stuff that people
could be bullshit are calling bs on.

1395
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,690
It could be.
But the dealers though,

1396
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,410
this guy was a geneticist that overlooked
the data and it was his conclusion

1397
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:22,050
based on his understanding of
genetics. There's a fame. He was a,

1398
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:23,840
like an accomplished geneticist,
but

1399
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:28,310
published in any real
thing other than their own.

1400
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,610
No. That's because they couldn't get
published. And we're so far down. No snow.

1401
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:36,750
It's good. It's a good thing. That's
the letter footage. This is like,

1402
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,050
this is when, uh, the o nine checks out.

1403
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,780
No, it's, look, it's, it's
a fascinating subject.

1404
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,130
Wrong. This Melba catch a
women or if it's a hoax,

1405
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:51,260
but when a geneticist says that he finds
the, the information to be compelling,

1406
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,110
then I have to listen because I'm too
fucking stupid to understand who's right

1407
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:54,850
or who's wrong.

1408
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:59,850
Do you ever see any of the story of
Jimmy Stewart with the Yeti finger?

1409
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,510
Jimmy Stewart? Yeah. He's,

1410
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:07,740
he's muddled that what was
supposed to be a Yeti finger of,

1411
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:13,220
uh, the Himalayas. Uh, and
his wife's underwear. Not,

1412
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,610
she wasn't, it wasn't in her pants
but I mean in her underwear. Right.

1413
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,550
Honey, you going to have to
keep this in your pussy. Yeah.

1414
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:21,740
It was just important to any finger.
It's hard getting weed and

1415
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,860
it needs to be moist.

1416
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,880
No it wasn't.
It was in her,

1417
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,490
in her underwear drawer and they
got it all the way to England.

1418
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:35,040
Now that has been proven not to
be a Yeti thing. I can't remember,

1419
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:38,550
but I remember that it had
DNA testing done to it.

1420
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:42,860
Jimmy Stewart at Yeti. I,
you know, you know, um,

1421
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,370
you know, what really works
for me is a lot of the, the,

1422
01:22:46,371 --> 01:22:48,390
the audio recordings will obviously,

1423
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:50,240
cause you were talking
about that in the movie and,

1424
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:54,480
and that is what works for me is, is,
is, you know, I love listening to them.

1425
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:57,570
I think it's funny you were talking
about Ufos. I think it's funny.

1426
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:59,460
It's like people will go,
where's the footage?

1427
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:04,410
Well there's a ton of footage on Ufos now
that you can't wrap your brain around.

1428
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:09,020
Yeah. Okay. Here's some
interest. Something interesting
about the Yeti finger.

1429
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:13,880
They said the DNA tests have
found it to be a human bone. Well,

1430
01:23:13,881 --> 01:23:14,930
here's what's interesting.

1431
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,190
Um, they sent me Stewart's
wife smuggled a human,

1432
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,490
but they think

1433
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,080
that these things are fucking human.
It doesn't mean that that's wrong.

1434
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,620
The people that I thought
that they thought that this
was like some sort of like

1435
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:32,420
a rank attack giant around a tank thing.
But no, they think it's like that,

1436
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,291
that Hobbit,

1437
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:37,070
that homofloresiensis you're aware of
that those little tiny man they found the

1438
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:37,904
island.

1439
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,380
Yeah. Well that was a human. Yeah.
Well that's, that's uh, you know,

1440
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:46,000
the native Americans up in
the Pacific northwest, just,
Eh, you know, Eh, you know,

1441
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:50,740
some, some, some of the tribes
just attributed to Sasquatch
as a, as another tribe.

1442
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:51,990
I mean, it wasn't, yeah,

1443
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:56,050
she's now how have you gone
on down this rabbit hole then?

1444
01:23:56,110 --> 01:24:00,750
The amount of people who go, dit
disappearing in our parks? No.

1445
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:05,940
There is no federal database set up
for people who go missing in the parks.

1446
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,510
And it's a, I can't remember
the number. It's huge.

1447
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:14,170
There's an author who wrote a
book about it. It's really fast.

1448
01:24:14,171 --> 01:24:18,070
And do they think that these are yetis
are, he doesn't even go down that road.

1449
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:21,280
He just says, why is it,
it's a, we should look it up.

1450
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:24,700
I don't know what the number
is. He, he's saying, Ooh,

1451
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,290
what is this?

1452
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:31,630
Why isn't there a and where all these
people gone? I can't, oh, I feel really

1453
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,590
well bringing up, they could
starve to death. I mean, you,

1454
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,970
you get lost in the woods and
you could get lost easily.

1455
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,990
But the weird part is the Fed's not
taking the time to have a database.

1456
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,030
I actually have a friend
whose dad died in the woods.

1457
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:46,440
He went hiking and then the
fog rolled in and he goes,

1458
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:50,260
did they find him eventually?
Yeah. Oh yeah. Um,

1459
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,750
I think they didn't find him for a long
time too, but you know, you can't that

1460
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,620
now out in the woods
like, like we were, eh,

1461
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:02,180
what happens to your mind when you were
out there? That's pretty funny to me.

1462
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,360
Well, it's, it's very,
how late did you stay up?

1463
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,800
Oh, we were all, we were, we
didn't sleep in the woods.

1464
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:11,860
We decided to stay in a hotel that
was in town. It was a way. Yeah.

1465
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:15,610
But just being around there at night
when you're in those woods, okay.

1466
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:19,390
Even in the day when you go into
those woods, well, you're gone.

1467
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:24,130
We were in Mount Rainier.
You go into those woods and
there's, it's another world,

1468
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,820
first of all, those elk that
bound in front of you and
they're, oh, you know, five,

1469
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:29,380
600 pound animal just jumped.

1470
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:34,510
Yeah. That's weird. When you run into a
animal, I saw that up in Willow Creek, uh,

1471
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:39,370
and uh, that, that aren't afraid
of you. That's the weird part.

1472
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:41,630
I didn't know what the
fuck you are. Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,380
But I've never seen one of you fair.

1474
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,650
Which was pretty fun because
a couple of the guys,

1475
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:51,650
it was really funny because
we were at Laos camp, which a,

1476
01:25:51,651 --> 01:25:54,010
if anybody knows that's
really close to that. And

1477
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:59,090
one of the guys goes,
cause we had two women,

1478
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:03,150
the actress and producer, and um, uh,

1479
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,420
I never had a woman here before.

1480
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:09,440
This is around a campfire in the
middle of the night. I go, fellows,

1481
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:11,690
I'm gonna stop you right there.
That's usually when the rape and started.

1482
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,850
Yeah. You shouldn't even
say that. Even if it's true.

1483
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,080
I keep that shit to yourself son.
And I used to get women out here,

1484
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:23,700
never had women out here. So as far
as the things that they've collected,

1485
01:26:23,701 --> 01:26:25,270
like the, the Ufo, you know,

1486
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,430
quote unquote evidence to me the most
interesting shit is the halls that are

1487
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:30,300
really insane.

1488
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,670
Primate Howells and the dermal
ridges that they found footprints.

1489
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:38,530
Some of them was great, like, like in the
middle of the night and, and uh, it's,

1490
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,130
it's awesome. I was once, uh, uh,

1491
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,800
before the keynote speaker got up,
one of the guys,

1492
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,650
he mentions there's two guys
like an opener, you know,

1493
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:53,890
this is the feature that
that butter and a MC.

1494
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:59,160
So basically the feature brings up Ufo
is while he's doing his big foot pitch

1495
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:03,910
and about a third of the room went like,
boy,

1496
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,680
but this group,

1497
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,870
I'm going to take a piss.

1498
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:16,240
Yes. Well there's people in the big foot
community that like make fun of would

1499
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:19,930
knockers yeah. Would knock and
like they're just going to,

1500
01:27:19,931 --> 01:27:22,270
would not back mom.

1501
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:23,021
Well I said,

1502
01:27:23,021 --> 01:27:26,350
you know these guys who upset if you
smoked tobacco in them and there's,

1503
01:27:26,351 --> 01:27:30,010
you know, there's people with crying
babies and making bacon and you know,

1504
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,720
well the one guy saying to the other
guy that you never find big foot because

1505
01:27:32,721 --> 01:27:35,150
your smoke.
I've seen big foot three times.

1506
01:27:35,151 --> 01:27:38,060
You're never going to see big foot
because you smoke. That's fucking,

1507
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,020
that cuts out a man.

1508
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,010
So I was like wondering like
how's this guy feel about grass?

1509
01:27:42,011 --> 01:27:45,540
Does he think that big foot's down with
grass big was probably attracted to weed.

1510
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,740
That's well I have noticed that
a few fellow Sasquatch hunters

1511
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:56,050
a little could possibly be a little bit.
Yeah,

1512
01:27:56,350 --> 01:28:00,410
well squashing. When you're high, it's
probably way more fun than you know,

1513
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,890
Oh God,
sober squatch much to be desired.

1514
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:09,190
Really think folks can't wrap their
brains around how many millions of acres

1515
01:28:09,191 --> 01:28:13,930
there are still in like California and
Oregon and Portland that are completely

1516
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:16,900
like a plane goes down and no one
finds it. I think you're totally right.

1517
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:19,900
And I think that's one of the things
that we tried to capture on the show when

1518
01:28:19,901 --> 01:28:23,350
we went up into Mount Rainier. I was
like, the way I described it, trees, oh,

1519
01:28:23,351 --> 01:28:25,360
like it's like a box of Q tips.

1520
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,530
You know how you get a box of cute tips
and you know they're just shoved in

1521
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:32,820
there.
You're not getting through that.

1522
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:35,770
You're going to get through that
going on with this one step, right.

1523
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,850
And one step left and one step you're
going to like slowly have to see,

1524
01:28:39,851 --> 01:28:41,710
saw your way through all these trees.

1525
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:47,070
Like this is incredibly dense rain forest
and there's thousands of square miles,

1526
01:28:48,131 --> 01:28:52,990
thousands and you can't just get
to the middle of it. There's no,

1527
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:57,190
there's not trails through all of it.
So if something was living up there,

1528
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:02,430
he could see you coming a fucking
mile away, hide from you. So easy,

1529
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,390
especially if it had better senses than
us. Which if it lives in the woods,

1530
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,800
it's got to have like animal
senses course probably.

1531
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:11,730
It was senses like a dog does.
Sure.

1532
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,530
Dogs would be able to hear you and see
a human being. Yeah. But dear, dear,

1533
01:29:16,531 --> 01:29:21,210
see you coming a mile away. They hear
you coming a mile away. Well I, uh,

1534
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:25,440
so, so tell me, or you're not trying to
talk too much about the show you did.

1535
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,390
Who did you go out with? A, I'm
not trying to talk too much better,

1536
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:32,450
but women with these guys from
Wasser, the Washington state, uh,

1537
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:37,280
Sasquatch research team, these guys.
Was it a black cord attached? Yeah,

1538
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,250
they were great guys.

1539
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,960
They were a hardcore dedicated squatters
and they took us to like some serious

1540
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:45,030
spots and we saw some weird shit.

1541
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:48,810
We saw some trees that were arranged in
some really peculiar positions in the

1542
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:52,830
middle of the forest. We also saw some
trees that were broken in the middle,

1543
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,610
which is really weird cause there's no,
there's no wind inside this forest.

1544
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,670
You know, you're deep, deep in
the forest and you see trees.

1545
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:02,760
They're snapped in half,
seven feet up.

1546
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:07,440
Like something grabbed it and snapped it.
I don't know what the fuck it was.

1547
01:30:07,441 --> 01:30:10,470
I mean, I don't know what happened,
but it's weird. You know, you see that.

1548
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,620
But to them squatch

1549
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:18,030
and wanting to see your church.
There's an area in Alaska,

1550
01:30:18,031 --> 01:30:20,670
I don't know if you're familiar with it,
how deep you went with your big,

1551
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,090
I have not gone to a Alaska,
Alaska,

1552
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,500
the trees that you treat

1553
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,080
uprooted Jamie. See if you
could find the photo. There's a,

1554
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,550
these two trees in Alaska that
they believe bigfoot has uprooted.

1555
01:30:33,551 --> 01:30:35,580
Ain't got [inaudible] to
the ground. Not yet. Again,

1556
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:40,450
doing a gig up there in two weeks. Which
town? I'm doing a Gig in anchorage. Yeah.

1557
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,060
Well the anchorage is really,
uh, it's beautiful. But um, yeah,

1558
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:48,470
maybe that's why I'm going off the grid.
That's great.

1559
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:53,130
I'm gonna delete it too now. I mean I
did two dates in February in Anchorage.

1560
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,480
Oh, he kind of reassess your career
choices the second time you go. Hello.

1561
01:30:57,481 --> 01:31:01,170
Ain't grits. How cold was it? It
was so cold, but it's, you know,

1562
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,250
it's this weird thing.

1563
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:06,090
There's guys wearing shorts and sneakers
cause they just go in and out of heated

1564
01:31:06,091 --> 01:31:10,800
things and it's dry. There's like
snow places that never goes away.

1565
01:31:11,210 --> 01:31:12,280
These are those trees.

1566
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:17,080
They're picked up by the roots and driven
into the ground and no one knows how

1567
01:31:17,081 --> 01:31:18,040
the fuck it was done.

1568
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:21,220
They know that it wasn't done with heavy
equipment because there's no, like,

1569
01:31:21,221 --> 01:31:24,580
apparently there's no marks in the trees
at correspond to the use of a heavy

1570
01:31:24,581 --> 01:31:29,470
equipment. Now what do you think
that allegedly, I don't know.

1571
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:32,380
I mean, you, here's the thing,
when you hear these stories,

1572
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:34,600
you're hearing about them, see if
there's any other photos of that. Jeremy,

1573
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:39,700
better ones. I've seen some different
ones that are more in detail,

1574
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:40,630
but the,
they don't,

1575
01:31:40,631 --> 01:31:42,940
you don't know how much you're dealing
with just people that are in love with

1576
01:31:42,941 --> 01:31:44,020
that Shit,
you know?

1577
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:47,360
Sure. But I, I, uh, you know, there's,

1578
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,660
there is,
um,

1579
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:55,940
there's a cynicism that you can have
and then there's the question of, uh,

1580
01:31:55,941 --> 01:32:00,100
of what if, and, and, and you
could even be, say, all this stuff

1581
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,050
is bs, but I do love the, the
what if, right, right. Yeah.

1582
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:11,050
It's, Jane Goodall thinks
they're real. Yeah. Jane Goodall.
Yeah, sure. That's legit.

1583
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:15,370
That's when my, that's when, that's
when the o nine gave me shark guys.

1584
01:32:15,371 --> 01:32:18,760
When I pulled out Jane Goodall,
she really, you know, I
mean like, you know, sharks,

1585
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:22,870
you know, they wrote, they wrote back
before they bite. She's like, wow,

1586
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,210
well people don't think it's bullshit
and you would start pulling out Jane

1587
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:33,100
Goodall. That's all you know. That's,
that's again the, the, the uh,

1588
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,610
the o nine, she likes to say
this movie, the Willow Creek.

1589
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:38,770
That's what the name of this
movie is that we're talking about.

1590
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:41,140
It's that I can't announce it yet.

1591
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:46,030
It got into some bigger festivals that'll
happen soon. It matches in the movies.

1592
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,050
Um, I'm, um, I think
that there's, you know,

1593
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,260
that you can make a good trailer for
the movie and I think it could open.

1594
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,970
I think it's different
than the other movies.

1595
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:59,800
I would go see that if I was on a date.
She got such a great date night movie.

1596
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,960
It's fucking, man. It's a fun look.

1597
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,530
And obviously I'm very biased because
I love you and I'm a big foot Dork,

1598
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:09,900
so it was a double combination. But,
uh, I enjoy the shit out of it, man.

1599
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:14,650
Thanks ma'am. Thanks. You're
welcome. I am, you know, it's funny,

1600
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:18,730
I just, you know, I'm starting now to make
about a movie a year, different sizes,

1601
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:22,990
different budgets, different people. And
uh, and then in the meantime I do other,

1602
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,980
I work for other folks and I do stand
up like I'm about to go do patents new,

1603
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:30,460
a comedy central special. I'll
direct that. Oh, that's great.

1604
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:33,500
You're getting a standup special.
Yeah. Yeah. Where's he filming that?

1605
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:40,430
He's going to be a comic
con. I mean that is, yeah,

1606
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:44,850
that is, that is like if like a
stack the deck. Yeah, exactly.

1607
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:52,780
Like if you were in one of those giant
southern, uh, cathedrals that holds,

1608
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:56,710
you know, the mega churches
and then Christ actually
just came out of the floor.

1609
01:33:56,910 --> 01:34:00,370
He just showed up. That's what pat
and that comicon is going to be like.

1610
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:05,140
I love Patton.
His writing is fucking fun.

1611
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:08,200
Yeah, he's brilliant. So,
so, uh, that kind of stuff,

1612
01:34:08,201 --> 01:34:11,470
like if I can work with a comic
and, and try to, and you know,

1613
01:34:11,471 --> 01:34:16,060
and try to make it easier when they
show up so they're not worried about,

1614
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,390
you know what I mean? Some knuckleheads,
you know, that, that, that,

1615
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:21,700
that makes me really happy.
That's just a satisfying,

1616
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:25,660
believe it or not as going out and doing
a show. Oh, that's awesome. Because I,

1617
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,970
yeah, cause I love comics
and I don't, I don't,

1618
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,360
I don't like it when people make
it harder. You know what I mean?

1619
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:33,850
Like just before you go on the,
on TV,

1620
01:34:33,851 --> 01:34:36,790
everybody's saying the worst
thing you could do. Good.

1621
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,360
Making me lose. That's the worst thing
ever. You know, they're questioning,

1622
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:48,010
you're going to do good. You know, my
friend Tony, like when he be, yeah.

1623
01:34:48,011 --> 01:34:50,330
So like he was,
I love Toby.

1624
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:53,290
So I sent him flowers when he's
on Letterman and it just said,

1625
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:58,250
don't fuck this up.
And then one time he was taping another

1626
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:02,580
TV show and it was years ago and it's a,
I go,

1627
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:06,360
Tony, I'm coming down there tonight
to watch the tape. He goes, oh,

1628
01:35:06,361 --> 01:35:09,890
I really don't know. I'm bringing
Robin Williams, so don't fuck this up.

1629
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,280
He just thinks you're my friend and
he doesn't know that you're funny.

1630
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:17,120
So really do good. He's like
fucking anthem. And then of course,

1631
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:20,180
you know you do that to a guy and they
go up in there and they're laughing

1632
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,840
because he's like, subconsciously he's
going, well Bob wouldn't back out.

1633
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:27,320
It's not going to tell me I'm gonna
fucking blow if you, you know what I mean?

1634
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:30,500
So you need a safety zone.
You need,

1635
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:33,690
you need friends that are driving
you nuts before you go on.

1636
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:38,100
Well it seems like what I like about
what you've done with your, you know,

1637
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:42,420
I hate the word career, but I guess
that's what it is, you know? Clear. Oh,

1638
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:46,320
seems so formal. What you have,
you have, you express yourself.

1639
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:50,340
What I like about it is that you have
not boxed yourself into any one corner.

1640
01:35:50,341 --> 01:35:53,390
Like this big foot thing is
just fucking freaky hormones.

1641
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,570
That's why I love that. It's like so
funny. It's like people like, you know,

1642
01:35:56,571 --> 01:36:00,540
their perception and then you make it
and it's really fun to watch for that

1643
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:02,220
what you,
but what I was going to say is you,

1644
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:05,500
but also like I'll run into you and
you direct and the Chappelle show,

1645
01:36:05,501 --> 01:36:08,670
a running a ranch. You, you're
directing Kimmel. Yeah, yeah. I mean,

1646
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:11,070
you're doing all this weird shit,
but you're doing your,

1647
01:36:11,071 --> 01:36:12,940
you're equally competent at all of it.

1648
01:36:12,941 --> 01:36:16,120
And it seems like you're equally
enthusiastic about all of them, which is,

1649
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,820
it allows you to like direct someone,

1650
01:36:17,821 --> 01:36:21,060
stand up and enjoy it as much as doing
your own standards, which you also enjoy.

1651
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:25,400
Yeah. I, it's, it's, I'm, I'm
pretty lucky now. Now, you know,

1652
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:29,960
the other side of it is, is
like, it's, it's, it's not,

1653
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:30,823
um,

1654
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:35,780
it's probably the least secure
I've ever been financially.

1655
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:39,500
But there's something awesome every time
you, you, you jump off and you go, Hey,

1656
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:40,850
what am I going to do next?
You know?

1657
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:45,180
And every time it works out in some
harebrained way, you know, I mean,

1658
01:36:45,181 --> 01:36:48,290
I gave the commencement speech at my
daughter's school at Hampshire College,

1659
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:50,270
you know, and I was, I really, well,

1660
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:53,540
first I went up and I just read
an Oprah speech word for word.

1661
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:59,150
I, you know, whenever I'm nervous,
I always go to Oprah and then,

1662
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:03,890
and it was all about making it and as
I blah, blah, blah, dreams and hopes,

1663
01:37:03,891 --> 01:37:07,610
and I guess this doesn't apply
to any you kids. He got to,

1664
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:12,850
you guys gotta quit as often as possible
in life until you end up someplace that

1665
01:37:12,951 --> 01:37:15,320
you don't want to leave, you know, and uh,

1666
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:17,420
and you could smell the
parents stomach acid, you know,

1667
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:20,090
they just spent all this money
on an education. It's so true.

1668
01:37:20,091 --> 01:37:21,770
That's an amazing advice

1669
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,780
as many times as you can until
you find something you don't want.

1670
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:28,500
You know? And, and like, there's a weird
thing for guys our age. I mean you're,

1671
01:37:28,501 --> 01:37:32,840
you're younger than me, but where we
were doing all different things and,

1672
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:36,090
and you know, are we enjoying them or
not? And then all of a sudden this age,

1673
01:37:36,091 --> 01:37:40,740
we come onto our own and
it's, um, it, the, the, the,

1674
01:37:40,741 --> 01:37:44,670
the freaky part is like, after world's
greatest dad, I wrote five screenplays.

1675
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,270
I mean, I just write screen plays
all the time and someone goes, well,

1676
01:37:48,271 --> 01:37:52,270
who are you competing with? And
I'm like, the grim fucking man.

1677
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:56,520
I thought like sitting and
over at, you know, competing

1678
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,400
with, that's not an interesting
question, that if you produce anything,

1679
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:02,310
you create something. You're competing
against somebody to create it.

1680
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:07,190
And what a shitty mentality, but
common, you know, it's a common thought.

1681
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:11,760
Well, yeah. And as soon as you can
remove those guys and make it, you know,

1682
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:16,761
yourself instead of other people and
you're not judging what you make by their

1683
01:38:17,611 --> 01:38:20,920
standards and stuff. It's a, it's a,
it's a pretty awesome place. Yeah.

1684
01:38:20,921 --> 01:38:21,570
That's a thing

1685
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:25,530
now being a, you know,
a grown ass man too.

1686
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:28,860
It's like you get to a point where
you're comfortable in your own life and

1687
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,860
you're comfortable with what you do when
you know what's good and what you've

1688
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:32,550
done.

1689
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:36,060
You've had enough feedback by what you've
done that you enjoy and what you've

1690
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:37,350
done that you did for money.

1691
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:40,170
And then you get to this sort of
like place where you're like, okay,

1692
01:38:40,171 --> 01:38:41,880
I know what I'm doing
here. Yeah. And on the line

1693
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:42,920
pink cloud,
you know when,

1694
01:38:42,921 --> 01:38:46,100
when you know there's gigs I take for
the bread and there's things I do,

1695
01:38:46,101 --> 01:38:49,790
but you know it, it does make it a
little easier when you're sitting there,

1696
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:54,170
you know, and you're asking what,
what is, what is your police academy?

1697
01:38:54,171 --> 01:38:57,630
I'm interested in that. Like what does it
bring up your factor? Fear factor. Okay.

1698
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,740
And you're, and you're polite, I'm
sure when people talk about it. Yeah,

1699
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:03,050
I enjoy doing it. You know,
fear factor was nothing.

1700
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,680
There's nothing artistic about
fear factor. But there was a,

1701
01:39:05,681 --> 01:39:06,890
I had a lot of great moments,

1702
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:10,290
but there are a couple of questions that
you've heard a million times, right?

1703
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,410
Oh yeah. What is it? What is the one,

1704
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:17,430
did you ever eat any of that stuff?
Hey, Joe's fear factor for you?

1705
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:22,560
Yeah, but I, I have a very healthy
attitude about it and you know,

1706
01:39:22,561 --> 01:39:25,600
I'm happy that people enjoy
the show, you know? And uh,

1707
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:29,280
I understand what it would be like if
I enjoyed the show and I ran into me.

1708
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:32,820
I might say something stupid too. I
might say it's for refractive. You Buddy.

1709
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,650
Cause I wouldn't know what else
to say. I'm an idiot. Okay.

1710
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:39,830
You,
but you don't did test it.

1711
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,010
We do our best and smile through it.
Yes.

1712
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:47,780
But this person doesn't realize they're
the third person that stopped me today

1713
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,680
at the airport and asked me at the
end, you went to your gate. No.

1714
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:53,810
You know what it is. It's always, you
know what it is. It's the security people.

1715
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,220
When you take in your belt
with that horse,

1716
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:04,280
you're mad. You did that. You did the
mood, the beer. Oh, you did that shit.

1717
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:07,750
Oh, it's worse because
they go, I don't know.

1718
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:11,930
They are looking at me and I
never heard of them do the voice.

1719
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:17,600
It's the word Jimmy Kemble loves the bust
my balls harder than anyone about the

1720
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:21,010
voices as you know,
like if we're doing the show and you know,

1721
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:23,900
doing the commercial, I over
the do the voice, I guess.

1722
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:31,450
That's hilarious.
Jimmy went and got a star and that was a,

1723
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:34,670
I hadn't seen him in a while, so I went
and got, I went with him while he, yeah,

1724
01:40:34,671 --> 01:40:37,760
I was very tight. So you got a star
on the Hollywood was really sweet.

1725
01:40:37,761 --> 01:40:41,330
It was just a real, it was a real
[inaudible] moment where everybody,

1726
01:40:41,331 --> 01:40:44,990
that guys that I've seen in and
out of his life and hey, you know,

1727
01:40:44,991 --> 01:40:49,010
it's really sweet to
watch the, Oh Dang goes,

1728
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:53,980
you know, I tried to get you a star
and uh, I go, what happened? They

1729
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,700
said, ma'am, the pasta must
request, right? Again, it's another,

1730
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:02,770
it's another thought. You were dead. And
I said, they were, I go, what did you do?

1731
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:06,730
She goes, well, I, I, the guy insisted
you dad and I said, I'm your wife.

1732
01:41:06,731 --> 01:41:11,410
And then I was like, I would have
taken a dead star. I don't care.

1733
01:41:11,411 --> 01:41:14,110
You know,
they showed up in like Gore makeup,

1734
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:20,590
they gave you a star Star and then you
showed up for the, and they're like,

1735
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,600
fuck is going on

1736
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,650
in this day and age. I mean
everyone Zombie obsessed. Yeah.

1737
01:41:27,710 --> 01:41:32,340
Yeah. I just come in Gore makeup with
maggots coming out of an Isiah. I get,

1738
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:36,260
she killed me.
That would be

1739
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:39,190
really funny man.
Especially if you, I mean,

1740
01:41:39,191 --> 01:41:41,590
sure you can get somebody in
Hollywood to do it up really good.

1741
01:41:41,591 --> 01:41:42,750
Like walking dead style.

1742
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:47,500
Yeah. Real estate. Sure. Yeah, that'd be
awesome. So I have a question. What's the,

1743
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,200
you did this one episode.
What? What's the next one?

1744
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:54,590
Well, we've done, we're doing
six. We were picked up for six.

1745
01:41:54,591 --> 01:41:56,680
It starts July 16th so there's a,

1746
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:59,360
I had a similar idea,
but what I wanted to do,

1747
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,070
and this was after shooting Willow Creek,
I thought it'd be funny to like go,

1748
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:08,300
let's say I go the Jersey
Devil. Right, right.

1749
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:12,520
But I make it because I,
I'm interested in filmmaking.

1750
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:17,530
So I get Kevin Smith to go with me in
a tent and we go and sleep out and look

1751
01:42:18,021 --> 01:42:20,810
for the Jersey down. Yeah, that would
be great. And then you just keep going.

1752
01:42:20,811 --> 01:42:23,960
But it's always like, you
know, John Waters is Baltimore.

1753
01:42:23,961 --> 01:42:25,960
And we'd go and we'd go
find that and go into this,

1754
01:42:25,961 --> 01:42:29,070
this haunted house in Baltimore
again. You know, it just came up.

1755
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,720
Well, the way what I'm doing is some
of them I'm doing with Comedians,

1756
01:42:32,721 --> 01:42:36,020
like I did a one with Duncan Trussell.
He went with looking for big foot with me.

1757
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,040
And uh,

1758
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:42,040
Ari Shaffir is going to go
to a transhumanist con com
conference with me in New

1759
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:44,100
York.
Transhumanism is no chance here.

1760
01:42:44,210 --> 01:42:48,890
People that want to download consciousness
into computers like Ray Kurzweil and

1761
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:53,320
other, like all the people that
are into robots. And uh, so, uh,

1762
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:57,110
he's going to go and do some of that
with me too. So a lot of it we're doing,

1763
01:42:57,111 --> 01:42:58,670
I'm doing it like with comic friends,

1764
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:03,740
but it's cool to go have an open mind
and just not be snarky because here's the

1765
01:43:04,141 --> 01:43:08,280
thing, what people don't realize, all of
these different subcultures and stuff,

1766
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:13,050
they have a sense of humor. Yeah.
You don't have to roll your eyes.

1767
01:43:13,051 --> 01:43:13,530
You know?

1768
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:16,860
I mean like there's a lot of laughs in
willow creek from these guys and they're

1769
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:20,390
just, they know they're making
jokes. They're not, you know.

1770
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:21,541
Yeah.

1771
01:43:21,541 --> 01:43:26,541
They listen to the guys that we were
hanging out with up in Seattle and Mount

1772
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:30,480
Rainier. They were great guys and one of
the guys had a great point. He goes, hey,

1773
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:34,590
he's, he had never seen big fun and he
had been fascinated by it and he'd been

1774
01:43:34,591 --> 01:43:38,610
looking. He said, listen, if I don't ever
even see big foot, I'm still camping.

1775
01:43:38,611 --> 01:43:41,110
I'm enjoying the wilderness,
having a good time. He goes,

1776
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:44,340
I wonder why people get
so aggressive about it.

1777
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:47,660
They'll get aggressive about music. But
I mean, yeah, that's true. You know,

1778
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:52,010
they get aggressive about movies. They
get aggressive about TV shows. Like,

1779
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,150
how the fuck are you watched it?

1780
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,980
I uh, I had a, um,

1781
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,790
now it's actually so played out,

1782
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:04,791
but I had a story when I was directing
Kimmel show about Nickelback and the

1783
01:44:05,761 --> 01:44:09,960
first time I tell the story I
go, I go. And I wasn't like,

1784
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:12,900
I think making fun of Nickelback
is really hacky at this point.

1785
01:44:12,901 --> 01:44:15,240
But I really said, I go,
what's the band that sucks?

1786
01:44:15,241 --> 01:44:18,300
And the guy immediately Nickelback
I go, yes, they were on the show.

1787
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:21,720
Now as a comic, I go, I'm going to
see if that works tomorrow night.

1788
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:26,700
And it does every time. It's like, it's
really funny that these, these guys,

1789
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:30,360
for some reason or the whipping boy of
music understand that, but confused.

1790
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:31,800
I will tell you,
I will,

1791
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:35,700
I will tell stories out of school that,

1792
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,690
you know, uh, the, the,

1793
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:45,180
the manager of Nickelback came
into the booth and he goes,

1794
01:44:45,181 --> 01:44:49,220
don't shoot Chad from the front. And I'm
like, I don't even know what chat is.

1795
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:52,200
You know, I, I figured out
that's the lead singer. He says,

1796
01:44:52,201 --> 01:44:55,350
don't shoot Chad from the front. I was
like, why ain't cause cause of his nose?

1797
01:44:55,351 --> 01:44:59,100
Just shoot him. Don't shoot him
profile. Just shoot them in the front.

1798
01:44:59,101 --> 01:45:01,320
That's what I'm sorry. He said
shoot her in the front. No profile.

1799
01:45:01,321 --> 01:45:03,210
That's why I said, I was like, okay.

1800
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:06,760
So he leaves and all the
cameramen are my best friends.

1801
01:45:06,761 --> 01:45:09,750
And when you're a television director,
that's who you really bond with.

1802
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,040
And they're like, oh dude.
Hey Bob, can I drag, you know,

1803
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,560
you're letting the manager
Nicole Vector Act, you know,

1804
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:17,880
they are really busting my balls.

1805
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,530
So if you see the cumulus show
as this show goes off the air,

1806
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:27,660
the band's playing, right. And so I go,
yeah, there's, there's a profile shot.

1807
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:32,010
And uh, just as a, I go to the AED, I go,

1808
01:45:32,011 --> 01:45:35,300
tell me when I have 10 seconds left.
She goes, okay. And she has 10 seconds.

1809
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:40,200
I go shoot the nose and six cameras
go whizzing in from every direction.

1810
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:44,670
And I did just, I did a montage, it
was, and I go, ready, camera five,

1811
01:45:44,671 --> 01:45:47,930
ready for already three ready, six ready?
Said, I just did the, did the, did it.

1812
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,803
And we just,

1813
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:54,230
we just went off the air with this
guys knows it's super quiet and in the

1814
01:45:55,501 --> 01:46:00,450
headsets and the guys go, hey man, what
are we going to do now? And I'm like,

1815
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:02,460
uh,
I didn't

1816
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:06,880
plan for that. I'm getting in my
car. I have a good weekend guys.

1817
01:46:06,881 --> 01:46:08,540
Did anybody yell at you?
Well,

1818
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:11,620
I know that it didn't make the
west coast broadcast that, that,

1819
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:14,420
that he censored the nose.
Well,

1820
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:17,720
I'm sure people flipped out because I
did that something that I did something

1821
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:21,830
like that to another band and I know
that's fucking knows it's not that bad,

1822
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:26,480
ugly God. If someone didn't come into
the booth and tell me what to do,

1823
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:31,190
I wouldn't even have done the tribute
to his nose. What do you attribute the,

1824
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:34,340
um, the whole hate for
Nickelback too. It was,

1825
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:37,150
it they're there to smooth I
think too polished. I don't,

1826
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:40,030
I mean there's two poppy,
I don't understand why,

1827
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:45,060
why just suddenly everybody gangs on
Nickelback when there's so much more crap

1828
01:46:45,141 --> 01:46:50,100
in the world. I don't know. It's just
this weird, well, you know what it is.

1829
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,340
I'll tell you what it is. There's
a safety and bullying, you know,

1830
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:57,270
we all decide that we're going to bullying
Nickelback then you're not bullying

1831
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,260
or Justin Bieber. Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:46:59,261 --> 01:47:02,790
Whoever fill in the blank liking
him or disliking Justin Bieber,

1833
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:07,310
I don't have that kind of time. You
know what I mean? I don't even know why,

1834
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:11,190
you know, he's not for me right
though. He does. But then again,

1835
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:15,090
50 year old men, you know?
Yeah. But here's the thing,
you know? Yeah. And I just,

1836
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:19,120
you know, I, I, uh, I think of him
in terms of like Donnie Yasmine,

1837
01:47:19,121 --> 01:47:20,820
when I was growing up,
you know, I, I, you know,

1838
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:24,150
I was threatened and weirded out and then
when I got older I was like, Hey dad,

1839
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:28,020
he asked me this. Isn't that bad guy?
Nice guy. Yeah. Isn't that weird?

1840
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:30,150
You end up meeting that.
He was super nice.

1841
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:33,050
Did it show you the Donny and Marie show

1842
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:38,710
[inaudible] that I used to bring out a
puppet and do and do so stupid and do

1843
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,940
weird things. I do like a puppet show
with them to understand, well, you know,

1844
01:47:43,941 --> 01:47:44,780
I'm gutting fish.

1845
01:47:44,781 --> 01:47:48,710
So it wasn't that much of a stretch for
me to pull out a Donny Osmond down my

1846
01:47:48,711 --> 01:47:51,430
early standup. There was
no jokes. I mean I'm a,

1847
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,960
it's nice that you like to meet
Bob because I had material then,

1848
01:47:53,961 --> 01:47:56,480
but it was just doing one
weird thing after another.

1849
01:47:56,481 --> 01:48:01,370
I was super influenced by Andy Kaufman
and Steve Martin and stuff like that. So,

1850
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:05,630
so, uh, if I did well it
would kind of go well.

1851
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:09,620
And then sometimes when I did bad it
she'll go off the rails. You know,

1852
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:11,330
it just ruined all the other guys.

1853
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:17,100
Well, you guys were, it
was such a that that comedy
environment was such a, like a,

1854
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:19,470
a hot environment,
but it also,

1855
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:24,110
the Boston comedy environment really
supported originality. Originality was,

1856
01:48:24,111 --> 01:48:25,140
it was really huge.

1857
01:48:25,210 --> 01:48:29,110
Yeah, it was weird. It was nice that
that like if you were derivative,

1858
01:48:29,111 --> 01:48:33,490
you didn't get work, you know, so, so,
and you've got shit on. Sure. Yeah.

1859
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:36,470
You got shit on by all your peers.
Nobody just let that slide.

1860
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:38,180
They kept a high standard,

1861
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,150
which is difficult for people don't
want to maintain a high standard,

1862
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:42,920
but for people that have like,
you know,

1863
01:48:42,921 --> 01:48:46,880
you realize that you're going to have to
be judged by your peers. Got this weird

1864
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:50,590
court of your peers so you don't do this,
you don't do that.

1865
01:48:50,591 --> 01:48:53,190
You don't get other people's
actually then you go on stage,

1866
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:57,880
then we're going to goose it and have the,
some of the toughest worst crowns.

1867
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:03,340
Yeah. So it was a, it was a good
place. Comedy style. Sure. Animals.

1868
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:07,090
Did you play it again?
Sam's, I had my own,

1869
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,510
I had a thing called
dollar night at Sam's that,

1870
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:14,460
and it'd be means Steven Wright
and we'd walk the room, you know,

1871
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,480
I started out of the paradise
stitching, my first gig. Yeah.

1872
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,480
I have a question for you. Do you think
anybody's going to come along and,

1873
01:49:25,481 --> 01:49:30,481
and as a comedian and ever
be what Steve Martin was?

1874
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,740
Do you know what I'm saying?
Like,

1875
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,530
or do you think we're too
fractured as a society?

1876
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:38,040
Like my mother had weighed
in on Steve Martin. You know,
she thought he was funny.

1877
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:38,940
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

1878
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:42,290
And you did as well. So when across the
board, really that's what I'm saying.

1879
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:47,230
My jag calf again is squeaky clean
and I think funded everybody.

1880
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:48,010
Brian Regan.

1881
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,100
But these guys appeal to everybody,
but they're not the phenomenon.

1882
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:54,930
They're not on the cover of rolling
stone. Right. Affiliate link.

1883
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:57,640
I don't think.
I don't think it could happen.

1884
01:49:57,641 --> 01:50:00,760
I mean there's certain things I don't
think can happen anymore because of the

1885
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:02,890
digital age.
And I say it's good or bad,

1886
01:50:02,891 --> 01:50:06,460
but I'm just saying I don't know about
that because Dan Cook crack through

1887
01:50:06,461 --> 01:50:07,540
because the digital age,

1888
01:50:07,541 --> 01:50:10,410
and although his was like more of
like a teeny bopper sort of a crack,

1889
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:14,800
that guy was doing 18,000 seat arenas
and that was very Steve Martin neck.

1890
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:19,360
But when I was growing up, Steve
Martin, you had to deal with, you know,

1891
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:22,600
my parents if they were alive, would
not know who Dane Cook is. Yeah.

1892
01:50:22,601 --> 01:50:23,530
But that's just Dane Cook.

1893
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:27,610
I'm saying he broke through in this
digital age people, that'll be huge.

1894
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:31,150
But I don't think there'll be people
that, that, that are so huge that,

1895
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:35,130
that everybody in the family knows them
and they're a phenomenon. Wonder. I mean,

1896
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:37,930
you know, they don't think it could
happen again. You might be right.

1897
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,690
And we are definitely more
fragmented than ever before.

1898
01:50:40,730 --> 01:50:44,290
And in a way it's a good thing because
there's a lot more audience for more

1899
01:50:44,291 --> 01:50:47,950
obscure people that wouldn't have had
an outlet before. I think that's great.

1900
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:48,860
I think that's great too.

1901
01:50:49,110 --> 01:50:52,170
Do worry about like, um, the,

1902
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:54,870
our exposure to our,

1903
01:50:55,170 --> 01:50:59,760
our world gets minute.
Or maybe I'll just say for myself,

1904
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:04,620
am I going to go to BBC and learn
today about the, uh, you know,

1905
01:51:04,621 --> 01:51:07,350
about the events or am I going to click on

1906
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:13,140
fun site and go down a rabbit hole?
What do you think's going to happen?

1907
01:51:13,410 --> 01:51:14,830
I did the same thing.
There's something,

1908
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,150
you know, when you had a newspaper
now it's like I'm an old guy yelling,

1909
01:51:18,151 --> 01:51:21,300
get off my lawn. But you had a
newspaper. I go through I, Oh,

1910
01:51:21,301 --> 01:51:24,760
I'm interested in that and I didn't know
that was going on in China and I, I,

1911
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,250
I think the digital age makes
it a little bit too much. You,

1912
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,010
you can find news that agrees
with your outlook, which is weird.

1913
01:51:32,011 --> 01:51:36,780
The news should not be,
you know, it should be,

1914
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,740
it's never impartial, but it
should be. It should be somewhat.

1915
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,870
Yeah, you could, if you
have confirmation bias,

1916
01:51:42,871 --> 01:51:44,760
you could support it really
easily on the Internet.

1917
01:51:44,761 --> 01:51:48,270
Just sticking to a
bubble of like whenever,

1918
01:51:48,271 --> 01:51:51,750
when I'm ego surfing and I see someone
called me a lip tarred and you know,

1919
01:51:51,751 --> 01:51:56,750
I'm like, I'm so out of
their tarred. Tired. Yeah.

1920
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,410
When someone calls you a liberal, that's
hilarious. Self hating liberal liberals,

1921
01:52:01,411 --> 01:52:06,210
one of the weirdest sort of insults
ever because if you look at the like,

1922
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,340
okay, let's look at the
official definition of it. Yeah.

1923
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:14,350
Definition of liberal. Okay. Where's a,

1924
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:20,120
yeah, this is Tara. Tara. All right.

1925
01:52:20,121 --> 01:52:21,260
Look it up and addiction.

1926
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,080
It says to open,

1927
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:28,260
open to new behavior or opinions and
willing to discard traditional values.

1928
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,910
That's hilarious.
That sounds pretty positive.

1929
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:35,880
Unprejudiced unbegged added broad minded,

1930
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:39,970
open minded, enlightened,
permissive, free,

1931
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:42,910
free and easy and easy going.

1932
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:46,340
Those are the, now the only thing
that seems to be for me would be

1933
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,240
to folks is uh,
disregarding a, what was it?

1934
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,080
Disregarding traditional value. I see
that that's very threatening to people.

1935
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,980
There's people that treat the
constitution as if it's like the 10,

1936
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:01,050
the 10 commandments like that,
that, that there's no, you know,

1937
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:04,100
we're checks and balances, you know,
we can change and adjust things,

1938
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:07,280
but there's still people that are so
ingrained that's really scary. You know,

1939
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:11,100
I think there's also the real problem
with liberalism is a lot of people know

1940
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:14,670
that folks naturally are
inclined to be lazy fucks.

1941
01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:17,370
And if you give people an easy way out,
they'll take it.

1942
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:22,550
So as soon as you start advocating giving
people aid or helping people at out or

1943
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:25,710
people that I get 'em up,
get that fucker up.

1944
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:28,890
It's like there's a part of people that

1945
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:34,950
resent. Yeah, there's a resentment
against like the idea is that liberals

1946
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:39,100
world, World War II, it's like, hey,
you're down on your luck. You know,

1947
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,440
write a Gi loan, here's this, here's that

1948
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:44,690
much, much, much harder world
that they were dealing with.

1949
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:48,500
And it was only a couple of decades
after the fucking depression where people

1950
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:51,470
are much more used to living together,
scraping to get by.

1951
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:55,220
Your parents almost starved to death
20 years ago and they all have stories

1952
01:53:55,221 --> 01:53:58,820
about it. Yeah. My grandfather
had a horrible stories
about the depression. Yeah.

1953
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:02,710
My Shit down man. Lived through
the depression and that'll make 'em

1954
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:08,610
well, my old man is a whole
nother can of worms, but that was,

1955
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:13,520
was mine there. Yeah. The um, you know,
what would we be sitting here talking?

1956
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:17,120
No. Yeah, you'd never,
you'd never be a comic.

1957
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:22,660
I think that's one of the
number one pieces of a comic
that didn't have a fucked

1958
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:25,460
up life.
I don't think I've ever met one.

1959
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,680
Basically. I think my act, it
was me going on stage going, mom,

1960
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:32,270
do you,
do you hear me?

1961
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:38,950
I think that's, that's in a
nutshell. Yeah, that's 100%.

1962
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:42,880
But it's funny how that is like my
favorite art form comes out of that.

1963
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:43,714
In balance.

1964
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:47,500
It seems like there's the
only way to achieve it is
like to achieve it correctly,

1965
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:51,410
like something, there has to be some sort
of a deficit to create this, you know,

1966
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:54,850
this, this, it's a reaction
to a lack of something.

1967
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,220
It's not just a natural progression from,

1968
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:59,200
I was kind of a funny guy in
high school and I figured,

1969
01:54:59,201 --> 01:55:01,300
let me try other standup thing,
you know?

1970
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:05,130
Well, here's the thing, it's,
it's what we're missing is that,

1971
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:09,640
that those times that we
bombed, we probably should
have never got back on stage.

1972
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:14,480
Right. But we, we, we eat it and then
go back up again because the, it's,

1973
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:19,360
it's, it's horrible. It's so
crazy weird thing. You know,

1974
01:55:19,361 --> 01:55:22,930
like often the funniest guy in
the room is not the comedian.

1975
01:55:22,931 --> 01:55:26,110
You know what I mean? The
comedians got the, the,

1976
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:30,920
the illness or the Nads to
go up there or both. Yeah.

1977
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:34,910
Yeah. But you know, something that
happened in lately on stage, and this is,

1978
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:39,520
this is not me lying that all of a
sudden for the first time in 30 years,

1979
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:44,080
I'm sometimes having fun up there.
I was always the whole time.

1980
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:48,860
Oh yeah. Something new. Like
all of a sudden a, um, I'm a,

1981
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,900
I don't know, man. I'm on this new thing,
like sometimes with the right crowd,

1982
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:56,690
I actually enjoy it. And uh, and uh,
yeah. You know, it's a new new thing.

1983
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,881
Isn't that funny?

1984
01:55:57,881 --> 01:56:01,360
That something that people enjoy so
much to come see you and it looks like

1985
01:56:01,361 --> 01:56:02,710
you're having so much fun up there,

1986
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:07,690
but for a lot of folks it's just terror
and fear and worry about bombing and

1987
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:12,580
fucking try to again
when it's over, oh fuck.

1988
01:56:12,581 --> 01:56:16,660
Two more shows tomorrow. Yeah.
Even if you're killing every show,

1989
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:22,530
it's a, it's a new thing, you know, a,
suddenly it dawned on me what was a,

1990
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:26,910
a new thing that dawned
on me is like, uh, uh,

1991
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:31,930
it was okay, these people have an
expectation and I'm not doing that,

1992
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,460
but how can I warm up to them?

1993
01:56:36,461 --> 01:56:37,750
How can I include them?

1994
01:56:37,810 --> 01:56:40,780
So it's not just me saying this
is what I see the world as.

1995
01:56:40,781 --> 01:56:43,120
This is what I see is funny.
If you don't like a cram it,

1996
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:45,490
not saying compromise what I believe in,

1997
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:49,840
but suddenly I was doing like a little
bit of crowd work that wasn't like,

1998
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:54,250
you know, uh, how do you know when
you're finished? You know? But you know,

1999
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:57,810
to actually just sit around and poke
around and talk to folks and it's,

2000
01:56:57,860 --> 01:57:01,690
it's been different. It's, it made my
mom make, doing standup a lot more fun.

2001
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:02,950
That's awesome man.

2002
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:07,980
I love when people like refined or the
joy of performing or find it caused all

2003
01:57:09,321 --> 01:57:13,960
these tiny still and I'm like, oh, what is
he doing? How's he doing that? You know?

2004
01:57:13,961 --> 01:57:17,230
Is he funny? He doesn't have
an opening act. Yeah. Yeah.

2005
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:20,470
Any speed is like an hour and a half.
I had all, everybody sits down, right?

2006
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:24,530
It was actually Louis that he said to me,
he was like a c k. He's like, he's like,

2007
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:29,330
go see Cosmi. It goes, wow, he's
going to do a ton of material.

2008
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:34,070
You're going to think 20 minutes went by.
He's still funny. And, and Lo and behold,

2009
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:38,500
yeah, go on. And I was like, this is
weird. I wanted to be bitter and uh, he,

2010
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:39,383
he ruined it.

2011
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,080
And maybe it's because he
just enjoys the art form.

2012
01:57:42,081 --> 01:57:47,081
As long as like stand up to me seems like
when I feel like when I'm like really

2013
01:57:47,481 --> 01:57:49,510
tuned into it,
I'm as much of a,

2014
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:53,780
I'm like a passenger and I feel
like it's a group hypnosis thing.

2015
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,390
Like you lock people and you
know how to do the bits ride.

2016
01:57:56,391 --> 01:57:57,320
He know where it's going,

2017
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:01,250
you know the setup and you hold the
pause and it becomes like this big and if

2018
01:58:01,251 --> 01:58:04,190
you tune into that
frequency and nourish shit,

2019
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,110
as long as you continue to nourish it,

2020
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:08,450
it seems like something
that would always be there.

2021
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:11,990
It seems like when people lose it is
when they take a couple of years off and

2022
01:58:11,991 --> 01:58:15,190
then they'd go back again or
something happens. And really

2023
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:20,200
I think it just maybe the opposite.
It's like when people just, this works,

2024
01:58:20,290 --> 01:58:24,190
I'm going to do it and just get out of
here tonight when my life get the check.

2025
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:27,760
You know what I mean? So, cause I
know I have done that, you know,

2026
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:32,590
but this is different, a new phase
where I lived there and I go, all right,

2027
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:37,360
um, it's not a mistake. You're
here. You know what I mean?

2028
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:39,820
I slow it down,
slow it down,

2029
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:44,020
and instead of blurting out those new
ideas, you know, that's usually what I do.

2030
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:46,180
Like the first couple of minutes
or whatever, the new ideas,

2031
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:50,620
there's this and then I do the act. I go,
I go, Geez, slow it down. It was, it's a,

2032
01:58:50,621 --> 01:58:54,230
it has been new, you know, maybe people
are like, and I'll see, you know,

2033
01:58:54,310 --> 01:58:56,890
I keep doing it and see what
we see, folks like it. But

2034
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:59,640
are you more comfortable as a person now?

2035
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,700
Yeah. Yeah. So is that it?
Yeah. I'm not like, you know,

2036
01:59:03,701 --> 01:59:08,230
rainbows and cramping and Unicorns
all day. I mean, I, I get, I get dark,

2037
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,990
but I will say,
um,

2038
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:15,280
the majority of the time I'm happy
and I'm happy when I'm making stuff.

2039
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:17,560
So now I know that, well, okay,

2040
01:59:17,561 --> 01:59:22,120
no one greenlit this movie or no one did
this and that. I pick up my, you know,

2041
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:25,390
I start writing know it doesn't
matter if it gets made or not.

2042
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:27,430
That process is very freeing.

2043
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,171
Yeah.

2044
01:59:28,171 --> 01:59:31,830
There's something about creating things
where especially if people enjoy those

2045
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:33,750
things, if he could put those
things out and they can,

2046
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:36,870
like people can like actually get like a,
like when you like,

2047
01:59:36,871 --> 01:59:41,010
so say someone goes to see Willow Creek.
If you go and see this movie,

2048
01:59:41,011 --> 01:59:45,090
which you're going to get is like a
feeling you're going to sit down and this

2049
01:59:45,091 --> 01:59:48,450
thing's going to happen in front
of you and you go, ha ha ha,

2050
01:59:48,710 --> 01:59:52,920
you're going to have all this
feeling attached to and you as uh,

2051
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:56,670
you know the pretentious word artist,
but you as an artist,

2052
01:59:56,671 --> 01:59:59,610
like as someone who's created this
gets to sit there and realize that your

2053
01:59:59,611 --> 02:00:02,970
effort, your thought, your focus,
all this, you piece it together,

2054
02:00:02,971 --> 02:00:07,650
your edited up and boom and then you
deliver it and then you get to watch all

2055
02:00:07,651 --> 02:00:10,350
this positive reaction and
you just want to go do more.

2056
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:13,040
We just want to continue that
cycle of putting out there.

2057
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,320
Me.
I think it's kind of like,

2058
02:00:14,321 --> 02:00:16,540
I keep making these movies
and it's really exciting,

2059
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:19,080
especially like the last four,
when,

2060
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:23,800
when after the movie people are
are Chatty, they're like, rob,

2061
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:28,150
I've haven't been that. Which happens.
It's really sweet. And, and, and, and, um,

2062
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:32,440
and I guess basically what I'm doing
is I'm shooting out of flare saying,

2063
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:37,090
[inaudible] do you, do you guys see this?
Do you guys feel this? Is this right?

2064
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,900
Or is this going, what's going on? Or
wouldn't this be cool? You know, that's,

2065
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:43,210
that's what I'm doing when I make a movie.

2066
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:46,510
Well, that's the way to do it,
man. I mean, you're, you're, it's,

2067
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:51,300
it's a true form of expression. Like
instead of you saying, Oh, this will sell,

2068
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:55,800
you know, hey, if I box this with that
and that in a funny black guy, boom,

2069
02:00:55,801 --> 02:01:00,540
I'm fucking man, I do the voice. Yeah.
Instead you're like, you know what, man,

2070
02:01:00,541 --> 02:01:05,340
I'm fucking into big foot. Let's make
this weird fucking crazy movie about big.

2071
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:08,250
Well, that's what I got to say about my
wife. That's a really funny, she says,

2072
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:12,330
she says, go, you know,

2073
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:15,050
go to your big foot. Like she
can't, you want me to get it?

2074
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:17,940
She let me drive around for a week.

2075
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,840
So is that what you did to, to
write it? You just drove around?

2076
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:25,390
Truly. It wasn't even like writing. It
was really just just, uh, I'm going to go,

2077
02:01:25,391 --> 02:01:29,920
I'm going to talk to people. I'm just
going to do this with no agenda, you know?

2078
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:33,010
Wow. I knew that some day
I'd probably make a movie,

2079
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:37,690
but it was really more just like, do you
know how freeing that is? Like, like five,

2080
02:01:37,691 --> 02:01:40,010
six days,
Matt have,

2081
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,680
you know, the, you know, I still had to
do a couple of folders, which is funny.

2082
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:46,660
You know, they're going to,
where are you looking for?

2083
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:52,340
That's hilarious. You're doing
phones for gigs. Like, yeah,

2084
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:57,090
we'll help me in Peoria at the
Jukebox, but right now I, that's it.

2085
02:01:57,110 --> 02:02:00,620
You know? So, so you go out
there, you take 11 days,

2086
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:03,770
you go wandering around for bigfoot.
Where did you decide to start?

2087
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:05,510
Did you have a specific

2088
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:06,321
no,
no.

2089
02:02:06,321 --> 02:02:11,321
I drove up first to Santa Cruz and the
Sierras twos and I drove around there.

2090
02:02:11,571 --> 02:02:15,320
Santa Cruz is amazing and never been.
It's really, it's really, really awesome.

2091
02:02:15,610 --> 02:02:15,920
You know,

2092
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:20,920
I just went where like kind of kind of
poked around and knew certain sites where

2093
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:25,920
people had seen, you know, or heard or
you know, events, you know. So and, and,

2094
02:02:25,921 --> 02:02:28,700
and, and that's again, I
ended up in Willow Creek. I,

2095
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:33,380
I didn't go up to happy camp, which,
uh, I probably will still, I mean,

2096
02:02:33,381 --> 02:02:37,670
that's another pretty a, a
Sasquatch. Yeah. Yeah. It's,

2097
02:02:37,671 --> 02:02:42,490
it's above a Orleans. It's above
bluff creek and everything. It's,

2098
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:45,440
uh, it's still another place
that there's a lot of squash. It

2099
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:50,310
isn't there a bunch of different names
for those areas too that are like monkey

2100
02:02:50,311 --> 02:02:55,260
names and Apa. Yeah. Canyon,
yeah. In Oregon. Yeah.

2101
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:59,940
Very strange. How many,
why? Yeah. And then, um, in,

2102
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:04,950
in Mount Rainier, up in that area,
there's a bunch of names that are the,

2103
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:07,290
one of the North American
names for bigfoot.

2104
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:10,170
There's a bunch of like canyons
that are named after that. Like,

2105
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,110
so this guy starts talking about all
these different areas and it's got this

2106
02:03:13,111 --> 02:03:17,400
weird North American, you know,
name in it and a, and he said,

2107
02:03:17,401 --> 02:03:21,000
well that's when we just, that's how
we started our big foot squashing.

2108
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:24,710
We just started going to all these places
as the North American Indians had now

2109
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:27,650
her affidavit that it's fucking crazy.
Like they names

2110
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,550
bots again. Yeah. That's
makes you fucking think. Yeah.

2111
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:36,820
And it's also, but when all
said and done, Eh, Eh, you know,

2112
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:37,730
it's,

2113
02:03:37,730 --> 02:03:40,870
whenever you're a sub culture you're
going to get ridiculed and picked upon.

2114
02:03:40,871 --> 02:03:42,790
But like you said,
it's just camping.

2115
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:45,950
It's camp and it's fun.
There's something silly about it.

2116
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:48,170
I mean I went with Dunkin
trust and we ate pot candies.

2117
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,350
Yeah. Last. Well that's what
I was wondering about the,

2118
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:54,150
cause they know some of these guys,
they're high of course,

2119
02:03:54,151 --> 02:03:57,980
but they're very worried
about what bigfoot foot,

2120
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:03,030
bigfoot likes different smells.
And I'm like, are they eating it?

2121
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,140
They got to eat it.

2122
02:04:04,530 --> 02:04:08,160
Well, if they're smart, they'd eat it.
But even if they, if he eats strong,

2123
02:04:08,161 --> 02:04:12,570
we'd like you open up. Like,
I remember one time, uh, uh,

2124
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:15,880
I won't even say his name,
but we were on a plane and uh,

2125
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:20,960
he had brought a Tupperware thing and
it's fucking carry on with weed cookies

2126
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:22,740
and it was an international flight.
Okay.

2127
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:27,600
And this motherfucker opens the lid
and he goes, do you want one here?

2128
02:04:27,601 --> 02:04:29,730
You can say it wasn't him guy.
Now I'll tell you that.

2129
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:34,470
He opens the lid and the smell was
so strong. I'm like, oh my God,

2130
02:04:34,471 --> 02:04:37,920
we're going to jail. I'm like, are you
crazy? Do know what that smells like?

2131
02:04:37,921 --> 02:04:39,540
He's like, can't even
smell it. And I was like,

2132
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:42,390
you can't smell it because you've
been smelling it for so long.

2133
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,310
You are in your comment.

2134
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:47,540
It was so scary. It was, it
was, it was so powerful. Strong.

2135
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:50,240
I would think if you had those
brownies out there in the woods,

2136
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:51,620
big foot's going to fucking smell.

2137
02:04:51,710 --> 02:04:52,220
No.

2138
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:56,780
Have I ever told the Tony Vee story
about when he was the American tourist or

2139
02:04:56,781 --> 02:04:59,740
gorilla? No. Okay. This is
great. I don't think so. Tony,

2140
02:04:59,741 --> 02:05:03,650
you won a contract to be the gorilla.
And so he had show up.

2141
02:05:03,651 --> 02:05:08,510
Now he told he's a big guy,
right? He's like two 50, you know,

2142
02:05:08,511 --> 02:05:10,370
it was maybe a little heavier sometimes,

2143
02:05:10,371 --> 02:05:12,800
but he's a big guy and I
think he's about three,

2144
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:17,720
three bills when he was the gorilla.
So Rick Baker builds him a gorilla suit.

2145
02:05:17,721 --> 02:05:19,460
That's one he grant.

2146
02:05:19,610 --> 02:05:24,040
It's made it like real hair and
it's got this whole gorilla, uh,

2147
02:05:24,070 --> 02:05:25,280
it muscle structure.

2148
02:05:25,970 --> 02:05:29,450
Now Tony goes to like hockey games and
stuff and people get mad, you know,

2149
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:34,200
like he goes out on the ice.
Fuck you really,

2150
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:39,310
you know, this is bad. We're fucking
horrible. Our animals animals.

2151
02:05:39,370 --> 02:05:43,820
So, so Tony, the gorilla seats
got a better deal than Tony.

2152
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:48,630
It's got a guy that travels with these
anvil cases in packs it up and, and, and,

2153
02:05:48,631 --> 02:05:53,631
and so Tony's doing standup
in the meantime with me
and hopscotching while he's

2154
02:05:53,751 --> 02:05:57,780
doing the gorilla dates. Now the gorilla
suit is not with us, but he's got this,

2155
02:05:57,830 --> 02:06:01,430
this oneZ , this big unit tired that
he wears under the gorilla suit.

2156
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:05,030
And clearly he was having
some chafing problems.

2157
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,310
So he goes and um,

2158
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:12,950
so we're getting search through customs
going out of Canada and there's all this

2159
02:06:13,101 --> 02:06:16,730
uh, like white powder and
rocks that form from his sweat,

2160
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:20,960
from the Crotch,
sweat and sweat.

2161
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:24,710
The custom guy licks his finger,

2162
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:29,750
he picks up one of the rocks and
he tastes it. If I'm his balls,

2163
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:32,150
you know,
it was a ball.

2164
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:37,430
It was a rock of baby powder from his
ball and this ball sweat and I think I'm

2165
02:06:39,321 --> 02:06:44,090
kind of, I think I'm witty. I
like, it was like go it is that

2166
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:51,730
tiers tier can [inaudible] the
rock this big hit his tongue.

2167
02:06:53,121 --> 02:06:55,640
He was just immediately, he was like,
I don't know what he's thinking.

2168
02:06:55,641 --> 02:06:56,810
Like he could tell like

2169
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:02,900
he think Paul's and old man
Dick and he's just like,

2170
02:07:02,901 --> 02:07:04,520
what the fuck is going on?

2171
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:09,380
It was the best phase just
like hyperventilating. We,

2172
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:13,670
there we are actually cause I love Tony.
Like Tony,

2173
02:07:13,671 --> 02:07:16,530
I love Tony and I met were
just holding each other.

2174
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:19,120
We're just two guys just
wrapped around each other.

2175
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:21,930
Crying is the best

2176
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:27,320
thing we ever saw. Serious, furious,

2177
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:30,080
furious because

2178
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:33,810
we kind of stopped him by the way.

2179
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:37,900
He licks the and then he's got all the
way down and we both look hook like,

2180
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:42,190
all right, it's so funny. That was
the best thing. I thought it was coke.

2181
02:07:42,191 --> 02:07:45,250
He thought he was catching someone
who daddy got the bag, got a big case.

2182
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:49,900
He's got the big collar is going to
get kicked upstairs. That is so fun.

2183
02:07:50,480 --> 02:07:52,050
I don't eat.
Told me one of the morning

2184
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:56,550
important things that I ever learned
about driving because he was driving back

2185
02:07:56,551 --> 02:08:00,600
and forth from New York to Boston. It was
a long thing and he was doing it a lot.

2186
02:08:00,601 --> 02:08:01,650
I forget what he was working on,

2187
02:08:01,651 --> 02:08:03,690
but he was driving back
and forth a lot and I go,

2188
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:07,320
how do you do that without going crazy?
He goes, I just goes. Then he goes,

2189
02:08:07,321 --> 02:08:10,830
when I'm in the car, I just say,
now this is what I'm doing. He goes,

2190
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:12,660
there's don't say,
man,

2191
02:08:12,661 --> 02:08:16,050
I wish I wasn't doing this and I could
be doing something else. He goes,

2192
02:08:16,170 --> 02:08:19,740
I just say, this is what I'm doing. And
that's, I never thought about it that way.

2193
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,600
I want, I was like,
yeah, you can do things.

2194
02:08:21,601 --> 02:08:25,050
You don't want to do like that and just,
just have it in your head.

2195
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,220
This is what I'm doing.

2196
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:29,880
My wife had a friend who, uh, he was, uh,

2197
02:08:30,060 --> 02:08:34,680
he sold ice cream and an ice cream truck
and it played a Turkey in the straw

2198
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:39,350
over and over. Is that data
that, that, that, that, that,

2199
02:08:39,351 --> 02:08:43,710
that the, the, the day, day after
day, all day long Turkey in the straw.

2200
02:08:44,190 --> 02:08:47,670
And he said, you know what? I did? I said,
I'm going to make that my favorite song.

2201
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:54,350
I became, became his favorite
jam. Wow. That's madness.

2202
02:08:55,110 --> 02:08:58,380
Yeah. Ice Cream truck. That would
be the best job. That'd be horrible.

2203
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:01,100
Ah, you could deal with a
lot of shitty kids there.

2204
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,680
Would definitely make you
want to not have kids.

2205
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:04,320
Yeah.
And I'd also be like,

2206
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:08,580
you're giving kids ice cream down the
side and he mostly aren't people just

2207
02:09:08,581 --> 02:09:13,080
selling weed out of ice cream trucks.
I don't know if you're lucky,

2208
02:09:13,081 --> 02:09:16,500
if you have any good in the
van Halen Song. You know,
it's funny, as you grow up,

2209
02:09:16,501 --> 02:09:18,960
like I grew up,
you know,

2210
02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:23,910
I was the first generation of like
getting, you know, the Ramones,

2211
02:09:23,911 --> 02:09:28,290
you know, they, they, I, I, I
got to see them live, actually
would help build the pas.

2212
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:31,880
That's how I'd sneak into bars
when I was under age, Ramones,

2213
02:09:32,370 --> 02:09:33,900
punk rock and all this stuff.

2214
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:38,520
And I rebelled against all of this stuff
as it kept coming up, like, you know,

2215
02:09:38,530 --> 02:09:41,850
then later on, the kids, we were in the
van Halen. I'm like, that's not punk rock,

2216
02:09:41,851 --> 02:09:43,230
you know,
it was an asshole.

2217
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:48,570
But I was down in Baja with a bunch
of buddies and they were all surfing.

2218
02:09:48,570 --> 02:09:52,440
And I'm like the, uh, and, uh, I
mean, we're in the middle of nowhere,

2219
02:09:52,441 --> 02:09:56,130
like about about five, six hours.
Yeah. I, you know, just, just,

2220
02:09:56,131 --> 02:09:57,600
I don't know if you've
ever gone out and Mexico,

2221
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:01,020
I think it's a little too sketchy now,
but there's nothing around there.

2222
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:05,730
Any surfers with no shipwreck.
It's a famous surf site. And, uh,

2223
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:06,721
you know,

2224
02:10:06,721 --> 02:10:11,721
and we're driving along the side of a
cliff and I'm driving this jeep and we're

2225
02:10:12,151 --> 02:10:15,990
playing Panama from Van
Howell fucking loud.

2226
02:10:15,991 --> 02:10:19,110
And everybody's fucked up except me.
I'm the designated. I'm, you know,

2227
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:23,760
Joe Sober fucking but I, it was
finally, I was like, hey man,

2228
02:10:23,761 --> 02:10:28,560
I get van Halen.
You finally got it.

2229
02:10:28,561 --> 02:10:33,090
I got it was Panama, that
song, great fucking song.

2230
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,010
I it

2231
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:38,090
just loud and there's stars and these
guys are screaming and as I keep speeding

2232
02:10:38,091 --> 02:10:42,430
going over gigantic pot holes,
they're all thinking they're doomed.

2233
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:46,370
And I was like, it's again. It's like I'm
good in chaos. I go now I get van. Now.

2234
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,790
Isn't that a funny thing that you
do though? People do. We all do it.

2235
02:10:49,890 --> 02:10:52,820
Especially when you're young. Where
if someone doesn't like what you like,

2236
02:10:52,850 --> 02:10:57,040
you fucking angry. So angry. What
do you like it? Shit you don't like,

2237
02:10:57,041 --> 02:10:59,730
you hate them for liking it.
Here's an exclusive cause I,

2238
02:10:59,731 --> 02:11:03,320
I do tell a lot of yarns and they're
all true, but I have a lot of stories.

2239
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:08,270
Here's the story. I don't, I've never told
anyone. When I was opening for Nirvana,

2240
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:13,430
we were at, uh, here in la,
so I don't know which, which,

2241
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:15,260
which form. I think it
was a form. I don't know.

2242
02:11:15,680 --> 02:11:20,680
But I'm an Eddie van Halen shows up
and he's really fucking hammered and he

2243
02:11:20,871 --> 02:11:25,300
wants to jam. And Kurt is totally flipped
out. Like Eddie van Halen wants to,

2244
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:29,380
he's like hide me, you know, so, so
Eddie wants to go up and tread. Yeah.

2245
02:11:29,390 --> 02:11:33,020
And he's fucking hammered. I go, dude,
give him one of your guitars cause,

2246
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:36,950
cause Kurt played lefthanded and I go,
it'll be, it'll be great. You know,

2247
02:11:36,951 --> 02:11:40,700
he won't be able to play it. And he's
like, he would figure it out. Like

2248
02:11:42,850 --> 02:11:44,120
this would be so funny.

2249
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:49,350
It was really weird and it probably would,
we had David Lee Roth coming here.

2250
02:11:49,351 --> 02:11:53,040
He couldn't be fucking cooler.
I met him one night at the comedy store.

2251
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:56,580
He was the greatest guy just hanging out.
No pretense

2252
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:02,060
in the 80s they were going to cause
purple rain made money and they were going

2253
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:05,920
to give him money and it was
just an insane scripty. Oh,

2254
02:12:05,930 --> 02:12:07,160
it was just a movie.

2255
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:10,710
Yeah. I went in and read for why did they
never do that? He's so camera's Madec.

2256
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:12,150
Yeah.
What did they never give him a movie?

2257
02:12:12,151 --> 02:12:15,120
That's what he's putting on
the busy fucking everything.

2258
02:12:15,150 --> 02:12:18,030
But there could be a movie there, you
know? That's the thing. It's like,

2259
02:12:18,031 --> 02:12:19,920
look at him. You know? Maybe they
didn't know what he's doing now.

2260
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:22,530
He lives in Japan.
Okay.

2261
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:26,190
He lives in an apartment with his dog
and he practiced his sword fighting all

2262
02:12:26,190 --> 02:12:30,260
day. I'm not kidding. No.
I believe man by himself.

2263
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:32,840
He's a fascinating guy. We
had him in here. First of all,

2264
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:36,130
the fucking guy wears overalls
everywhere. He goes. Okay.

2265
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:39,620
He's comfortable with his nipples. I
don't let me just likes wearing overalls.

2266
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:43,580
They bug your nipples.
I haven't worn in a long time.

2267
02:12:43,581 --> 02:12:45,710
I'd have to cut back or over overalls.

2268
02:12:45,711 --> 02:12:48,260
You know what they have the little things
like the farmers where they clip up

2269
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:51,980
here and he, yeah, we haven't see, look,
he's wearing overalls. You see that? Oh,

2270
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:56,060
he's got a shirt on it. Yeah. I thought he
wasn't wearing a shirt. No. Look overall,

2271
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:01,800
it's hilarious. And, and, and so he, he
does his sword and, and this practice,

2272
02:13:01,830 --> 02:13:06,680
his sword fight and does, and not to be
so crass, but does he, is he set, I mean,

2273
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,130
financially, I'm sure
he's got the side. Well,

2274
02:13:09,131 --> 02:13:11,530
you never know how much fucking
money David Lee Roth must have.

2275
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:13,720
I by David Lee Roth is,
first of all,

2276
02:13:13,721 --> 02:13:18,070
he's very smart and I think
he's also a savvy guy.

2277
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:21,340
I do not see him overindulging to
the point of something like that.

2278
02:13:21,550 --> 02:13:23,140
He likes living small.

2279
02:13:23,141 --> 02:13:26,620
He shows up here by himself and he's one
of the biggest rock stars of all time.

2280
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:30,280
Drives himself here, shows
up by himself. Hey guys, no,

2281
02:13:30,310 --> 02:13:31,890
no pretense in and sit down.

2282
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,620
How's everybody? But a
lot of, a lot of the,

2283
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:39,680
the folks that have longevity do that.
Yeah.

2284
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:43,170
You know what I mean? Like, like
I haven't seen him in a long time,

2285
02:13:43,171 --> 02:13:45,630
but there was a period where
I spent some time around,

2286
02:13:45,670 --> 02:13:47,340
I sound like I'm just name
dropping all my stories,

2287
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:52,270
but it would take a bow and
he would do that. He was like,

2288
02:13:53,370 --> 02:13:58,260
well, you know, uh,
uh, I know, I know. No,

2289
02:13:58,261 --> 02:14:01,650
no, I'm just kidding. It is a, yeah, it's
true. If you know data, here's the thing.

2290
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:03,610
You've always,
you eat

2291
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:08,320
if you're in show business that
these are the folks that you, you,

2292
02:14:08,330 --> 02:14:12,600
you become friends with. Not all
of them, but some stories. I mean,

2293
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:18,450
you just told me a David Lee Roth story,
but you also have a show maybe that,

2294
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:21,150
well, he came in to promote
his show. He has a podcast.

2295
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:25,770
He's going to Japan from Japan. It's
fucking great. It's great. He's fun.

2296
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:29,520
He gets up and does this, does this
podcast, video podcast I think.

2297
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:31,540
And then he didn't find
out what the addresses,

2298
02:14:31,560 --> 02:14:34,020
I don't know what the addresses and
then he, and then he sword fights.

2299
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:36,620
I think it would cause it to the
Dave TV or something like that.

2300
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:38,970
I remember he also, I heard
this, I don't know this is true,

2301
02:14:38,971 --> 02:14:42,080
but I heard that when you would know
this may be because martial arts, he,

2302
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:46,410
he would, uh, sweep the
stage after the show. Really?

2303
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:48,840
I heard that. I don't know if
that's true. I didn't ask him,

2304
02:14:48,841 --> 02:14:52,800
but I could see him doing something like
that. Just, just has a discipline. Yeah.

2305
02:14:52,801 --> 02:14:57,480
I could see him doing. So he's a weird
guy though. Show I also, we were at,

2306
02:14:57,650 --> 02:15:02,450
uh, again with the Nirvana, but this
is another funny strive that wisdom.

2307
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:07,180
Uh, one of the crew guys had worked with,
uh, the new, she had worked with Dennis

2308
02:15:09,140 --> 02:15:11,650
and Kurt enjoyed hearing the
story because you know the nudes,

2309
02:15:11,651 --> 02:15:15,890
you would hit the stage with an air ramp.
Like he hit the, this air ramp, you know,

2310
02:15:15,891 --> 02:15:18,110
like a stunt man and he
would shoot him over the amp.

2311
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:20,361
Yeah.

2312
02:15:20,361 --> 02:15:24,920
And so he can fly in and it with the
guitar and just go shooting over and land,

2313
02:15:24,921 --> 02:15:27,080
which stand on what they hit the stage.

2314
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:31,250
And how far would he fall from
the top of a stack of Marshall's?

2315
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,630
Holy shot him off like

2316
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,850
Canon. So, um, but
apparently curtain joke,

2317
02:15:38,070 --> 02:15:40,260
cause I witnesses hearing
the story about when he,

2318
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,380
he clipped the top of the speakers,

2319
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:46,260
would his boot heels and just
ate shit and landed on his feet.

2320
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:50,800
Oh well his knees are all fucked up.

2321
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:55,060
He hobbles really bad now and he just
had some serious knee operation be that

2322
02:15:55,061 --> 02:15:58,990
air ramp, Jesus' side of magic, man.
We don't have to go at that way.

2323
02:15:59,590 --> 02:16:00,970
Flying over the fucking

2324
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:06,250
probably cowboy boots on or something
stupid. Right. You know, every audience,

2325
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:09,370
you know isn't red hot,
you know?

2326
02:16:09,371 --> 02:16:14,371
I mean there's gotta be times where
you'll feel like they're in a beer line.

2327
02:16:16,570 --> 02:16:18,370
I'm trying to get him to do the podcast.

2328
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:21,970
He's always going to be at the Canyon
Club in July. Why wouldn't need,

2329
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,853
or I don't know.

2330
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:28,690
I shot an animal for them just to be
friends that went deer hunting just so I

2331
02:16:28,691 --> 02:16:30,110
could call my friend and

2332
02:16:30,170 --> 02:16:33,060
no, that's not why I did, but I
really would like to get them in a,

2333
02:16:33,070 --> 02:16:37,150
he's a fascinating character.
Of course he's and his is a hunting show.

2334
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:41,230
I watched his hunting show. It's
called spirit of the wild. And He,

2335
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:45,460
and is it the hunting he, does he go
around the world or is it as backyard?

2336
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:50,210
The sexy part, not see the
ladder. When the Kimmel show is

2337
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:53,280
Detroit,
I pitched an idea that nobody bit,

2338
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:56,160
and the idea was we were going
to get the new age right.

2339
02:16:56,161 --> 02:16:59,670
We're going to get ted on and then we're
going to pick like Guillermo and uncle

2340
02:16:59,671 --> 02:17:03,450
frank and maybe someone else
in gold ball hunting. No, no,

2341
02:17:03,451 --> 02:17:07,020
I was going to s w I was going to give
him a paint gun and then make them,

2342
02:17:07,050 --> 02:17:09,210
you know, the, the, the
hardest pray, you know,

2343
02:17:09,211 --> 02:17:14,100
I mean and send them out in the streets
and have ted Nugent, uncle frank.

2344
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:17,760
That's funny. You know, and, and it
was great cause it was a snow storm.

2345
02:17:17,761 --> 02:17:20,190
It would've been so fun. You know,
I would have been really fun.

2346
02:17:20,191 --> 02:17:24,630
These guys running away from nudes. Why
it's painful falls. I mean that would be,

2347
02:17:24,631 --> 02:17:27,390
and it was in Detroit
and the snow hilarious.

2348
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:30,600
I was just in the eyes in
Detroit this weekend doing stamp.

2349
02:17:30,601 --> 02:17:34,800
And then I went to Dallas
and showed willow creek down
there to a small festival.

2350
02:17:34,810 --> 02:17:35,470
Couple be oak cliff.

2351
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:39,910
First of all, it's food is fun. Nugen has
a son hunting show and he sets food out.

2352
02:17:39,911 --> 02:17:42,910
And then he climbs in a tree with a bow
and arrow and just fucks these deer up

2353
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:46,690
every day is fucking up a new dear
that's going to eat his food now.

2354
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:48,810
But see he

2355
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:56,170
does he have to abide by? Uh, it
depends on the animation can law.

2356
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:58,180
It's an he's not Michigan anymore.
He's in Texas,

2357
02:17:58,830 --> 02:18:03,350
fanboy of a Ted Nugent family
in Texas. Can he just, you know,

2358
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:06,910
shoot. You know what I'm saying?
Like if he owns an animal,

2359
02:18:06,911 --> 02:18:11,911
can he kill it without having to Dubai
in Texas is one of the best places for

2360
02:18:11,921 --> 02:18:14,050
that,
for what they call high fence operations.

2361
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:17,080
But it depends on the animal and
there's a lot of animals that they keep.

2362
02:18:17,081 --> 02:18:20,580
And those, uh, those high
fence places that are not, uh,

2363
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:25,520
they're not native to like an African guy.
Animals like a cemetery.

2364
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:29,620
So they don't have or a
season? No, no. Some other,

2365
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:32,440
they shoot him whenever they want to
so he could shoot them every day if you

2366
02:18:32,441 --> 02:18:35,950
chose. So they come from another country?
Yup. They got, this is pretty nice.

2367
02:18:35,951 --> 02:18:39,520
I'm getting three squares.
Holy Shit. Is that Ted Nugent

2368
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:44,650
flying stick right to my heart.

2369
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:50,680
My older brother, he, he, he uh, he's,
he's no longer with us but he, he uh,

2370
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:56,590
he was a poacher.
I mean he just shot things all year long.

2371
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,710
Well that's really common in a lot of
places. Yeah. Pacific northwest, it was,

2372
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:02,890
they were telling us how to poach. Yeah.
We were up there hunting for big foot.

2373
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,130
There's a, there's a, there was a woman
that was a woman who worked at the store.

2374
02:19:06,131 --> 02:19:08,140
She was like, whoa. She goes, when we, we,

2375
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:10,900
we see al could just shoot them with a
bow and Arrow and nobody could hear it.

2376
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:11,610
They can.
Yeah.

2377
02:19:11,610 --> 02:19:14,940
Well my brother had everything
figured out. He had a,

2378
02:19:16,630 --> 02:19:21,450
I brought Tony v out to his house once
and I've given him some money to buy,

2379
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:25,320
to insulate his home and I wanted to buy
some new windows and I wanted to make

2380
02:19:25,321 --> 02:19:29,510
sure you use the money cause I went to
visit my brother basically. And Tony,

2381
02:19:29,511 --> 02:19:33,860
we get out of the car and it's just corn,
like psycho corn.

2382
02:19:33,861 --> 02:19:35,800
It just growing up everywhere and,

2383
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:39,530
and tell me what's going on with the
court because it's, you know, I mean,

2384
02:19:39,531 --> 02:19:42,910
there's no rows and my brother's like,
oh, that's for the deer, you know,

2385
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:46,650
you know by sort of the deer and
Tony. He's like, Oh yeah, you,

2386
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:47,880
you help them through the winter.

2387
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:49,630
I want to blast them.

2388
02:19:51,730 --> 02:19:53,730
I go up to the top,

2389
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:59,560
the window in the bathroom and it's
fucking sniper's perch. Yeah. I go,

2390
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:01,810
when I'm in the bathroom
window, he goes, oh recoil

2391
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:06,820
my brother shooting out
the window on the toilet.

2392
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:12,130
He shooting deer from the toilet. By the
way, there's some guys who are going, wow,

2393
02:20:12,131 --> 02:20:15,910
that guy had it all,
all these missing as a qtip

2394
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,310
lamb. He'd be like, you know,

2395
02:20:21,311 --> 02:20:24,900
in the end they want to go hunt
and meet me in the kitchen. Oh,

2396
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:28,600
we're leaving Tony Bigos and
what does that over there?

2397
02:20:28,601 --> 02:20:30,610
Was it like a woodchuck came
my brother. He goes, yeah.

2398
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:35,920
And then we're not even around the corner
and where Blam I just figured that.

2399
02:20:35,921 --> 02:20:36,754
Would Chuck,

2400
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:45,780
when Chuck, what would you shoot
a woodchuck animals? He just, he,

2401
02:20:45,970 --> 02:20:46,803
he was,

2402
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:52,780
his friends were telling me stories
were amazing stories. I hadn't heard.

2403
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:56,680
Oh yeah, your brother. You know,
cause there's a swan pond. I was like,

2404
02:20:56,681 --> 02:21:00,820
don't tell me she'll swatch. He goes,
no, no, no. But there was some bigger,

2405
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:03,340
I don't know what was in
their trout or something. So,

2406
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:08,170
so they had taken acid and they were
climbed over the swap plan and we're

2407
02:21:08,171 --> 02:21:12,820
fishing and shooting. He would
go, dynamite fishing life is like,

2408
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,820
you know, I had back surgery,
let's it a month and a half ago.

2409
02:21:15,821 --> 02:21:19,870
It was my birthday at the end of May and
I get a ladder out and the whole nine,

2410
02:21:19,871 --> 02:21:21,040
it's like, what are you doing? I go, well,

2411
02:21:21,041 --> 02:21:25,440
I think it'd be fun to jump into the
pool from the ladder because cause,

2412
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:29,410
and she's like, that is a horrible, right.

2413
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:35,380
I just see you slipping. Oh,
coming down the ladder. Well,

2414
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:38,050
I'll give you an idea. I
was sitting at home and, um,

2415
02:21:38,590 --> 02:21:41,680
and because of the back surgery and
what did you get done to your back?

2416
02:21:41,710 --> 02:21:46,450
I had some,
a disc and bone spurs and I feel great.

2417
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:50,260
And they do. They took a little bit of
my disc away and took out the bone spurs.

2418
02:21:50,261 --> 02:21:51,520
But I had other problems before.

2419
02:21:51,521 --> 02:21:55,840
I had nerves that were smashed into
two vertebraes yeah. That we're making.

2420
02:21:55,841 --> 02:21:59,020
So my leg just,
I couldn't walk and I have back issues.

2421
02:21:59,021 --> 02:22:02,290
That's all really have a disc. A
bulging disc. Oh, well I have a dude,

2422
02:22:02,291 --> 02:22:06,580
when you want to calculate the cut a
piece of the disc away and I got to tell

2423
02:22:06,581 --> 02:22:07,910
you, it hurt. Uh,

2424
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:12,580
the surgery heals up and now my leg
and I don't have back pain. You know,

2425
02:22:12,581 --> 02:22:16,240
I lost 20 pounds. I as soon as
cause I could, I have my life back.

2426
02:22:16,241 --> 02:22:21,100
But what's amazing, but, so
I said that I've been sober
since I was 19, but here's,

2427
02:22:21,101 --> 02:22:25,890
I mean, yeah, 19 so, but the
thing was like with back surgery,

2428
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:26,370
I,

2429
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:31,140
I had a break. I, you know, I, I, they
put me on the lot. It was a VA based.

2430
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:36,270
Yeah. So have you had the line of no, it's
in cowboy movies. Yeah. It's morphine. So,

2431
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:40,020
so it's the shit that killed
Lenny Bruce. Really? Yeah. So,

2432
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:44,260
so it's awesome. By the
way. It's the best day ever.

2433
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:48,750
I was trying to explain it and I was like,
I said,

2434
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:53,610
it's not cause like people describe
heroin as, as coming as, as like,

2435
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:57,780
you know, like that and it's like,
no, it's dilaudid is like, um,

2436
02:22:58,290 --> 02:23:02,730
right after that and before regret,
you know what I mean?

2437
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:08,700
Shame and regret, right? The
bribe second window and a,

2438
02:23:08,701 --> 02:23:12,690
and it lasts all day. What would you
put Nyquil? Like original Nyquil?

2439
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:16,950
The real shit compared to it a lot
at like a, like a two. Whoa. Yeah.

2440
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:19,750
I'm telling you man. It
was like, it was, you know,

2441
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,860
and I'm glad I went through
this back surgery and,

2442
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:27,240
and when it was over, got off the
dope, that's what we're going to.

2443
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:31,530
And I gave him nervous about that. I
was terrified, terrified. And I gave it,

2444
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:36,480
I gave it to the, oh no. Why did
you need it? Because of the pain.

2445
02:23:36,481 --> 02:23:39,390
I mean, the pain was so bad. Like they're,
you know, they go into your surgery,

2446
02:23:39,391 --> 02:23:44,280
pain pre and post. But, but the
problem was, is that I have, uh,

2447
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:46,830
I have no sense of reality.
Like,

2448
02:23:46,831 --> 02:23:51,270
I don't know the difference between an
ingrown toenail and a ruptured disk.

2449
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:54,210
I really don't like, it's just
pain, you know what I mean?

2450
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:58,560
So I was in so much pain and, um, it was,

2451
02:23:58,590 --> 02:23:59,780
it was so,

2452
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:04,110
but here's at one point already I have
a problem with good ideas and bad ideas.

2453
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:08,820
So, so my friends are over the
house and, uh, I said to my wife,

2454
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:13,140
I go, wouldn't it be funny if I
shot a hole in the roof with a 22?

2455
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:16,980
She was, it wouldn't be
funny at all. I go, yeah.

2456
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:21,040
It scared the cats while you
were on dilaudid in, yeah, yeah,

2457
02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:24,870
yeah. Well, I at least a
hundred Thompson Jr over here.

2458
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:28,090
At least I read it by
while she's there for you.

2459
02:24:28,091 --> 02:24:32,160
It's like no that way cause
your filter. Yeah. It's amazing.

2460
02:24:32,161 --> 02:24:36,750
You need someone to tell you that.
Uh, well, uh, that was the lot, but,

2461
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:40,560
but I will say it's always,
and I've passed this down to my daughter,

2462
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:44,510
it's always the funny story that
outweighs everything else. Oh,

2463
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:48,750
like later on it's the fall. That's
also what's gotten you mean as a comic?

2464
02:24:48,751 --> 02:24:51,620
That's what's gets you like
your life, your career. We,

2465
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:55,630
your livelihood is having these stories.
It's a, it's a valuable asset. Well,

2466
02:24:55,830 --> 02:25:00,230
I love that my daughter has it.
Oh, that's, well that's cool.

2467
02:25:00,290 --> 02:25:05,250
Like she loves her daddy. She
went to a wedding, she says,

2468
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:10,140
I didn't know anybody. I go,
well, what did you do? She said,

2469
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:13,800
during the first song I ran
out in the hump, the bride.

2470
02:25:17,350 --> 02:25:21,850
Fuck is that bro? And she
really did that. Yeah,

2471
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:24,490
of course. She always knows
that the, it's the stories.

2472
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:26,150
You know, she's got
the photos. Look Daddy,

2473
02:25:26,151 --> 02:25:28,120
you know when you took this dilauded Shit,

2474
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:33,150
you were 19 you quit doing everything
and then exit 19 to 50 and then there's

2475
02:25:33,401 --> 02:25:34,234
nothing in between.

2476
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:38,530
Well, I had a back surgery before, so
that, that was funny because at one point,

2477
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:43,020
like I said, I, I put it in the hands
of someone else. I give it to, to, to,

2478
02:25:43,050 --> 02:25:43,883
to my wife.

2479
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:47,930
Give yourself a greenlight to do shit
like that because you're in pain.

2480
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:51,620
Like I had, again, I had to talk
to other folks and say, look man,

2481
02:25:51,650 --> 02:25:55,730
and that had to explain this is
what this is for. But I've, uh,

2482
02:25:55,940 --> 02:26:00,050
I've had surgery before knee surgery
and I just dealt with the pain because I

2483
02:26:00,051 --> 02:26:03,470
don't like, like I don't like,
I don't like all that stuff.

2484
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:07,280
All that stuff actually has a really
weird reaction to me and I become a big

2485
02:26:07,340 --> 02:26:10,160
asshole. Oh, that's interesting.
I become really nasty.

2486
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:14,410
Make you cranky and just a
really an asshole. And I mean,

2487
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:17,370
I'm not like punching my wife, but I
mean I would just, you know, short and

2488
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:22,620
tell her what to do. And so, so
this was what worked. And, um,

2489
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:27,910
and uh, you know, I was on this
and, uh, the first time and, and,

2490
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:33,240
and she, did you ever try to
do it without it? Yeah, yeah,

2491
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:36,060
yeah. Definitely pain and they're
going, this is crazy. You know?

2492
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,840
And they actually just slammed morphine
into my back, cause they're going,

2493
02:26:39,841 --> 02:26:44,040
this is crazy that you're walking around,
you know? And then I thought, well, okay,

2494
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:47,220
I can handle it. I'm sorry
they did. You know what? I did.

2495
02:26:47,250 --> 02:26:52,230
I just vomited immediately.
That's fine. But, but I was,

2496
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:56,640
I was sitting there one day and uh,
this is the first time and, and,

2497
02:26:56,850 --> 02:27:01,850
and I'm watching 'em lifetime and I'm
just sobbing and my wife comes in.

2498
02:27:02,671 --> 02:27:03,180
She goes,

2499
02:27:03,180 --> 02:27:07,730
you don't get any more
pain medicine starting now.

2500
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:14,820
I married a man. Oh, that's
funny. I did not marry him. Man.

2501
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:19,830
Cries during mommy. May I sleep with
danger? Started Tori spelling or whatever.

2502
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:23,070
I was watching.
I'm lifetime lifetime movies made you cry.

2503
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:26,200
Yeah. She's like, it remind me.
She's like, that's, that's it.

2504
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:28,090
Remind me not to take that stuff ever.

2505
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:30,070
I didn't want to cry and I
want to watch lifetime. Yeah.

2506
02:27:32,990 --> 02:27:35,930
I was doing Q and A's for
the movie on dilaudid.

2507
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:39,800
Wow. We went to the Boston film.
Tells the people that you on it. Yeah.

2508
02:27:39,801 --> 02:27:44,060
I just said I'm really high.
What else was I going to do now?

2509
02:27:44,061 --> 02:27:46,940
Was it painful just to like sit down?
Just like to sit up straight?

2510
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:49,173
It got to the point where yes,

2511
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:52,960
sitting was a pain and
walking was a pain and yeah.

2512
02:27:52,961 --> 02:27:55,840
And it affected my life to the point
where, I don't know if you're this way,

2513
02:27:55,841 --> 02:27:59,710
what you go, uh, you,
you, you measure things.

2514
02:27:59,711 --> 02:28:02,800
If I go to the store that's going to hurt
a lot. Can I go? You know what I mean?

2515
02:28:02,801 --> 02:28:06,660
It's affecting what you do to the
point where I, you know, I didn't have,

2516
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:11,410
I was 50 or in my late
forties and thinking like a,

2517
02:28:11,411 --> 02:28:14,680
a senior citizen, so
whoa. And now I'm back.

2518
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:19,720
That's amazing. Yeah. Back surgeries,
scary shit. Back surgeries.

2519
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:22,220
Spooky one for people I've ever,
well

2520
02:28:22,220 --> 02:28:25,010
it sounds, I have a great
doctor, but it sounds like,

2521
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:30,010
are you worried about the controls
surrendering it? Is that it? I mean I,

2522
02:28:30,011 --> 02:28:34,220
I went to a bunch of doctors. Oh really?
Yeah. I've had no surgery. Back Surgery,

2523
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:39,860
knee surgery twice, three times, three
11 uni. I tore my ACL and both knees.

2524
02:28:39,861 --> 02:28:41,890
I had a reconstructed and
I told him I'm doing this.

2525
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:45,590
Just the first one was a kickboxing.
The second one was Jujitsu.

2526
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:51,560
And what happens when
it happens? You're like,

2527
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:55,550
well, the first one that you broke,
I knew something was really bad.

2528
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:58,850
I knew something was really wrong.
It was like a pop and just terrible,

2529
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:05,210
terrible pain. The first one, uh, her a
lot more. The second one didn't even hurt.

2530
02:29:05,211 --> 02:29:09,190
It was really weird because it was, um,
I was in what's called a half guard,

2531
02:29:09,260 --> 02:29:14,090
so someone's legs are wrapped around
your legs and he extended his legs and my

2532
02:29:14,091 --> 02:29:17,900
leg went sideways and just went stop
like a carrot. It was really weird.

2533
02:29:17,901 --> 02:29:20,140
It was like this pop noise. And then, uh,

2534
02:29:20,141 --> 02:29:24,230
I didn't even know it was the
ACA was gone until I was walking.

2535
02:29:24,231 --> 02:29:26,800
I think it was in my office.
I was moving something like,

2536
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:30,860
just gave out on me really weird.
And I had already had my left done,

2537
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:34,410
so I knew that my right was
probably fucked. So first one,

2538
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:38,000
was that during a match?
No, it was training. Both of
them were during training.

2539
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:42,470
Okay. And what does, how does
the other guy feels? He's
like, know it wasn't fault.

2540
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:46,790
It was totally easy. Does it feel weird?
Oh yeah. He felt bad. He felt terrible.

2541
02:29:46,791 --> 02:29:50,030
The Guy, will's the guy who it
happened to the second time,

2542
02:29:50,031 --> 02:29:50,751
it was a friend of mine.

2543
02:29:50,751 --> 02:29:54,350
He's a really nice guy and he was terrible
when you train. I haven't had it guys.

2544
02:29:54,351 --> 02:29:57,770
I had a guy's lady explode on
me a couple of times. Yeah,

2545
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:01,820
two different times that I can remember
one time the guy blamed me but that was

2546
02:30:01,821 --> 02:30:03,510
ridiculous.
It was just weird.

2547
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,100
It's just in the middle of scrambling
like sometimes you need just gives out.

2548
02:30:07,490 --> 02:30:11,600
And then the other one time was a
guy didn't tap in time in his knee,

2549
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:15,680
just exploded. It went pop, pop,
pop, pop, pop. But it was like,

2550
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:17,510
it was a weird situation.

2551
02:30:17,511 --> 02:30:21,740
It was like he didn't really have to tap
like sometimes like you can get out of

2552
02:30:21,741 --> 02:30:25,190
things and you're real close and then
I'll something in the middle of like

2553
02:30:25,191 --> 02:30:27,350
trying to get out of it. Like he was
pretty close to getting out of it.

2554
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:28,610
His knee just gave out.

2555
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:32,880
Like it was a weird sort of a thing
and it made this horrible, loud sound.

2556
02:30:32,881 --> 02:30:36,530
And that sounds to me you're, you're
thinking that I'm crazy cause I'm an,

2557
02:30:36,531 --> 02:30:41,090
I am a jump off the ledge. I was going
to get someone to steady it. Well it's,

2558
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:45,150
it can be dangerous. Like I
said, I've had my nose opened up.

2559
02:30:46,130 --> 02:30:49,760
It's a little insane but it's also very
intoxicating. It's fun. It's like a,

2560
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:54,560
it's a very exciting game now about
now you don't do it. Sure do. Wow.

2561
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,330
Yeah. Well the only thing
that's stopping right now,

2562
02:30:56,331 --> 02:30:59,660
so I have this little disk issue but
the disc is getting a lot better.

2563
02:30:59,661 --> 02:31:02,150
It's pretty close. Yeah. You gotta
get it taken care of? No, it's not.

2564
02:31:02,151 --> 02:31:04,810
It's not like a, it was only
a few millimeters, the bulge.

2565
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:08,570
So it was something that with spinal
decompression and a bunch of different

2566
02:31:08,571 --> 02:31:13,040
cases saw mine, the law and the
MRI and it was like a comedic,

2567
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:16,940
it looked like a, a bicycle tire with
a bloop. Oh Wow. It was that big.

2568
02:31:16,941 --> 02:31:19,950
And I remember how many millimeters
or poked out like they put on

2569
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:24,780
the Mri and the two doctors go,
oh you like, you're like slow.

2570
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:28,590
Yeah. It was like, okay, mine is
actually asymptomatic right now.

2571
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:31,530
It's a stiff and it just does
getting things out of the things.

2572
02:31:31,531 --> 02:31:33,840
This is the problem.
The problem,

2573
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:38,460
the problem is by the time you figure
out how to do it, what makes you happy?

2574
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:40,140
The wheels start falling off.

2575
02:31:40,610 --> 02:31:43,950
They were just telling me you might need
to get glasses. I mean it's, yeah, no,

2576
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:47,250
I definitely should get reading glass.
What have actually reading classes.

2577
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:52,080
Like when I look at things like anything
that close is, is kind of blurry.

2578
02:31:52,170 --> 02:31:54,960
Like right there that's blurry.
But like, my computer's fine.

2579
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:58,800
I can read everything on the computer.
I need it. It's things are close.

2580
02:31:59,060 --> 02:32:01,590
Well my phone sometimes,
sometimes our wake up,

2581
02:32:01,591 --> 02:32:03,950
I can't read a number and I'm like,
fuck you,

2582
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:06,720
look if I have to actually dial it on
my home phone, I'm just looking at like,

2583
02:32:06,721 --> 02:32:10,590
what the fuck is that? It's weird.
Then I have to go. Like I said,

2584
02:32:10,610 --> 02:32:15,510
it's the cruel, cruel joke at time.
Yeah. Time as mother fucker. It.

2585
02:32:15,511 --> 02:32:20,190
Uh, you know, I, I hate to be so cliche,
but as you get older it's, you know, like,

2586
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:23,390
you know, that's, that's like I said,
that's who I compete with now. Yeah.

2587
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:27,200
Well that's one of the reasons why, um,
I think like going, I'm not like going,

2588
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:32,520
wait a second, did the grim reaper get
a comedy central special mother fucker?

2589
02:32:32,521 --> 02:32:37,180
What do I got to do? A competing? Yeah.

2590
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:41,220
You do rewind up thinking you got
to get out more ship before you go.

2591
02:32:41,470 --> 02:32:43,020
I want to be behind.

2592
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:45,510
Conflict is what builds everything
is what creates everything.

2593
02:32:45,511 --> 02:32:50,220
It's why anything's interesting.
Conflict or pure enjoyment of whatever.

2594
02:32:50,221 --> 02:32:52,480
You're doing that too. That's
true. Conflict kind of,

2595
02:32:52,750 --> 02:32:56,640
there's a bunch of things that can move
along. Right. Well the cool thing is,

2596
02:32:56,641 --> 02:32:57,240
is if you,

2597
02:32:57,240 --> 02:33:02,240
if you stop making the conflict being
other people and you use your own demons

2598
02:33:02,521 --> 02:33:07,260
as the conflict and then you don't
have to create, you know, you know,

2599
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:10,320
yeah. I can sit there and
write a screenplay and,

2600
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:15,020
and not go down and not go to
a terrible place. Yeah. Go,

2601
02:33:15,810 --> 02:33:18,450
yeah,
go back and forth with myself.

2602
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:23,820
When you create something like a, like
this movie or anything that you write it,

2603
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,580
do you sometimes like get out of
it and go, who the fuck wrote that?

2604
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:30,300
Like it just almost like it
comes from somewhere else. I uh,

2605
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:34,830
I think that it's almost like,
this sounds really trippy.

2606
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:37,830
Um,
but I think a lot of this stuff,

2607
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:41,700
and well here you're on stage and you
say something that he never said before

2608
02:33:41,701 --> 02:33:44,040
and it's not even derivative.
It's not something, you know,

2609
02:33:44,041 --> 02:33:47,730
I mean your buddies and you are, you
guys discuss, it's a brand new thought.

2610
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:52,230
You kind of feel like it's just there
already and it's like this, this,

2611
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:54,990
this stream and then you
reach up and you grab it.

2612
02:33:54,991 --> 02:33:57,030
And the big part of it is trying to,

2613
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:00,660
I can't believe I'm not not dilauded
right now, but the big part of it is,

2614
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:03,360
is getting yourself out of the way
so you can just grab that stuff.

2615
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:06,200
That's a great way to describe it, you
know, because cause cause you know, I'm,

2616
02:34:06,201 --> 02:34:09,390
I'm terrible, I'm a failure. I'm a
hack. This has all been done before.

2617
02:34:09,391 --> 02:34:11,790
Nobody likes me.
You know.

2618
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:17,010
It's so exhausting excel and that
stuff's just having a big ego in reverse.

2619
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:18,280
You know?
It's still a big ego.

2620
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:19,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2621
02:34:19,521 --> 02:34:22,190
You're thinking about yourself instead
of thinking about what you're doing or

2622
02:34:22,191 --> 02:34:26,420
going zen and focusing on, yeah. It just
makes stuff that's, it should be a shirt,

2623
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,320
you know,
make stuff or just make stuff,

2624
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:32,220
you know, the other cliche, it's true.
You know, you're feeling bad, you know,

2625
02:34:33,440 --> 02:34:34,480
you do something good.

2626
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:41,280
Yeah. This, uh, this, did you ever read
a, any, uh, Pressfield's the war of art?

2627
02:34:41,970 --> 02:34:43,870
He talks about the Muse,
you know,

2628
02:34:43,871 --> 02:34:47,460
and he talks about and treats it like
it's a real thing and it's a kind of an

2629
02:34:47,461 --> 02:34:51,650
interesting idea because what know, people
think of the Muse, you know, that like,

2630
02:34:51,730 --> 02:34:56,730
and the idea is that there's something
that gives you these ideas for something

2631
02:34:57,811 --> 02:35:01,820
that you pay tribute to and then
it, it gives you ideas. Right.

2632
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:05,140
He actually asked sort of
actively courts it like,

2633
02:35:05,141 --> 02:35:09,030
he actively like says like a, you
know, I'm going to respect the muse.

2634
02:35:09,031 --> 02:35:11,940
I'm going to show up at work every day,
you know,

2635
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,240
and I'm going to put in the hours and
when I put in the hours, the musical come.

2636
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:17,730
Yeah.
And like he sort of,

2637
02:35:18,390 --> 02:35:23,190
his philosophy on it was very enlightening
and it, and it's also very, um, the,

2638
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:26,160
it's, it's, it's, it's inspiring
because it makes you want to write,

2639
02:35:26,190 --> 02:35:27,630
it makes you want to create
and it makes you want it.

2640
02:35:27,631 --> 02:35:29,940
Like that attitude is a very
beneficial attitude to have.

2641
02:35:30,090 --> 02:35:33,880
It's sort of spiritual and Mumbo jumbo
and kinda crazy. No, that's not right.

2642
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:38,880
I say the nicest compliment I've ever
received, uh, as this friend of mine who,

2643
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:42,790
who, uh, Tom Link I think, and he, he, he,

2644
02:35:43,060 --> 02:35:47,290
he saw a movie of mine and he, and he
said, I want to go. Right. Ah, yeah.

2645
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:49,420
That's great. And I was
like, oh, that's nice.

2646
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:51,730
I always feel that way when we're
cynical me. He's like, what? He thought

2647
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,770
better now,
dirty prick again though.

2648
02:35:56,980 --> 02:35:59,620
No, I was like, that was the
nicest thing anyone's ever said,

2649
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:03,070
I think after a movie.
Yeah. Yeah. That is, uh,

2650
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:07,360
one of the coolest things about
other artists to create more of it.

2651
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:10,540
I truly don't know when I'm
making these movies, uh,

2652
02:36:10,570 --> 02:36:14,710
what they're about later on I'll
say, oh, that's this character,

2653
02:36:14,711 --> 02:36:18,160
that's this person in my life and I have
no idea until after they're done and

2654
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:22,720
I'm watching him, like my wife was like,
you didn't get that. This is just pretty,

2655
02:36:22,730 --> 02:36:24,220
or people playing you and me.

2656
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:28,443
Yeah.

2657
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:32,730
Well listen man, you move.
He's fucking bad ass.

2658
02:36:33,080 --> 02:36:37,110
I really wish you all the
best in the world. I will
cherish these big foot socks.

2659
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:38,760
That's a big the in my life

2660
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:42,050
and that posters are really rad
that my friend, uh, Alex, uh,

2661
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:42,441
yeah.

2662
02:36:42,441 --> 02:36:46,850
Where do you might get one frame and
we'll put it up on the hall of fame here

2663
02:36:47,130 --> 02:36:50,420

Willow Creek. If anybody wants to see it,

2664
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:52,310
what will be the availability?

2665
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:56,770
It will in some festivals and as soon
as I get a distribution of some level,

2666
02:36:56,771 --> 02:36:58,420
I'd love to come back.
Probably. I'd like to come back

2667
02:36:58,440 --> 02:37:01,670
before that. Fuck yeah.
Dude. Any time. And please,

2668
02:37:01,671 --> 02:37:04,970

anything to do with the movie business,

and it's, it's, we need fun movies.

2671
02:37:11,241 --> 02:37:13,590
It's a fun movie. Yeah,
it's exciting. Thanks.

2672
02:37:13,710 --> 02:37:16,040
I'm not going to say any
more about it. Don't, and you

2673
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:20,240
don't either, man. It's one of those
movies where you can't say, Oh,

2674
02:37:20,241 --> 02:37:21,470
I love that scene.
Yeah.

2675
02:37:21,560 --> 02:37:24,290
I can't even say it. I enjoy the
shit out of it. Ladies and gentlemen.

2676
02:37:24,380 --> 02:37:28,250
It's called Willow Creek and we'll
keep you updated as far as, uh, what,

2677
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:31,430

or should you have a weapon?

2681
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:41,070
Do you have any names on Instagram?
That's about it, but what's the Instagram?

2682
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:45,030
It's just bobcat. Goldthwait all one
word. It's hard to spell, but you know,

2683
02:37:45,270 --> 02:37:46,480
he can figure it out. It, yeah,

2684
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:51,300
I'm on Instagram and I'm pretty close
to pulling the trigger on the Twitter.

2685
02:37:51,330 --> 02:37:52,163
Maybe

2686
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:55,610
do it. Please. Come on, man.
Do it. We'll will pump you up.

2687
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:57,730
We'll have a contest to see.
How many Twitter followers were you?

2688
02:37:57,740 --> 02:38:01,850
Do you have like a million? Yeah, I
thinks it's a little more than that,

2689
02:38:02,090 --> 02:38:06,470
so it's like, hey man, who's in the
numbers? It's over a million. Okay,

2690
02:38:07,490 --> 02:38:10,920
scratch. I don't know what
it is. I don't know. I, I,

2691
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,820
all I know is that I'm pretty close
to 9,000 Instagram, whatever, nine,

2692
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:18,020
9,000 people looking at
pictures of my cats. Yeah.

2693
02:38:18,021 --> 02:38:21,650
There's a lot of pictures of my cat.
A squeaky frown in my underpants.

2694
02:38:21,770 --> 02:38:25,490
We'll tell about that in
that quickie from, yeah. Got
a dog named squeaky Fromme.

2695
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:30,580
Yes. Yes. Girl. Did you read head? Oh,

2696
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:33,980
female pit bull because he was red and
I found her wandering the streets of

2697
02:38:33,981 --> 02:38:37,190
Hollywood, just like Manson.
Well, my dog killed two dogs.

2698
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:41,030
That's a pretty bad as well. I kind
of crazy dogs. Killed a boy dog.

2699
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,180
She's not really, she's not around
anymore. She's not really squeaky.

2700
02:38:44,180 --> 02:38:48,120
Fromme then we had to take her out
of the blue. She was awesome though.

2701
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:51,290
She had loved me anyway. Squeaky.
Fromme is my best friend.

2702
02:38:51,950 --> 02:38:54,590
I used to love squeaky Fromme my dark too,
so it's all good.

2703
02:38:54,610 --> 02:38:58,970
She gets troubled childhood. I got
her after I got her a little too late.

2704
02:38:59,270 --> 02:39:01,790
Wish she was already a year old
and already crazy. That cat.

2705
02:39:01,791 --> 02:39:04,640
I actually found while we will wrap it up,
we'll talk about my cats next time.

2706
02:39:04,850 --> 02:39:08,570
I got a lot of I could go on for hours.
Wait Ladies and gentlemen,

2707
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:12,200
I know we asked a piece so we're going
to wrap this motherfucker up nice and

2708
02:39:12,201 --> 02:39:16,970
tidy. He's going to be a, you can see
