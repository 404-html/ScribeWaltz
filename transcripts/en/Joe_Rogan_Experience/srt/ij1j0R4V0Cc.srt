1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,520
It should be actually happening.

2
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:13,720
It says live and recording,

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,660
but I'm a fucking idiot.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,870
So I dunno if that's true.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,640
If this is all badly as a gentlemen,

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,440
I did not plan this out this well
and I'm trying to do this myself.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Just me and my man Brian.

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:32,130
But I really need my little buddy red van
to help me out with the technical shit

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,190
cause I don't know what the fuck is going
on so I got to go online to see if it

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,690
is actually online.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,161
No,

12
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,280
I don't want to go social
with your fucking Facebook.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,420
It seems like it's on.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,190
Okay,

15
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,611
we're on.

16
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,444
We're live.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,530
Yes.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,633
Fantastic.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by on it.com on a.com has

20
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:51,981

21
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:52,231

22
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,780
a bunch of new shit in a,

23
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,561
first of all,

24
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:55,940
the hemp protein powder,

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,800
which is a sensational,

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,880
very delicious.

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,380
I use it daily.

28
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:00,690
Is it?

29
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:00,960
Yep.

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,611
You protein proteins.

31
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:01,941
The Shit.

32
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,741
I got to give you some of this,

33
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,650
a hemp for stuff.

34
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,020
It's sweetened with Stevia and yeah,

35
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:07,250
it's got raw cocoa in it.

36
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:09,410
Not a good spokesman for protein powder.

37
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,360
That's not like we're looking
at Brian can I took a shower,

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,080
eat you,

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,491
what do you do?

40
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,324
Do Dance?

41
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,460
Do you dance in the
rain dancer's physique?

42
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:16,551
If,

43
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:16,701
yeah,

44
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,150
if you want to do I have protein powder.

45
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,993
Brian Cowen,

46
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,340
he's a dancer in the rain.

47
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:23,980
That's the,

48
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,813
that's the,

49
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,350
that's a commercial for
hemp protein powder.

50
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,220
Me Dancing in the rain because I look
good wet when rain pitter patter is off my

51
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:31,640
body.

52
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,980
Have you ever tried battle ropes?

53
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,270
Uh,

54
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,570
you mean the roles?

55
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,600
I have some in my house.

56
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,650
I call him,

57
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,550
you call him battle ropes.

58
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,220
I call a Mussel ropes
dude to throw the shit.

59
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,100
That's the only thing.

60
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,780
We just started selling them at Onnit.

61
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,683
Uh,

62
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:47,991
and that's,

63
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:48,171
uh,

64
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,670
one of the other items
that people are good,

65
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,080
so fucking expensive for rope.

66
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,210
I'm telling you it's not all right.

67
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:53,451
It's,

68
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:54,890
it's as cheap as you can buy.

69
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,400
You cannot buy battle ropes online
cheaper than the ones that we're selling.

70
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,580
Ropes are fucking expensive when you're
getting 40 feet of giant thick ass rope

71
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,520
that's not cheap and it comes out to be
like 100 bucks or something like that.

72
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,900
The same thing as Kettlebells,

73
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,770
kettlebells that we're selling.

74
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,633
They're not cheap,

75
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,900
but here's the deal.

76
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,621
First of all,

77
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:15,200
they fucking will last you forever.

78
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,420
You don't ever need other gym equipment.

79
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,760
You needed a chin up bar and
some fucking kettlebells bells.

80
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,320
If you want to be in some badass shape,

81
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,320
those kettle bells will
last you for a lifetime,

82
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,580
for a lifetime.

83
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,361
You will be able to have,

84
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,580
there's so many different exercises
you can do with kettlebells.

85
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,350
Just looking off of youtube,

86
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,320
there's fucking hundreds of
different things you can do.

87
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,740
These canon balls with
handles on them are the shit.

88
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,250
They're fucking the most manly
shit ever for working out.

89
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,720
You feel like you're fucking like,

90
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,220
you're some crazy Russian dude.

91
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:44,000
The worse,

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,850
the worst workout I ever did was
I had to push a weighted sled,

93
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,650
then do the battle ropes.

94
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,310
Oh,

95
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,140
I call him Mussel ropes
and then do kettlebells.

96
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:51,801
I,

97
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,160
I've,

98
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,431
you know,

99
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,090
wrestling,

100
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,600
all of it.

101
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,210
I've never in my life Jujitsu,

102
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,203
I've never,

103
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,680
ever wanted to die.

104
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,041
And it was,

105
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:58,551
by the way,

106
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,760
it was in a six and a half minute workout.

107
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,911
Oh,

108
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,810
here comes Brian.

109
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,550
Almost nowhere online though.

110
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,413
Six and a half months.

111
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,713
Do this online.

112
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,473
Alright.

113
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,081
Hey,

114
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,914
little fella.

115
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,860
Oops.

116
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,580
Here we go.

117
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,761
Hey,

118
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,594
little fella.

119
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,550
We're on the air right now.

120
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,341
Well,

121
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,174
are sleeping.

122
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,073
How dare you?

123
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm,

124
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,420
I'm in a panic because I can't get,

125
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,201
I guess it doesn't matter,

126
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:29,310
but I can't get that dissolve thing to
work where you can't see the text at the

127
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,144
bottom of the screen.

128
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,461
Yeah.

129
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:36,530
You know how you can
make the text fade out?

130
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,730
How do I do that?

131
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,170
Should I sing background
music while he did his?

132
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,004
Yeah,

133
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,823
his name.

134
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,243
Okay.

135
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,111
Right.

136
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:46,100
Click on the scene that you're on.

137
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,943
Okay.

138
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
Edit shot

139
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,660
long eyelashes.

140
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,860
It's a really nice contrast.

141
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,280
He's got a wide face,

142
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,263
not

143
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,890
black shale,

144
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,763
so on and,

145
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,790
but he's got,

146
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:05,960
see,

147
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,860
I don't see that.

148
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:07,910
That's where it's confusing.

149
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,010
It's just too,

150
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,020
he's,

151
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,261
no,

152
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:11,580
I have,

153
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,411
it's just you.

154
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:15,020
I was trying to put Brian's name
up because it's your name on it.

155
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,090
He's got shoulders for
days and a really wide

156
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,200
shoulders is that are really low.

157
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,170
So what should I do?

158
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,830
The last one is Christina Ppas.

159
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,341
It's gain.

160
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,870
It's got like a names on it.

161
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,081
Oh,

162
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,430
the last seat on the far right,

163
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,751
Nia.

164
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,040
That one's just me now.

165
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,310
Back and forth from Brian to me.

166
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,551
Oh,

167
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,361
be sac.

168
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,194
Sac.

169
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,440
Thank you for bearing with
us in this technical break.

170
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:53,011
Ladies and gentlemen,

171
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,050
I'm going to keep singing
the song about Joe Rogan.

172
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,560
He's kind of well,

173
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,300
okay,

174
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,160
well we'll have to deal with this.

175
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,631
So the,

176
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:00,960
um,

177
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,471
the text,

178
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,870
there's no way to get rid
of that text on the screen.

179
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,250
He's got a lie back and
he's really flexible.

180
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,200
It name is Joe Rogan.

181
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,970
He's got a wide neck wad,

182
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,520
faith and a short neck.

183
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:16,741
See,

184
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:17,820
I don't see that though.

185
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,140
When I'm trying to do that.

186
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,770
I can't,

187
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,940
it's not letting me do that means
he can absorb punches really well.

188
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,180
Should have been a fighter buddies.

189
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,670
Jason,

190
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,280
gentleman harm this is boring as fuck.

191
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm sure it shows logic,

192
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,490
camera logic,

193
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,410
camera built in eyesight.

194
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,400
Those are the options.

195
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,271
I'm thinking.

196
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:39,240
Background music did builtin input.

197
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,690
Uh,

198
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,710
it shouldn't be anything on,

199
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,750
it should have been a gymnast.

200
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:43,400
He should have been.

201
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,030
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing,

202
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:45,241
dude.

203
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,410
We're going to have to have you,

204
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,000

205
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,700
get an a,

206
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,420
this is a good job security for you.

207
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,800
The whole show goes to
shit without redband.

208
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,783
Okay.

209
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:57,951
All right.

210
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,170
Well now for some reason
it says Eddie Bravo.

211
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,190
I must have changed it.

212
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,390
I don't mind being Eddie Bravo.

213
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,781
Okay.

214
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,620
This is Eddie Bravo.

215
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,490
Now they used to,

216
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:04,631
well,

217
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,170

218
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,380
I'll be at the American comedy.

219
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,841

Just trying to see if this
thing is actually online.

238
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,870
It's kind of long eyelashes
and he's really flexible.

239
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,400
He can do impressions.

240
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,720
Nobody knows that.

241
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,900
Here's Joe Rogan.

242
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,670
He's really muscular.

243

out of your Gig this weekend.

262
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,150
Let's not do it here because
this is a only the commercial.

263
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,730
Let's do it.

264
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,790
A link to the podcast.

265
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,290
We're going to plug the fuck out of you,

266
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,124
son.

267
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

268
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,560
the Joe Rogan podcast.

269
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,400
What is it called?

270
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,100
The experience?

271
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,933
Something like that.

272
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:27,830
No.

273
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,880
What the fuck this is?

274
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,570
It's just,

275
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,830
it's why label it.

276
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,664
Do I have to label?

277
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,410
Maybe when I'm going to
not nit label them anymore.

278
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm going to stop calling
it the Joe Rogan experience,

279
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,140
but when I call my podcast,

280
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:37,280
the man thoughts,

281
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,200
the problem,

282
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,050
if you don't label it,

283
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,100
you can't sell tee shirts.

284
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,270
Well,

285
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,560
you got to make it bumper stick money,

286
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,370
dog.

287
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,560
You ain't got no label.

288
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,340
The label don't take man thoughts.

289
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:46,930
That's mine,

290
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,763
right man.

291
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,153
I like it.

292
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,930
It sounds powerful.

293
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm calling from Bryan County,

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,690
Exactly.

299
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,040

00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,461

Joe Rogan,

305
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,680

306
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,690
without sound on a 10 minute podcast.

307
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,010

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,220
We di we fucked around with the crowd.

317
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,330
You could watch the video of it.

318
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,010
I actually put the video of it on Youtube.

319
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:25,521
Oh yeah,

320
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,354

327
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,350
Anyway,

344
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,311
Mussel ropes,

345
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,390
and you take your own product.

346
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,161
So here,

347
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:54,994
here,

348
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,760
yeah,

349
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,593
there are those gentlemen,

350
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,583
dude,

351
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,970
I'd take it because it's awesome.

352
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,571
If they didn't,

353
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:00,980
if,

354
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,750
if they weren't my own
product that's still taking,

355
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,780
I'm addicted to it.

356
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,270
So is,

357
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,470
uh,

358
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,000
Lorenzo Fertitta owner,

359
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,451
the UFC.

360
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,560
He's addicted to this shit.

361
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,700
Every time he sees me he goes,

362
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:08,941
dude,

363
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,010
it's fucking Alpha brains.

364
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,650
Incredible.

365
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,780
Because when you fly around a lot,

366
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,410
why aren't things are happening?

367
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,430
I'm picking right now.

368
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,390
How many did you take for
God's for I'm a savage here.

369
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,224
An extremist.

370
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,560
I am a little bit right.

371
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,590
It might be a little crazy.

372
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,970
You're my canary in the coal mine.

373
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:25,921
Everything you do,

374
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:26,490
I'm always like,

375
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,323
is it safe

376
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,670
podcasts?

377
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,350
Is it safe?

378
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,230
I'll do it now.

379
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,010
Stand up.

380
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,843
I guess I'll try.

381
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,713
I'll do it again.

382
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,670
We'll talk about this later.

383
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,020
This is a fucking commercial,

384
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,740
Brian Calendar.

385
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:37,951
Sorry.

386
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,430
Sorry.

387
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,860
It's for God damn on a.com.

388
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,310
That's o.

389
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,910
N.

390
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,910
N.

391
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,910
I.

392
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,910
T.

393
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:42,990
Um,

394
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,610
and what is Alpha brain that I just took?

395
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:44,790
It's,

396
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,600
it's a,

397
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
it's a competent Tori
sort of a supplement.

398
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,130
It's all a bunch of different nootropics.

399
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,270
And what nootropics are is nutrients
that have been shown to have a positive

400
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,380
effect on brain function.

401
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,860
And you can take gold on at.com and
there is a plethora of information on the

402
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:04,830
subject and look at Google too cause it's
a controversial subject and you know,

403
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:07,140
some people are not into it and you know,

404
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:07,750
they don't want,

405
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,480
they don't want to believe
that supplements can help them.

406
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,350
And that's fine.

407
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:10,681
I'm not,

408
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,530
I am not pushing it on
anybody that's not interested.

409
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,550
But if you're a person
that does supplement your
vitamins into your person like

410
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,090
me,

411
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,700
who absolutely knows that
it affects your health,

412
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,481
it does.

413
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,930
I sometimes don't get enough
nutrients from my food.

414
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,831
You know,

415
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:30,300
in a perfect world we would all be
eating mineral rich vegetables and a,

416
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,210
we would all be getting the perfect amount
of water and we would all be having,

417
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,751
you know,

418
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,090
the best food ever and grass fed diet.

419
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,430
But the reality is it doesn't
always fucking work out that way.

420
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,300
And a lot of things get
affected by not supplementing.

421
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,841
Uh,

422
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:43,400
I think,

423
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,710
uh,

424
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,190
I have,

425
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,320
uh,

426
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,230
it is most certainly enhance my health
and the supplements that have been most

427
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:54,231
interested in are nootropics
and this along with a neuro one,

428
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,830
which is Bill Roman House keys formula.

429
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,090
That was the one I first discovered,

430
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,280
Dell Rom asking Greg
Gray middle linebacker.

431
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,300
He had problems with concussions
and he developed these,

432
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:03,720
uh,

433
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,150
this,

434
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,900
this series of supplements to aid himself.

435
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,320
Like it was his idea to eight himself
and I took a shit because a no name.

436
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,700
It was a radio DJ,

437
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:12,190
uh,

438
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,800
in San Francisco a few years back.

439
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,070
He was raving about this guy
and the formula was pretty,

440
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:17,904
pretty interesting.

441
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,990
Here's a little caffeine in it,

442
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,860
I believe.

443
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,220
Um,

444
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,580
which I didn't want in,

445
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,620
in Alpha brain.

446
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,011
You know,

447
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,750
I think caffeine is something
that's kind of tricky.

448
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:24,990
It,

449
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,330
it absolutely can help
your brain function,

450
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,480
but I don't think it should be
in anything unless it's obvious.

451
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,361
You know what I mean?

452
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,980
Like caffeine I think should be in coffee.

453
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,290
Caffeine should be an energy drink to
take something with a lot of caffeine.

454
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:34,860
And feel like,

455
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,071
wow,

456
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:35,940
this is what's working,

457
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,150
but you fuck up and you don't read the
label and you take it while you're taking

458
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:40,750
coffee and you have a
goddamn heart attack that,

459
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:40,950
Whoa,

460
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,290
that was what the Fed did.

461
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,961
Yeah.

462
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,291
Right.

463
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,840
A lot of those people
that are on diet pills.

464
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:46,260
Yeah.

465
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,950
All this stuff that we were,

466
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,110
we're talking about here at folks.

467
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:49,980
It's all vitamins.

468
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:51,360
It's nothing that you have to worry about.

469
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,410
Nothing that's dangerous.

470
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,140
And the thing was on it is we want to
make sure that nobody ever feels ripped

471
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:56,381
off.

472
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,940
So your first 30 pills,

473
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,620
it's a hundred percent
money back guarantee.

474
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,150
You don't even have to return the product.

475
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,630
That's how confident we are of the product
and we know that you're gonna enjoy

476
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:04,990
it.

477
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,823
And two,

478
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,740
how the ethics of this company is,

479
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,600
nobody wants anybody to feel ripped off.

480
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,830
We want to sell you the
best shit that we can find,

481
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,070
the best supplements as far as health
and athletic performance and the best

482
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,400
nutrients we can find,

483
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,740
the best late lifting
equipment that we can find.

484
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:24,880
We use Troy kettlebells.

485
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,990
They're the best in the world.

486
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,853
They're perfect.

487
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,071
The,

488
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,180
you can't get anything better.

489
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,590
They're the highest quality available.

490
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,810
They will fucking last
through the apocalypse.

491
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,040
You buy those bitches,

492
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:33,820
you're done.

493
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,421
You're done.

494
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,260
You have them forever.

495
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,630
They will never wear out their cast iron.

496
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,060
Fucking cannonballs awesome.

497
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,790
So this stuff is not cheap.

498
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,510
Um,

499
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,770
but we're selling it at the
most reasonable rate that
we can and we're trying to

500
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:51,520
provide everybody with the best
possible products that we can.

501
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,960
That's the ethics of on it.

502
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,610
And that's what we're all about.

503
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,240
Um,

504
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
and if you use a code name,

505
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,381
Rogan,

506
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,450
you will save 10% off all supplements.

507
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:58,931
All right.

508
00:12:58,931 --> 00:12:59,680
You dirty freaks.

509
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,280
Brian counts here and I
don't know how to turn it.

510
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,203
Musica

511
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,170
heavy guitars and wind
blowing my hair back.

512
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,420
It's the fucking park.

513
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,330
It's the Brian Collins on the
podcast with Joel Role Gum.

514
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,960
That was the,

515
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,730
that was a very interesting
way to answer right there.

516
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,040
Yeah.

517
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
That was like a brainiac.

518
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,700
It's like a gay Kenyan dance.

519
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,331
I'm bringing,

520
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:24,210
I'm bringing back some shift from
like the 70 [inaudible] if you cook,

521
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,500
if you cook and cast iron and it's an
excellent way of getting iron in your

522
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:28,860
diet,

523
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,490
which I didn't know.

524
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:29,941
Yes,

525
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:30,330
yes.

526
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,160
They say stakes in cast iron,

527
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,670
like you're seriously fast,

528
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,500
too much Ferris oxide and your
diet and you have to be careful.

529
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,000
So Tim Ferriss says in his book that a
lot of these guys will like actually take

530
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:45,780
a day and eat no iron to yes to
bring their iron levels down.

531
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
So there it is.

532
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,140
See Ferris is fascinating.

533
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,700
We've been going back and forth.

534
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,380
He's going to come back
on the podcast again.

535
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,641
Well let's do it.

536
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:54,181
Let's look it up.

537
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,140
He's a great guy.

538
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,540
I got to get him on cause
I had a conversation with
them after I read his book

539
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,290
and I loved him and it,

540
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,340
he just knows so much.

541
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,800
Yeah,

542
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,300
he's apparently got a lot of stuff cooking
and he's in the middle of writing a

543
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,134
book as well.

544
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,973
But uh,

545
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,311
man,

546
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,300
I love talking to him.

547
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,330
I just love talking to do's done that are
just filled with information like him.

548
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,150
Rob Wolf,

549
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,140
the Paleo solution author.

550
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,790
What was that like?

551
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,960
Fucking great.

552
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,210
You know,

553
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,960
because I'm reading the guys
filled with information.

554
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,980
It's controversial.

555
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,340
Well,

556
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,173
but I just,

557
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,090
I just read the China study
I talked to you about it,

558
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,060
which is about,

559
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,471
he's a very,

560
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:29,610
very credible science and he looks at
a lot of science says whole food plant

561
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:31,260
based whole food diet
is the best way to go.

562
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,930
Problem is that I think
like we talked about,

563
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,510
if you're doing sports
and lifting personally,

564
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,260
I went,

565
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,830
I went like about a week
eating just whole food,

566
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:41,664
plant based Diet.

567
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,961
I eat a steak.

568
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,630
The other day I wolfed it down.

569
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:46,411
I inhaled it.

570
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:46,591
I,

571
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,281
it was literally like,

572
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:48,114
I was like,

573
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,013
oh,

574
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,120
I made and I've never felt better.

575
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,580
I mean,

576
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,870
I just need some meat sometimes.

577
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,390
Don't think that you can have
the same diet for every person.

578
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:56,560
Right?

579
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,140
I don't think,

580
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,220
I don't think everybody needs,

581
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,780
I don't know why it needs a stake.

582
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,740
There's a lot of chicks out
there that don't need a stay.

583
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,900
They really don't.

584
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,300
There's a lot of dudes don't need to stay.

585
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,050
Jamie kills teens coming
on the podcast tomorrow.

586
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,040
He's a Vegan,

587
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,611
he's healthy,

588
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,444
he's happy,

589
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,261
and he loves it.

590
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,760
It's real fitness.

591
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,680
He does always constantly
doing martial arts,

592
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,550
Jujitsu and shit.

593
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,383
And he's a Vegan,

594
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,561
weighs eight pounds,

595
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,394
but he's a Vegan.

596
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,391
I'm not kidding.

597
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,140
He weighs eight pounds.

598
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,951
I always look at it.

599
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,480
I always like,

600
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,430
you can't find too many Olympic
athletes who are vegans.

601
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,150
Well,

602
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,881
Mac Dansik,

603
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,010
who's also going to do the podcast,

604
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:25,220
we,

605
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,240
we're going back and forth.

606
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,011
I love that dude.

607
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:27,800
He's a really,

608
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,940
really interesting guy.

609
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,890
He's a UFC fighter who's a Vegan
and he's also a photographer and a,

610
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:33,230
you know,

611
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,063
it works.

612
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,521
His,

613
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:36,290
his reasons are that he loves animals.

614
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,780
You know,

615
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,613
that's it.

616
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,960
And I respect that as well.

617
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,411
Look,

618
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:39,681
I,

619
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:39,921
uh,

620
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:40,830
I love animals too,

621
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:44,120
but there's a cycle of life and I
think factory farming is horrific,

622
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,650
but I think wild game,

623
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,090
I think that's where it's at.

624
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,290
I think in a perfect world,

625
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,490
we would buy meat from hunters and
that would be a new fucking industry.

626
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,380
We'd have to make sure that
people were at poaching,

627
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,820
buy meat from hunters.

628
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,080
I think she'd be able to hunt a lot of
them because deer are fucking everywhere.

629
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:00,950
The idea that there's a,

630
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,220
they're glorify cows too and we could
grow more of them too by the way.

631
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,810
We can grow more of them,

632
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,860
but my point is when they're wild and
they're running around and then you just

633
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,753
hunt them and killed them.

634
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:11,270
The,

635
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,380
I think first of all that it's the whole
thing is way more humane because they

636
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:16,610
live the real life.

637
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,960
They lived a real life.

638
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:18,411
That is,

639
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:18,740
no,

640
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,300
the deer's never lived a better life.

641
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,490
They have one life that
life forge for food,

642
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,690
stay alive if you do that,

643
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,200
you've won.

644
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,651
They're also,

645
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,131
by the way,

646
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:25,850
they're also,

647
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,680
they are food in the wild and
one of the things that are,

648
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,790
that's why they're there.

649
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,400
What are they?

650
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,961
Joseph Campbell.

651
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:30,860
All I said that one of the,

652
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,650
one of the problems with my original,

653
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,620
the original sort of peoples in their
mythology was that date they would look

654
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,750
around in nature and
realize it life eight life.

655
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,220
And if you look at a lot of like,

656
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:40,670
uh,

657
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,170
whether it's native Americans or whatever,

658
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,780
the tradition of killing animals,

659
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,070
they were always fairly,

660
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,910
most cultures were always fairly
very uneasy with killing an animal,

661
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,130
which is why when you killed an animal,

662
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,480
there was a ritual around that.

663
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,300
There was usually prayer said there
were rituals because human beings,

664
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:56,601
we're like,

665
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,590
they felt the connection.

666
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:57,741
Yeah,

667
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,260
we're taking it were to end when you
actually have to kill something with a

668
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:03,830
spear or a bow and Arrow or a knife and
you feel its heartbeat and you smell

669
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,530
that animal and that's,

670
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,340
that's very intimate and it's very,

671
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,240
it's physically intimate.

672
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,050
It's very,

673
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,610
and almost all,

674
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,510
almost all original or aboriginal cultures
had all of that I can think of had a

675
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,310
sort of a ritual around that.

676
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:20,121
They would say prayers.

677
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,360
They do all kinds of things
because it makes sense.

678
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,820
What we've become is so
removed from our food.

679
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,130
We're so removed with
factory farming and things,

680
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:28,911
it feeds a lot of people,

681
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,320
gets a lot of protein and people,

682
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,790
people don't go hungry anymore.

683
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,350
I always remind people 30 years,

684
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,041
30 years ago,

685
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,810
I mean half of half of India,

686
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,840
China went through major famines,

687
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,501
uh,

688
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:41,120
and certainly most of Africa.

689
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,260
But now that's,

690
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,420
that's becoming more and
more a relic of the past.

691
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,770
It's because we've become very efficient
at getting food to a maximum number of

692
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:49,230
people.

693
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,063
But there's,

694
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
there's a huge disconnection.

695
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,990
Yeah.

696
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,700
So when you eat a pig,

697
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,190
when you eat bacon that's
been in an a gestation crate,

698
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:56,851
you know,

699
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,770
and goes crazy cause
it's chewing on the bars.

700
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
You're not really thinking about it,

701
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:00,151
man.

702
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm just,

703
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,380
I'm just hungry.

704
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,580
You're not thinking it's a pig.

705
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,050
You're thinking it's just a piece of Ham.

706
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,750
We've actually given these
really euphemistic names to,

707
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:07,320
uh,

708
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,800
meet.

709
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,670
Having said that.

710
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,560
Yeah,

711
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,011
it is.

712
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:11,261
We,

713
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:11,471
we,

714
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,320
we do that beef ham,

715
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,190
you know,

716
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,020
you don't think of feel veal.

717
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,230
If you ever go to a farm though and you
were like playing around with the lambs

718
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,460
and the goats and fucking,

719
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:21,750
I mean and playing around them,

720
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,651
but you start to,

721
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:23,520
you get kind of,

722
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:23,860
you,

723
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,450
you realize,

724
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:24,961
oh wow man,

725
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:25,681
that thing is a living,

726
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:30,270
breathing creature that is reacting
to me and reacting to its environment.

727
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,420
Lock this door.

728
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,951
I forgot the lock.

729
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:32,760
This door keep talking.

730
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,001
Yeah.

731
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:33,391
And it's,

732
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:33,691
it's,

733
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:34,524
it's a,

734
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,900
it's an interesting thing you,

735
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,310
if you talk to farmers
who are round animals,

736
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,450
they're there.

737
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,050
They're very,

738
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,050
very tuned and keyed into animals and
nature on a way that most of us are not.

739
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,070
They just have to be,

740
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,620
they're very aware of the cycles
are very aware of all the things.

741
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,970
You talked to dairy farmers,

742
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,000
there was a mad cow scare and this,

743
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,460
this woman was being interviewed because
they had to kill all our cows in front

744
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,210
of her.

745
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,901
And then they had the burden,

746
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,501
the cows that was,

747
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,630
that was a government policy
and Britain at the time,

748
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:01,110
cause it's,

749
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,351
you know,

750
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,700
these premiums were very dangerous.

751
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,541
So they took the,

752
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:08,160
took out the whole heart and she was
so devastated because she got to,

753
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,630
she knows she knew her cows.

754
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,880
She had every one of her cows.

755
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,980
She knew how to its own personality,

756
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,920
had its own name and she had her
own relationship with it for me.

757
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,840
I went to fucking cow really?

758
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,880
And it was devastating for her.

759
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,490
She was going to butcher those
cows where they dairy cows?

760
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:23,761
No,

761
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:27,510
one of them had mad cow disease and
they they in the law at the time,

762
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,620
this is about 10 years ago,

763
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,390
they had to put down the whole hurt.

764
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
Was she raising these cows for butchering?

765
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:33,710
No,

766
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,590
of the dairy.

767
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,760
They were dairy cows and
they were also there.

768
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,760
I believe some of them were
for butchering as well.

769
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,190
But this was a dairy
farm for the most part.

770
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,560
So did they feed the cows?

771
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,930
Fucked up things that they
feed them like cow me.

772
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,011
What the,

773
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,110
apparently what happened with,

774
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,140
with the development of these prions
in the central nervous systems of cows.

775
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,890
I'm not a scientist,

776
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:56,820
but that from what I read,

777
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,130
I remember you could eat a,

778
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,940
if you had a cow that had mad cow disease,

779
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,010
it wasn't eating the muscle
meat that fucked you up.

780
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,740
It was when you ate the brain.

781
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,360
Yeah.

782
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,011
The brain tissue,

783
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,790
spinal cord.

784
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,310
And they would ground that up into
hot dogs and things like that.

785
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,290
And you can take those prions,

786
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,490
they're called preop I think.

787
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,350
And you can heat them up to 500 degrees
and they still don't die and you can

788
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:17,610
still get the mad cow disease.

789
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:18,151
So you can't,

790
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:18,890
it's not the stairs.

791
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,510
You can't stay more
than a thousand degrees.

792
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,344
It's crazy.

793
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,220
And,

794
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,053
and so,

795
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,390
um,

796
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:29,390
apparently that came from the fact that
you had cows cannibalizing their own

797
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,110
tissue because when you slaughter cows,

798
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,610
there are certain parts I guess,

799
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:33,900
that you don't necessarily need.

800
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,840
You take 5% of that and you put it
into the slop and they'll eat it.

801
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:37,171
They were doing,

802
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,670
I was chicken fucked up.

803
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,780
It's become illegal now.

804
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,750
What's fucked up about it as
if they could do with pigs.

805
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,740
That's okay.

806
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,020
Pigs actually are omnivores,

807
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,033
but you do it.

808
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,980
Cows like

809
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,040
you're just jacking his whole system.

810
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,710
Is that the reason you don't want an
animal cannibalizing itself is because it,

811
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,250
it,

812
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,100
it leads to these really weird pathogens.

813
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,460
These [inaudible] actually
in the book of Leviticus,

814
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,560
which regions are private,

815
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,390
I think it's called preamps,

816
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,621
but the,

817
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:02,860
the,

818
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,111
the,

819
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:05,470
the book of Leviticus you were
talking about in your show.

820
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,820
The video is actually,

821
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:08,140
um,

822
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,250
a book in the Old Testament.

823
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:13,330
That route goes into really stark detail
about what you can eat and what you

824
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,164
can't.

825
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,921
And in,

826
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,300
in the Old Testament,

827
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,820
they always talk about the fact
that you can't eat animals of prey.

828
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,080
You can't eat a,

829
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,870
so you can't eat a leopard or an Osprey,

830
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,321
uh,

831
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,190
an eagle,

832
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:24,671
a hawk.

833
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:25,450
Why?

834
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,760
Because those animals eat
other animal protein and you,

835
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,710
you still don't find
people eating leopard meat.

836
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,900
Even in the mountain lions,

837
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,840
I think actually bear and stuff like that.

838
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,860
But you wouldn't do it.

839
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,850
There's a reason we don't,

840
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,151
it's,

841
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:40,841
it's a rarity.

842
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,201
And we say,

843
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,390
I think they do because for the most part,

844
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:45,490
no culture is ever eaten the protein.

845
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
I except for fish,

846
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,790
but a lot of animals
that eat other animals,

847
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,511
apparently it's not.

848
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:50,920
Apparently it's not healthy,

849
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,140
but we kind of make sense
if you think about it.

850
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,620
Yeah.

851
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,453
Well it's also,

852
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,001
they're probably,

853
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,170
they probably taste creepy.

854
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,720
Yeah,

855
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,181
I've heard,

856
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:01,480
I've heard that when you eat
bear meat until really oily,

857
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,660
really like Gamion oily bears.

858
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:06,220
Bears are mostly her before it's actually,

859
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:07,480
unless you're talking about polar bears,

860
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,520
which are complete and meat eaters.

861
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah.

862
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,530
We were actually just talking about this,

863
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,460
about going hunting.

864
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,340
We're saying that I didn't want,

865
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:17,170
Steve Rinella asked me to go hunting with
them to go bear hunting and I'm like,

866
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,520
I don't want to kill a bear man.

867
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,450
I don't want to eat it.

868
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,313
I don't want to have,

869
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,150
if it's not something
that I really want to eat,

870
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,320
like I like venison.

871
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,183
I'll kill a deer.

872
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,700
Venison.

873
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,020
I like die mouth waters.

874
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,900
My Dad and I went to to uh,

875
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,943
Alaska.

876
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,300
Okay to go hunt bear.

877
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,661
He goes,

878
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:32,261
I want to hunt bear.

879
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:32,620
I go,

880
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,550
I'm not hunting bear.

881
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,150
He goes,

882
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,690
why not?

883
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,230
I go,

884
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,591
well,

885
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:36,670
because I don't want to kill a bear.

886
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:36,821
Oh,

887
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,451
and by the way,

888
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:38,284
either do you,

889
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,280
somebody talked him into it.

890
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,910
He goes,

891
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,230
well I'm talking about guy.

892
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:41,831
I go,

893
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:42,670
well what do you do?

894
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,720
He had already bought a rifle.

895
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:44,501
That's how susceptible.

896
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:44,771
He's like,

897
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:45,191
the guy was like,

898
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,024
well come by,

899
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,080
I'll pile rifle.

900
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:48,160
He bought like literally like a,

901
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,700
like a $12,000 rifle.

902
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,130
Some crazy with the scope and everything.

903
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,900
So we go there and I go,

904
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:53,980
I'll go to Alaska with you,

905
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,880
but we'll go fishing.

906
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,240
He goes,

907
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,110
I'll call you right back.

908
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,650
Cause man,

909
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:56,861
yeah,

910
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:57,310
you're right.

911
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,220
I don't want to kill a barrier.

912
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,260
Let's go fishing.

913
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,750
So he buys a crazy amount
of fishing equipment.

914
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:02,141
We go there.

915
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:02,951
We didn't catch one fish,

916
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,010
not one fucking fish.

917
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,033
We're not fishermen.

918
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,510
We lost all the lures.

919
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,460
We literally lost all
knew how to tie knots.

920
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't know how to do any of it.

921
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,320
And it might say,

922
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,190
just took chances.

923
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,060
Like we went out there,

924
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:14,140
we paid all this money for this guy.

925
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,010
The guy who comes back,

926
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:15,671
good knots,

927
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:15,961
man,

928
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,600
the guy,

929
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,890
the guy comes back and he goes,

930
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,710
we go,

931
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,200
we don't have any more lures.

932
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,040
And he goes,

933
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,820
but you had all the thing.

934
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,300
He goes,

935
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,560
yeah,

936
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,500
we lost him.

937
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,070
He goes,

938
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,580
what do you mean?

939
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,550
We were casting over
the lake into the trees.

940
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,020
He literally goes like this.

941
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,530
He goes,

942
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,221
how'd you lose?

943
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,800
All the Lords were like,

944
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,883
oh,

945
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,450
we never caught one fish.

946
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,571
And then he'd say,

947
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:35,861
he goes,

948
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,060
I want to cite my rifle.

949
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:37,361
This was,

950
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,530
he brings his rifle,

951
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
I want to cite it.

952
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:41,860
So the former marine
wants to sight his rifle.

953
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:44,110
So he lies down and showing
us how to shoot prong.

954
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:44,650
Right.

955
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,080
Problem.

956
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,500
When you,

957
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,070
when you're in the marines,

958
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,130
you're shooting military weapons,

959
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:49,910
they don't have the kind of recoil that
a three 70 or whenever the fuck it was,

960
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,160
I can kill an elk from half a mile away.

961
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,720
So he's like,

962
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,750
he's got his face right up
against the scope and he's like,

963
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,613
all right here.

964
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,131
And I'm like,

965
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:58,941
right behind him,

966
00:23:58,941 --> 00:23:59,270
right?

967
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,601
And I'm like,

968
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,320
all right,

969
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,220
I'm going to shoot that log.

970
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,054
I go do it.

971
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,500
So I'm right behind him and I don't know
if you've ever heard a fucking elephant

972
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,210
gun go off when you're close to it.

973
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,780
Oh,

974
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,940
it was so loud that I Prac,

975
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,710
I think I shat my pants a little bit,

976
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,410
like a little duty,

977
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,240
flatter mass.

978
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,110
My face,

979
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,420
the sound like hit where
it was like a fire stick.

980
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,531
I'm,

981
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:18,790
and I was like [inaudible] he,

982
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,180
so he goes to shoot and he goes,

983
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,931
he shoots,

984
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:22,310
I'm right behind him and it was so loud.

985
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,910
I went,

986
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,743
Jesus,

987
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,113
he hit me.

988
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,420
I fall back on my ass.

989
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,620
He looks up,

990
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,800
he's got this really deep around cut in
his eye because the scope came back and

991
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:34,490
hit him in the eye.

992
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,550
So for the rest of the
fuck that Alaska trip,

993
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,700
we're walking around like a couple
of losers don't stand next to me Bro.

994
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,350
You look like such a fucking tourist.

995
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,930
He has this huge around,

996
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,250
is I like a half a raccoon?

997
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,090
That is a lie.

998
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,990
I don't know who that guy is.

999
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:48,751
I know he looks like me,

1000
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:49,790
but he ain't my dad and I'm like,

1001
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,030
how are you supposed to shoot that
through the scoby supposed to back way up.

1002
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,171
Yeah,

1003
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:54,890
you fuck,

1004
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,550
I don't know.

1005
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,220
I've to three 70 or whatever it,

1006
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,220
you just have to brace it.

1007
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,450
You've gotta to you've to brace it better.

1008
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:02,540
I shot at six times and I couldn't shoot
it any more because I literally don't

1009
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,650
have the meat and my shoulder.

1010
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,400
It hurt that bad.

1011
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,910
Jesus like the kick is that bad
and one of the tricks you do,

1012
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:10,250
but when you don't have your plugs is
keep your mouth open when you should've

1013
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,620
gotten that loud because it will cause
the sound has somewhere to go steak

1014
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,640
rookies make as they
keep their mouth closed.

1015
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,270
Really?

1016
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,710
I see you keep your mouth open
and loose and I'm sorry life.

1017
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,920
We supposed to keep your mouth.

1018
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,911
That's I was told by the way,

1019
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:23,691
any soldiers out there,

1020
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,021
I don't know,

1021
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,370
maybe I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about,

1022
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,960
but that's what the guy told me.

1023
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,790
This guy named Swede and he said,

1024
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,630
keep your mouth open.

1025
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,141
That's how you do it.

1026
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:31,460
Cause he was shooting no problem.

1027
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:31,701
I was like,

1028
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,840
doesn't that hurt it?

1029
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,681
The sound was so loud.

1030
00:25:33,681 --> 00:25:35,020
It hurt my face for getting my ears.

1031
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,370
It's crazy to take it to
like a level like that.

1032
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,080
It's like the,

1033
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,000
they get guns to the point where
you get to like the 50 caliber,

1034
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:41,141
right?

1035
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:41,810
Like what are you doing?

1036
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,171
What do you do?

1037
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:42,470
I'll do,

1038
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,580
what the hell are you doing?

1039
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,430
I want to kill something from a mile away.

1040
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,283
It's anymore.

1041
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,530
This isn't like a,

1042
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,100
I mean that's like some army shit.

1043
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,650
Like why?

1044
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,130
Why is a regular person
buying so army shit.

1045
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,070
That's when you get a,

1046
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:54,410
when you get one of those high powered,

1047
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,221
the hunting rifles,

1048
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,054
it's to kill an elk.

1049
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,620
Do you think half a mile away,

1050
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,300
you know with this a raging gun
control debate in this country,

1051
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,900
do you think that there's any,

1052
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,530
there's any possible way you
could make this a safe world?

1053
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,280
Here's why.

1054
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,160
Here's what I always say about gun control
is what I talk about with my standup.

1055
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,271
Speaking of which,

1056
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:19,170
I'll be at the American
comedy club this weekend,

1057
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,001
Thursday,

1058
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:20,580
Friday,

1059
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:20,580
Saturday.

1060
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,770
That's down in San Diego.

1061
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,940
San Diego,

1062
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,331
Thursday,

1063
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,800
Friday and Saturday.

1064
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:25,251
That's right.

1065
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,084
Shit,

1066
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,800
I can't win.

1067
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,130
[inaudible] club by the way.

1068
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,990
We did a desk quad show there.

1069
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:32,930
We had a fucking great
time and we did a weekend.

1070
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:34,430
We did two shows and doing all new stuff.

1071
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm excited about my new hour,

1072
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:36,500
but,

1073
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,610
but one of the things I always say,

1074
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:37,960
my stance,

1075
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,190
what,

1076
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,260
what was the thing I
was talking about with,

1077
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:43,160
with gun control is gun control
in this country in my opinion,

1078
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,390
will never work in,

1079
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:45,780
in,

1080
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,640
in terms of what people
are calling for it.

1081
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:49,740
Because I think that men like their guns,

1082
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,420
not because they're
shiny and they go boom.

1083
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,650
I actually really believe most
men own guns because it's the,

1084
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,070
it's,

1085
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,210
it's for them.

1086
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,290
It's certainly for me,

1087
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,930
a feeling that at least
I can protect my family.

1088
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:04,500
If the shit hits the fan because a golf
club or a sharp stick ain't gonna do it.

1089
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,630
I want an arsenal in case,

1090
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,570
and I think most men go
when a politician says,

1091
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,920
and they have good points,

1092
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,880
but if a politician says,

1093
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,590
we want to take your gun away,

1094
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,300
Americans in particular go,

1095
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,420
I don't fucking item that because you're
not going to be there when somebody

1096
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,040
tries to break in my house
at four in the morning,

1097
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,090
I could call nine one one but the feeling
of a phone in my hand versus my Mazda

1098
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
20 gauge,

1099
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,441
you know,

1100
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,101
pump action,

1101
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,780
shotgun feels a lot better to me.

1102
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,030
The real problem is
that guns are out there.

1103
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,923
That's the real problem.

1104
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,820
Guys didn't exist.

1105
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,920
Then you have an ego and
be a different issue.

1106
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,520
But here's where the debate actually
lies for me after this terrible tragedy

1107
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:39,480
with the Batman thing,

1108
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,220
I do think,

1109
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,720
and the Nri Ras,

1110
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,250
from what I can understand,

1111
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,360
isn't that cooperative with us.

1112
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,420
I do think there's a debate to be
had about the lethality of weapons.

1113
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:51,480
Do you need a drum that
holds a hundred rounds?

1114
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,343
I don't think so.

1115
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,010
Do you need a fucking elephant coming?

1116
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,740
Right?

1117
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,720
I don't think that you necessarily need
an assault weapon that goes through a

1118
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:00,360
car engine or goes through a building.

1119
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,051
But you know what,

1120
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:03,390
all the law abiding people out there,

1121
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,140
like my friend Anthony [inaudible] from
the opiate Anthony shows a gun nut.

1122
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
Why shouldn't he be allowed to have?

1123
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:09,000
Well,

1124
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,370
it doesn't bother me at all that he,

1125
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,730
I just want guns and I,

1126
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,360
I'm,

1127
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,661
you know,

1128
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,111
I agree.

1129
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:13,321
I mean,

1130
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:16,110
I wondered then the other
dependency is a 50 caliber Jesus.

1131
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,940
He has one of those and things.

1132
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,781
I don't know.

1133
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,141
I mean,

1134
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:19,331
I,

1135
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,990
I think that there was a politician on,

1136
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,640
he said this about it and
it was really kind of,

1137
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:23,190
he was honest.

1138
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,881
It was really interesting.

1139
00:28:23,881 --> 00:28:24,360
He said,

1140
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,130
what can we do about these mad men?

1141
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,180
And he said,

1142
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,900
unfortunately in a society like ours
that's free and as big as we are,

1143
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,680
you can't ultimately do
anything about alone.

1144
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,281
Crazy,

1145
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:38,700
demented human being who is
whatever he has schizophrenia.

1146
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,950
I think though the debate lies,

1147
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,210
can you though create a situation
where you can keep very lethal,

1148
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,170
um,

1149
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:46,860
uh,

1150
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,330
efficient weapons,

1151
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,100
like machine guns out of their hands?

1152
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,440
That seems to be the debate.

1153
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,711
I mean,

1154
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,240
I don't think you're
ever going to stop crazy.

1155
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:55,890
He's from getting guns
and shooting people,

1156
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,993
but I,

1157
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,100
it'd be nice if they got just a glock as
opposed to a an ar 1415 with a drum of

1158
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:03,580
a hundred route.

1159
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,830
No,

1160
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,460
this is where the conspiracy theory kicks
in is we're all these people believe

1161
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:12,840
that the government has brainwashed people
like this joker guy to go and commit

1162
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,640
these things so they can clamp down on
gun control and that when you he see what

1163
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:20,220
does this Eric Holder and
you see like first of all,

1164
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,250
the nonsense of them selling illegal
guns to Mexico and having those guns be

1165
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,030
used on American border
patrol agents and murder.

1166
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,560
They're retarded.

1167
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,161
That was actually,

1168
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:32,641
it comes out,

1169
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,230
it's actually a way to track weapons,

1170
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:34,650
you know,

1171
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,200
attract whatever they sold guns bad.

1172
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,740
I think that is the dumbest
idea in the history of dumb.

1173
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,220
I don't know the details,

1174
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,330
but does it sound very well?

1175
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:44,410
Alex Jones of course,

1176
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,670
put your tinfoil hat on,

1177
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,730
believes that they did that
shit on purpose and they're
making money off of it.

1178
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:51,490
And they wrapped it up in in a ridiculous,

1179
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,070
completely implausible plot,

1180
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,800
like a completely implausible plan.

1181
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,470
The problem with a guy
like Alex Jones Johnson,

1182
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,100
my opinion is whenever you
talk about the government,

1183
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,610
the government is so diversified
with so many different interests.

1184
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:05,190
There are so many people that actually
are against gun control and government

1185
00:30:05,191 --> 00:30:06,120
and passionate about it.

1186
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,270
There are a lot of people in government
that are very for gun control.

1187
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,600
I think there's a lot of debate even
within the U s army and the army and the

1188
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:16,380
FBI and the CIA about what we should
do with our w about everything.

1189
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,650
I think you're misunderstanding
his tone though.

1190
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,900
What he saying is it's a much more
sinister thing than the government itself.

1191
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,550
What he's talking about is like the world
banks and the new world order getting

1192
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:32,551
together and physically engineering a
situation where they can clamp down on

1193
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:36,430
people to take away their guns because
they're worried about the economy going

1194
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:38,460
into the toilet and then you know when,

1195
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,230
when they're passing things like it is.

1196
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,681
It is.

1197
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:42,460
However,

1198
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,100
when they're passing things like the,

1199
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:45,310
the NDA,

1200
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,031
when they pass,

1201
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:49,450
things like that and you realize what
well they are slowly but steadily taking

1202
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,570
our rights away in a
place in a time where the,

1203
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:52,811
you know,

1204
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:53,860
it's really not necessary.

1205
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,900
This is where there is
no personal attacks.

1206
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,561
I mean there's no,

1207
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:58,210
there's no tax going on here in America.

1208
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,680
I didn't need to,

1209
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,440
I,

1210
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,040
I agree with you on that but I think
it's a little bit more insidious and a

1211
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,020
little bit more subtle than that.

1212
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:10,100
I actually think that that it's kind of
what the founding fathers warned about a

1213
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:10,940
long time ago.

1214
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,270
A lot of times human beings will invent
laws that take their own power away in

1215
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:20,690
the name of things like safety in
the name of look at the Patriot Act,

1216
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,110
right?

1217
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,440
You know,

1218
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,210
those kinds of things
where before you know it,

1219
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,680
there is um,

1220
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,230
there is a fire and I keep
telling you about this.

1221
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:27,951
My father,

1222
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:31,280
I did a podcast with my dad on
the Bryan County jail and he,

1223
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:33,770
he was talking about how he spent
a lot of time in government.

1224
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:34,630
A lot of time down there.

1225
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:35,960
I walked how it really works.

1226
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,000
It's not that politicians are bad.

1227
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:38,930
It's not that you know,

1228
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,130
Republicans or Democrats,

1229
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,570
a lot of people have good ideas.

1230
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,500
They're trying to get shit done.

1231
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:43,600
Obama's not a soldier.

1232
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,970
It's it's governments in
the business of intent,

1233
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,500
you're in the business of intent.

1234
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:48,950
You have an,

1235
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,290
you have a law and you have an intention.

1236
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,770
The problem when you have an intention
is that there's so many different

1237
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:59,240
interests that you have to appease
to get that law whole and passed.

1238
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,660
And what happens is what you intended
usually has other consequences,

1239
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:06,230
which would make sense.

1240
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,740
And I think what we have to worry about
is like what you're talking about,

1241
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,090
where we start losing our own power,

1242
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,800
but it's almost like it happens.

1243
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,770
It happens without us even realizing it.

1244
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,530
Like you pass a law that
seems to be a good law.

1245
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,870
It has other unintended consequences,

1246
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,351
right?

1247
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:26,090
And whenever you do anything that
compromises people's freedom and liberty,

1248
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,510
right?

1249
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,410
Then you have to say,

1250
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:27,561
well,

1251
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:29,360
what is the end game in this?

1252
00:32:29,361 --> 00:32:31,640
Because this seems like
even in the name of safety,

1253
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:34,340
you're going to clamp down on freedom
and liberty and safety isn't going to be

1254
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:35,330
worth nearly as much.

1255
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,920
You have to really look at that.

1256
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,120
My,

1257
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,331
my,

1258
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,170
my father was talking about corporations.

1259
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,040
He at one point

1260
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,840
ran the biggest investment
bank in the world.

1261
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,470
He knows a little bit.

1262
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,530
It was an amazing podcast.

1263
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,781
A lot of people really,

1264
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:45,440
really enjoyed it.

1265
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,310
I was so proud of it.

1266
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:46,451
It's,

1267
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:46,641
it's,

1268
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:47,301
you can get it on,

1269
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:47,601
on,

1270
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:47,910
uh,

1271
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,720
on Brian callen.com or
if I wasn't so selfish,

1272
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,530
I would listen to it.

1273
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:51,861
Yeah.

1274
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:52,101
Well,

1275
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:52,311
no,

1276
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,480
I did this.

1277
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:56,210
I think you'd really like
them cause he soaks fair.

1278
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:56,730
He's so,

1279
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,290
he's so,

1280
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,360
he's so he's just about personal liberty,

1281
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:02,000
but he also understands that he's
very moderate about that stuff.

1282
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,690
But,

1283
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,380
um,

1284
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,681
you know,

1285
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:03,851
he's,

1286
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,090
he's somebody who,

1287
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:05,540
who,

1288
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,740
who talks about,

1289
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,574
for example,

1290
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,740
whatever your intention,

1291
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,850
whatever your intention
as government grows and,

1292
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:15,050
and both sides of responsible Democrats,

1293
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:15,681
Republicans,

1294
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:15,921
it's,

1295
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:16,754
it's human.

1296
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,510
As a government grows with
tax revenue or whatever it is,

1297
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,340
what happens with corporations,

1298
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,330
they behave just like you.

1299
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:23,811
And I would,

1300
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:26,750
which is why I got a lobby,

1301
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,381
my government,

1302
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:31,250
so I can get a favorable outcome here
because everybody else is doing it.

1303
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,750
So pretty soon you've got
everybody feeding out of or
influencing the government

1304
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:36,584
trough.

1305
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,150
It's just how you can't do
business otherwise you can't
be in business as a bank

1306
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,360
without having very strong
ties to the government.

1307
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,380
You can't,

1308
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,640
you just can't.

1309
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,230
And there in lies the argument.

1310
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:51,020
So no matter what you say,

1311
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,340
yes you need government.

1312
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,120
Yes,

1313
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,560
there are good ideas out there,

1314
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,370
you know?

1315
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,280
But just be aware that regardless,

1316
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,420
the bigger it gets,

1317
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,130
even if its intentions are good,

1318
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,930
you're going to have,

1319
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,070
you're going to lose.

1320
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:04,941
The argument goes,

1321
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,770
you're going to lose
some of your liberties.

1322
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,873
You're just going to,

1323
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,760
that seems at least to
be what history says.

1324
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:15,710
And it seems to be that it's so easy
to let something grow completely

1325
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,240
unnecessarily out of control.

1326
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,230
If you wanted to,

1327
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:21,920
you could micromanage every single
aspect of society in order to create new

1328
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:22,754
jobs.

1329
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,860
If you wanted to create new jobs
and give more people the work of,

1330
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,150
you know,

1331
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,430
well they'll look what we were just
talking about this this weekend,

1332
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:36,910
not explain to me how in any
way making hemp weed marijuana,

1333
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:40,880
illegal marijuana is illegal.

1334
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:44,540
You and I were hanging out at a bar
this weekend and I remember I said,

1335
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,370
and there was somebody acting
up and they were drunk.

1336
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,660
And I said that I've never been
bothered by a pothead like that.

1337
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:50,960
Right.

1338
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,171
But,

1339
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:52,820
but it's always somebody
who's drinking now.

1340
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:55,340
Alcohol causes way more damage.

1341
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:58,070
We all know the story and clearly,

1342
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,731
but why?

1343
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,361
Why is,

1344
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:02,420
why is marijuana so why are those laws,

1345
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:04,880
those federal laws so difficult to repeal?

1346
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,360
Well,

1347
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,021
I'll tell you why.

1348
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:06,770
In my opinion,

1349
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,940
and it goes back to what you brought up.

1350
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,720
There's a lot of money and enforcing
a lot of money and enforcing,

1351
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,190
enforcing marijuana laws.

1352
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,970
There's a lot,

1353
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,590
a lot of money.

1354
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,080
Yes.

1355
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,000
Talk to talk to the DA.

1356
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,451
You,

1357
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,180
you've got a lot of people
whose jobs depend on this stuff.

1358
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,130
It's not anybody's fault.

1359
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,300
It's what happens,

1360
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:23,600
Matt.

1361
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:23,870
Yep.

1362
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,830
We are all,

1363
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,660
anytime you have a critique of somebody,

1364
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:29,360
just realize that if you were in their
position you'd probably be the same

1365
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,380
goddamn way.

1366
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,640
You hopefully not.

1367
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:33,080
But that's what happens.

1368
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,680
That's why we need clear cut laws to
protect people from their own instincts to

1369
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:37,770
protect natured.

1370
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:38,250
For you,

1371
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,260
a person who's outside of it objectively
looking at the situation from a,

1372
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,080
you know,

1373
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,730
a a knowledgeable point of view,

1374
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,180
you can sort of engineer
what is and what isn't legal.

1375
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,670
We have to avoid this
so you can't take money.

1376
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,020
We have to avoid that.

1377
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,070
So you can't do this,

1378
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:53,881
you know,

1379
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:58,200
and unless you stick by
some well thought rules,

1380
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:58,981
it's on like,

1381
00:35:58,981 --> 00:35:59,400
you know,

1382
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
you need a scaffolding for humanity to
grow on and when you give people power

1383
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,600
with no scaffolding,

1384
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,891
I never,

1385
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:11,460
I never arguing more about a lot
democratic or republican platform.

1386
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,270
I never do that.

1387
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,190
Not My argument always
centers on one thing,

1388
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:15,480
which is hey look,

1389
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,800
you got your political point of view.

1390
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,030
That's great criticisms that we
all agree we need some government.

1391
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,040
You just need some government.

1392
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:22,140
Yeah,

1393
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,880
we need some moral boundaries.

1394
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,160
We need some engineering of our culture.

1395
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,360
You need law and order,

1396
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:28,111
you need roads,

1397
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:28,410
you need,

1398
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,970
but we need way less than we had.

1399
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,181
Well,

1400
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:30,571
there you go.

1401
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:33,270
And so then the question becomes
how much less do we need?

1402
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,163
A lot less.

1403
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
And that's where the debate should,

1404
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,320
that's what we should talk about.

1405
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,340
Why and why?

1406
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:41,610
What is the objective to
preserve personal freedom?

1407
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,391
Liberty,

1408
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,270
if they had less laws and more cops would,

1409
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,100
the world would be a way better place.

1410
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,150
And if the cops were paid better
and treated better by people,

1411
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,850
if more people got their shit together.

1412
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:57,300
So it didn't look at the
cop as like someone is going
to come and arrest you for

1413
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,500
doing shitty things.

1414
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,210
Just don't be doing shitty things.

1415
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:00,420
Right.

1416
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,871
If we,

1417
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:05,871
if we could figure out a way to
elevate our society to the next level,

1418
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,511
you know,

1419
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:08,010
I think that could be a way,

1420
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:08,820
you know,

1421
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,320
I was just reading an article
about my thoughts of a competency,

1422
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,173
like,

1423
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,770
like a security person,

1424
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:14,640
like a friend.

1425
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,680
Like let's put it this way.

1426
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,750
Instead of thinking of cops as like,

1427
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:23,160
someone is coming to bus to
you or someone's going to
take your shit if you had

1428
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,080
good cops in a community.

1429
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,880
It's like if you had a fucking fort and
your buddy was the guy lied to watch the

1430
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,440
door with a gun because there's,

1431
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:31,921
there's,

1432
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:32,700
you know,

1433
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,950
crazy Indians or who knows
what the fuck could happen.

1434
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,940
You need that.

1435
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,470
Like that shit is very important.

1436
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:38,550
You have to have some of the garden,

1437
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:39,384
the wall.

1438
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,110
And it did.

1439
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,790
Somewhere along the line it stopped being
that and it became an us versus them,

1440
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,390
the society versus the cops.

1441
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,590
I do think though that,

1442
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:48,860
that,

1443
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,260
um,

1444
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,430
a lot of police forces that's not
lost on a lot of cops and a lot of,

1445
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:53,700
uh,

1446
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,660
a lot of the brass,

1447
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,680
for example,

1448
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,060
and in New York,

1449
00:37:57,061 --> 00:38:01,260
I just read an article that crime
is down since the 90s by 80%.

1450
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,150
That's amazing.

1451
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,983
Isn't cool.

1452
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,630
And mostly mostly in black
and Hispanic neighborhoods.

1453
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,630
Mostly Giuliani came in
and just cut the bullshit.

1454
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:12,960
And it was Bratton and their
notion of a quality of life laws.

1455
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:13,210
If you'd,

1456
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,700
they said if somebody graffiti's a walk,

1457
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,620
they probably do other
things that are bad too.

1458
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,840
So we're going to start
enforcing those small,

1459
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,420
those small crimes because
they lead to bigger crimes.

1460
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:22,170
That kind of notion.

1461
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,920
And it's interesting how many people
were like so down on Giuliani doing that.

1462
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:28,140
It really upset that
he's ruining in New York.

1463
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,580
I was in New York,

1464
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:31,740
I've shot a movie there three weeks ago.

1465
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,080
Whenever it's better than I've,

1466
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,973
I mean I've been,

1467
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,801
my family is from there.

1468
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,220
It's better

1469
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,780
than I've ever seen the city in my life.

1470
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,423
It's incredible.

1471
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:39,740
It's,

1472
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,320
it's a better place to
be than anywhere I've,

1473
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:42,501
I,

1474
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:43,570
it's the best I've ever seen it.

1475
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,790
It's the better place to be
than anywhere in the world.

1476
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,241
Well,

1477
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,860
in some ways I don't
want to get carried away.

1478
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,150
What's the greatest part about it?

1479
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,500
To you?

1480
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,760
Accessibility to everything.

1481
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:53,740
That's everything and
feeling safe doing it.

1482
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,520
Um,

1483
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,690
you,

1484
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,510
you've got,

1485
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,021
first of all,

1486
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,130
you've got the lower east side,

1487
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,080
which is totally different
than the lower west side,

1488
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:01,260
which is totally different than the upper
west side was totally different than

1489
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:01,660
midtown,

1490
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,370
which is totally different than
eating the upper east side.

1491
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,580
And there's an experience to be
had in all quadrants of Manhattan.

1492
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,440
You can get there in 15 minutes
by cab or less and or by subway.

1493
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,090
And most importantly,

1494
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,420
you're no longer walk around New York
feeling like you're going to get mugged or

1495
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,110
anything else.

1496
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,220
So that's what people,

1497
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:23,110
that's the feeling that people still have
about Manhattan is that weird feeling

1498
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,850
of worrying about being mugged.

1499
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,091
Sure.

1500
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:25,901
Cause it's so big.

1501
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,250
But if you look at statistics,

1502
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,470
the police had done an amazing
job of policing and you know,

1503
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,770
who else has done a really good job as,

1504
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,491
I can't remember the,

1505
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:33,700
uh,

1506
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,670
our police chief here and,

1507
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:35,440
and um,

1508
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,741
la,

1509
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,660
but they've done a really good job,

1510
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,510
really good job at controlling
gang violence in this,

1511
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:40,871
in this.

1512
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:42,690
And it's an almost
impossible in such an area,

1513
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,241
huge area.

1514
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:45,730
But they've done a really innovative job.

1515
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,110
You know,

1516
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,250
comparatively they've,

1517
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:48,461
they've,

1518
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:49,294
they've,

1519
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:49,831
they,

1520
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:50,471
they've learned,

1521
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,630
they learned a lot from,

1522
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:52,391
from the gangs,

1523
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,010
closings in the eighties and the nineties
and they've done a really good job in

1524
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,661
a lot of places.

1525
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,790
It's kind of fucked when you
really wrap your head around it.

1526
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,520
Like that should be the laws
that people are concentrating on.

1527
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:00,911
What is,

1528
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,740
what is causing that kind of shit?

1529
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,520
I know it's called,

1530
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,660
I have an opinion on that.

1531
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,693
The gangs,

1532
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,640
I think a lot of it comes,

1533
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,030
starts with,

1534
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,863
it's like a family.

1535
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,450
Exactly.

1536
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,030
I talked to a principal in Kansas City.

1537
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:10,540
I said,

1538
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:10,811
what do you,

1539
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,950
what would you do about education?

1540
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,360
And I wanted to get into a talk about it,

1541
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:13,810
you know,

1542
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,561
and he said nothing.

1543
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,394
Our schools are great,

1544
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,780
our parents are fucked up.

1545
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,460
They had good parents and be fine.

1546
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:18,820
I was like,

1547
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,030
Ooh,

1548
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,390
Geez.

1549
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,223
I never thought he goes,

1550
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,100
my school was great.

1551
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,630
I just got parents that don't,

1552
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,863
they're not present.

1553
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,750
They got three kids
they can't take care of.

1554
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,461
And it,

1555
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:27,380
it comes down to that

1556
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,470
gangs are about kids who just want to
feel significant and belong to something.

1557
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:32,890
Yeah,

1558
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,551
absolutely.

1559
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,220
Everybody has the need to
belong to a team or a tribe,

1560
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:36,890
you know,

1561
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:37,091
I mean,

1562
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:38,890
that's why we call it
solves a death squad.

1563
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,380
You know.

1564
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,920
That's why I love being a
part of 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu,

1565
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,730
you know,

1566
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,563
that's,

1567
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:43,880
we,

1568
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,200
we,

1569
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,531
you know,

1570
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:45,364
when you,

1571
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:45,840
you,

1572
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,830
you become a part of like a team,

1573
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,161
you know,

1574
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:48,880
you become,

1575
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,290
you feel stronger.

1576
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
So some kid who's out there on his own,

1577
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:52,870
you know,

1578
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,230
it was family just fucking sucks
and his whole life has been shit.

1579
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,981
And you know,

1580
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,410
he's there with some dude who
will shoot a dude for them.

1581
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,330
That's what the podcast is too,

1582
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:01,631
isn't it?

1583
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:02,210
I mean,

1584
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:02,491
you know,

1585
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:02,711
you,

1586
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:02,951
you,

1587
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:03,970
you have a really,

1588
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,590
that show we were with,

1589
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,483
Joe did a show,

1590
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:06,980
um,

1591
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,370
this,

1592
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,850
this weekend in Denver
and that crowd was so,

1593
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,560
they were so unbelievable.

1594
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,490
It was like a rock star.

1595
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:14,850
I went out as Joe and I,

1596
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,400
and I said,

1597
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,731
what's up?

1598
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:16,600
You fucking Frakes.

1599
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:16,721
Yeah.

1600
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,520
We wanted to see how long
it would take for people.

1601
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:19,720
Really thought it was me.

1602
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:20,321
And they must have been like,

1603
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:20,771
what the hell?

1604
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:22,920
Joe got Skinny and a
little taller with a beard.

1605
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:23,380
That's weird.

1606
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,213
But anyway,

1607
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,470
but they went crazy and I,

1608
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:25,721
I,

1609
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:26,300
and I'm,

1610
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,230
and then watching all these people in
line up just to take a picture with you.

1611
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,280
They both,

1612
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,710
they feel like they
belonged to an experience.

1613
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,260
You know,

1614
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,480
they feel like they belonged

1615
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,001
to something.

1616
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:35,780
Like even the,

1617
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,040
the,

1618
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,370
the,

1619
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:36,980
my,

1620
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,370
you know,

1621
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,480
my 10 minute podcast,

1622
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,490
well I noticed a lot of young men,

1623
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:40,971
they,

1624
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:41,211
they,

1625
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:41,521
they,

1626
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:41,900
they,

1627
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,790
they come on to that kind of humor.

1628
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:44,061
You know,

1629
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:44,241
they,

1630
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:47,030
they liked the silliness that we
do cause it's Kinda like recess.

1631
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,840
It creates a f you,

1632
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,010
when you create a following and
you create a core group of people,

1633
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,990
it makes them feel like
they belong to something.

1634
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,960
I think that's why they
root for a team that,

1635
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,411
you know,

1636
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,590
you haven't experienced with it.

1637
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:58,450
It's the same kind of thing.

1638
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,460
This is an even more intimate
experience because you know,

1639
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:02,840
you're in people's fucking heads.

1640
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,740
You know?

1641
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,970
That's why people get so annoyed.

1642
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:08,060
If you say something over repeat things
or if you do something they don't like,

1643
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,200
like the euro,

1644
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:12,020
the people are allowing
you like the most intimate,

1645
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:12,903
uh,

1646
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,930
sort of like input into their brain.

1647
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,100
You're in the fucking your buds and
you're literally playing inside their ear

1648
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:19,401
and you're,

1649
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,100
you're talking inside their
head and if you're annoying,

1650
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:23,030
that's a mind fuck.

1651
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,150
But if you are really genuinely on a
good path and you really are a genuinely

1652
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,160
promoting other people to
be on a good path to and,

1653
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,780
and just brotherhood.

1654
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,111
You know,

1655
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:39,590
Tom Rhodes sent me a text today that
was a really fucking awesome taxed cause

1656
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,750
Tom just did the uh,

1657
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,680
ice house chronicles show that we do
at the desk squad at the Ice House,

1658
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,761
the Ice House,

1659
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:47,930
amazing old comedy club.

1660
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,420
And we've been doing these shows and
we're going to do one this Friday night

1661
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,520
where we have all these comics go well,

1662
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,960
but it was Damo rarer,

1663
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,660
you know,

1664
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,420
this week it's Greg Fitzsimmons,

1665
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,440
Joey Diaz,

1666
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,750
Joey's on all time per
crusher was there this week.

1667
00:42:59,751 --> 00:42:59,961
I mean,

1668
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:00,290
these,

1669
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,090
these shows are fucking incredible.

1670
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:02,720
Okay.

1671
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,590
And were hanging around in the back room
and we're doing a podcast and it's me

1672
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,770
and crusher and Tom Rhodes and Dama rera
and Brody Stevens and we are laughing

1673
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:15,020
our fucking dicks off.

1674
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,580
It's so fun.

1675
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,930
It's like the stuff we always did,

1676
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:20,480
but now thousand hundreds
of thousands of people.

1677
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,333
But what,

1678
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,181
what Tom said,

1679
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:23,720
he's just,

1680
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,051
he goes,

1681
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,910
I really love the feeling of comedy,

1682
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:26,744
Brotherhood,

1683
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,591
you know,

1684
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:28,250
and that's what it,

1685
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,570
that's really what it was.

1686
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,600
It's like we have like a
comedy brotherhood and we
really genuinely like each

1687
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:36,021
other,

1688
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:39,860
love each other and want each other to
succeed and are happy when each other's

1689
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:40,610
succeeds.

1690
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,900
That's the one thing that's missing in
our group is that weird comic neurosis

1691
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,530
that often exist where people can't
be happy with other people's success.

1692
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:48,891
Bitter,

1693
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:49,281
bitter,

1694
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:50,690
like narcissistic or bitter,

1695
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:53,300
kind of like damaged like islands.

1696
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,570
That's what you'd get a lot
with like standup comics.

1697
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,050
They haven't been told,

1698
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:57,351
man,

1699
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:57,530
it's,

1700
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,070
it's like,

1701
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:03,070
it's like learning Jujitsu wrong or
learning to play the guitar wrong.

1702
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,710
You haven't been told the way to
manage your mind and what you,

1703
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:11,330
what you don't realize is that even
though you are separate from other people,

1704
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,710
you're really not,

1705
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,260
and you get something from them,

1706
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,790
positive or negative,

1707
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,970
and that affects you and if
you can generate positive
feelings and other people,

1708
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,450
then you will get more positive
feeling in your own life.

1709
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:26,631
You know,

1710
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,240
it's really weird.

1711
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,470
I'm reading this book called the sociopath
next door written by this Harvard

1712
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,250
psychiatrist.

1713
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,990
She's a sociopath.

1714
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:37,030
I read an excerpt about that where they
were saying some frightening numbers.

1715
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,101
We were just,

1716
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,970
you were just talking about connection
and how important it is and the feeling

1717
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:45,330
you get from when you move other people
and then you and you get in and you get

1718
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:46,141
moved from other people.

1719
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,790
And most of us who are normal,

1720
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,290
we get this socio paths.

1721
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,080
They don't even get that
from their own children.

1722
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,910
They don't even get like,

1723
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,010
like they could be very successful,

1724
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:58,310
but they don't get any
satisfaction out of being at,

1725
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:58,800
you know,

1726
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,970
getting the adulation.

1727
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,240
The only thing that they usually get
pleasure from is winning and controlling

1728
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,670
other people's reactions.

1729
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:08,903
Isn't that wild?

1730
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,920
So the idea is you,

1731
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,670
whatever they can do power over people
is what gets them off and winning.

1732
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,720
That's the only thing that gives him the
satisfaction because they can dominate.

1733
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,120
We know comics like that.

1734
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,220
There are a lot of people like that.

1735
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,350
I think we no one at least.

1736
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,800
And the ones that's usually the ones
that are in trouble for being unoriginal,

1737
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,630
it says it's the desire for conquest,

1738
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,950
most supersedes everything.

1739
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,240
And they really don't have any
problem fucking people over.

1740
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:35,550
Right.

1741
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,990
And that's where it gets really weird.

1742
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,350
Every time I've ever fucked anybody
over my life is left a bad feeling.

1743
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,520
Like we were talking before the show
about a steel in material and uh,

1744
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:48,121
I said,

1745
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:48,271
uh,

1746
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:50,490
when I was an open mic or I totally stole,

1747
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,400
I stole Greg Fitzsimmons
and stuff and like,

1748
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,340
we stole it on perfectly.

1749
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:53,500
We,

1750
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,930
we spoke about it to each other.

1751
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,681
We said like,

1752
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:55,921
dude,

1753
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:56,970
if I'm on the road and I'm bombing,

1754
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:57,804
I'm doing your shit.

1755
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,850
Like we made agreements with each other.

1756
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,680
But even though I told those people
his joke and it wasn't my joke,

1757
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,000
I still felt like I was full of shit and
it was like fucked with me for years.

1758
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,781
You know what I do every,

1759
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:10,620
every time now.

1760
00:46:10,621 --> 00:46:11,454
I do stand up.

1761
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,600
My Buddy Sam Brown,

1762
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,351
who was a great comic,

1763
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,510
died of pancreatic cancer
about two months ago.

1764
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,530
And uh,

1765
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,170
I was really close when I knew him for
20 years and he was the first headliner

1766
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:19,680
it ever seen.

1767
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,341
We would cross,

1768
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:23,790
he was from Boston and now
every show I steal one of his,

1769
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,060
uh,

1770
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,893
his jokes,

1771
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,381
I just,

1772
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,150
I just,

1773
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,390
it's like my little homage to him.

1774
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:28,440
I just put it in there.

1775
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:30,380
I just kind of slide it in just this,

1776
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,140
my little like,

1777
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,360
cause I know I wrote on his deathbed,

1778
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:33,541
he,

1779
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,680
unfortunately he couldn't talk,

1780
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:35,850
but his wife read it to him.

1781
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,620
I wrote,

1782
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,170
um,

1783
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:37,501
I said,

1784
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,334
listen man,

1785
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:38,701
you know,

1786
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:41,250
you're one of the greatest comics
are you always made me laugh.

1787
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,900
If there's any way I
can have your material,

1788
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,141
I mean,

1789
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:43,974
you know,

1790
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,293
I fucking rock.

1791
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,130
And she read it to them
and I don't think he,

1792
00:46:47,131 --> 00:46:48,120
I don't think he was able to,

1793
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:49,530
I don't think he was conscious about hope.

1794
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:51,660
He can hear and I hope I made
them laugh before he died.

1795
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,650
I literally,

1796
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:52,981
by the way,

1797
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:53,100
I'm,

1798
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:53,400
I,

1799
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,080
I recorded two podcasts with him.

1800
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,390
One he knew he was dying on my,

1801
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:57,961
on my,

1802
00:46:57,961 --> 00:46:58,170
uh,

1803
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,921
on my podcast.

1804
00:46:58,921 --> 00:46:59,641
So it's pretty,

1805
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:00,210
pretty cool.

1806
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:00,781
Pretty Pretty.

1807
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:00,960
Uh,

1808
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,793
pretty moving.

1809
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,210
You could do my shit if I die,

1810
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,340
I'll do your shit.

1811
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,173
I'll always,

1812
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,440
that's what I want to see my friends.

1813
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,340
I knew some of my notes.

1814
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,353
He had great,

1815
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,271
great bits,

1816
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:10,104
man.

1817
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,550
He had a fucking great
pitch and he's like,

1818
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,600
he would talk about smallest
ticket me behind the Greg.

1819
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:15,031
Oh Dude,

1820
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:15,271
no,

1821
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:15,511
no.

1822
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,720
You fucked the order of jokes man.

1823
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:21,540
Your jobs would be hard to steal though
because like I was watching you this

1824
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,420
weekend and one of the things I loved
was it was almost like you were,

1825
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,170
you were,

1826
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:25,730
you were.

1827
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,780
Cause I know a lot of
this stuff is new and so,

1828
00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:30,850
so much of it was just you
of having an experience.

1829
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,151
It's like,

1830
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,690
what I like about your standup is you're
always kind of having an experience and

1831
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:37,960
you're doing it for you and you're working
something out and you're looking at

1832
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:42,700
how weirdly how weird we
are structured as a society.

1833
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:45,460
Our minds are why we do
things that make no sense.

1834
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,620
Why contextually something makes sense,

1835
00:47:47,621 --> 00:47:49,090
but then it doesn't in this case,

1836
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,130
and it was so fun to
watch because I was like,

1837
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,000
you know this,

1838
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,200
the comedy is almost secondary
to the experience La.

1839
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:56,471
Yeah.

1840
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:56,741
Yeah.

1841
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:57,191
It's funny.

1842
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:57,610
Yes,

1843
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,480
but you're almost like,

1844
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,720
I think I really think people are
watching you kind of have your own very

1845
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:06,250
authentic and unique experience.

1846
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,510
Verbal experience.

1847
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,740
That's what I felt like.

1848
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,740
Like I come away with a
very different perspective.

1849
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:12,940
It's very inspiring to me because
I started writing differently.

1850
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,511
Really?

1851
00:48:13,511 --> 00:48:13,751
Yeah.

1852
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,620
When I see you I go,

1853
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,671
I,

1854
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:16,900
it's a really nice,

1855
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,900
it's what I love about like
having friends that inspire me.

1856
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,740
What you've always done.

1857
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,530
Like it's just like you have that,

1858
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:22,900
that's,

1859
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,250
that's who your friends should be.

1860
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:24,791
You know?

1861
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:25,450
I know you,

1862
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,940
I have friends that are wonderful
that are I play grab ass with.

1863
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:31,930
But then you have friends that are like
that really inspire you to be better and

1864
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:33,670
push you just by their example.

1865
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,020
Well they make you better.

1866
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,000
They make you to make be better.

1867
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,361
Good.

1868
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:40,050
I like hearing that we all
make each other better,

1869
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:40,961
but you always right.

1870
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,290
You have,

1871
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,730
your bar has always been,

1872
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,103
oh,

1873
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,360
I don't know how to describe
where you place the bar,

1874
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:49,600
but I always would watch you
and I've seen you at your best.

1875
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:54,370
I've seen you when you're shit is fucking
so tight and you're just a machine

1876
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:54,641
gun.

1877
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:55,930
Like I remember when you were younger,

1878
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,060
I'd never seen you did something
to a crowd in New York.

1879
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,740
I remember was I was with Patty Jenkins,

1880
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,740
you are a fucking machine gun.

1881
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,240
It was like literally these New Yorkers,

1882
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,480
like all these comics gotten them
and then Joe Rogan gets up and it was

1883
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:07,961
literally like,

1884
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,040
we were like looking at each other going,

1885
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:09,874
what the fuck?

1886
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,810
What the fuck is this?

1887
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,160
And it was what it was,

1888
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:16,930
was somebody who had never taken a day
off and had only been working on being as

1889
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,760
authentic with their experience.

1890
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,820
And what a lot of people don't
know about your early stuff,

1891
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:21,491
that you were so good at.

1892
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,001
Impressions,

1893
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:22,810
you did all of it.

1894
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,190
It was funny but really truth.

1895
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,610
So for me it was just literally
like a fucking tsunami.

1896
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:28,444
We were like,

1897
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,310
Jesus Christ,

1898
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,480
that's how you do stand up.

1899
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,830
That's how you do it.

1900
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,730
Good luck.

1901
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,350
Anybody trying to follow that fucking
ball of fucking energy cause you just come

1902
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,330
on like certain bits that I couldn't,

1903
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,800
I couldn't follow myself.

1904
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:42,663
Oh my God,

1905
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,590
you were so physical,

1906
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:45,430
like muscular,

1907
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:46,570
but really flexible.

1908
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,330
Like you do weird shit
like fall into the splits.

1909
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,980
I remember one time we had a meeting,

1910
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:54,640
remember that we were pitching a TV show
and we're sitting on a couch and it's

1911
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:54,791
like,

1912
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,700
I think it was Eric with Eric Tanenbaum
and like big producers and you go

1913
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,580
[inaudible] and we were talking
about martial arts and you go,

1914
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:00,791
yeah,

1915
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:01,624
I'm flexible.

1916
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,411
And I was like,

1917
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:02,621
yeah,

1918
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:03,341
I'm flexible too.

1919
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:03,581
And you go,

1920
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:03,821
yeah,

1921
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:04,631
but you can't do this.

1922
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:08,440
And you grabbed your ankles and fucking
pull them up and you did the splits in

1923
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,880
the air and we were all like,

1924
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,890
what the fuck is high?

1925
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,801
What is that?

1926
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,380
He's like made a rubber and you
used to bring that shit to the,

1927
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:15,790
to the stage and it was just,

1928
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,050
it's just really wild to watch.

1929
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:21,280
You kind of continue to grow
and change your expression,

1930
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:21,670
you know?

1931
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,480
Well you,

1932
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,480
you just keep adding information
to the pile and you keep euro,

1933
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,050
you're learned experiences.

1934
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,770
So if you're still into it and I,

1935
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:33,081
you know,

1936
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:33,421
you,

1937
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:35,390
you don't diminish your focus.

1938
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,950
And my focus is a real
wrestling match because I,

1939
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,721
you know,

1940
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:39,271
like a,

1941
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:40,880
in Steven Pressfield's books,

1942
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,630
it talks about distractions and,

1943
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:45,320
and different things that you and I will,

1944
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,570
I certainly battle with those things,

1945
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:50,930
but I also battle with
other things that I enjoy.

1946
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,450
Like when he calls distractions like that,

1947
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:54,890
I think make me better.

1948
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,810
I think the better I get at pool,

1949
00:50:56,811 --> 00:50:57,920
this seems really strange,

1950
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,810
but the,

1951
00:50:58,810 --> 00:50:59,481
the better.

1952
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:03,950
I am at comedy and right now I've never
been better at comedy and I've never

1953
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:04,910
been better at pool.

1954
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:08,270
Like I've got this weird
thing going on where,

1955
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:08,750
um,

1956
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,290
I can,

1957
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,570
I can tune in to,

1958
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:12,250
it's,

1959
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:12,530
it's,

1960
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:12,771
it's,

1961
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:17,270
to me it seems to be about tuning into
whatever the fuck I'm trying to do,

1962
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,890
whether it's Jujitsu,

1963
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,120
whether it's pool,

1964
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:20,601
whatever,

1965
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:21,710
w but it standup company.

1966
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:25,640
But I have to have that same
sort of intensity and energy.

1967
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,050
And if I dwindle,

1968
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,330
if I drop below a certain level,

1969
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,040
I can't rely on my learned
experiences with stand up.

1970
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,080
I can't rely on the past.

1971
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:40,160
I have to constantly be maintaining
a certain amount of current interest,

1972
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,700
writing new stuff.

1973
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:41,830
Yeah,

1974
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:42,770
that's what I was going to say is,

1975
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,001
well,

1976
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,950
what's what I think the
secret to your success is,

1977
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:47,740
and I always try to tell people this
because people get very frustrated and

1978
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:52,330
discouraged by the process
of accomplishment because
there are so many plateaus

1979
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,560
and you're always always
like a lot of people,

1980
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,120
well this didn't work out and and,

1981
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,230
and what what we in,

1982
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:02,440
I'll just say this to everybody because
I've been pretty successful and I have

1983
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:03,274
people come up to me and they,

1984
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,520
you know when you do a show they
want to take pictures and they,

1985
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:05,860
they,

1986
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,610
they look at you as a success in this
business and you being one of my closest

1987
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:10,420
friends,

1988
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,870
you had a critique of my,

1989
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,420
my recent special on showtime,

1990
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,650
which I wasn't very happy with.

1991
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,720
But what was great about it is you said,

1992
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:17,554
Hey Brian,

1993
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,430
you could be a great,

1994
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:20,680
you could be way better than you are now.

1995
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:22,390
I shot a fucking show times
special when people are like,

1996
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:22,601
Whoa,

1997
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:23,391
you shot a special,

1998
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:23,491
I'm,

1999
00:52:23,491 --> 00:52:24,490
I'm at working on my second.

2000
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,110
But you said you're,

2001
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:28,480
you're putting a little too
much English on the ball.

2002
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,100
Okay.

2003
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,070
Little too little too slick
playing around and what that does,

2004
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:33,923
what an adequate,

2005
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,270
no,

2006
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,260
it's a trick of course.

2007
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:35,591
Of course.

2008
00:52:35,591 --> 00:52:35,720
I,

2009
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,553
I've done it.

2010
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,440
I look back at my old
stuff where I did that.

2011
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,120
It's the grossest feeling of all time

2012
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:40,711
because what,

2013
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:40,951
what did,

2014
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:43,170
what it means is that no matter
where you are in your career,

2015
00:52:43,171 --> 00:52:44,760
you've always got to be assessing.

2016
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,230
You've always gotta be taking yourself to,

2017
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,300
to task and kind of taking a look
at yourself objectively and go on.

2018
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:51,750
I gotta,

2019
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,280
I gotta I gotta work a little harder.

2020
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,370
I'm watching my last
special that I edited.

2021
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:57,590
It's the best shit I've ever
done and I can't even watch it.

2022
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,341
I was like,

2023
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:58,521
Oh,

2024
00:52:58,521 --> 00:52:59,480
I look so stupid.

2025
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,740
Fucking talk too much.

2026
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,740
Even when I stumbled through like,

2027
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:04,010
uh,

2028
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,370
like one also I'll fuck up the,

2029
00:53:06,371 --> 00:53:06,831
the,

2030
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:07,131
the,

2031
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:08,630
the one word,

2032
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,180
you know,

2033
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,040
one one,

2034
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,000
I'll have one little stumble in there
and it's just like watching a puppy get

2035
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:14,834
hit with a hammer.

2036
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,733
The first time

2037
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,160
I saw myself on camera with was a wrestler
and I was 14 and I walked out onto

2038
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:21,661
the mat when I,

2039
00:53:21,661 --> 00:53:23,620
and I used to think I was the
baddest guy on the planet.

2040
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,830
I looked at video and I went,

2041
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,461
well,

2042
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:26,970
where's,

2043
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,570
who's the,

2044
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,010
who the fuck is the kid with rickets?

2045
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:29,941
Fuck,

2046
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:30,390
is that,

2047
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,223
it was me.

2048
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,790
I've never been more devastated.

2049
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:33,330
I was like,

2050
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,360
I'm that skinny in a single let,

2051
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,510
I'm never wrestling again.

2052
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,390
I'll go out in the Burka before I
fucking go out in a single let that's,

2053
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,283
that's a fair,

2054
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,700
and that's a horrific,

2055
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,420
my,

2056
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,440
my buddy wrote a book,

2057
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,190
um,

2058
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,290
which I told you you should
have them on your podcast.

2059
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,310
His name is hunter Mott's.

2060
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,610
He wrote a book called the straight a
conspiracy speaks 10 languages fluently.

2061
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:53,460
This kid graduated from Harvard
with a biochemistry degree.

2062
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,180
Okay.

2063
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,601
And I said,

2064
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:55,200
why did you write the book?

2065
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,441
He said,

2066
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:55,830
well,

2067
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:56,220
I said,

2068
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,341
oh.

2069
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:56,611
I said,

2070
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:56,750
well,

2071
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,890
how do you learn 10 languages fluently?

2072
00:53:58,910 --> 00:53:59,070
And,

2073
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,300
and he's fluent.

2074
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:00,960
And he said,

2075
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,171
oh,

2076
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:01,771
it's because I,

2077
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,451
it's because I,

2078
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:03,510
I know I can do it.

2079
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:07,080
And everybody who learns languages or
math thinks they can't because they have

2080
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,550
an emotional context around it.

2081
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:09,090
That's all.

2082
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,320
And I don't know what does that mean?

2083
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:10,831
He said,

2084
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:11,491
I'm writing a book about it.

2085
00:54:11,491 --> 00:54:12,324
I'll tell you about it later.

2086
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,710
I had him on my podcast.

2087
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,020
He wrote a book called
the straight a conspiracy.

2088
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,711
And He,

2089
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:16,891
and,

2090
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,570
and if you look at all the math,

2091
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,090
all the science around
learning and which he did,

2092
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,710
one of the things that they find for sure
is that people have these myths about

2093
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:26,100
themselves.

2094
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,120
I'm not a math person.

2095
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,110
I am a math person.

2096
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:28,831
I'm artistic,

2097
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:29,664
I'm not artistic.

2098
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,181
I'm musical.

2099
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:31,014
I'm not musical.

2100
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,010
If you actually look at the science
that's being done about learning and why

2101
00:54:35,011 --> 00:54:37,260
some people are very good at
some things and others are not,

2102
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,790
I'm talking broad scope here.

2103
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,230
Um,

2104
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,820
what you find is that the emotional
context with which they learned something,

2105
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:48,420
it has everything to do with whether
or not they're going to excel at that.

2106
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,170
Everything.

2107
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,003
So in other words,

2108
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,680
whatever emotional state you approach,

2109
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,790
learning something,

2110
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,690
growing at something means everything.

2111
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:58,351
It's,

2112
00:54:58,351 --> 00:54:59,670
it's what it's all about.

2113
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,750
If you are in a pleasant environment
where somebody makes it fun for you,

2114
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,680
okay,

2115
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,520
you're going to learn it.

2116
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,000
Why are a lot of Asian people,

2117
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,340
so the stereotype goes like Chinese
people good at math and a lot of Americans

2118
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:11,820
aren't.

2119
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,653
I'll tell you why.

2120
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,330
If you read Malcolm Gladwell's book,

2121
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:17,400
the outliers and my buddy's
book straight at conspiracy,

2122
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,430
it has to do with a culture that says,

2123
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:20,761
well,

2124
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:21,091
yeah,

2125
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:23,670
this math problems really
hard and I guess I'll,

2126
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,620
I'll be here for the next
two and a half hours.

2127
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,850
Americans are like,

2128
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,890
I'm not going to sit here
for two and a half hours.

2129
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:30,390
I got shit to do that.

2130
00:55:30,391 --> 00:55:32,160
This is fucking really hard.

2131
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:32,760
Guess what?

2132
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,770
Not a math person and
then your parents go,

2133
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:34,951
yeah,

2134
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:35,784
he's not good at math.

2135
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,810
Isn't it fascinating?

2136
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:42,540
The culture that is the least inclined
to do that hard work is the culture that

2137
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,490
has the best art.

2138
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,021
Well,

2139
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:48,810
we also have the best math and
science and surprisingly because we,

2140
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,410
we have,

2141
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:54,120
we have immigrants and capture the
competition's fierce and the possibilities

2142
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:54,990
are pretty intense.

2143
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,520
I also happen to believe that that's,

2144
00:55:56,521 --> 00:56:00,570
that is the reason we're so good
at art and things is because it is,

2145
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,820
we place emphasis on the individual.

2146
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,030
It's your individual expression is what
you can benefit from it and we have

2147
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:06,631
freedom to do it.

2148
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,010
You can't be expressive.

2149
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,560
Imagine having your podcast in Russia to
imagine having my podcast in American a

2150
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:14,250
few years.

2151
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,600
That's what's really a problem.

2152
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,680
What's really a problem is the more
you get shit like this national defense

2153
00:56:19,681 --> 00:56:20,580
authorization act,

2154
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,980
the more of these different
laws are passed that slowly but

2155
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,290
surely take away your right
to say certain things.

2156
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,050
They just outlawed protests
at military funerals.

2157
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,220
The government has,

2158
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:30,550
uh,

2159
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,430
recently reinstated propaganda.

2160
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,660
They're allowed now.

2161
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:39,690
They haven't been since the 1940s to
actively use propaganda on the American

2162
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:41,081
people.

2163
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:46,081
That's legal now and all this shit is
going on while the Internet is growing,

2164
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:51,100
while people's access to
information is just flying out them.

2165
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,280
It's like this desperate last clawing
attempt at a dying culture to hold on to

2166
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:58,990
power and it's disgusting.

2167
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,200
It's disgusting that anybody would ever
allow the government to use propaganda.

2168
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,540
I mean Munis,

2169
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,281
lead,

2170
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,114
lie,

2171
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,771
and and,

2172
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:12,771
and distort the truth for the public in
order to emphasize their point of that,

2173
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:16,600
you would give that power to the
government is so beyond sick,

2174
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,350
but as long as you realize that that is
always going to be the case and that you

2175
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:22,060
have to always be aware of that.

2176
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,480
Right.

2177
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,950
The problem is that's happening though.

2178
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,480
The problem is that it's a trend.

2179
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:28,300
It's happening and it takes
a lot to stop a trend.

2180
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,980
It takes a lot to back it up.

2181
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,590
How do you stop and you
write to your representative?

2182
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:32,980
I mean,

2183
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,970
what happens after a while I started
to feel like I'm not represented.

2184
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,370
Right.

2185
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,000
I start to feel like if I'm not a
corporation with a lot of money to buy it,

2186
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,690
but to by lobbyists,

2187
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:40,931
no,

2188
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:41,471
you're not.

2189
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,750
I don't have a way of
influencing my government.

2190
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,584
For example,

2191
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:45,710
New York Times wrote an Ra.

2192
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,920
Ra ran an article recently about,

2193
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:52,921
I travel a lot as to you and when you
walk through the two boxes where you put

2194
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:55,010
your feet and you actually
put your hands up,

2195
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,370
y'all not talking about the
foam that goes around you.

2196
00:57:57,371 --> 00:57:58,600
I'm talking about the two,

2197
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,770
the two boxes you walked.

2198
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:03,790
Well that's radiation and in New York
Times wrote an article and it was about a

2199
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:03,791
week ago.

2200
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:07,480
If you guys want to look it up about the
fact that they actually aren't too sure

2201
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,860
how much radiation you're getting.

2202
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,020
They think it might be
one 10th of a chest x Ray.

2203
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,010
Some in some cases,

2204
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,873
more importantly,

2205
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,440
they don't maintain them as well.

2206
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:17,200
They had some crazy number
of maintenance requests,

2207
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:17,660
mum,

2208
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,910
many of which were not met.

2209
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,511
You're,

2210
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:21,730
you're putting your trust into the Tsa.

2211
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,370
They're probably good people doing the
best they can and in some ways they do a

2212
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:25,090
great job.

2213
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,700
But the fact that I didn't know that
I was being blasted with radiation,

2214
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:28,540
no matter how small,

2215
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,350
not doing it,

2216
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,183
I don't do that.

2217
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,390
I have them pat me down.

2218
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,693
And

2219
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,650
did anybody ever get creepy with you
when you asked for a pat down was I was

2220
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:37,461
hoping they would,

2221
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:38,380
but they didn't the fuck.

2222
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,590
Not Creepy sexually.

2223
00:58:39,591 --> 00:58:40,424
I mean,

2224
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,350
Graham Hancock,

2225
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,040
uh,

2226
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,410
who's,

2227
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:43,900
uh,

2228
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,800
a guy who I've had on the podcast before,

2229
00:58:45,801 --> 00:58:46,634
he's from England,

2230
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,730
he came to America and he didn't trust
the radiation of the machine and he said

2231
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:52,190
they violently like almost assaulted him.

2232
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,170
He said it was very rape.

2233
00:58:54,171 --> 00:58:55,920
Like grab his cock like the

2234
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:56,771
no,

2235
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:58,150
they were really polite to me actually.

2236
00:58:58,151 --> 00:58:58,421
They went,

2237
00:58:58,421 --> 00:58:58,720
all right,

2238
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,553
no problem.

2239
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,271
I think it's,

2240
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:01,350
you know who you get,

2241
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,100
you know,

2242
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,290
we might get some guy that
doesn't like English people,

2243
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:04,660
you know,

2244
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,700
dude has an accent.

2245
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,031
He's like,

2246
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:07,170
I'm not going to go through,

2247
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,980
they're impressed with the TSA and
how professional a lot of them are.

2248
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:12,350
I'm actually impressed with how Curtis,

2249
00:59:12,351 --> 00:59:14,310
you're such a fucking Fox News.

2250
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,550
Contrarion I would have known that you
were gonna say that if we brought up the,

2251
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:18,690
what about Tsa cons?

2252
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,270
You know what actually
statistically the Tsa,

2253
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,251
I like everybody.

2254
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:24,260
I have no like resolved by the way.

2255
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,250
Just for the record.

2256
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:25,910
Everybody.

2257
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,920
I finally all my rules in the show.

2258
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,730
I don't believe as an actor I should
be talking about anything including

2259
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:32,181
politics,

2260
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:32,931
but I can't help it.

2261
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,640
I'm like anyways,

2262
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,510
in the actor,

2263
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,930
how could you say as an actor,

2264
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:37,630
as a comic or a comic,

2265
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,331
if you're a comic,

2266
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:41,690
you should be feel ridiculous idea
that you should be able to talk about

2267
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:43,430
anything except religion or politics.

2268
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,030
Well,

2269
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:44,161
the,

2270
00:59:44,161 --> 00:59:49,161
that that alone is just like a cry or a
call rather to a middling state of mind

2271
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,600
to a non communication.

2272
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,180
You know?

2273
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,710
It's like if you're not politically
committed to some extent,

2274
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,940
then it's at your own peril.

2275
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,330
If everybody wants to be ignorant
about what's going on in their world,

2276
01:00:02,331 --> 01:00:03,164
in politics,

2277
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,870
then then good luck trying to change
anything and more importantly,

2278
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:07,690
good luck being able to see what,

2279
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:08,570
what's happening.

2280
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,760
Most people don't have the fucking time.

2281
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:11,120
Man,

2282
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,290
that's a part of the problem.

2283
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,430
Most people have lives.

2284
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:16,580
They have jobs and children and all that
other stuff that goes along with them.

2285
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,390
Hobbies,

2286
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,770
you have time to develop a philosophy.

2287
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,030
You don't have to worry about the minutia.

2288
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,310
Did you have time?

2289
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,890
My point is that what you were saying
earlier is that they don't feel like

2290
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:28,310
they're being represented so they don't
feel like their efforts put into it.

2291
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:29,600
Have any great reward.

2292
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:30,621
You know,

2293
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:30,950
they don't,

2294
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,120
they feel like completely,

2295
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:33,260
there's a lot of people,

2296
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:34,460
I think a good percentage,

2297
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:35,300
more than half,

2298
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,400
I feel completely
alienated from the system.

2299
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,200
And that's a conservative estimate.

2300
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,470
If you say that half the people in this
country feel alienated from the system,

2301
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,820
that's a failing system,

2302
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:45,380
no matter how you look at it.

2303
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,240
And the problem is people
don't feel rewarded for
investing in a failing system.

2304
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:55,270
When a guy like Obama gets the Nobel
Peace Prize and then since 30,000 more

2305
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,770
fucking troops to Afghanistan
and everybody's like,

2306
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:58,910
Jesus Christ,

2307
01:00:58,911 --> 01:00:59,660
man.

2308
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,493
Like what?

2309
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,000
What kind of system is this?

2310
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,161
Who,

2311
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:02,751
who would have,

2312
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:03,561
who would have said that?

2313
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:04,041
That's okay.

2314
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,540
Who would one of their sons to go?

2315
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:08,780
Who would one of their brother
to go get the fuck Outta here?

2316
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:09,830
That's nonsense.

2317
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:10,664
That's craziness.

2318
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,810
But yet it's happening.

2319
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:14,270
So we don't feel represented.

2320
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:15,104
We feel too,

2321
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,600
I wonder if Obama himself feels,

2322
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:18,590
I want why it's like a,

2323
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,240
like a listless play thing.

2324
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:20,930
I wonder,

2325
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:21,381
you know what I mean?

2326
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:21,980
Like somebody,

2327
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:25,370
I bet you his biggest complaint is the
fact that he doesn't have any power at

2328
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:25,910
all.

2329
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:26,870
I bet you that he makes it.

2330
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:27,030
Well,

2331
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,580
he knows that if he makes one decision,

2332
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,240
he's going to a appease 50% of the
people and piss off the other 50% I mean,

2333
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:36,920
it's gotta be a strange job if you just
stop and think about who you are before

2334
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:37,701
he become president.

2335
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:39,320
If you take out all the nonsense,

2336
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,200
the tin foil hat stuff about the
illuminati running things and you,

2337
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:47,201
let's just pretend for a brief moment
that maybe elections are real okay.

2338
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:51,710
And maybe Obama is just a regular
dude who became a senator,

2339
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,020
who's a regular dude
who ran for president,

2340
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:59,021
who activated a big wellspring of hope
and it's people and then they put him

2341
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:01,580
into office and then
once he gets in there,

2342
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:04,340
then he has to deal with
these international banks.

2343
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,860
He has to deal with
things like Halliburton.

2344
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:09,590
He has to deal with
people like Dick Cheney,

2345
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,700
Rumsfeld,

2346
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,830
think about all the people
that were in power before him.

2347
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:14,840
Think about all the people that
he has to communicate with.

2348
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:17,660
Think of it all the shit that
went down in that office.

2349
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:21,750
Think of it all the people that died all
over the world because of the actions

2350
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,800
of the group of people he replaced and
think about what that must feel like to

2351
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,030
step into those shoes.

2352
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:31,110
And then all of a sudden you realize
you are at the helm of a murder machine.

2353
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,300
You are at the helm of a thing that
is in every single part of the world.

2354
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:40,650
It's also a huge octopus that is
not being run by one particular,

2355
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,011
no,

2356
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:44,160
it's being built by a bunch
of different interests,

2357
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:46,350
but they're profiting like massive,

2358
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,960
massive amounts on war.

2359
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,240
Deon and all those companies that have
that make a lot of money off of what,

2360
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:52,631
what they,

2361
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:55,420
what Eisenhower called the
industrial military industrial.

2362
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,600
And so as a,

2363
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:57,860
as a president,

2364
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:58,610
do you feel like,

2365
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:01,910
you know when you get in there you
just slowly tried to put on the brakes?

2366
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:02,451
I mean,

2367
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:04,190
how much control does a guy have?

2368
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:05,810
Cause it doesn't seem like much.

2369
01:03:05,811 --> 01:03:08,720
I think we deviated much
from Bush to Obama at all.

2370
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:13,750
And in fact they cracked down on secrecy
issues and crack down on prosecuting

2371
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,390
people for leaking information.

2372
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,450
And Obama was,

2373
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,530
was very,

2374
01:03:17,531 --> 01:03:18,340
um,

2375
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,290
very much about the drone programs,

2376
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,133
special forces.

2377
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,210
He made a joke about using the drones
if someone tried to Dre to a date,

2378
01:03:25,211 --> 01:03:26,050
his daughters,

2379
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,150
he made a joke in one of those,

2380
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:28,361
you know,

2381
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:30,340
they do as one of those functions
where he does one liners.

2382
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:34,720
Obama got up there and he made a joke
about if you were dating his daughters,

2383
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:36,550
he has one word for you.

2384
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:37,563
Drones.

2385
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:38,700
Yeah.

2386
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,533
Well,

2387
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:39,850
uh,

2388
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:40,650
kinda funny,

2389
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,101
but not if,

2390
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:41,830
when you're the president,

2391
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:46,480
that's not when thousands of civilians
have been murdered by drones.

2392
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,670
Thousands of innocent civilians.

2393
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,040
I don't know what the number is now,

2394
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:52,650
but it was in the thousands.

2395
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:54,550
Someone sent me all the
statistics on Twitter.

2396
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,290
Give killed a lot of bad guys.

2397
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:57,230
But again,

2398
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,260
it was what we were talking
about with farm factory farming.

2399
01:03:59,261 --> 01:04:04,261
When you have people in Nevada and Florida
who go to a room and they kill people

2400
01:04:04,331 --> 01:04:06,820
who are a thousand miles away via,

2401
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:07,540
you know,

2402
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,220
camera and with these drones.

2403
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,073
I think about that.

2404
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,290
My joke was the war hero in 20 years
is going to be the Chubby guy with huge

2405
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:14,850
thumb muscles.

2406
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,300
This smells like Doritos and we'd write,

2407
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:16,960
cause he's,

2408
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,793
he's a Gamer.

2409
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,790
He's hooked up on Alpha brain there.

2410
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,621
There is a,

2411
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:24,940
there is a psychological model when
you're removing yourself from the actual,

2412
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:25,120
you know,

2413
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:25,781
when you're a marine,

2414
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:26,770
you're drawing a bead,

2415
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:27,940
you're shooting a guy and you know you're,

2416
01:04:27,941 --> 01:04:30,820
you're running and you're and you
just see the guy die and stuff.

2417
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:35,140
When you're in a room in your
country and you go home after,

2418
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,650
after operating these drones and
killing whatever it might be,

2419
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,780
maybe it's one person in
the 25 whatever it is,

2420
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,690
or you drop a thousand
pound bomb on a shoot,

2421
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:44,501
a Hellfire missile,

2422
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:45,550
whatever comes out of those things.

2423
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,900
That's kind of really,

2424
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,830
that's,

2425
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:49,570
that raises a lot of questions.

2426
01:04:49,571 --> 01:04:54,250
It raises a lot of questions when we're
this removed from the actual experience

2427
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:55,084
of killing

2428
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,910
what we were talking about earlier.

2429
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:57,750
It's all connected.

2430
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:01,350
The sociopath does not have that feeling
of connection and only feels pleasure

2431
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:02,184
when they win.

2432
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:06,060
And what is war but completely
sociopathic behavior.

2433
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,110
And what is friendship other than none.

2434
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:10,530
So sociopathic behavior,

2435
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,420
the connection that you get with people,

2436
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,870
the being the most important thing we
were talking about when we're doing this

2437
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,610
podcast that we've created an environment,

2438
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,550
we've created a,

2439
01:05:19,551 --> 01:05:19,870
uh,

2440
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,380
there's,

2441
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,720
it's not as simple as this is a show.

2442
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:26,500
It's a bunch of people tuning into the
show and getting like a positive thing

2443
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:30,820
out of it and having conversations like
this and these conversations take place

2444
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,220
in their head and they experience it.

2445
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,660
They learn from it.

2446
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:35,290
They,

2447
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,430
it gives them hope.

2448
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,440
It gives them a mindset that they can,

2449
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,650
uh,

2450
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,640
they can accomplish something with
it gives them a fucking people.

2451
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:43,570
I've had come up to me and go,

2452
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:43,841
dude,

2453
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:44,980
since I've listen to your podcast,

2454
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,240
I've lost 70 pounds.

2455
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,500
I start drinking Kale shakes,

2456
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:49,060
I think come to me every fucking show.

2457
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,230
It's incredible.

2458
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:53,380
It's also important when you have a
debate and we have a discussion like we do

2459
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,600
to to actually take a look at the,

2460
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,440
where to place,

2461
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,750
where to place the focus,

2462
01:05:58,930 --> 01:05:59,670
for example,

2463
01:05:59,670 --> 01:05:59,900
allowed.

2464
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,011
Well,

2465
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:00,450
I'm a,

2466
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:01,283
well the military,

2467
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,200
well the military,

2468
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:05,560
there are a lot of people in the military
who are carrying out these who are

2469
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,930
doing these things that never agreed
with the war in the first place.

2470
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,380
I mean,

2471
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:10,450
we have a civilian government
that controls the military,

2472
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:12,280
that makes these decisions
for the military.

2473
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,170
The military just carries out orders.

2474
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,210
That's how our government works.

2475
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,680
And the military has a job to do.

2476
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:19,180
If you send them into a war zone,

2477
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,350
they're going to get the job done.

2478
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:21,100
Um,

2479
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,030
and a lot of guys,

2480
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:22,330
I mean,

2481
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,730
I know I w you know,

2482
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,670
I went to Afghanistan,

2483
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:26,470
but I know enough people
in the armed forces,

2484
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,310
a lot of,

2485
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:31,180
a lot of men in the armed forces and
women have an ideology that they believe

2486
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:31,490
in.

2487
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,410
It's this country.

2488
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,050
It's the things that they'll do
when they come in and they're,

2489
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,080
they're loyal servants,

2490
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,570
they risked their fucking
lives and they go do their job.

2491
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,770
And a lot of them get Maine,

2492
01:06:38,771 --> 01:06:39,581
they lose their arms,

2493
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:40,930
they lose their friends
and everything else.

2494
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,610
I think that when you start to look at
how this war's gone over the past 11

2495
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:46,210
years,

2496
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,740
and I'm talking about
the Palestine in Iraq,

2497
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:48,910
you've gotta be,

2498
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,691
you gotta be very,

2499
01:06:49,691 --> 01:06:54,220
very conscientious about not
only how this really started,

2500
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,083
who were the,

2501
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,410
who were the architects,

2502
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,760
who was the intellectual force,

2503
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,260
who was the argument behind it?

2504
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,000
How did this happen?

2505
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,980
How did this turn into a huge snowball?

2506
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:07,600
And the reason you should know about
that is because your lives and other

2507
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:09,490
people's lives depend on it in the future.

2508
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:09,970
Yeah.

2509
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:10,870
We just get ourselves,

2510
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,850
we'll get ourselves
into another situation.

2511
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:13,481
You know,

2512
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:14,130
my buddy,

2513
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,220
it's not weird though.

2514
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,330
That's what's really going on.

2515
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,930
I'm sorry.

2516
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:17,381
It's not,

2517
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,690
we're going to get ourselves
into another situation.

2518
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:20,770
Somebody else's going to do it.

2519
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:21,000
Well,

2520
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,833
my buddy,

2521
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:22,571
my buddy,

2522
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:25,030
I think I put it on on red bands a thing,

2523
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:25,960
but my best squad,

2524
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:28,960
but my buddy who I interviewed who was
a special forces guy who was a real,

2525
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:29,853
a real,

2526
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:30,940
I don't know what he does,

2527
01:07:30,941 --> 01:07:33,490
but I know he's very much involved
and he was the baddest guy I ever knew

2528
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:35,370
growing up and he said he,

2529
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,130
he was,

2530
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,840
he just said about the war effort.

2531
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,030
He watched what's happening,

2532
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,960
had been in Iraq for I guess
seven years and he said,

2533
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,330
Iraq is a country now.

2534
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:45,040
We've created a mini Saddam in this guy,

2535
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:45,874
Molokai.

2536
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,230
He is now,

2537
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,280
he's a Shiite.

2538
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:51,970
He is got police squads
that report directly to him.

2539
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,960
So what we,

2540
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,980
we go into Iraq.

2541
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,100
There's this notion that while he's got
the fourth largest army in the world,

2542
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:58,270
we've got to stop him from,

2543
01:07:58,271 --> 01:07:58,631
you know,

2544
01:07:58,631 --> 01:08:00,520
dropping a weapon and okayed his hands.

2545
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:01,630
There was the arguments and stuff.

2546
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,160
What we'd done in some ways,

2547
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:05,560
if you look at Iraq with the
exception of Kurdistan and stuff,

2548
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,990
is that we really destroyed that country.

2549
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:13,150
A lot of people are dead and we've put
into place somebody who is keeping his

2550
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:15,980
people or has a potential
of keeping his in

2551
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,100
the same kind of oppression
technically as Saddam did.

2552
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,410
Now what is the objective?

2553
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:22,244
What are we doing?

2554
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,070
Was this worth it wasn't worth
killing all those people.

2555
01:08:25,071 --> 01:08:28,400
Was it worth all those soldiers didn't
come back and many more who are wounded?

2556
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,980
That's the question and more importantly,

2557
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,630
what lessons can be learned?

2558
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:36,080
What do we have to learn
from Iraq and Afghanistan?

2559
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,140
What do we have to learn so we don't
get an arm ourselves into the situation

2560
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:39,530
again,

2561
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,390
sometimes wars,

2562
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,263
inevitable men.

2563
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:41,900
It is.

2564
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,430
That was an inevitable one.

2565
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,520
That was one that we got tricked into.

2566
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,040
Okay,

2567
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,810
but then how do we not get tricked the
next time we have the Internet now?

2568
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,680
I think we have a completely different
sort of playing field than what existed

2569
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,370
back when Bush and Cheney
dragged us into the Iraq war.

2570
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:01,580
I think the Internet has
evolved far past where it is.

2571
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:05,210
That's why things like wikileaks are
so terrifying to the powers that be,

2572
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,350
it's real hard to get away with
shit on the Internet to others.

2573
01:09:08,351 --> 01:09:10,130
So much countervailing information too.

2574
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,840
Like you get one argument
and you get another,

2575
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:13,820
but that's just debate.

2576
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:15,290
I'm talking about straight information.

2577
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:16,573
Um,

2578
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,870
I think that the,

2579
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,200
the access to information is ultimately
changing the world that we live in and

2580
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,580
it's happening so quickly.

2581
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:27,790
And these kinds of conversations really
weren't commonplace when we were kids.

2582
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:28,050
Yeah.

2583
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,240
Well we were 16 and 17.

2584
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:31,250
Our parents weren't having
these kinds of conversations.

2585
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,084
They just weren't,

2586
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:32,721
it's a,

2587
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:33,740
it's a different world.

2588
01:09:33,741 --> 01:09:38,030
We know more about how things work and
because of that it makes it harder and

2589
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:39,620
harder to accomplish fuckery.

2590
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,500
Still going still going on right now.

2591
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,580
But ultimately it's got to die
off in order for us to have,

2592
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:47,860
you know,

2593
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,190
uh,

2594
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:50,180
any sort of religious society,

2595
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:54,080
we're going to have to evolve past that
and realize just as you and I realize as

2596
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:58,670
friends and as members of our community
that it's not necessary and that that

2597
01:09:58,671 --> 01:09:59,630
kind of a,

2598
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,720
an energy that you put
out to control people.

2599
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:03,960
And to and into,

2600
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:04,730
to,

2601
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:09,730
to profit from other people's losses is
totally non beneficial to you as well.

2602
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,970
You just because you're pulling it off
under the guise of a corporation doesn't

2603
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:18,971
mean that you are immune to the negative
rebound of that because you're not,

2604
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,870
and you want to call it Karma,

2605
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,970
you want to call it what
goes around comes around,

2606
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:23,780
whatever you want to call it.

2607
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:24,613
It's real.

2608
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,071
Okay.

2609
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:26,090
I have experienced it.

2610
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:27,890
I am walking proof of it.

2611
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,840
My whole life is proof of it.

2612
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:32,540
I have been,

2613
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,121
I the,

2614
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:35,150
the negative things that
I've ever done in my life,

2615
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:40,151
I have felt in great deep detail and
rebounded as much as possible to turn that

2616
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:48,800
terrible feeling into positive energy.

2617
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:52,040
And that is why I've been a
happy person my whole life.

2618
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,800
But do you think that's because,

2619
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:54,970
cause I always wonder,

2620
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,590
I try to help people,

2621
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:58,570
a friend of mine who's going
through a tough time now and,

2622
01:10:58,990 --> 01:10:59,201
and I,

2623
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:00,000
and I realized that the,

2624
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,270
one of the reasons that he's going
through a hard time as he's not in any way

2625
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:07,330
actually really confronted and
asked himself what he wants.

2626
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:07,851
Yeah.

2627
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:08,684
You can't,

2628
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,160
you can't get a guy to do that though.

2629
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:10,660
But,

2630
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:12,560
but don't you think that will be success?

2631
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:13,440
Is the fact that you've already,

2632
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:17,520
you've always been able to
see and technicolor what
you wanted and what you want

2633
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,200
it to be or,

2634
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,770
or is that what you know what it is?

2635
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:20,350
Um,

2636
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,183
uh,

2637
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,940
first of all it's just pressing forward.

2638
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:28,970
That's constant doubt that that constant
need to write new shit to do different

2639
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,460
things to the constant
need to be in motion.

2640
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,780
The constant need to be doing something,

2641
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:37,170
whether it's doing Jujitsu or playing
pool or writing more jokes are getting

2642
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,350
onstage that forward momentum.

2643
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,880
That is a constant that,

2644
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:42,151
that,

2645
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:42,540
that,

2646
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,200
that is,

2647
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,880
that is the reason why
I've done everything.

2648
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,940
And you can transfer it.

2649
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:49,560
It's like the meal multi Musashi quote.

2650
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,880
And once you understand the way broadly,

2651
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:51,990
you can see it in all things.

2652
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:55,410
So like the idea that once you lock on
to what it is to really focus and get

2653
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:56,244
good at something,

2654
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,220
then you can keep,

2655
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,010
but it's also that it's really
satisfying to accomplish things.

2656
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,050
It's really satisfying to write things.

2657
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:05,700
It's really satisfying to do shows.

2658
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,560
I don't know even know why I did it,

2659
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:08,880
but I've always wanted to play the drums.

2660
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:09,391
So I've,

2661
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,860
I've been taking drums for a year now.

2662
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:15,150
It's actually changed not only
my comedy but my sports like,

2663
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:20,130
like I pick up on shit really fast now
because with the drums I'm having to do

2664
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,581
something.

2665
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:21,540
One thing with my foot,

2666
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:23,220
one thing with this thing
with this and one this,

2667
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,320
so my brain is firing,

2668
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:26,183
it's firing.

2669
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,990
So it's changed the way I read.

2670
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:29,260
It's changed the way I do stand up.

2671
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,150
It's really wild.

2672
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,120
I'm I,

2673
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,420
it's a really good mental and
I'm listening differently.

2674
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,130
I'm never going to be
in a band by the way.

2675
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:35,611
Right,

2676
01:12:35,611 --> 01:12:36,570
but you just enjoying it.

2677
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,710
I'm just enjoying love that.

2678
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,950
I think that's very important to
life and I think a lot of people,

2679
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:42,030
like there's,

2680
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,890
there's like a lot of people that have
falsely rewarded being a lazy cunt and

2681
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,290
it'll like,

2682
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,080
you'd rather just sit in front of the TV,

2683
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:49,410
chill,

2684
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:50,850
wouldn't beers watch TV?

2685
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,050
Let me tell you something.

2686
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,040
This is the real reality of,

2687
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,750
of life.

2688
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,810
If you don't earn something,

2689
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,460
you won't appreciate it.

2690
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,640
It's why people win the lottery and
they lose all their money within a year.

2691
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,450
When you earn something
you appreciated it is,

2692
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,010
it is a golden,

2693
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:13,050
steadfast rule of life and if you're
laying around on the couch watching TV and

2694
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:14,850
you haven't done anything to deserve that,

2695
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,260
getting drunk doesn't feel good.

2696
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,550
It doesn't feel good.

2697
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,031
It doesn't,

2698
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:19,230
you feel like a fucking loser.

2699
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,330
But when I do something,

2700
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:25,710
like if I write and I blast out like
three or four hours are really good shit

2701
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:26,120
and they're like,

2702
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,180
fuck yes,

2703
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:28,020
I feel good.

2704
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:28,981
I feel fired up.

2705
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:30,150
I can't wait to do a show.

2706
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,260
I can go watch TV and I can enjoy it.

2707
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:32,430
Yeah,

2708
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:36,090
I can go watch mountain men and I
enjoy watching these fucking guys.

2709
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:38,430
Here's what I think is really
like forks for me as I go,

2710
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,900
I sit down and I go like this.

2711
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:40,380
I go,

2712
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,130
what do I want to,

2713
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:44,040
what do I want to do and what
am I going to regret not doing?

2714
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:44,311
When I,

2715
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:46,410
when I'm 90 I say to myself,

2716
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:46,591
I go,

2717
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:47,430
what do I really want to do?

2718
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:50,190
And I go and what do I want to do in
three months or six months and stuff like

2719
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:50,401
that.

2720
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:51,540
And then I literally,

2721
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:54,360
I structure my day and I think you
can do this no matter who you are,

2722
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,560
you structure your day.

2723
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:56,394
So you go,

2724
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:57,660
you wake up every morning and go,

2725
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:58,590
what action.

2726
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,580
Just one action,

2727
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,450
maybe two actions,

2728
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:00,651
whatever.

2729
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:04,080
What action can I take today just
to get a little closer to that,

2730
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,453
that goal.

2731
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,350
I just want to just to
get a little closer,

2732
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:07,650
whatever,

2733
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:07,981
whatever,

2734
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:08,611
whatever it is.

2735
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:08,791
You know,

2736
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,590
maybe it's 20 minutes of practicing
your takedowns or it might be,

2737
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:13,270
I want to get my black belt in Jiu Jitsu.

2738
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:15,160
I want to be able to play drums in a band.

2739
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:15,380
I want to,

2740
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:15,591
you know,

2741
01:14:15,591 --> 01:14:16,424
whatever it might be.

2742
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,630
The only going to speak a language,

2743
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,673
you know,

2744
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,880
call me during my podcast.

2745
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:22,990
It's Brian Webb.

2746
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,600
Then

2747
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
maybe it's called and told
me what the shows down.

2748
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:28,871
Hey Boo,

2749
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:29,920
you live on the air.

2750
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,163
Okay.

2751
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,780
His mikes out.

2752
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,943
Okay.

2753
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:38,631
It's really quite well.

2754
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:39,680
He keeps backing up.

2755
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:40,580
That's what it is.

2756
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,573
Yeah.

2757
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,150
Sorry guys.

2758
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:44,780
Oh really?

2759
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,051
Yeah.

2760
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:46,130
You can't be talking back.

2761
01:14:46,131 --> 01:14:47,130
They're all casual pitch.

2762
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,390
Okay.

2763
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:47,960
I gotta get in.

2764
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:48,471
Thanks Brian.

2765
01:14:48,471 --> 01:14:51,530
This is technical information
delivered via telephone.

2766
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:52,364
Ladies and gentlemen,

2767
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,530
Brian Red Band on the scene.

2768
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,221
Follow him.

2769
01:14:55,221 --> 01:14:56,240
Red Ban on Twitter.

2770
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,380
All right buddy and me,

2771
01:14:57,381 --> 01:14:58,730
Brian Calix at Brian.

2772
01:14:58,731 --> 01:14:59,600
Count on Twitter.

2773
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,550
I respond to all my twitters by the way.

2774
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,873
What were we talking about?

2775
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,393
Very important probably.

2776
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,120
Um,

2777
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:05,751
but this,

2778
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:10,010
this idea that we were talking about
before of of community of you know,

2779
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:15,020
of all influencing each
other in a positive way that
gets lost in big numbers.

2780
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:19,670
And the problem is we could have a great
tribe of like 50 people and keep it

2781
01:15:19,671 --> 01:15:21,560
together and have the most awesome utopia.

2782
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:27,290
As I've heard boulder described boulders
like a really small mountain community,

2783
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:28,460
but it's so small.

2784
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:28,740
It's like,

2785
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:31,190
it really almost is like a
functional working utopia.

2786
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,440
But I think that we could do that.

2787
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,630
It's possible to do that as a country.

2788
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,250
We just have to get more people
in tuned to thinking correctly.

2789
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:44,120
And most people are just
never taught how to think.

2790
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,460
They're never taught that they
can manage their consciousness.

2791
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:47,540
They've never taught,

2792
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:52,570
they've never been taught that the
mind can go down that self-destructive,

2793
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:57,790
completely self destructive and also
totally unnecessary and you have to learn.

2794
01:15:57,861 --> 01:16:01,160
Like all the times I've blown my
cool for nothing and still do.

2795
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:05,560
I mean I might be in my car retard
and hit the Horn fucking pass money.

2796
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,160
It was just so pointless,

2797
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,100
so stupid.

2798
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,180
And that's near the airport and it's
almost always a sign that I'm doing too

2799
01:16:11,181 --> 01:16:11,540
much.

2800
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:14,000
It's always a sign of some
sort of external stress.

2801
01:16:14,001 --> 01:16:14,840
It's affecting,

2802
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:15,291
you know,

2803
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:16,124
whatever it is that,

2804
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,270
but when,

2805
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:19,490
when you can see that,

2806
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,440
if you can see that and if you
can go in the the right direction,

2807
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:29,030
if we could fucking influence a giant
group of people to go in the right

2808
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:29,720
direction,

2809
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,540
then you really can change something.

2810
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,470
Well that really can change tools.

2811
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,353
But that starts,

2812
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,550
that starts with individuals
really asking themselves,

2813
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,350
starts with saying with inspiration.

2814
01:16:39,351 --> 01:16:39,680
Yeah.

2815
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,420
It doesn't only start with individuals,

2816
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:42,590
ask themselves what they want.

2817
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:44,210
Sometimes it starts with inspiration.

2818
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,680
Where you realize there's no,

2819
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,120
there's no difference between them and me.

2820
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,260
They were losers too.

2821
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:48,710
I was,

2822
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:53,690
I've been a lose or I have been
a fucking failure in my life.

2823
01:16:53,691 --> 01:16:54,530
Hardcore.

2824
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:55,380
Like when people,

2825
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,390
I've had people say like,

2826
01:16:56,391 --> 01:16:57,530
here's your Obama on stage.

2827
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:58,040
I'm like,

2828
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,480
Oh my Christ that I bombed.

2829
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:00,950
I bombed so hard.

2830
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:02,000
I bombed so hard.

2831
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:06,740
No one who ever watched me that day would
have ever thought that I could ever be

2832
01:17:06,741 --> 01:17:07,574
funny.

2833
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,310
I had a girl send me a short film.

2834
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,980
Um,

2835
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:11,813
her name is Diana,

2836
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,990
and she sent me a film,

2837
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:14,590
uh,

2838
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,840
and she wrote it.

2839
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:16,900
She wrote a,

2840
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,721
basically a movie,

2841
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:21,080
a short film about her
experience with a guy on a date.

2842
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,340
And the guy was me.

2843
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,840
She never told me that.

2844
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:25,080
She sent it to me and I,

2845
01:17:25,081 --> 01:17:25,401
and I,

2846
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:27,440
and all the lines that guy was making,

2847
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:28,760
saying lines.

2848
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,750
I had said to her,

2849
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:31,490
and let me tell you something,

2850
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:31,910
man.

2851
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,230
I called her up and I went,

2852
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,771
Diana,

2853
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:34,011
I go,

2854
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:34,821
I'm so sorry.

2855
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,070
I was such a fucking arrogant prick.

2856
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,100
I was such a Dick because I didn't
even understand you are a woman.

2857
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:42,140
And I had a projected notion of what,

2858
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:42,860
what you were,

2859
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:46,610
what you thought and I thought I was so
much smarter than you were and you were

2860
01:17:46,611 --> 01:17:49,640
looking at me like I was a
Guinea pig in a fucking maze.

2861
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:50,000
Like a,

2862
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,140
like a rat in a maze.

2863
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:51,950
Like literally like,

2864
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,830
look at this monkey talk
to me like I'm an idiot.

2865
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,880
Yeah,

2866
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,511
exactly.

2867
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,910
And he's just hitting me with all
these things and he's just a dick.

2868
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,721
Literally.

2869
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:00,371
I looked at it,

2870
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:01,430
I was just appalled.

2871
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:05,000
I was appalled at who I was and it's
just cause I didn't know any better.

2872
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:05,571
I just didn't.

2873
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:09,260
I had preconceived notions of what women
were preconceived notions of how they

2874
01:18:09,261 --> 01:18:11,440
thought preconceived
notions of what a man was

2875
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:12,383
supposed to be.

2876
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,090
The all funds,

2877
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,280
by the time you get to your
20s and you know you're,

2878
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:17,870
you're having experiences with women,

2879
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,530
these are not the very first of all
social experiences when you're involving

2880
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,500
people that are sexually attracted
to each other are very complicated.

2881
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,820
They're very awkward.

2882
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,190
There's a plenty of room
for misunderstanding.

2883
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:31,310
There's plenty of room
for offending people,

2884
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,630
putting out bad vibes,

2885
01:18:32,631 --> 01:18:34,810
being too forward being too well,

2886
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,110
you know,

2887
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,330
hey,

2888
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:35,580
there's,

2889
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:35,871
it's,

2890
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:36,161
it's a,

2891
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:38,380
it's a very strange
sort of a situation way,

2892
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,400
so we're not good at navigating it,

2893
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,031
you know,

2894
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:41,291
and we,

2895
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:41,571
we,

2896
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:41,901
you know,

2897
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:42,501
when you're young,

2898
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:46,910
especially you just say the dumbest
fucking shit and most of the time you

2899
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:49,130
fucking hate yourself after
it's over and you don't,

2900
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,570
you don't,

2901
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,410
you didn't want to do that.

2902
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,280
It's just,

2903
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,640
it's like you being thrown in a major
league baseball game and someone telling

2904
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:56,570
you to hit that ball,

2905
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,040
that fucking things flying at me.

2906
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,570
That's exactly right.

2907
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,990
You're really not prepared
for that extreme experience.

2908
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:04,250
No manual for life.

2909
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,580
I mean,

2910
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,211
well not only that,

2911
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:05,421
I mean,

2912
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:06,550
how much did your fucking parent,

2913
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:07,730
I don't know how much
your parents taught you,

2914
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:09,500
but how much did your parents
teach you about dating?

2915
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:10,401
Oh,

2916
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:11,130
nothing.

2917
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,950
I was just talking about that with my son.

2918
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:13,280
I was like,

2919
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,300
I didn't really,

2920
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:18,080
I wasn't really taught the women
the complexity of the female psyche.

2921
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,630
I'm definitely going to have to
have a talk on my son about that.

2922
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,464
But yeah,

2923
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,610
that's going to be that it's,

2924
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:28,910
it's so important to try to actually
raise a kid that can understand what's,

2925
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:32,000
what's next on the horizon.

2926
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:33,800
Give them like a little
heads up of like what,

2927
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:34,940
this is what I went through.

2928
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,400
So this is probably that that
would have fucking help a lot.

2929
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:38,780
So when it comes to dating,

2930
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:41,420
parents didn't give me any dating advice.

2931
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,343
Also because you have,

2932
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:46,490
you also given a very weird archetypal
notion of what masculinity is too.

2933
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,760
Like that's also like being what,

2934
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:49,620
I didn't even know what a man,

2935
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,050
what a man to find was.

2936
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:51,621
It was difficult.

2937
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,350
I had an exam.

2938
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,161
What's to everybody?

2939
01:19:53,161 --> 01:19:53,731
It's different,

2940
01:19:53,731 --> 01:19:54,151
you know what I mean?

2941
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:56,130
What did it a man is does.

2942
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,180
This is what I believe a man is a person
who does what he wants and what makes

2943
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:00,571
him happy.

2944
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:03,990
As long as it's not hurting other people
and we'll actually follows through and

2945
01:20:03,991 --> 01:20:05,800
does what he wants as
opposed to someone who,

2946
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,643
someone's bitch,

2947
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,110
if,

2948
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,741
let me tell you something.

2949
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,760
If you're a gang guy,

2950
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:09,151
okay.

2951
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:11,670
And you're not out there blowing guys
because you're worried about what other

2952
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,360
people think.

2953
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,530
You're somebody bitch.

2954
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:13,800
Right?

2955
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,060
Whether you realize it or not.

2956
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:15,270
Yeah,

2957
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:18,840
you're the bitch of all the prejudice
people that want to stop people from being

2958
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:19,320
gangs.

2959
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,490
And if you are a man,

2960
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,930
you'd go out there and suck some cock.

2961
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:22,791
That's,

2962
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:23,640
that's reality.

2963
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:24,360
That's true.

2964
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,620
Because that's what life is.

2965
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,640
What I like you,

2966
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:27,690
you probably don't,

2967
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:31,830
but it's my right to like what I like
and being a man is going after what you

2968
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:35,490
like and if you want to fucking
take the easy way out and take some,

2969
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:40,640
some job that you know you can do instead
of pursue a career in writing books or

2970
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,770
pursue a career racing horses,

2971
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:46,650
whatever the fuck you're compelled to
Pressfield and going provide the best

2972
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:47,484
example he said,

2973
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,380
you may have your degree
in comparative literature,

2974
01:20:49,381 --> 01:20:52,410
you man a phd in comparative literature
and Teach Comparative Literature,

2975
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,250
but guess what?

2976
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,270
You should have written a novel.

2977
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,730
So that's just a form of
high tech procrastination,

2978
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,360
you know?

2979
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,171
So you're right.

2980
01:20:58,171 --> 01:20:58,381
I mean,

2981
01:20:58,381 --> 01:21:00,690
it's really a question of
going for what you want.

2982
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,763
And you know,

2983
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:06,180
a real man can be a guy who fights in
the cage or a guy who was a nurse in a

2984
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,110
fucking hospital,

2985
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,630
you know?

2986
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:08,180
Yes.

2987
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,710
Whatever it is you're doing
whatever you're supposed to do,

2988
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:12,330
wherever you're supposed
to place your energy,

2989
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,170
giving,

2990
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,790
helping and growing.

2991
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:15,460
Uh,

2992
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:15,800
that's,

2993
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,180
that's,

2994
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,430
that's what we need to teach kids.

2995
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:17,740
And that's,

2996
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,361
there's no,

2997
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:18,930
there's,

2998
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,790
there's no better or worse.

2999
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,230
If you're supposed to be a carpenter,

3000
01:21:22,231 --> 01:21:22,770
that's what,

3001
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:23,670
if you really enjoy it.

3002
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,910
I have a buddy who's a carpenter
back home and he's fucking loves it.

3003
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:27,840
He loves buildings,

3004
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,840
really loves the art of
putting together a great room.

3005
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,220
He loves it when it's done.

3006
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,150
He loves that he can,

3007
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:35,670
he'll look in this room
and it's all mapped out.

3008
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:37,080
You're following the architect's plans,

3009
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:37,261
you know,

3010
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:38,160
laying down things.

3011
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:38,994
And next thing you know,

3012
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,140
three months later,

3013
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,531
whatever it is,

3014
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:43,000
look what the fucking awesome
kitchen you guys just build.

3015
01:21:43,001 --> 01:21:43,830
Totally Shit.

3016
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,190
Like he gets a deep feeling of
satisfaction from that and he makes a good

3017
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:47,431
living.

3018
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:48,540
He's got a good company doing that,

3019
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,330
but that's it's because that's
what he's passionate about.

3020
01:21:51,331 --> 01:21:55,260
It's because he actually enjoys his work
and it doesn't matter if it's that or

3021
01:21:55,261 --> 01:21:57,270
if it's been in a fucking band or if it's,

3022
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:57,511
you know,

3023
01:21:57,511 --> 01:21:59,520
being a stand up or whatever it is.

3024
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:01,560
If you don't follow that shit,

3025
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,580
that's when you'll,

3026
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:02,820
you'll,

3027
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:03,061
you're,

3028
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:04,410
you're fucking yourself,

3029
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:04,910
man.

3030
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,380
Our dear friend Sam Sheridan said,

3031
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:08,520
he goes,

3032
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,600
I was talking about how I want it.

3033
01:22:09,601 --> 01:22:11,000
I was watching UFC
every time I watched it.

3034
01:22:11,001 --> 01:22:13,590
A little part of me dies because I want
to be a fight or something or you don't.

3035
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:13,981
I know,

3036
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:14,551
but that's what he said.

3037
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:14,761
He goes,

3038
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:15,091
Brian,

3039
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:15,301
he goes,

3040
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:16,134
Brian,

3041
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,000
you are supposed to,

3042
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,700
and I've always been supposed
to be a standup comic.

3043
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:21,210
Dude,

3044
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:22,710
you found what you're supposed to do.

3045
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,290
Did you,

3046
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:25,380
you were not supposed to be
a fighter or anything else.

3047
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:26,760
You weren't doing comedy.

3048
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,290
I remember you told me,

3049
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:28,500
you go,

3050
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,790
you're missing out on the
best thing in the world.

3051
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:30,091
What are you,

3052
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:30,720
what are you doing?

3053
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,280
I got back into it because of you,

3054
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,181
but I also,

3055
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:35,340
I remember watching Dane Cook
back in the day and I was like,

3056
01:22:35,341 --> 01:22:37,500
that dude is crushing a room and I want,

3057
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:39,870
I got to get back into this
because he wanted to crush.

3058
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:40,741
I just loved,

3059
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:41,251
I loved it.

3060
01:22:41,251 --> 01:22:41,551
I was like,

3061
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:42,600
I'm watching him map so much.

3062
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,513
Just stop.

3063
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,990
I don't know cause I'm crazy.

3064
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:46,301
Well,

3065
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:48,390
you weren't doing real
standup when I first met you.

3066
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,171
When I first met,

3067
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:50,640
you couldn't get spots and I was like,

3068
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:51,091
fuck it.

3069
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,230
And I was trying to be an actor.

3070
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,610
We first started hanging out.

3071
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:58,640
You had this act that was like you had
taken every alternative act that you saw

3072
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:00,120
and tried to duplicate it.

3073
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,950
And I remember talking to
you about it going guys,

3074
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:02,551
and even you,

3075
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:02,881
man,

3076
01:23:02,881 --> 01:23:03,541
what are you doing?

3077
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,200
You look you're,

3078
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,033
you're going up there.

3079
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:05,261
You're,

3080
01:23:05,261 --> 01:23:10,261
you're doing what these fucking Weirdo
judgmental like dorks want you to do,

3081
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,650
like you're doing what you think
they're going to enjoy from you.

3082
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:15,700
So satisfying to me now,

3083
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:19,030
especially about the stuff I'm doing now
is you're being yourself this weekend

3084
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,790
at the American comedy San Diego.

3085
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,421
Amazing Club,

3086
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:22,990
by the way,

3087
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,400
and it's filled with great comedy.

3088
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:24,701
If you're,

3089
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:25,900
if you're living in San Diego,

3090
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:30,340
San Diego finally has like a real
comedy club and a in Chicago,

3091
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:32,920
August 23rd they have national
headlines there every weekend.

3092
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,960
Look like the comedy store
in La Jolla is a great club,

3093
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:38,290
but you could get fucked there and they
could send down one of those old school

3094
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:41,710
headliners from like the 1970 [inaudible]
that has a written a joke in a hundred

3095
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,630
years when was work anywhere
else other than the comedy store.

3096
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,730
They'll send those down
to La Jolla on occasion.

3097
01:23:45,731 --> 01:23:47,050
I don't know if they're still doing that,

3098
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,260
but back in the day you would
look at the lineup and go,

3099
01:23:49,261 --> 01:23:50,410
oh my God,

3100
01:23:50,411 --> 01:23:50,831
no,

3101
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:51,970
that's the headliner.

3102
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,020
No,

3103
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:54,790
you almost wanted to like
call the people and go,

3104
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,870
please just stay on,

3105
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:58,660
because that show would be so bad.

3106
01:23:58,661 --> 01:23:58,961
It would,

3107
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:00,880
they would never want to go
see standup comedy again.

3108
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:01,061
No,

3109
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:01,870
and it's true.

3110
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,580
As you get older and if
you're trying to be a real,

3111
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:04,510
trying to do something,

3112
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:05,621
what happens?

3113
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:08,710
I think what's supposed to happen is you
become a comic is you start stripping

3114
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:13,711
away all that other stuff and more and
more of who you really are is kind of

3115
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:14,890
expressed.

3116
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:16,450
That's what's so satisfying to me,

3117
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:17,050
you know?

3118
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:17,291
Yeah,

3119
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:17,740
for sure.

3120
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:17,990
I mean,

3121
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,320
it's weird,

3122
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,160
but you're learning how to
talk on stage instead of,

3123
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:23,740
you were just like you
were when I first met you,

3124
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,110
you were doing this fake thing,

3125
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,960
rabbits out of hats,

3126
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:28,390
and then you became just
this like really silly guy.

3127
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,500
It was like really silly,

3128
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,960
but I was always weirded out by
the fact that you were so silly.

3129
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:35,590
But then we would have these deep fucking
intense conversations and I was like,

3130
01:24:35,591 --> 01:24:35,751
why?

3131
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:36,640
Where's that on stage?

3132
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,451
And then I thought about it,

3133
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:37,661
I'm like,

3134
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:37,811
well,

3135
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:38,051
you know,

3136
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:38,760
that's a choice.

3137
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:39,151
That's a,

3138
01:24:39,151 --> 01:24:40,270
an artistic thing.

3139
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,850
Like look at Hedberg one
of my favorite comics ever.

3140
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:43,960
And you know,

3141
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:46,750
there's a message in that it was all
silliness and there's nothing wrong with

3142
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:46,981
that.

3143
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:48,190
Like I'm a silly goose.

3144
01:24:48,191 --> 01:24:49,100
There's a large part of me.

3145
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:50,300
It's always I can't help it.

3146
01:24:50,301 --> 01:24:51,880
And it's funny that you're so intense.

3147
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:56,290
Often it's like there's a real balance
to that and it's a good quality that you

3148
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,930
have that it's missing in a lot of men.

3149
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,080
Would they somehow or another
equate weakness with silly?

3150
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:02,990
You know,

3151
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:03,791
because I don't think,

3152
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:06,520
I think the biggest mistake a man can
make his taking himself seriously.

3153
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,440
Don't take yourself too seriously,

3154
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:08,741
man.

3155
01:25:08,741 --> 01:25:09,850
There's always somebody faster,

3156
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:10,331
stronger,

3157
01:25:10,331 --> 01:25:10,720
funnier,

3158
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:10,961
better,

3159
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:11,760
smarter.

3160
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,161
It just,

3161
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:16,420
just do only what you can do and always
don't be afraid to fucking take the

3162
01:25:16,421 --> 01:25:17,350
pressure off yourself,

3163
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:17,621
man.

3164
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:20,260
Don't be afraid to kind of
just make fun of yourself.

3165
01:25:20,261 --> 01:25:21,190
There's nothing wrong with it.

3166
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:23,350
There's a lot of power in that you,

3167
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:23,621
yeah,

3168
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:27,460
you don't understand that when
you try to not take the hits,

3169
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,131
that the,

3170
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:29,730
the rebounds doubled,

3171
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:31,750
tripled the effect because
you're not learning.

3172
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,210
You're not only are
you not taking the hit,

3173
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,720
but you're not learning from the hit
because every time you take the hint,

3174
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,733
it makes you better.

3175
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:40,480
You got to take the head emotionally.

3176
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:42,490
You got to take the hit psychologically,

3177
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:43,900
you got to take the hit with your ego.

3178
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:45,910
You got to fucking fail in life.

3179
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,400
It's an important ingredient to success.

3180
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,410
The other thing that I was,

3181
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:49,990
don't you agree?

3182
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:52,960
I hundred percent agree with that
the a hundred percent and the other.

3183
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:54,550
The other thing that that the the,

3184
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,451
as you were talking,

3185
01:25:55,451 --> 01:25:57,070
I was thinking about the
other thing you get from it,

3186
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:58,180
which is when,

3187
01:25:58,181 --> 01:25:59,560
when you take,

3188
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:03,590
when you allow yourself to be a little
bit of a silly goose or you allow

3189
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,880
yourself to be vulnerable or
whatever it is and make fun yourself,

3190
01:26:07,050 --> 01:26:11,450
what will happen is it people around you
feel safer and what they'll do is they

3191
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:14,180
won't be on their guard because a
lot of times we come at a situation,

3192
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:16,640
if you come to a situation
from a power angle or whatever,

3193
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,970
that person's guard will go up immediately
and you won't see who they really

3194
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:20,260
are.

3195
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:20,410
Well,

3196
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:21,201
let's think about this.

3197
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:24,620
How disappointing is it when you meet
someone and you have like a level of

3198
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:25,610
adulation for them?

3199
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,091
You,

3200
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:26,301
you,

3201
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:26,541
you know,

3202
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:26,830
you're,

3203
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:27,591
they're famous.

3204
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:27,811
Your,

3205
01:26:27,811 --> 01:26:27,951
your,

3206
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:28,161
your,

3207
01:26:28,161 --> 01:26:30,110
your fan and they're a dick.

3208
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,890
The rebound is stunning.

3209
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,930
It's stunning and hurtful.

3210
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:36,381
I mean it's,

3211
01:26:36,381 --> 01:26:37,310
it's incredible.

3212
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:37,820
Yeah.

3213
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:39,350
But on the other side,

3214
01:26:39,351 --> 01:26:42,500
when you approach someone and
they're like really normal and nice,

3215
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,650
what a warm feeling that is.

3216
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:48,290
Like because you're coming
at them in an unfair way.

3217
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,140
It's like we had Bert Kreischer on the
icehouse chronicles and he was talking

3218
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:52,760
about his experience with Gene Simmons.

3219
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,230
And apparently he did that show,

3220
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:57,860
the expo and gene Simmons was
a fucking complete cunt to him.

3221
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:00,350
And Gene Simmons like
told him not to talk.

3222
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,273
I said yeah,

3223
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,620
told them he wouldn't be interviewing
him and he was gonna make this grill

3224
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:04,280
interview him.

3225
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,730
And he was a huge kiss fan before this.

3226
01:27:07,850 --> 01:27:08,840
So when this happened,

3227
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:11,300
it was completely devastating to Bert.

3228
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:11,630
Yeah.

3229
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:16,050
And having Burt relay this and then
having all of us share our experiences.

3230
01:27:16,051 --> 01:27:16,671
Like I was talking about,

3231
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:18,350
I met Robin Williams last week and,

3232
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:19,610
but he was like real normal,

3233
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:20,540
like really nice guy.

3234
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,531
But it was still,

3235
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:22,910
it was fucking Robin Williams,

3236
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:23,511
you know what I mean?

3237
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:24,920
Like he didn't have to be normal.

3238
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:26,330
And he didn't have to be a nice guy.

3239
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,030
It could have been weird because
when you meet someone like that,

3240
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:30,290
there's a weird imbalance.

3241
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,550
If you're talking to Tom Cruise,

3242
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:33,950
I don't care how many gay jokes you have
in the back of your head that you want,

3243
01:27:33,951 --> 01:27:35,450
those will pop into your
head when you meet him.

3244
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:36,051
You'll be like,

3245
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:36,501
Holy Shit,

3246
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,900
I hope you'll spend an hour and a half.

3247
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,570
I did a reading with him for three hours
and I spent an hour and a half of them

3248
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:42,500
at a party and believe me,

3249
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,261
I was like,

3250
01:27:43,261 --> 01:27:43,621
I was like,

3251
01:27:43,621 --> 01:27:43,700
oh,

3252
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,740
maybe he'll be my best friend by the way,

3253
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,341
and by the way,

3254
01:27:47,341 --> 01:27:48,100
I'm a straight guy.

3255
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:50,580
I think he's straight actually
shut your fucking mouth.

3256
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:50,761
Oh,

3257
01:27:50,761 --> 01:27:51,181
I know is.

3258
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:51,691
I'm looking,

3259
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:52,500
looking at him going,

3260
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,430
he's a really good looking guy.

3261
01:27:53,431 --> 01:27:53,701
I was like,

3262
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:54,090
you know what?

3263
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:54,781
He's Tom Cruise.

3264
01:27:54,781 --> 01:27:54,960
I mean,

3265
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,410
weren't really,

3266
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:55,981
we're talking,

3267
01:27:55,981 --> 01:27:56,880
we're having a good conversation.

3268
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,150
It's all a ruse wonder.

3269
01:27:58,151 --> 01:27:58,681
Like he was like,

3270
01:27:58,681 --> 01:27:59,220
Hey,

3271
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,050
I'll be your best friend you
make out with me for 10 minutes.

3272
01:28:01,051 --> 01:28:01,884
I'd be like,

3273
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:03,740
I got you make out with,

3274
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:08,910
I'd have to think about it because then
I can be best friends with why I think I

3275
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,350
may go Tom Cruise 1000% as a straight man.

3276
01:28:13,351 --> 01:28:14,100
You know why?

3277
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,480
Because I'd be able to tell you about it.

3278
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:17,430
Are you fucking kidding me?

3279
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,361
Are you kidding?

3280
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:19,050
Watch.

3281
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,883
Yeah.

3282
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,581
For the record,

3283
01:28:20,581 --> 01:28:21,210
for the record,

3284
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:22,200
open mouth.

3285
01:28:22,201 --> 01:28:22,651
I'd be like,

3286
01:28:22,651 --> 01:28:23,100
Tom,

3287
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:23,580
come over here.

3288
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:23,881
By the way.

3289
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:24,714
He's Kinda,

3290
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:25,680
he's Kinda pretty.

3291
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,191
So yes,

3292
01:28:26,191 --> 01:28:26,660
I would.

3293
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,160
Would you enforce your,

3294
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:31,460
weighed on him a little bit and press
him backwards just to make them a little

3295
01:28:31,461 --> 01:28:33,290
bend to your will without question.

3296
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:34,400
But I'd also be looking.

3297
01:28:34,401 --> 01:28:35,000
I did.

3298
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,690
You'd be

3299
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:37,990
phone call and make you
be the first of all.

3300
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,391
Come back.

3301
01:28:38,391 --> 01:28:38,631
And I go,

3302
01:28:38,631 --> 01:28:38,901
dude,

3303
01:28:38,901 --> 01:28:39,770
I sit down for a second.

3304
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:40,670
I've got some time.

3305
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:41,861
I'm straight,

3306
01:28:41,861 --> 01:28:42,380
man.

3307
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:47,380
I Bob slapped and I mean bubs slapped
for 10 minutes with Tom Cruise and his

3308
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:50,000
hands were really get made
that happen with John Travolta.

3309
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:51,710
We just have to put you in a proximity.

3310
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:52,311
Can't do it.

3311
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:54,020
He wouldn't do it with John is too gay.

3312
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:54,951
He's gay.

3313
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:55,161
Yeah.

3314
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:55,630
Shit,

3315
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:56,150
I'm not,

3316
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:56,731
I'm not gonna make it.

3317
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:57,820
And it's like what my agent sent me,

3318
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:58,340
uh,

3319
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,070
things violently to audition first.

3320
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:00,731
Queer's folk,

3321
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:01,050
you know,

3322
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:01,980
which was that show

3323
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,813
on showtime.

3324
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:03,140
And,

3325
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,580
and the first thing was I have
to be making out with this guy.

3326
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:05,941
I was like,

3327
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:06,570
listen,

3328
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:06,741
call,

3329
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:06,910
manage.

3330
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:07,171
And I go,

3331
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:07,440
look,

3332
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,221
I'm not a homophobe.

3333
01:29:08,221 --> 01:29:11,160
I'm really not and I'm actually in
favor of gay marriage and all that.

3334
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:11,640
I go,

3335
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,780
but I'm,

3336
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,770
you got to know who I am.

3337
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:18,450
I'm Brian Callan and I'm straight guy
and it can think I'm waking up every

3338
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:21,600
fucking morning at 6:00 AM and going
to set and making that with some dude.

3339
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:22,291
Uh,

3340
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:22,741
after,

3341
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:23,880
after getting rid of my coffee breath,

3342
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:27,000
you're out of your fucking mind and
there's not enough money that I would do

3343
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:27,450
that with.

3344
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:31,320
Here's the problem with this is one of
the reasons why I wouldn't be doing it.

3345
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:33,150
It's not that I'm not open minded,

3346
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:35,520
but I don't like watching gay guys kiss.

3347
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,090
So I don't want to do a movie where guys,

3348
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,350
kids kind of movie squeamish about it.

3349
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,213
You wanted me to do.

3350
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:43,500
I never saw,

3351
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,760
I never saw Brokeback mountain.

3352
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:45,630
Actually I saw it,

3353
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,291
which was awesome.

3354
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:47,790
I had a great five and a bit about it.

3355
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:49,440
He's fucking hilarious.

3356
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:51,150
I laughed through so much to that movie.

3357
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:52,080
The child.

3358
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,150
We know why because I
enjoyed it and people were,

3359
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:54,871
there was a lot,

3360
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:56,160
I had this conversation
with someone who like,

3361
01:29:56,161 --> 01:29:56,401
you know,

3362
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:57,091
like well you know,

3363
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,400
it's because of your narrow mighty
point of view that you didn't enjoy it.

3364
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,050
I enjoyed the fuck out of it.

3365
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,090
I bet I enjoyed it more than you.

3366
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,661
Okay.

3367
01:30:03,661 --> 01:30:05,220
Cause I enjoyed it as even if,

3368
01:30:05,221 --> 01:30:05,580
yes,

3369
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:09,630
it is a beautiful love story and
it is sad and oddly romantic.

3370
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:09,870
Yeah.

3371
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:11,760
It's still also hilarious.

3372
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:13,470
I enjoy both aspects of it.

3373
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:15,300
I'm not closed minded or homophobic,

3374
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:18,480
but I enjoyed the love thing
that they had going on.

3375
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,270
But I also enjoyed Caitlin
like a fucking school child.

3376
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:22,500
Every time they were kissing each other.

3377
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:26,790
I remember you were like two men
making out is in fact hilarious.

3378
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:28,351
It's hilarious.

3379
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:28,681
It's not,

3380
01:30:28,681 --> 01:30:30,150
there's nothing wrong with it being funny.

3381
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,830
It's not like I'm
telling you not to do it.

3382
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,960
But if you're telling me there
should be less funny in the world,

3383
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,200
you can go fuck yourself.

3384
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,370
And if you're telling me
that what you want to do,

3385
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,510
if I think it's funny,

3386
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,403
hurts you,

3387
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,820
I think you're a bitch.

3388
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:42,391
Okay?

3389
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:45,120
Because if you start making
fun of having sex with girls,

3390
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:45,850
ah,

3391
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,480
I'm not going to hurt feelings,

3392
01:30:47,481 --> 01:30:48,060
not gonna get hurt.

3393
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:48,371
Look what?

3394
01:30:48,371 --> 01:30:49,260
You're a majority.

3395
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:50,094
There are minority.

3396
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,630
Get the fuck over it.

3397
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,430
If you like fucking guys,

3398
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,660
you should laugh your ass off when
dudes talking about you fucking guys.

3399
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:57,780
Cause that's what you enjoy.

3400
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:00,150
Humor is the greatest fucking equalizer.

3401
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:00,690
Speaking of,

3402
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,261
speaking of which,

3403
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:01,741
you'll kill me,

3404
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:02,311
but I have to go.

3405
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:03,600
No 10 minute podcasts,

3406
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:05,120
podcasts go fuck itself too.

3407
01:31:05,121 --> 01:31:05,371
You know?

3408
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:08,000
But I got to do it because they're waiting
for me and I gotta be there at seven.

3409
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,620
You're going in late,

3410
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:08,970
late.

3411
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:09,880
You're going to be late morning.

3412
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,053
They're going to kill me.

3413
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:11,880
There'll be fun.

3414
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,541
No they're not.

3415
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:13,374
I've kind of fun.

3416
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,460
I love it,

3417
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:14,910
man.

3418
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:15,540
Listen,

3419
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,590
we have to keep the throwing
for a little while longer.

3420
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:21,580
10 minutes to talk about you being an
American comedy company in San Diego's we,

3421
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:21,800
yes,

3422
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,420
I'll be at the American
comedy club comedy company.

3423
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,990
It's for American comedy
company as soon as he goes.

3424
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:27,421
What's called,

3425
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:27,631
right?

3426
01:31:27,631 --> 01:31:28,980
Or is it the American comedy club?

3427
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,640
You might,

3428
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,560

3429
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,011

Everybody.

3434

August 23rd 24th now you're
confusing the fuck out of people.

3435
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:39,591
Do it.

3436
01:31:39,591 --> 01:31:41,340
Don't you don't remember
seeing more than one.

3437
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:41,880
Just one.

3438
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,510
Just one.

3439
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:44,220
It's American comedy company.

3440
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,000
Oh it is?

3441
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,450
Yes.

3442
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,283
American comedy.

3443
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,510
I can't wait since San Diego,

3444
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:49,344
California.

3445
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,450
So fucking awesome club.

3446
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:56,520
It's one of those like really
low ceiling intimate clubs that,

3447
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:57,330
you know,

3448
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:59,440
like the comedy works in Denver.

3449
01:31:59,460 --> 01:31:59,800
Okay.

3450
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,850
Like the old comedy.

3451
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,140
The comedy works in Denver.

3452
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,093
Oh yeah.

3453
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,551
It's good.

3454
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:04,360
As it gets.

3455
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,460
Me and Doug Benson and Brendan Walsh,

3456
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:08,430
we were in town in this way.

3457
01:32:08,431 --> 01:32:10,320
And you got to at the paramount and a,

3458
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:11,170
one of the things we're saying,

3459
01:32:11,171 --> 01:32:14,080
we're walking by the comedy works
like there's no better club.

3460
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:15,600
There's never been a better club event.

3461
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:16,780
And then the comedy works in Denver.

3462
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,950
It's perfect.

3463
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:19,740
Size is the perfect height.

3464
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:21,280
Shamirs don't move.

3465
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,350
Nobody can move the chair on your foot.

3466
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,610
The chairs are locked in place.

3467
01:32:24,611 --> 01:32:26,050
There's a table in between each chair.

3468
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,250
Sit the fuck down.

3469
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,120
Here's the show.

3470
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,500
Everybody's packed in there.

3471
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:30,490
The wage staffs.

3472
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,270
Awesome.

3473
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:32,470
The shows are fantastic.

3474
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:33,700
You walked by the comedy works,

3475
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,330
you look and you see one headliner after
another national name after national

3476
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:39,250
name and she's an individual.

3477
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:40,600
She's not like the Improv.

3478
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:42,580
She's not a part of a giant
corporation when he is,

3479
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:43,510
the shit is great.

3480
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:44,381
I love that lady.

3481
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:44,710
Right?

3482
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,730
If you're listening Wendy,

3483
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:46,350
you're the shit.

3484
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,183
You are the best.

3485
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,540
Fucking tremendous.

3486
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:50,470
And she's got another one.

3487
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,000
I had such a good time.

3488
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,600
Well Denver is fucking awesome period.

3489
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:57,680
And the paramount was awesome
too and thanks to everybody.

3490
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:58,481
I've always wondered,

3491
01:32:58,481 --> 01:32:59,051
I've always wondered,

3492
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:00,040
this is gonna sound so weird,

3493
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,630
but I've always wondered like what?

3494
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:05,410
Like with a building like that with
all that laughter over all those years,

3495
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:10,220
like a wonder and then you take something
terrible like the torture chambers of

3496
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:13,960
like I will gray or something that the
Saddam kept all his people and stuff.

3497
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,240
I wonder what the composition of that,

3498
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:17,740
the the walls.

3499
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,720
I wonder if there's
anything that permeates,

3500
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:21,580
I mean this hocus pocus bullshit,

3501
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:26,140
but I've always wondered if if in some
ways the material like of the of the

3502
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:27,190
organic material,

3503
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:31,690
like the wood would be a different kind
of composition then in a torture chamber

3504
01:33:31,691 --> 01:33:33,000
or something is on there.

3505
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,830
All that positive energy versus
all that negative energy.

3506
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:39,940
You know the weird thing
message in the water,

3507
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:44,770
a documentary is that the Japanese game
frogs all bullshit really killed me.

3508
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,350
It was all fucking horse shit.

3509
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:47,020
God Damn it.

3510
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:47,540
I looked into,

3511
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:47,801
I was like,

3512
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:47,921
oh,

3513
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:49,890
you guys were lying to me and that movie,

3514
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,630
the whole fucking liars who made that.

3515
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,840
I know that there's,

3516
01:33:56,290 --> 01:34:00,280
there's places like the ice house is a
perfect example that there's been so much

3517
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:03,130
laughter in that place that
it feels good going in.

3518
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,840
I don't know if that's my
personal association though.

3519
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:09,400
And it very likely could if you led
me into that place from the outside

3520
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:13,640
blindfolded and I thought I was in a
bakery and you know it's all association

3521
01:34:13,641 --> 01:34:14,261
cause my friend,

3522
01:34:14,261 --> 01:34:15,094
how about this?

3523
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,990
My friends a surfer was
a competitive surfer.

3524
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:17,710
Right.

3525
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:20,950
When when she hears waves for most of us,

3526
01:34:20,951 --> 01:34:22,120
waves are like relaxing.

3527
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:23,530
Her heart starts beating really fast.

3528
01:34:23,531 --> 01:34:24,364
She gets really nervous.

3529
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:24,911
Yeah,

3530
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:25,780
that totally makes sense.

3531
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,310
Waves she gets,

3532
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:29,060
she gets scared and competitive and she,

3533
01:34:29,061 --> 01:34:29,801
she can't relax.

3534
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:30,280
She's like,

3535
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,280
she's in fight mode cause she knows
that she's about to attack away.

3536
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:33,911
Well you know,

3537
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:38,530
when I was a kid for years I couldn't go
to fights because I didn't like the way

3538
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:39,050
it felt.

3539
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,401
That's right.

3540
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:40,670
I got real nervous.

3541
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:41,440
I would like,

3542
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,660
I would think that I was supposed
to fight next and I would,

3543
01:34:43,661 --> 01:34:45,430
and that it was just a weird part of me.

3544
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,660
Like I will try to enjoy it.

3545
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,560
But there was like,

3546
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,580
until I was like in my thirties until I
had really resolved the fact that it was

3547
01:34:51,581 --> 01:34:52,930
no longer going to compete.

3548
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:53,700
You know,

3549
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,320
I would get nervous first live event.

3550
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:59,900
It's the first I've ever been
to where I was totally relaxed.

3551
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:00,380
Really.

3552
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,213
I would go to UFC.

3553
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:01,550
I,

3554
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,390
the reason I don't go to USC,

3555
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,370
I can only get tickets
from you and by the way,

3556
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:04,851
congrats it.

3557
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:06,100
Donald Cerrone who came to my standards.

3558
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:06,950
It's exciting.

3559
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:08,900
That motherfucker so well.

3560
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:09,710
He's so awesome.

3561
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:10,543
Whoo.

3562
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,060
What a round that.

3563
01:35:12,061 --> 01:35:13,820
That was 70 seconds of crazy.

3564
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:14,660
One of my favorite things,

3565
01:35:14,661 --> 01:35:15,560
I was doing standup and I,

3566
01:35:15,561 --> 01:35:18,350
they came to the comedy works in Denver
and I could see Donald's Ronnie's hat

3567
01:35:18,351 --> 01:35:21,050
going up and down laughing at
my jokes and afterward he goes,

3568
01:35:21,051 --> 01:35:21,321
dude,

3569
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:23,810
my fucking abs came in fucking ab workout.

3570
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,080
Him and Nate Marquardt an underwear model
to study the girls I was with like my

3571
01:35:29,631 --> 01:35:30,680
friend's wife and my,

3572
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,520
my girl,

3573
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,480
they were like looking at,

3574
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:33,530
they were looking at Donald.

3575
01:35:33,531 --> 01:35:34,280
They literally like,

3576
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,480
like my friend's wives.

3577
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:35,930
They were like,

3578
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:36,351
that guy.

3579
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:37,220
I just want to touch him.

3580
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:41,810
There was an inappropriate around
him because he's a handsome fuck.

3581
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:42,381
Isn't that weird?

3582
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:46,080
When guys wives get creeper dudes
like right in front of them.

3583
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:48,840
When you got an Alpha
male like fucking dog dad.

3584
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,370
It's when you have such a disrespectful
relationship that a lot of people engage

3585
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,580
in this like over relationship.

3586
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,040
Yeah.

3587
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,720
Well a lot of people
have that weird own salt.

3588
01:35:56,721 --> 01:35:56,961
You,

3589
01:35:56,961 --> 01:35:59,990
you'll insult me and you know you
go back and forth a little bit.

3590
01:35:59,991 --> 01:36:00,500
It's not,

3591
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,910
you're not in each other's corners.

3592
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:02,421
You know,

3593
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:03,290
looking out for each other.

3594
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:05,020
You got a bad relationship
and you're just,

3595
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:08,030
you haven't worked it out
and you're not trying to,

3596
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,730
he just stuck in this little
fucking ins and they're round,

3597
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:10,971
man,

3598
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:11,181
man,

3599
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:11,950
they'll grow up on you.

3600
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:13,520
I will take pictures and squeeze.

3601
01:36:13,521 --> 01:36:14,510
My hand was coming up to me.

3602
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:14,721
Go on.

3603
01:36:14,721 --> 01:36:16,070
I want to talk to him and say hi to him.

3604
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:16,880
I want to meet him.

3605
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:17,151
I'm like,

3606
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:18,110
your husband is right there.

3607
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:18,650
She's like,

3608
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,430
look at his ass,

3609
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,701
his ass.

3610
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:20,290
They were like levered.

3611
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:20,980
They were all over.

3612
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,190
All those kicks that he throws

3613
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:24,763
that he is,

3614
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:27,380
that he is fucking ready.

3615
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,430
That was holy Shit.

3616
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:31,730
That was a crazy fight and it was right
when I had just got done saying that he

3617
01:36:31,731 --> 01:36:32,840
has to be very carefully,

3618
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,440
can't get overconfident because Melvin
can fuck you up with one punch and then

3619
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,820
oh so explosive.

3620
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:38,571
Oh my God,

3621
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:39,141
I left Hook.

3622
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:40,250
Melvin landed too.

3623
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:40,940
That could,

3624
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:43,690
and Donald kept it together
cause he got find out,

3625
01:36:43,691 --> 01:36:44,790
you said when will you,

3626
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,740
when were you okay after that punch.

3627
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:47,583
And he goes,

3628
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,530
yeah,

3629
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:49,430
he was not okay.

3630
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,840
And he's still through the kick.

3631
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:53,300
See that's how confident
he is in his ground games.

3632
01:36:53,301 --> 01:36:54,380
One of the things about Serone,

3633
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,680
I love that he'll fucking
let those kicks fly man.

3634
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:58,970
Cause if you take him down,

3635
01:36:58,971 --> 01:36:59,360
man,

3636
01:36:59,360 --> 01:36:59,511
it's,

3637
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:01,580
chances are he's going to
threaten you from the bottom.

3638
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:02,990
He doesn't get grounded pounded now.

3639
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:05,600
And he threatens dude's
when triangle arm bars.

3640
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:06,531
He's not just long,

3641
01:37:06,531 --> 01:37:07,880
he goes for it man.

3642
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,200
He attacks the attacks
on the ground so he,

3643
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:11,630
he's not holding back.

3644
01:37:11,631 --> 01:37:15,530
So he's willing to throw even after
getting tagged light to that way still

3645
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:16,580
throws a head kick.

3646
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:20,360
But 55 is so I want to
see him fight Jose Aldo.

3647
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,030
It's great as if to five we'll,

3648
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:24,260
although is most likely going
to move to 55 eventually,

3649
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:25,090
he's still young.

3650
01:37:25,090 --> 01:37:27,650
That's only 25 and he's having
a hard time making weight,

3651
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:31,250
although he's had a less of a hard time
of it lately because he cut back on the

3652
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:33,650
weightlifting [inaudible] weightlifting.

3653
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,170
He was a bulking up in between,

3654
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:36,591
you know,

3655
01:37:36,591 --> 01:37:36,890
uh,

3656
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,360
fights and putting on mass and then the
cut was harder for 55 is just a division

3657
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,940
of killers.

3658
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:43,110
Well,

3659
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:44,060
so it's 45,

3660
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:44,330
man,

3661
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:45,230
it's already five shit.

3662
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,450
Every and every weight class is growing,

3663
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:47,841
you know,

3664
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:49,520
like 35 is growing now.

3665
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:50,443
There's this like,

3666
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,770
there's this Eric Perez Kid.

3667
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:53,150
Therefore this weekend there's like,

3668
01:37:53,151 --> 01:37:54,260
it's constant.

3669
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:54,591
This,

3670
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:55,170
uh,

3671
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:57,450
there's so many fucking good fighters,

3672
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:57,691
man.

3673
01:37:57,691 --> 01:37:58,071
It's the,

3674
01:37:58,071 --> 01:37:58,221
the,

3675
01:37:58,221 --> 01:37:58,431
the,

3676
01:37:58,431 --> 01:38:00,480
the whole like division,

3677
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:01,800
like the whole UFC,

3678
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:05,880
like every single division is expanding
and getting deeper and deeper and

3679
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:06,390
deeper.

3680
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:08,820
The heavyweight division is getting
deeper and deeper and deeper.

3681
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:11,790
They're going to have Cain Velasquez
vs junior dos Santos on New Year's Eve.

3682
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:12,751
Really?

3683
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:13,090
Didn't they?

3684
01:38:13,090 --> 01:38:15,090
Fuck ass dude.

3685
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:17,610
It's going to be on the 29th and the
30th day going to have a rematch.

3686
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:18,961
You have to,

3687
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:20,520
Cain destroyed bigfoot.

3688
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,830
Cain just ran through big foot Silva.

3689
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,810
Just cut them up the last
of them on the ground.

3690
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,011
That's not,

3691
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:26,844
that's such a good,

3692
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,273
oh,

3693
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,750
I'm glad I'm not a fighter man.

3694
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,120
That's just every time
you step in that octagon,

3695
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:33,954
you're going to war.

3696
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:36,000
This is what we talked about earlier.

3697
01:38:36,001 --> 01:38:36,231
It's,

3698
01:38:36,231 --> 01:38:40,410
it has to be what you really want to do
and has to be what you're really driven

3699
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:40,771
to do.

3700
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:43,130
It has to be your calling
and if it's not your calling,

3701
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,180
you better get the fuck out of there
because there's a guy like junior dos

3702
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:47,730
Santos near the end of the
ring and it is his calling.

3703
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,740
What Anderson Silva steps in that cage.

3704
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,840
He doesn't wish she was
in a fucking Marajhi band,

3705
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,130
no Mariachi,

3706
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:53,920
whatever.

3707
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:54,220
He says,

3708
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,140
he's ready to fuck you up.

3709
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:55,861
That's what he's there for.

3710
01:38:55,861 --> 01:38:56,694
That's what he does.

3711
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:58,260
He's not supposed to
be doing anything else,

3712
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,060
you know,

3713
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:00,770
and the,

3714
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:03,990
the margin for error now is
so small with these guys.

3715
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,823
They're so good.

3716
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:05,903
Some of these guys,

3717
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:09,060
the level is insane and the levels
increasing constantly between,

3718
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:09,331
um,

3719
01:39:09,331 --> 01:39:12,900
when I was watching the speed difference
between Serone and Gallard and the

3720
01:39:12,901 --> 01:39:15,040
fights before was astronomical.

3721
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,880
They were both throwing hay makers,

3722
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:18,331
you know,

3723
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:21,150
and that is part of it is that
they were throwing the kids,

3724
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:22,560
they knew each other very well.

3725
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:24,420
I can't believe God went
down there and it was so,

3726
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:25,350
it's such a vicious thing.

3727
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:26,280
He was really bad.

3728
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,650
Well Donald hit him absolutely perfectly.

3729
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:31,260
He climbed them with the
left Shin to the head.

3730
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:33,660
He likes that left high
kick with the switch.

3731
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:36,000
He throws that so well to the head man.

3732
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:37,320
It's such a powerful shot.

3733
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,270
A lot of guys don't throw it that hard.

3734
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:41,100
So there's dude's that
stand there and they,

3735
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:43,050
and they'll take one
of those on the gloves,

3736
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:43,501
you know,

3737
01:39:43,501 --> 01:39:45,570
they'll kind of like
recognize that it's coming,

3738
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,490
but they'll still try to avoid it.

3739
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:50,400
Instead try to try to move like
you can't do it to Anderson.

3740
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,121
Like you try it.

3741
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:53,040
Like rich Franklin tried
the high switch crack on.

3742
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:55,200
I understand innocent season coming
knows what you're going to do.

3743
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:58,440
And just bans and slides off his
shoulder and he looks right at me.

3744
01:39:58,441 --> 01:39:59,010
Your tricks,

3745
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:01,080
he's the fucking matrix is incredible.

3746
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:03,780
But Serone he's got so much
power in it and he's so,

3747
01:40:03,781 --> 01:40:04,560
he's got so,

3748
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,180
so much dexterity with his legs.

3749
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,770
It just calling,

3750
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,500
it just come.

3751
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,360
It's almost like,

3752
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:10,800
it's shocking how quick it guests.

3753
01:40:10,801 --> 01:40:12,510
They're so confident in this phone man.

3754
01:40:12,511 --> 01:40:14,580
And he was very confident and
in the right hand he laughed.

3755
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:17,040
It landed afterwards was just a bomb.

3756
01:40:17,041 --> 01:40:18,080
It was just pinpoint.

3757
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,100
It was like boom.

3758
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:22,020
It was like flying at him.

3759
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:24,330
All his power directly on the jaw.

3760
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:26,030
And that was the knock next.

3761
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:26,890
Uh,

3762
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:27,390
Nate does.

3763
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:28,230
Nate Diaz does.

3764
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,153
Oh boy.

3765
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:30,300
That's going to be incredible.

3766
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:30,880
I love,

3767
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,140
yeah.

3768
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,070
Well that was a tough fight,

3769
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:32,251
man,

3770
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:34,680
that a lot of people thought
Frankie Edgar won that fight.

3771
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,880
Almost unanimously.

3772
01:40:35,881 --> 01:40:40,290
The professionals on Twitter thought
that he wanted that time at that.

3773
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:42,600
He's the toughest small guy in the world.

3774
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:43,910
Fred gaggers a motherfucker,

3775
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:44,280
dude,

3776
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:44,840
I,

3777
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:45,120
you know,

3778
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:45,360
look,

3779
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,970
I thought he won the fight
afterwards by decision,

3780
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:48,470
but it was,

3781
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:52,400
it w I would have to honestly
go back and watch it again and,

3782
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:52,691
and,

3783
01:40:52,691 --> 01:40:56,860
and score it with my mouth shut to make
an accurate assessment of whether or not

3784
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:59,140
my feelings after the
fight or over or accurate.

3785
01:40:59,520 --> 01:40:59,920
You know,

3786
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,580
I think I'm really careful about saying
what I think when it's real close fight

3787
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:06,850
like that until I actually sit down
and watch it as if I was scoring it.

3788
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,430
Because if you're watching
it as a commentator,

3789
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:10,870
you're also involved in it.

3790
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:12,340
You're trying to be entertaining,

3791
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:12,671
you know,

3792
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:16,600
I'm trying to like explain what's going
on and I don't have to like in order to

3793
01:41:16,601 --> 01:41:21,601
do that and do like a really effective
calculation of whether or not one person,

3794
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:23,021
one or the other,

3795
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:25,180
especially when it's close because it was,

3796
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,530
the fight unquestionably was close.

3797
01:41:27,531 --> 01:41:28,620
There's no doubt about it.

3798
01:41:28,621 --> 01:41:30,160
It was a very close fight.

3799
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:31,390
No doubt about it.

3800
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:33,490
The people thought Henderson
wanted agree with that.

3801
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:35,260
The people who've thought
Edgar wanted agree with that.

3802
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:37,390
It was a tightly contested fight.

3803
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,790
So to really watch that and judge it,

3804
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:42,700
you got to really shut your fucking
mouth and sitting there with a pad,

3805
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:43,360
another game,

3806
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,920
and you've got to mark things down.

3807
01:41:44,921 --> 01:41:48,670
And if you had the best would be if the
judges had access to the information

3808
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:50,470
that Goldie and I have access to,

3809
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,590
like we have access to all the takedown,

3810
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:56,860
like the end of the round [inaudible]
thing that comes up fairly recently in the

3811
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:57,510
last few fights.

3812
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,460
Who Screen?

3813
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:00,460
Who Does it?

3814
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,510
It's UFC staff.

3815
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,830
So the production staff,

3816
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,030
it's catching everything.

3817
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:06,380
They're counting strikes and
there there's a whole like,

3818
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:07,270
you know,

3819
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:10,870
segment of the show where
they'll go to effective strikes,

3820
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:11,621
take down attempts,

3821
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:12,454
submission attempts.

3822
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:17,350
So we get to look at hard numbers as well
as like our gut feeling about things.

3823
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,380
Like there's sometimes a guy will land
like little pitty pat shots in Atlanta,

3824
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:21,010
a bunch of them,

3825
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,110
but the other dude lands one haymaker.

3826
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:25,630
Well that haymaker is worth
more than those pitty pat shots.

3827
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:28,720
So sometimes numbers
don't necessarily mean,

3828
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:33,640
but it's good to have that information
to add in addition to your calculations

3829
01:42:33,641 --> 01:42:34,600
on how you feel about it.

3830
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:35,261
Just watching it.

3831
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:35,590
Right.

3832
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:38,740
So you need almost more than
you watching it on your own.

3833
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:39,880
Because I'm not just watching it,

3834
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,490
I'm getting fed information
as I'm watching it.

3835
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,560
That's ideal for a judge.

3836
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,850
Not that it would really,

3837
01:42:45,851 --> 01:42:46,270
you know,

3838
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:47,103
I just,

3839
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:49,810
not that it wouldn't help to clean house
and just get people in and know what

3840
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:51,430
the fuck is going on in an actual fight.

3841
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:52,720
That certainly would be,

3842
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:56,050
but I also think they need access
to information the way we have.

3843
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,900
They finally gave them
monitors to get monitors now,

3844
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,040
which is very nice surprise.

3845
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:01,970
They finally gave it.

3846
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:02,650
Yeah.

3847
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:03,520
Not Everywhere,

3848
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:05,590
but we've done it in certain places.

3849
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,420
Emotion would strike very important.

3850
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,910
Very important as well as
to have angles on shots.

3851
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:10,241
You know,

3852
01:43:10,241 --> 01:43:13,750
there's sometimes it looks like a
guy landed when really the guy fell,

3853
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:14,800
the guy slips.

3854
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:15,330
You know,

3855
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:15,670
there's,

3856
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,020
there's all sorts of weird jobs.

3857
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,261
No,

3858
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:17,970
it's not.

3859
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,500
It's very hard and it's not
rewarded when they're good at it.

3860
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,130
No,

3861
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:22,720
it's the only critique
when they suck at it.

3862
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,261
You know,

3863
01:43:23,261 --> 01:43:23,431
I'm,

3864
01:43:23,431 --> 01:43:23,651
I'm,

3865
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:24,640
I swear to God man,

3866
01:43:24,641 --> 01:43:24,871
when,

3867
01:43:24,871 --> 01:43:25,661
when I have a weekend,

3868
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:30,090
like this weekend where we did the
show at the paramount and we did the,

3869
01:43:30,091 --> 01:43:31,120
the comedy works in Denver,

3870
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:31,181
uh,

3871
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:32,500
meet all these cool people and everything.

3872
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:35,980
It really does feel like this
crazy fucking dream life,

3873
01:43:35,981 --> 01:43:36,550
man.

3874
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,780
It's so fun.

3875
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:39,640
Everything is so fun.

3876
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:41,140
You've earned it and you've created,

3877
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:42,760
nobody earns this dude.

3878
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,530
Nobody deserves this.

3879
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,900
This is some crazy lucky shit.

3880
01:43:46,901 --> 01:43:49,330
It ain't just that you earned it
because it didn't even exist before.

3881
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:51,760
It's not like you say you
earn being the commentator,

3882
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,151
but you know what I'm saying.

3883
01:43:53,151 --> 01:43:53,591
Before it,

3884
01:43:53,591 --> 01:43:54,920
before I was the commentator,

3885
01:43:54,921 --> 01:43:56,330
the other people had done it.

3886
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:57,350
But I'm saying before,

3887
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,290
when I was a young man thinking
about this as an aspiration,

3888
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:02,030
this job didn't even exist.

3889
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,680
You know,

3890
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:03,513
like that's just,

3891
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,060
I remember when you got it,

3892
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:05,690
that's like,

3893
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:05,841
Hey,

3894
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:06,021
I'm,

3895
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:06,251
I'm,

3896
01:44:06,251 --> 01:44:06,800
I'm,

3897
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:07,730
I'm going to do the UFC.

3898
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:10,910
And I came down with you and
I met tank Abbott back cheese.

3899
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:12,770
It's so fortunate though.

3900
01:44:12,771 --> 01:44:14,170
It's ridiculous.

3901
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:14,360
Yeah.

3902
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:14,591
Jeff,

3903
01:44:14,591 --> 01:44:15,650
that great guy,

3904
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,520
great guy,

3905
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,031
love that guy.

3906
01:44:17,031 --> 01:44:17,864
Olympic gold medal.

3907
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:19,580
And it's so,

3908
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:24,050
it's so strange to have
like that kind of a life,

3909
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:24,501
you know?

3910
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:28,610
It's so strange to have all these cool
friends and to like how this dream

3911
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:29,120
weekend,

3912
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,350
I remember when you were all
hanging around you and me
and Joey Diaz and Brendan

3913
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,360
Walsh and Doug Benson,

3914
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:35,840
we were eating after the show,

3915
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,010
after the UFC.

3916
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,630
We were last making good wine,

3917
01:44:38,631 --> 01:44:43,340
drinking good wine and eating sliders
in buffalo wings and just killing it.

3918
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:45,650
All of us laughing at each other.

3919
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:47,060
I mean that's like,

3920
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:49,490
we're so fucking fortunate,

3921
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:49,940
man.

3922
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:50,300
That's what,

3923
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:50,901
that's what that was.

3924
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:51,870
So foreign message.

3925
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:52,191
They're like,

3926
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:53,720
we're so lucky we get to do what we do.

3927
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:57,590
We're so fortunate in every aspect
in the friends that we have in our

3928
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:59,300
occupations and you know,

3929
01:44:59,410 --> 01:44:59,810
it's,

3930
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:00,090
it's,

3931
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:01,370
it's completely amazing.

3932
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:01,940
But to,

3933
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:04,100
to do what we did to get like this,

3934
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:07,100
this posse of comedians
together for that show,

3935
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,140
like at the paramount
that is really important.

3936
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:11,540
And it's one of the things that we were
talking about before you got there.

3937
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:14,870
I was telling them like I was thanking
them for coming and I was like,

3938
01:45:14,871 --> 01:45:15,261
you guys,

3939
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:17,570
like there might be 2000
people out there for this show,

3940
01:45:17,571 --> 01:45:18,800
but if you guys weren't with me,

3941
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:22,550
it wouldn't be half as fun because you
really wouldn't even be 50% of have a

3942
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:23,121
fraternity.

3943
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:23,960
You can share it with.

3944
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:24,290
You know,

3945
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:27,950
I love watching Joey Diaz get off
stage with a giant smile on his face.

3946
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,720
Just laughing his ass off.

3947
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:33,320
I five and so authentic and original.

3948
01:45:33,321 --> 01:45:36,640
We had some really good talks
and he's the best listener I've,

3949
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:37,461
I'd love.

3950
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:42,461
But I'll say I'm going to go anywhere
at least 10 minutes to get out of the

3951
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:44,330
supposed to be there and have,

3952
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:46,530
they can suck it up because they're mine.

3953
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:46,980
They're mine.

3954
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:48,090
But it's the 10 minute podcast.

3955
01:45:48,091 --> 01:45:49,640
I guess that's not a good show.

3956
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:49,941
I know,

3957
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:52,020
but I gotta I gotta know it's actually,

3958
01:45:52,021 --> 01:45:52,161
you know,

3959
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:52,400
wait,

3960
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,140
they're going to buy them.

3961
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:56,960
I go to go to 10 minute
podcasts and listen to drunk
Arnold that well Sasa does.

3962
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:58,010
If you don't laugh your ass off.

3963
01:45:58,011 --> 01:45:58,221
To me,

3964
01:45:58,221 --> 01:45:59,870
it's the best impression of all time.

3965
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,520
And it's the funniest
thing I've ever done.

3966
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:03,890
It's a funny one because Arnold is like,

3967
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:04,540
I don't,

3968
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,300
I hardly do my own
oppression in the morning.

3969
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:07,671
How many people do,

3970
01:46:07,671 --> 01:46:09,830
Arnold is so fucking hilarious.

3971
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,053
We have some,

3972
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,430
I'm really proud of some of
the things we did on that show.

3973
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:13,940
I mean,

3974
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,731
I like the idea.

3975
01:46:14,731 --> 01:46:15,564
It's great idea.

3976
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,070
Great.

3977
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,903
10 minutes.

3978
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:19,190
Do some fucking characters on there.

3979
01:46:19,191 --> 01:46:19,761
Forget me.

3980
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:20,870
I did an ostrich expert,

3981
01:46:20,871 --> 01:46:21,704
but that doesn't matter.

3982
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:22,400
Uh,

3983
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:22,790
it's,

3984
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:23,840
it's some of the funny shit.

3985
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:24,561
I got to go.

3986
01:46:24,561 --> 01:46:25,390
It's an ostrich.

3987
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:26,223
Hi,

3988
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:27,291
my name is,

3989
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:27,560
uh,

3990
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:27,790
Ooh,

3991
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:28,451
she won't do the,

3992
01:46:28,451 --> 01:46:29,720
and the ostrich.

3993
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,130
Uh,

3994
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:30,440
my,

3995
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:30,760
my,

3996
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,980
my specialty and the good question is,

3997
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,390
if an ostrich is a bird,

3998
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:38,810
why can he not?

3999
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,260
And that's all I talk about.

4000
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:44,330
This is what we need to work with you.

4001
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:45,250
We need to get hit,

4002
01:46:45,251 --> 01:46:50,251
not total Alondra with you together with
your Brazilian Jujitsu character and

4003
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:53,460
make something happen because
that rapist character is,

4004
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:57,600
there's two of the funniest moments in
my life that I've experienced in my whole

4005
01:46:57,601 --> 01:46:58,080
life.

4006
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,400
One of them is Joey Diaz on the Alex
Jones show or Joe or they fucked up and

4007
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:05,550
told Joey Diaz that he didn't have to
worry about swearing because this part is

4008
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:10,551
on the Internet and Joey Diaz has opened
up a can of whoop ass on the he he it

4009
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:12,540
was,

4010
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:16,350
he was telling a story about going
through the TSA with weed tucked under his

4011
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:18,450
balls and about how
those fucking machines,

4012
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:22,290
they don't scan shit and you know this
is your fucking tax dollars at work and

4013
01:47:22,291 --> 01:47:23,850
the Alex Jones is going crazy.

4014
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,250
He goes check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

4015
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,001
Big Dixon.

4016
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:28,470
Yes it's bad for your help.

4017
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:29,603
Joel Diaz,

4018
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,480
Facebook,

4019
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:31,110
Twitter,

4020
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:31,980
stay black.

4021
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:34,860
And he and he leaves when he
literally wrecked the room.

4022
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,760
I'm crying laughing and it's,

4023
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:37,681
and by the way,

4024
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:39,420
we got it all on video,

4025
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:39,950
it's all,

4026
01:47:39,950 --> 01:47:40,230
you know,

4027
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:41,970
I got to see the people
that say I'm exaggerating,

4028
01:47:41,971 --> 01:47:42,810
it's all online.

4029
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,620
Joey Diaz and the Alex Jones show is a
hundred versions of it on youtube cause

4030
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:48,090
it's so phenomenal to see this.

4031
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:53,220
There was that and there was you in the
hotel room when we were high as fuck.

4032
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:53,970
And I don't even think,

4033
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:58,650
I think I just got the job of the UFC and
we would all come out to the fight and

4034
01:47:58,651 --> 01:47:58,891
it was,

4035
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:01,260
it's so fucking great guys event.

4036
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:04,460
I mean so barbaric and
men to go to fucking jail.

4037
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,490
How'd you see that fight?

4038
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:05,960
Always shook.

4039
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:06,660
I was crazy.

4040
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,250
And afterwards we eat steaks and shit.

4041
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:10,350
It was just such a a boy party for you.

4042
01:48:10,351 --> 01:48:12,810
And I actually went and looked
at Randy couture and we're like,

4043
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:13,150
look at him,

4044
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:14,250
look at it and be fucking animal.

4045
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,370
He had a swollen knee.

4046
01:48:17,371 --> 01:48:17,651
I was like,

4047
01:48:17,651 --> 01:48:17,840
Gee,

4048
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,810
you were upstairs.

4049
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:20,210
And we were barbecued.

4050
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,120
We were so high.

4051
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:21,931
And you know,

4052
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:25,440
we just have this group of really
funny people hanging out together.

4053
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:30,240
So we're just making sure that lab and
Brian goes into this explanation like a

4054
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:33,960
Jujitsu seminar and had a fuck guys
basically doing hands on because I was

4055
01:48:33,961 --> 01:48:34,910
training at [inaudible] says,

4056
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,920
and of course I have nothing
but respect for hence all.

4057
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:41,640
Of course he was just the character,

4058
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:41,851
you know.

4059
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:42,690
And come on guys.

4060
01:48:42,691 --> 01:48:43,021
Okay.

4061
01:48:43,021 --> 01:48:43,531
Like that.

4062
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:44,010
You know,

4063
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:45,060
when I'd take a guy,

4064
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:47,210
they got a guy like that put
them into the math like that,

4065
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,373
eh,

4066
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:51,630
there was like the way the,

4067
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:55,350
the all the parts of your speech
or I don't know where it is,

4068
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,750
but any Bravo's video,

4069
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:59,790
but it was like a window like you,

4070
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:00,240
you had,

4071
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,320
it was like one of those things.

4072
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:05,640
He put it on his video but he put
it on there as a fortune cookie.

4073
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:07,170
You know what I'm talking
about is I have been a calm,

4074
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:08,750
we have to find it,

4075
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:09,600
whatever.

4076
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,940
So he put it on there I think.

4077
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:13,140
Is that what's called the fortune cookie?

4078
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,670
Whatever the fuck it's called,

4079
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,211
when,

4080
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:15,540
um,

4081
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:17,760
when someone puts something
on their DVD and you,

4082
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:18,031
you know,

4083
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:18,870
you go and find it.

4084
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,200
So he put on there like you had to press
like a couple of different things for

4085
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:23,034
it to come up.

4086
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:25,620
It was one of those stupid things that
people did before they realized that

4087
01:49:25,621 --> 01:49:28,360
extra content you should let people
want that people are watching.

4088
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,850
And so Eddie had that.

4089
01:49:29,851 --> 01:49:32,670
He thought it would be really funny and
I also think he was worried about it was

4090
01:49:32,671 --> 01:49:36,120
so dirty like connecting it to his thing.

4091
01:49:36,150 --> 01:49:39,420
I think he would do it now because like
on a mastering the system you gotta be

4092
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:42,360
careful when you're building a brand
or whatever and if you're interested in

4093
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:42,630
that,

4094
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:47,040
go to 10th Planet Jiu jitsu.com Cause
Eddie's got this whole web series called

4095
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:49,940
mastering the system and a lot
of that is with [inaudible].

4096
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:50,760
Raja,

4097
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:51,593
who is this?

4098
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:54,130
I don't want to tell you the whole story
because I don't want to give up the

4099
01:49:54,131 --> 01:49:54,580
joke.

4100
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,050
What we'll do it but you got to get
together with him and we'll do it.

4101
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:00,260
I'm coming back on a podcast
teach guys how to get this.

4102
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:01,040
Guys,

4103
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,080
I want to thank you guys.

4104
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:02,621
Fuck yeah man.

4105
01:50:02,621 --> 01:50:04,360
You come out on the
podcast anytime you want.

4106
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:06,160
I'll do extra ones for you if I'm,

4107
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:07,090
if I have a full week,

4108
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:07,960
we'll do one at night.

4109
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:09,900
Always do it anytime you want man.

4110
01:50:09,901 --> 01:50:11,080
I'm sorry I have to leave early today.

4111
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:12,370
It's no worries.

4112
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:13,240
Thank you everybody.

4113
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:15,280
You should tell those guys to
fuck themselves and stay here.

4114
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:16,520
Twitter while are,

4115

We are doing it now.

4118
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:27,154
It's a game for me.

4119
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:28,283
I love you.

4120
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:30,160
Don't mean I gotta get him my commercial,

4121
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,120
but I can't.

4122
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,960
I've got to let you out of the house,

4123
01:50:31,961 --> 01:50:32,171

4124

I love you.

4126
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:34,420
Animals out the security.

4127
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:35,160
Hold on,

4128
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:35,341

01:50:35,341 --> 01:50:35,600
let me,

4130
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,520
let me end this.

4131
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:36,850
Alright,

4132
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,651
this podcasts over.

4133
01:50:37,651 --> 01:50:38,290
Ladies and gentlemen,

4134
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:42,430
go see Brian this weekend in San Diego
at the American comedy company and go to

4135
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:43,360
the American comedy company.

4136
01:50:43,361 --> 01:50:43,990
Support it.

4137
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:47,620
It's great that San Diego finally got a
real fucking comedy club and it is a bad

4138
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:48,250
ass one.

4139
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,200
Thank you to a Alienware MMA.

4140
01:50:50,201 --> 01:50:53,950
Follow them on Twitter Alienware and
then they on Twitter Alienware sponsors

4141
01:50:53,951 --> 01:50:55,090
through sucker punch entertainment,

4142
01:50:55,091 --> 01:50:55,930
a lot of fighters.

4143
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:57,123
And um,

4144
01:50:57,190 --> 01:50:57,880
they uh,

4145
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,320
we really appreciate the shit out of that.

4146
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:03,640
So we started using Alienware computers
for all of our podcasts and if you're

4147
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:04,360
into gaming,

4148
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,890
they're fucking fantastic.

4149
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:06,970
They're really awesome.

4150
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:11,080
They sent us this 18 inch laptop
and it's fucking tremendous.

4151
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:11,250
It's,

4152
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:11,710
it's,

4153
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:12,940
if you want to play games on them,

4154
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,100
they're,

4155
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:14,210
they're like the,

4156
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:14,921
the graphics,

4157
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:15,520
the speed.

4158
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,271
They're really incredible.

4159
01:51:16,271 --> 01:51:16,811
They're pricey,

4160
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:17,191
but they're,

4161
01:51:17,191 --> 01:51:18,200
they're really worth it there.

4162
01:51:18,201 --> 01:51:22,210
They're incredible gaming computers and
we thank them for supporting us because,

4163
01:51:22,211 --> 01:51:22,830
uh,

4164
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:23,140
uh,

4165
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:23,531
we,

4166
01:51:23,531 --> 01:51:23,740
uh,

4167
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,450
we love the fact they
hooked us up with computers.

4168
01:51:25,451 --> 01:51:28,360
We loved them as a company and we love
the fact that they support MMA fighters.

4169
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:29,680
We think it's a ballsy move.

4170
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:31,600
And I really appreciate
the fact that Dell,

4171
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:34,440
a big company has the
guts through Alienware.

4172
01:51:34,450 --> 01:51:34,990
They're there,

4173
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:37,020
which they own to step
in and sponsor fighters.

4174
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,863
I think that's beautiful.

4175
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:39,990
And so we support people
who support him in May.

4176
01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:40,500
Uh,

4177
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:41,920
thanks to [inaudible] dot com as well.

4178
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:44,110
Go get yourself some battle
ropes and kettlebells.

4179
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:45,160
So you could be manly.

4180
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:48,260
Like Brian Cowlick may throw
that rope around bitch stuff,

4181
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:49,300
a dancer's physique.

4182
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:50,860
I love your brain.

4183
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,030
Feed your brain with
some nutrients and uh,

4184
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:53,831
get your shit together.

4185
01:51:53,831 --> 01:51:54,664
You dirty bitches.

4186
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,031
Look,

4187
01:51:55,031 --> 01:51:55,864
we love you.

4188
01:51:56,200 --> 01:52:00,690
We appreciate the podcast tweets
and emails and all that Shit.

4189
01:52:00,691 --> 01:52:01,524
It literally,

4190
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:07,510
my life would not be as rich and
interesting if it wasn't for how,

4191
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:08,830
how,

4192
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:13,210
how much positive energy we've
gotten back from you people,

4193
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,610
how much that is inspirational,

4194
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:20,630
how much that makes us want to
do more and make it better and,

4195
01:52:20,631 --> 01:52:22,060
and put out more content.

4196
01:52:22,061 --> 01:52:27,061
And I appreciate the fuck that all you
guys are using this podcast to make your

4197
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:31,300
commute more interesting to
entertain you when you're on a plane,

4198
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:32,231
you know,

4199
01:52:32,231 --> 01:52:34,630
whatever the fuck you're using
it for when you're at the gym.

4200
01:52:34,631 --> 01:52:35,540
I think it's awesome.

4201
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:38,910
I love the connection that we have and uh,

4202

it,

4206
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,930
it inspires me to no end and that's it.

4207
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:44,764
You dirty freaks.

4208
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:48,170
Tomorrow we will have Jamie

And he's a very smart guy and he
has us besides his strange ideology,

4215
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:01,910
he's got his heart in the right place.

4216
01:53:01,911 --> 01:53:03,440
He's a good human and
he'll be here tomorrow.
