1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,580
And we're live.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,803
What's that brick

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,180
happy memorial day.

4
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:08,110
Happy Memorial Day.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,400
A perfect day to have you want to
talk about your project because this,

6
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:13,000
um,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,170
it's called a fighting season.

8
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,600
It's available right now on iTunes.

9
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,730
And for folks who,

10
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:19,564
uh,

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,673
are not,

12
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,011
uh,

13
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,170
aware of Rick Schroeder,

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:23,981
first of all,

15
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:28,120
how dare you and a actor,

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm now director,

17
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:30,770
producer,

18
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,970
you're doing a lot of different things
and we've been friends for what,

19
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,190
10 years now?

20
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,641
10 years.

21
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah.

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,010
Long time girls introduced
this thankfully.

23
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,953
Yeah.

24
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,200
So you are documentary
series is pretty intense man.

25
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,620
And you showed me a bunch of it last
time I was over your house and I was the,

26
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:46,850
first of all I was really impressed.

27
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:50,750
But one of the things I was
really impressed with was
your commitment to doing

28
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,110
this.

29
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,560
I mean you spent a lot of time in,

30
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,990
in Afghanistan and uh,

31
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
like embedded.

32
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,390
You were with the soldiers in firefights.

33
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,730
I mean you were there pretty
much every step of the way.

34
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,841
Yeah.

35
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:10,310
I was there 110 days
from March until July,

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,480
2014 and I needed to be there because
I needed to be there that long because

37
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,950
just to build trust with the,

38
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,970
the soldiers and the units that I would
embed with took sometimes weeks alone

39
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,830
just to,

40
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,970
because everybody looked at me like,

41
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,920
what's this journalists doing here?

42
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,390
A lot of the guys were 20,

43
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:26,991
22,

44
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,580
25 in these platoons.

45
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,240
No,

46
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,770
had no idea of my past.

47
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:34,160
They thought I was just a journalist
and camera guy that was there to tell a

48
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,840
story that was probably negative.

49
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,050
So just took time to build
a relationship with them,

50
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,921
um,

51
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,420
before I got into their worlds.

52
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,283
And,

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,651
but you know,

54
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,484
it's funny the,

55
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,241
you know,

56
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:44,610
when,

57
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,680
when you do go out and got combat patrol
and you do have contact with an enemy,

58
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,170
then like all of a sudden
you know that you're with,

59
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,303
you're one of them.

60
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,680
So it like totally changes the dynamic,

61
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,960
but it has to be some big event has to
happen typically for them to accept you.

62
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,011
Wow.

63
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:01,341
That's,

64
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,540
that's pretty intense man.

65
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,870
So what was the motivation to do this?

66
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,201
And like,

67
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,180
when did you decide,

68
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,950
how long did it take to plan this out?

69
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,470
Like,

70
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,250
yeah,

71
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,930
so the motivation is probably,

72
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,650
you know,

73
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,140
I was always curious about what war was,

74
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:15,741
you know,

75
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:20,650
war is just one of those things
that it has affected mankind and,

76
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:20,840
and,

77
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,560
and change the course of history
since the beginning of time.

78
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,191
Right.

79
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,060
The act of war.

80
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,283
And so,

81
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:27,981
you know,

82
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,840
I was always curious about what war was.

83
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,470
And I,

84
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,131
in my mind,

85
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:31,670
I always thought,

86
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,911
wow,

87
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:36,911
I have to experience what it is or else
I don't have like a whole picture of

88
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,180
what it means to be,

89
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:38,540
you know,

90
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,410
in this state of,

91
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,040
you know,

92
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,150
this condition has man.

93
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,720
So I was always looking for an opportunity
where I could sort of experienced it.

94
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:48,980
Um,

95
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,580
but you know,

96
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,810
I didn't come along for a long,

97
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:51,644
long time,

98
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,360
but after nine 11,

99
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:53,601
you know,

100
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:54,890
I've been sitting there watching,

101
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,013
you know,

102
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,120
US fight in the war on
terror for 13 or 14 years.

103
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,063
My living room,

104
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,540
like there were most of us.

105
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,640
And you know,

106
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,474
I,

107
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,910
I had an opportunity because I knew
a three star general named Lieutenant

108
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,110
General Anderson at the Fort Bragg,

109
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:13,111
North Carolina who was
deploying to Afghanistan in
the spring of 2014 so I asked

110
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:13,961
Joe,

111
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,231
I said,

112
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:14,471
Joe,

113
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,520
can I go with you guys?

114
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,241
And he's like,

115
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,140
why do you want to go?

116
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,041
And I'm like,

117
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,401
well Joe,

118
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,590
I think it's important to document,

119
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,933
you know,

120
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,450
what we've accomplished or failed to
accomplish in that country for the last 13

121
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:25,870
years.

122
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,160
We've spent a lot of money there,

123
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,900
we've lost a lot of people there,

124
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,470
we've had a lot of handicapped
and amputees come from that war.

125
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,390
And I think it's important to
show what ending a war looks like,

126
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,321
how hard it is,

127
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,310
how complicated is,

128
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,270
how ugly it is.

129
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,360
And so he agreed and he said,

130
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:43,691
okay,

131
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,524
I'll make it happen.

132
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,850
Now this was when you had already
started doing that show for the army.

133
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,260
You had done this show.

134
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,340
What was the show called?

135
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:51,840
The,

136
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,710
the project that I started working for,

137
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,700
what's called starting strong,

138
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,990
started working for the army for,

139
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,910
that's a branded content shell.

140
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,270
It's like long form kind of,

141
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
um,

142
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,600
a infomercial in a sense,

143
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,510
ultimately for the starting
strong for the military.

144
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:07,661
I mean,

145
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,650
that's a 30 minute,

146
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,750
it's not truly a reality show,

147
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,021
right?

148
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,560
It's,

149
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:11,950
it's,

150
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,270
it's branded content.

151
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,870
It's,

152
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,380
it's messaging that they want in there
that I helped produce and I have a

153
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,510
government contract and
I produced that for them.

154
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,160
So in that sense,

155
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,810
one of the conversations
that we had about that,

156
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,330
they,

157
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,220
they're fairly restrictive about what
you ere and what you don't air and you

158
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,870
didn't have a lot of
creative freedom with that.

159
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,441
That's right.

160
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:29,750
I mean,

161
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,250
they,

162
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,830
it's a long form commercial
jail starting strong,

163
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,520
but it's,

164
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,930
it's well done and it's real.

165
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,070
There's nothing in it that's not,

166
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,970
not truthful,

167
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,990
but it's definitely controlled by the
army and the messaging that they want to

168
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:41,770
put into it.

169
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,660
So it's not necessarily balanced.

170
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:45,970
Like the negative aspects
are not really shown.

171
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,090
You're just kind of showing
the things that they want.

172
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:49,840
Yeah.

173
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,490
And ultimately they have
the final edit there,

174
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,060
the final judge and jury on
those decisions when you have,

175
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,421
you know,

176
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,020
a creative,

177
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,620
uh,

178
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,453
difference.

179
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,640
So that really kind of opened your eyes
to this possible or open your mind to

180
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:07,450
this possibility of doing this
nonrestrictive embedded reality.

181
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,590
I mean this is a real,

182
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,260
a real documentary that,

183
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,391
yeah,

184
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,290
this is the real deal.

185
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,010
I mean this is,

186
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,390
this is John Paul Dejoria,

187
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,460
the guy who owns patroned Tequila in me,

188
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,151
uh,

189
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,990
each kicking in a chunk
of money and you know,

190
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,290
putting together a film crew.

191
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,680
And I scrambled after I talked to Joe
Anderson and Fort Bragg in February,

192
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,430
I was in Afghanistan by February,

193
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,850
by March and I brought
three camera guys with me.

194
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,511
I brought,

195
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:36,010
I hired a local there and
the only limitation the
army put on me was they said

196
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:41,011
we are going to have to review for
operational security and any things that

197
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,830
could endanger our soldiers
or give away capabilities,

198
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,371
tactics,

199
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:50,080
techniques and procedures of certain
weapon systems or things that we employ to

200
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:50,914
defeat the enemy.

201
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,240
Which,

202
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,020
which is pretty interesting stuff.

203
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,570
And I can talk about
a little bit with you,

204
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,440
some of those tools we have.

205
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,530
Like what were the things that
you were not allowed to put in?

206
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,360
So like when we were on the,

207
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,070
let's say I'm a drone,

208
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,641
we were,

209
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,560
when we were trying to do dynamic or,

210
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,130
or um,

211
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,470
kinetic strikes with drones on bad guys,

212
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,304
we were following,

213
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,330
um,

214
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,050
known terrorists that had pictures and
names and we were following them from the

215
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,760
air.

216
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,593
Um,

217
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,020
and looking for opportunities to shoot
hellfire missile and eliminate them.

218
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,233
Um,

219
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,280
there's certain information that's on
the drone feeds the monitor feeds that

220
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,620
gives away sort of
capabilities of the drone.

221
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,520
I see.

222
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,570
And so we had to blur that.

223
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,213
Um,

224
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,090
there was certain weapons systems which
are just brand new that you couldn't

225
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,810
even talk about and people will know
that they're not released to the public.

226
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,470
Yeah,

227
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,670
that's always tripped me out.

228
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,310
Like things like the area
51 stuff and the groom,

229
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:47,810
Lake weather test,

230
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,350
all this crazy technology out there and
people don't even know about it until

231
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:51,921
it's too late.

232
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,230
It's one of the things,

233
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,451
not,

234
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,350
not too late necessarily,

235
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:56,240
but I mean until it's already employed.

236
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,021
One of the things,

237
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:57,590
um,

238
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,990
that they attribute to a
lot of the UFO sightings.

239
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:03,320
It was like stealth bombers and the
B 52 and [inaudible] 51 and all these

240
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,770
different technologies they had created
out there in the [inaudible] desert and

241
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,150
people had no idea they even existed
until they started using them.

242
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,350
You know,

243
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,160
the technology that I saw an experience
with the army and the way that they can,

244
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,640
you know,

245
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,330
fight and conduct war and gather
intelligence and stuff was,

246
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:21,230
it was phenomenal.

247
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,550
Absolutely phenomenal.

248
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,403
Um,

249
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,781
at that,

250
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,590
that being said,

251
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,590
there's only so much you can
do to overcome an adversary
that's a suicide bomber

252
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:30,931
that's going to,

253
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:31,430
you know,

254
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,730
load the car with explosives
and drive it into your,

255
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:34,891
you know,

256
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:35,724
check point,

257
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,410
um,

258
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,760
or walk up to you and detonate.

259
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,980
There's only so much you
can do with technology.

260
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,701
Um,

261
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,270
and it's,

262
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,390
there's just certain things it's
hard to mitigate against and that,

263
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,380
that's fanatics.

264
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,401
Yeah.

265
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,810
And this war in particular and a,

266
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,450
the first desert storm war,

267
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:55,451
it was really the first time that they
had experienced that as the United States

268
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,890
military and experienced
that from the enemy,

269
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,724
right.

270
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,800
Except the Japanese suicide bombers.

271
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:01,670
But the kamikaze is,

272
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,930
it was sort of a different story.

273
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,501
Yeah.

274
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:07,160
I mean that's the only time I can
really remember is the weapon of choice

275
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,790
becoming,

276
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,623
um,

277
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,500
a human,

278
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,801
you know,

279
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,071
his,

280
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:10,401
his,

281
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:10,940
um,

282
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,460
World War II with the kamikazes and then,

283
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:13,761
you know,

284
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,470
you started hearing about it in Iraq,

285
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,723
um,

286
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,210
and that really wasn't
employed and Afghanistan for
many years early in the war.

287
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,300
And then they decided to
change tactics and bring,

288
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,620
bring that to the battlefield.

289
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,491
But you know,

290
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,680
the really disgusting thing with,

291
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,920
with some of that is,

292
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,700
you know,

293
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,710
they use kids a lot for suicide bombers.

294
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,600
Um,

295
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:31,820
you know,

296
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,040
kids that are handicapped,

297
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,700
kids that have mental problems,

298
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,980
down syndrome or handicaps in some way,

299
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,001
they'll actually,

300
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,420
you know,

301
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,420
radicalize the kids in Pakistan
madrassas or schools teach them that,

302
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,841
you know,

303
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:45,170
it's,

304
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,471
it's,

305
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,304
um,

306
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,990
it's the highest degree of glory to
die in the act of Jihad because without

307
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,680
jihad actually you can't
actually get the 72 versions.

308
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,760
So the kids are actually trained to
thank the Americans kind of in a way,

309
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:03,720
or thank the out of the infidels
because without the infidels to kill,

310
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,670
you can't get the highest degree of,

311
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,010
of a celestial glory.

312
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,361
That term,

313
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,410
72 virgins.

314
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,244
Apparently.

315
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,233
I looked it up.

316
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,870
What a lot of people think that
it's actually like the number 72,

317
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,180
but it's like a shit load.

318
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,580
It's like saying a shit load,

319
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,430
you know,

320
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,660
like you how it's more than 72.

321
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:22,891
Well,

322
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:23,341
you know what I mean?

323
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:23,731
It's like,

324
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,110
it's a term like,

325
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:25,591
you know,

326
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:26,550
like it's not a,

327
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,720
it's not an exact term.

328
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,360
I don't know what the a,

329
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,430
the definition that would be,

330
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,181
but you know,

331
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,014
um,

332
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,351
you know,

333
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,190
people say that,

334
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,410
uh,

335
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,300
it's a cajillion

336
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,720
exaggeration.

337
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,350
It was the original,

338
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,330
I mean it's not,

339
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,840
it's not really defined.

340
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,700
It's just a large number of versions that
apparently is what they mean by saying

341
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,211
72.

342
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,220
Cause I always thought
like that's so specific.

343
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,390
What does that mean?

344
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,080
Yeah.

345
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,700
I mean it's a cultural thing obviously,

346
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:51,510
but yeah.

347
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:51,990
Um,

348
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,070
so this is really a crazy undertaking.

349
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,270
I mean I really,

350
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,340
I mean you threw your
whole life into this,

351
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,700
you separate yourself from
your family for many months,

352
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,290
a hundred plus days,

353
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,370
and then,

354
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:05,701
uh,

355
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,600
went over there.

356
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:07,950
And was there any,

357
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,900
was there any point in time in the,

358
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,530
in the process of this before you
launched where you had second thoughts?

359
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,041
We did,

360
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,180
you know that you were going to commit
yourself to such a long extended stay.

361
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,210
So I did have second thoughts,

362
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,660
um,

363
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,291
before I went,

364
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:22,441
you know,

365
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,720
especially cause like
three days before I left,

366
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,070
Andrea and my wife said,

367
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,293
don't go.

368
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,321
If you love me,

369
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:29,154
don't go,

370
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,910
whoa.

371
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,400
And so if you love the kids don't go.

372
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,730
I got that.

373
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,920
And so I had to deal with
that like three days before.

374
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,530
And that was pretty tough.

375
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,190
Um,

376
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,870
because I do love my
wife and do love my kids,

377
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:41,704
but I went.

378
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,963
So,

379
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,890
um,

380
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,723
but,

381
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,700
but yeah,

382
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,830
I mean it was definitely a hard,

383
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,270
a hard thing to,

384
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:50,104
um,

385
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,320
to come to terms with tea,

386
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,210
to come to grips with.

387
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,020
Um,

388
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,171
you know,

389
00:10:53,171 --> 00:10:53,621
my camera,

390
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,920
one of my camera guys backed
out the day of the trip.

391
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:57,941
Um,

392
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:02,200
and I went out there at one time before
my team actually and just to scout and

393
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:05,230
look for different embeds in different
characters and stuff that I could follow.

394
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:05,951
Different soldiers,

395
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:06,581
different units,

396
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,450
different missions.

397
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,310
And we follow everything in this just,

398
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:09,521
you know,

399
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:13,900
from three star general who was the
commander of the battlefield of in all of

400
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:15,550
Afghanistan to,

401
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,150
you know,

402
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,900
um,

403
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,830
Colonel John Graham,

404
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:18,660
which is a,

405
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,420
a great embed where he advises
the chief of police and cool,

406
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,950
which is 6 million people,

407
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,150
cops with RPGs,

408
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,490
13,000 man pill,

409
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,420
paramilitary police force in Kabul,

410
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,620
heroin industry,

411
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,950
thriving black market for
weapons thriving and are in bed,

412
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:36,670
was with criminal Graham embedded
with the chief of police for cobble,

413
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,863
um,

414
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:38,801
you know,

415
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,560
trying to secure the city
and build the ring of steel.

416
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,101
They called it,

417
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:46,270
which was like 50 something checkpoints
to try to keep suicide bombers and

418
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:50,950
vehicle borne IED is out of
the city before the election
because the Taliban had

419
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:54,400
threatened immense bloodshed
to disrupt the elections.

420
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,110
This was 2014 was just,

421
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:56,471
you know,

422
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,304
um,

423
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,420
the first peaceful transition
of power in Afghanistan,

424
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,320
legitimate transfer of power after Karzai.

425
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,360
And so the Taliban wanted
nothing more than to,

426
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,200
to,

427
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,790
to disrupt that process.

428
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,720
They want Sharia law,

429
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,710
they don't want democracy.

430
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,540
And so 2014 ended up being the deadliest
fighting season in Afghanistan's

431
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,374
history,

432
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,880
at least while we were there.

433
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,020
I don't know about the Soviets,

434
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,140
but while we were there
and more civilians,

435
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,620
more tallyman and more coalition forces
were killed in 2014 than any other year.

436
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,091
So yeah.

437
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:28,481
So I mean,

438
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,260
going into this,

439
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,340
I started to get some,

440
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,190
you know,

441
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,871
jitters here,

442
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,800
they're cold feet,

443
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,420
but you know,

444
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:33,591
I,

445
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:34,870
I commit and you know,

446
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,040
I know how to jump,

447
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,460
you know,

448
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,293
like hold your,

449
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,980
hold your balls and junk kind of attitude.

450
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,220
Right.

451
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,090
I know how to do that,

452
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,560
thankfully.

453
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,540
And so that's what you
do is you just jump,

454
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:43,841
you know,

455
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:44,560
you just,

456
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
you just because I couldn't
live with myself if I didn't.

457
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,100
Right.

458
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,520
I mean,

459
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,480
you couldn't,

460
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,373
I couldn't.

461
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,390
And so it was,

462
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,224
um,

463
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,681
you know,

464
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:57,130
and really what was really
stressful though was they
started killing journalists

465
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,690
in Afghanistan in 2014.

466
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,080
It's specifically targeting
people that had cameras.

467
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,071
And so,

468
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:03,311
you know,

469
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,540
every while I was there,

470
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,250
you'd get news reports of,

471
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,030
you know,

472
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,400
two,

473
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,050
two dead journalists are dead
journalists here are two dead there,

474
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,850
you know,

475
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,660
purposely shot by our allies,

476
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:13,970
our,

477
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,211
our,

478
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,044
our own,

479
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,061
not our allies,

480
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:16,421
but our,

481
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,020
our own Afghan partners that
we were partnering with,

482
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,770
whether it'd be Afghan national
army and a or Afghan Ello,

483
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:27,040
Alp Afghan local police would
turn guns on journalists.

484
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,173
And it,

485
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,871
it turns out,

486
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:29,051
you know,

487
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,870
you never quite understand
why it happened.

488
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,930
A lot of times it's Taliban
infiltrate the ranks of the,

489
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,981
of the,

490
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,814
um,

491
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,760
of the security forces in
Afghanistan that do that.

492
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,541
But,

493
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:40,750
uh,

494
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,580
but sometimes it's cultural differences.

495
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,800
They don't like cameras pointed at them.

496
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,410
They don't like they're there.

497
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,840
They don't like you to talk to women.

498
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,660
If you talk to women or
open a door for a woman,

499
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,260
you could insult somebody so much that
it's the kind of place where they pull a

500
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,280
gun out and they kill you.

501
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,883
Wow.

502
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,460
Yeah.

503
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,210
So the stress,

504
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,410
the anxiety just never ends because like
on that embed with criminal Graham and

505
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,250
the Cabo police,

506
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:06,941
you know,

507
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:11,800
we were a six or seven person
team embedded with a 13,000 men,

508
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,020
Afghan police force.

509
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,350
And so all day long we're surrounding
by Afghans with AK is and RPGs.

510
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,420
And so every building you go into,

511
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,360
you're surrounded by Africans with guns
and there's just six or seven years,

512
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,710
sometimes two or three of you.

513
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,380
And so you're always trying
to put your back to the wall.

514
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:29,710
And the anxiety of that
is just relentless.

515
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,730
Even though Maine,

516
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,690
nothing may happen,

517
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,860
but just the potential that something's
going to happen is kind of exhausting.

518
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,421
Yeah.

519
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:37,480
I can only imagine,

520
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:42,190
especially knowing that some of these
security forces were killing journalists.

521
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,650
Did they give you a list of things?

522
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,484
Never do.

523
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,900
No.

524
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,733
Um,

525
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,060
that's how to learn along the way.

526
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,421
Yeah.

527
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,500
I mean you ask for advice.

528
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:50,711
I mean,

529
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,600
I think that's one of the weirdest things
about like going to going go into a

530
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,820
place like that is there is no rule book.

531
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,120
All you can look is for
people that have experienced,

532
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,920
that have done it before,

533
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,800
been there before,

534
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,240
and ask and hope somebody takes
you under their wing and you know,

535
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,190
decides to give you a
little bit of comfort,

536
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,791
you know,

537
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:07,911
and,

538
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:11,630
and decides to try to teach
you something along the way.

539
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,281
God,

540
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,200
that's gotta be insanely stressful.

541
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,900
So I could just call him,

542
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:22,901
imagine being a small number of people
also surrounded by all these Afghan

543
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:27,710
security forces and then also having
the knowledge that some of these people

544
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,460
that Taliban had embedded in some of
these people and they didn't filtrate it

545
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,190
and they were in the ranks and they were,

546
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,450
they were upset that the Americans were
there in the first place and they were

547
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,420
resentful of the whole situation and,

548
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:41,630
you know,

549
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,463
very angry.

550
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,970
Yeah.

551
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,660
Um,

552
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,051
it was,

553
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:45,350
you know,

554
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,800
it was mine exhausting my numbing.

555
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,783
It was almost like you,

556
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,200
you don't know where the enemy is.

557
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,681
And it's like,

558
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,060
once you know where the enemy is,

559
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,570
then at least you can focus
on him and you can face him.

560
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,470
But the enemy can be anywhere
in that kind of environment.

561
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:01,970
And so like it'd be,

562
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,360
you know,

563
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,840
on a patrol or walking through a village
and there's a bunch of guys around and

564
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,690
they all got shovels and you know,

565
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,531
but you know,

566
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,610
some of them are Taliban,

567
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,560
you know that for sure.

568
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:13,400
Some of them are talent man,

569
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,990
but they're holding a shovel
and you can't prove it.

570
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,240
So you have to really wait until,

571
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,020
you know,

572
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,860
they decided they want to fight that
day because typically it's up to them.

573
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,850
You know,

574
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,960
where they fight,

575
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,130
when they fight,

576
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,960
they're the ones that
determine those things.

577
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,560
That's gotta be really crazy.

578
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:33,400
So it's very difficult to figure
out who exactly the enemy is.

579
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,570
You looking at one guy,

580
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:37,420
he might be a farmer and the
guy next to him might be Taliban

581
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,230
or the guy might be a farmer one day
and then he needs money the next,

582
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:45,200
so he picks up as a k or plants an IED
the next day because he needs money and

583
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,040
he becomes Taliban.

584
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,443
Wow.

585
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,800
Did you learn the language?

586
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,461
No,

587
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,320
I'm a few words here or there.

588
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,640
What do they speak on?

589
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:57,641
Dari is the people in the north and
Pash tune is the people in the south and

590
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,831
it's really a tribal conflict that
country as opposed to sharia versus Sunni.

591
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,110
So what is the conflict?

592
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,771
It's,

593
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:08,900
it's very different people.

594
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,510
It's the people in the
north that are dory there,

595
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:12,710
the Northern Alliance,

596
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,160
they're Asian kind of mixed.

597
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,323
Um,

598
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,193
the,

599
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:18,861
you know,

600
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:22,160
used to have those big Buddhist statues
up there and their lands that got blown

601
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,270
up by the Taliban than Islam came into
that country and sort of kick Buddhism

602
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,104
out.

603
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,390
And so it sort of all when Islam,

604
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,290
um,

605
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,120
and then the people in the
south or the past tunes,

606
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:32,901
you know,

607
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:33,261
very,

608
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,640
very connected to Iran,

609
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,541
you know,

610
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,500
kind of culturally.

611
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,933
Um,

612
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,840
and so there's a conflict
between those groups.

613
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,990
And then there's also conflicts
with the states around there.

614
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,310
Like India,

615
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,280
Afghanistan really likes the Indian
people and Indian way of life

616
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,810
and the sports,

617
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,321
the music,

618
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,154
Bollywood,

619
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,880
cricket,

620
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,151
you know,

621
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,630
the Indian businessmen all over Kabul,

622
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,833
um,

623
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,011
and Pakistan,

624
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,251
you know,

625
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:00,990
sort of as at odds with India.

626
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,880
And the last thing they
want is Afghanistan to be
a ally of India to Pakistan

627
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,340
doesn't kind of want surrounded by,

628
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,660
you know,

629
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,100
people they find unfriendly.

630
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,120
So there's,

631
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,930
the conflict is,

632
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,500
you know,

633
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,180
diverse.

634
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,680
It's,

635
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,100
it's,

636
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,200
it's heroin,

637
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:17,034
it's poppy,

638
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,890
opium.

639
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,723
Um,

640
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,200
a lot of money comes out of that.

641
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,080
And who controls that money
and where does the money go?

642
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,451
Yeah.

643
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:32,451
And the also the soldiers have to
actually help some of these guys that are

644
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,821
growing poppies because they get
information and because it keeps the,

645
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,350
keeps certain allies in place.

646
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,910
Like they had this thing on Fox News
where Geraldo Rivera was over there and he

647
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:45,611
was trying to,

648
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:45,900
uh,

649
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,900
help explain why the soldiers were
guarding poppy fields to people at home.

650
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:51,721
That was like,

651
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:53,640
what in the fuck is going on over there?

652
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:53,971
Well,

653
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:54,661
here's the good news.

654
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,270
The good news is 90 something
percent of that heroin,

655
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,030
that opium goes to Iran and Russia.

656
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,410
It doesn't come to us.

657
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:02,640
Ours comes out of Mexico.

658
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,880
It's not good news for
Iran and Russia now,

659
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,200
but as a weapon,

660
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:07,960
it's good news.

661
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,660
Um,

662
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,060
it meaning that the Taliban used
heroin is a weapon against us.

663
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,040
Like at first when they were in power,

664
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,110
they outlawed the growing of it.

665
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,980
So it went to zero when they
were taken out of power.

666
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,173
Um,

667
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,630
poppy production exploded and huge,

668
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,493
huge growth.

669
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,670
And so everybody grows it.

670
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,960
It's just such a cash crop.

671
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,303
And um,

672
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,331
and so,

673
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:31,170
but then they tax it,

674
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,540
tell him that makes $200
million a year from,

675
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,310
from some of the analysts had talked to,

676
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,510
from taxing the growing of it and
the movement of it back to Pakistan.

677
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,553
Wow.

678
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,443
Wow.

679
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,841
That's,

680
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,674
uh,

681
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,910
that's pretty insane.

682
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,391
So that,

683
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:47,130
is that one of the primary means of,

684
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,540
of generating income for them?

685
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,321
Well yet,

686
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:54,321
because in Afghanistan there's basically
no roads so they need to grow crops

687
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,860
that ha that don't spoil.

688
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,240
So when they grow,

689
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,870
when they grow up heroin,

690
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,500
when they grow that opium,

691
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,150
then they can store it in bricks and it
doesn't spoil and then they can treat it

692
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,380
like gold or silver.

693
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,970
And so it's not like,

694
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:09,570
you know,

695
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,220
another kind of food or
other item that spoils.

696
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,920
It's cause they don't have infrastructure
to move stuff to market either.

697
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,020
So it's partly,

698
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,440
those are the reasons partly
to that it's such a big crop.

699
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,180
The must have been an exam,

700
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,040
insane experience and insane
culture shock for you going from,

701
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I mean you were a child star and now
you're a grown man producing documentaries

702
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:40,110
and then you're in this
insanely odd world.

703
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,150
You traveling around Kabul,

704
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,550
which is essentially the
only city in Afghanistan,

705
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:44,881
right?

706
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,980
I mean most of Afghanistan is and

707
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,720
run by tribal bore lords,

708
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:51,270
different SEC segments.

709
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,330
What did,

710
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,620
what is cobble like?

711
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:53,741
Like,

712
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:55,750
what does it like to
travel around that city?

713
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,030
It's a very small downtown
center that looks fairly modern,

714
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:04,600
that has fairly modern looking buildings
that even may have at traffic lights

715
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:05,434
and sewer.

716
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,070
But once you get out of that sort of
nucleus that may be two or three square

717
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,710
miles of infrastructure.

718
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,371
It just,

719
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:17,371
because it basically becomes a city of
6 million mud huts and 6 million people,

720
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,480
but all living in mud and dirt roads.

721
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,200
Um,

722
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,280
just a massive,

723
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,860
massive village really.

724
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,540
And then there's Kandahar in the south.

725
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,580
So those are the two,

726
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,450
which is just another massive,

727
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,410
that has no city center.

728
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
That's a massive village,

729
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,503
Kandahar,

730
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,793
um,

731
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
mud village.

732
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:37,931
And then,

733
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,050
and then all these valleys around
where there's no roads connecting them.

734
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
So people live and die in the same
valleys without going anywhere

735
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,041
in,

736
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,720
they have to get all their
food from that valley.

737
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,290
Yeah.

738
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,970
And what's their primary
source of food there?

739
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,083
They grow it.

740
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,961
They grow it.

741
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,350
They,

742
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,570
they got some of the best
berries I've ever tasted.

743
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,891
I remember we were having,

744
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:57,520
um,

745
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,060
um,

746
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,980
needing with some Afghan army guys,

747
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,790
um,

748
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,360
planning operation and they brought out
bowls of like berries and they're like

749
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,520
boys and berries and
blackberries and raspberries.

750
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,080
And there were the sweetest,

751
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,570
finest berries I've ever tasted.

752
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,680
They would just taste like sugar.

753
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,880
They were so sweet.

754
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,560
Nothings sour about them.

755
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,020
And so it's a very,

756
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,680
like,

757
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,000
it's very arid place,

758
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,260
but where they have water,

759
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,580
it's very productive land.

760
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,920
They grow amazing fruit orchards,

761
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,053
nuts,

762
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,163
um,

763
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,110
and they have a lot of lambs and sheep.

764
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,730
You typically what they eat for meat.

765
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,060
And so I would think that in
that sort of an environment,

766
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,140
it's very difficult for
progress to take place.

767
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,560
That what progress did we
think of like infrastructure,

768
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,090
sewage systems,

769
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:46,350
electrical power,

770
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,551
running water,

771
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,510
all that different stuff.

772
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
It seems like it's very difficult to,

773
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,740
to change.

774
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,080
I mean,

775
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,913
what,

776
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,330
one of the things that I remember from
the election was when there was a debate

777
00:22:57,331 --> 00:23:02,190
between John Mccain and Obama and
Obama was talking about Afghanistan,

778
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:03,810
about bringing troops in Afghanistan.

779
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,440
And he was doing it in a way that John
McCain thought was very ignorant of the

780
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:08,274
environment.

781
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,480
And he said,

782
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:09,721
you know,

783
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,261
I don't think,

784
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,070
you know,

785
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,940
I'm paraphrasing,

786
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,220
but he was saying essentially,

787
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:15,570
I don't think you know
what it's like over there.

788
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:18,780
Like that place hasn't changed since
Alexander the great came through.

789
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,110
And when you describe it that way,

790
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,740
I think he kind of puts it in
perspective for people like these people.

791
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,390
It's not going to change.

792
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,720
Like it's one of the reasons why the
Soviets could never win the war there.

793
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,690
It's one of the reasons why it's so
incredibly difficult for anybody to make

794
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:33,860
any,

795
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,970
well the hope is the Internet.

796
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,150
The hope is the internet because like
literally several dozen TV stations have

797
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:41,504
sprung up.

798
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,120
Several hundred radio stations have sprung
up in the last years on the Internet

799
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,220
and cell cell signals and cell phones.

800
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:49,820
You know,

801
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,180
now there is a group of young people that,

802
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,820
and that I've tasted the,

803
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,440
the world through the Internet and they
see a different world and they see the

804
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,101
opportunity,

805
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:01,760
they see that,

806
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,140
you know,

807
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,341
and,

808
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,050
and those are,

809
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,170
those are the majority of the 8 million
people that came to vote on election

810
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,890
day.

811
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,460
Um,

812
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,821
you know,

813
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,041
and,

814
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,290
and women and young people.

815
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:14,240
And so the big thing is to try to
give that core group of people in that

816
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:14,601
country,

817
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,490
the time and the space to grow,

818
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,410
to develop and to get,

819
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,950
you know,

820
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,860
roots of democracy and roots of,

821
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,191
of,

822
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:22,970
um,

823
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,211
you know,

824
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,980
civil order established,

825
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,730
uh,

826
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,200
to try to deal with the corruption,

827
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,620
the huge amount of corruption
in the Afghan government.

828
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,221
I mean,

829
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:31,880
this is,

830
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,380
this is a place where fuel trucks
will be coming from Pakistan to say,

831
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:38,210
fill the downtown.

832
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,870
The police department's fueled
reservoirs in Kabul and on the way,

833
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,283
um,

834
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,000
so much fuel will be stolen
along the way from Pakistan that,

835
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,990
but by the time it gets
to the edges of Kabul,

836
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:49,760
you know,

837
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,390
all eight trucks will be RPG and burned
because nobody wants evidence that the

838
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,224
trucks were empty.

839
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,670
And so that's the kind of level of
corruption that that is going on that you

840
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,940
know that you have to try
to at the ministerial level,

841
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,280
the ministers like that's where
we've got to make sure we fixed.

842
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm,

843
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,940
the other problem with
that country is like,

844
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,010
it's,

845
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,750
it's,

846
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,650
it's sustaining itself.

847
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,010
So like you'll go to a outpost and you'll
see vehicles that look fairly well,

848
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:25,360
like they can be reused for patrols and
they're just sitting there and they'd

849
00:25:25,361 --> 00:25:28,770
been sitting there a long time and
the commander of the army golf say,

850
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,810
what's up with the vehicles?

851
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,351
The guys were like,

852
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,340
we can only do foot patrols.

853
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:31,791
Well,

854
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,601
what's up with the vehicles?

855
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,830
Why don't you do vehicle patrols?

856
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,221
What?

857
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:39,221
We don't have a fan belt and we can't
get a fan belt until we bring the vehicle

858
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:44,351
back to the brigade headquarters 150 miles
away to actually get the fan belt put

859
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:49,691
on because they won't push the parts
out because of the threat of them being

860
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,140
stolen on the way they,

861
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,150
they want all the equipment to go
back to the brigade headquarters,

862
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,860
which you can't get the vehicle.

863
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,270
There is no tow truck.

864
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,620
So there's those kinds of problems
where they have to figure out how to

865
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,820
logistically resupply their,

866
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,050
their self and sustain themselves.

867
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,490
They have to be trained on all that.

868
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:11,871
Wow.

869
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,280
That is bananas.

870
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,230
What a crazy place.

871
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,213
Crazy place.

872
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,900
Crazy place.

873
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,350
Is there a sense of
helplessness about that?

874
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:21,820
When,

875
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,550
when you're there,

876
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,331
like when you look at this,

877
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:23,960
you liked,

878
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,250
how is anybody gonna fix this?

879
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,641
First of all,

880
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:25,881
Jamie,

881
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,050
can you turn the AC on in here?

882
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,491
It was hot.

883
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:28,324
It's fucking hat.

884
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,340
Is there a sense of helplessness at all?

885
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,200
Um,

886
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,940
yeah.

887
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,120
You,

888
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,370
you,

889
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,900
I mean it depends on who you talk to.

890
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,770
You talked to the officers in the
army and some of the other folks,

891
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,540
um,

892
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:40,820
you know,

893
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,140
that see the big picture
sometimes and they're,

894
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:43,974
um,

895
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,580
they believe it's,

896
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:44,921
it can,

897
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:45,930
it can be one,

898
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,000
they believe that the Afghans can win it.

899
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,260
The Afghans can,

900
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,850
can resist the Taliban and then you
talk to the enlisted guys and typically

901
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,720
every one of them says it's going to take
generations and generations to change

902
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:57,931
this.

903
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,670
And if it changes,

904
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:00,990
I wouldn't want,

905
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,231
I mean,

906
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:05,880
how would you possibly get the internet
to these people and these mud huts?

907
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean it seems like if
the Internet is the hope,

908
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,390
how do you get the Internet to
people that don't have running water?

909
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,110
I mean it seems like that would be
their number one priority first and,

910
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:16,291
well,

911
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,670
I mean they're doing a lot of good there.

912
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,533
I mean life.

913
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,793
Um,

914
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,401
you know,

915
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,530
like I was reading some
statistics since we got there.

916
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:22,830
Like,

917
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,190
you know,

918
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,680
the amount of literacy
has gone through the roof,

919
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:25,890
you know,

920
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,420
life expectancy,

921
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,550
infant mortality has gone down,

922
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,900
life expectancy has gone up.

923
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,530
So many good things have happened
in 13 years in that place.

924
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:38,640
We built some roads now and
some infrastructure that
go all the way around the

925
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:41,520
entire country of Afghanistan
is a giant circle.

926
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,650
And,

927
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,880
and so we've done a lot of good things.

928
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,743
Um,

929
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,670
but basically the international community,

930
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:48,690
because it wasn't just us,

931
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:49,890
this was a NATO mission.

932
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,160
The first time I was told
that NATO was ever invoked.

933
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,263
NATO wasn't with,

934
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,800
started to,

935
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,570
uh,

936
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:56,940
you know,

937
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,030
work in Europe to defend everybody,

938
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:00,211
uh,

939
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,800
against the,

940
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,130
uh,

941
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,611
access,

942
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:07,611
I guess m and we invoke NATO's support
after September 11th and NATO came to our

943
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:09,540
aid.

944
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,740
And so that,

945
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,210
what was interesting was,

946
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:12,391
you know,

947
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:17,391
there was military members from like 50
or 60 nations in Afghanistan when I was

948
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:18,570
there.

949
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,990
A lot of them weren't going out and
doing patrols like the Germans were.

950
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,780
And some other countries were
actually out there engaged.

951
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,060
But most of them were sort of,

952
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:27,570
you know,

953
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,800
doing stuff that was,

954
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:29,634
um,

955
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,020
nation building kind of events
as opposed to direct combat.

956
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:34,951
But,

957
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:35,700
um,

958
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:35,911
you know,

959
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:40,650
so that's the hope is that
the international community
doesn't abandoned this

960
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:44,760
country because if they don't have the
money to pay their army and pay their

961
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:45,594
soldiers,

962
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,400
it falls apart.

963
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,540
So now the United States has pulling
out the majority of troops from

964
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,374
Afghanistan.

965
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,990
And what happens then?

966
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:55,741
What is,

967
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:56,131
what is the,

968
00:28:56,131 --> 00:29:00,750
what's the number one concern from the
people that have been there that are on

969
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:01,560
the ground?

970
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,850
Like what's the number one concern?

971
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,730
I think America leaving
completely their there.

972
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,310
You know,

973
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,590
the,

974
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,120
the President Asha Afghani and the
Prime Minister of Doula Doula came to

975
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:12,751
Washington,

976
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:17,640
I think recently just
talked to the president and
basically both thanked him and

977
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:21,720
thanked America for all the sacrifice
that it's made to help their country.

978
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,310
But,

979
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,570
but basically basically pleaded with him,

980
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,523
don't leave,

981
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,520
we need you to stay.

982
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:27,510
We are too fragile.

983
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:28,350
We are too young.

984
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,420
And I think that's the biggest fear of,

985
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,090
of the people there is that we will
completely abandoned them and Taliban will

986
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,050
come back into power.

987
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,700
Now there's a,

988
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,890
there's a growing segment of,

989
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,020
um,

990
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,960
in this country and all around the world.

991
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:47,410
I guess that I don't like American,

992
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,273
uh,

993
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,920
interventionalism if that's a word.

994
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,170
They don't like the fact
that we're nation building.

995
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,240
They don't like the fact that we'd go
over there and tried to clean up this mess

996
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,140
that's existed.

997
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,621
I mean,

998
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,101
or you know,

999
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,540
whatever he called a mass,

1000
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,160
call it a cultural divide,

1001
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:03,310
what,

1002
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,210
whatever you want to call it.

1003
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,440
Impose our standards of living
and our ideas in this place.

1004
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,033
Um,

1005
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,173
but these,

1006
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,260
the people that live there,

1007
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:14,310
they want this,

1008
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,140
they want to run it.

1009
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,071
Yeah.

1010
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,540
I mean the locals are so glad.

1011
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,620
I mean life under the Taliban was,

1012
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,960
was brutal and horrible,

1013
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,390
but back to your point of
nation building and stuff,

1014
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,500
you know,

1015
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,270
either got to commit and do it or you
got to just go do what you gotta do and

1016
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:30,930
leave.

1017
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,620
So like,

1018
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:31,830
you know,

1019
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,910
when we went into Afghanistan,

1020
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:33,031
right.

1021
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:38,031
And it was to kill al Qaeda and Sama Bin
Ladin and we sort of didn't ever want

1022
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,420
to mess with the Taliban.

1023
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:39,930
Really.

1024
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,760
Taliban didn't have international goals.

1025
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:44,130
I don't think they were just
wanted their piece of the world.

1026
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,151
It was al Qaeda.

1027
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:45,661
That was,

1028
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:46,470
you know,

1029
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,250
hurt us,

1030
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,083
attacked us,

1031
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,730
and Taliban wouldn't give all,

1032
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,643
I'll kind of over.

1033
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,370
So we went there and tried to,

1034
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,390
tried to get kill every,

1035
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:57,240
all kind of member we could
took awhile still happening.

1036
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,583
Um,

1037
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,170
but the,

1038
00:30:59,170 --> 00:30:59,520
the,

1039
00:30:59,520 --> 00:30:59,940
you know,

1040
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,490
we got drug into this Taliban conflict.

1041
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,840
We've got drug into it and 14
years later we're still there.

1042
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,003
Um,

1043
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,173
so,

1044
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,403
you know,

1045
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,940
I think there's going to be a debate,

1046
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,790
national debate one day on
nation building and using,

1047
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,690
you know,

1048
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,650
the military to,

1049
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,820
to build nations.

1050
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,900
Um,

1051
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,920
because I always thought the military
was designed to destroy an enemy and,

1052
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,323
and then leave.

1053
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,720
But now maybe that's
changing and politicians,

1054
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:31,830
you want them to destroy the enemy
or kind of destroy the enemy,

1055
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,040
but then help build up a nation.

1056
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,110
If that's what you want them to do,

1057
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,720
then at least build them like that,

1058
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,471
right?

1059
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:41,304
Build them,

1060
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,673
um,

1061
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,730
to succeed in that environment.

1062
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,163
Um,

1063
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,670
but I think the fighting season,

1064
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,260
the importance of this
is we're going to show,

1065
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:49,740
you know,

1066
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,460
how we left Afghanistan with the
fighting season Docu series and whatever

1067
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:55,470
happens in Afghanistan down the road,

1068
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,230
if it,

1069
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,400
if it crashes and Burns or success story,

1070
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,301
you know,

1071
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:00,841
we'll,

1072
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:01,081
we'll,

1073
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:04,230
we'll be able to reference the fighting
season from the soldiers perspectives of

1074
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:06,630
how we left it in 2014.

1075
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,220
There's a lot of people that are very
cynical about nation building because

1076
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,830
there's a lot of money involved
and that money involved.

1077
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:13,170
I mean,

1078
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,440
especially when Dick Cheney
was the vice president,

1079
00:32:15,441 --> 00:32:15,711
of course,

1080
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:18,230
he was the former CEO of Halliburton.

1081
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:21,650
Halliburton got those
gigantic multibillion dollar,

1082
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:26,651
no bid contracts to go over there and
rebuild areas that we had destroyed.

1083
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,350
And a lot of people recognize that
there was a whole industry behind that.

1084
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:33,620
Now,

1085
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,510
not just the military industrial complex,

1086
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:37,670
but this rebuilding industry,

1087
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,960
the contracting.

1088
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,711
It was,

1089
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,160
it became

1090
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,330
an enormous sense,

1091
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,120
an enormous source rather of,

1092
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,963
of money.

1093
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,633
Yeah.

1094
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,480
I can't really speak to that too much.

1095
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,373
Um,

1096
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,670
what I can say is that,

1097
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:49,851
you know,

1098
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:50,684
I saw some,

1099
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:55,250
some places that the Afghans had built
some Afghan bases that they had actually

1100
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,300
constructed on their own.

1101
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,370
We paid for them to build it.

1102
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,421
And you know,

1103
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:01,340
some of the guys that control
the money were telling me,

1104
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:01,581
you know,

1105
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:05,480
this would have taken us
two years and this much,

1106
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,270
lots of money to build these guys,

1107
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:08,991
built it in,

1108
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:09,824
you know,

1109
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,410
nine months and for way less.

1110
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,771
Yeah,

1111
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,660
maybe the craftsmanship is not as good.

1112
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:14,961
You know,

1113
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:18,650
it's one of like Mexico kind of block
housing as opposed to what we might have

1114
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,190
built.

1115
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,023
But it was,

1116
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,170
it was enough.

1117
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:21,711
It was official.

1118
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:22,544
It's efficient.

1119
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,421
And so,

1120
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:23,810
you know,

1121
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,430
these guys I was with with the army,

1122
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:29,660
we're very proud of the fact that they
were able to get money cut loose from

1123
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:33,530
that contracting process and get it to
the Afghans to help their local economy,

1124
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:35,240
to help them build stuff,

1125
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,780
you know,

1126
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,130
get employed their people.

1127
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,383
And so,

1128
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,560
you know,

1129
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,830
Joe,

1130
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,120
I'm sure you know,

1131
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,320
you know,

1132
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,850
I don't discount what you say at all.

1133
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,661
I'm sure that there's,

1134
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:45,740
when there's money involved,

1135
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:47,210
people do crazy things.

1136
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,350
Um,

1137
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,891
but you know,

1138
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,480
I just know the guys that I was with,

1139
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,800
they ain't getting paid a lot of money.

1140
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,220
The soldiers in getting
paid a lot of money there,

1141
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,570
they're walking towards the gunfire,

1142
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,230
happy to do it for next to nothing and
not next to nothing that's disrespectful

1143
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,730
and they have a sufficient income.

1144
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,940
But,

1145
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,060
but it's still not to risk your life.

1146
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:08,894
I don't know.

1147
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,950
They don't do it for money,

1148
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:10,881
honestly.

1149
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:12,110
They don't do it for month money.

1150
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,970
The first day you get up in the morning
in Afghanistan was a feeling like,

1151
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,220
like you're in Mars.

1152
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,100
It's just like you're in a new unit,

1153
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,070
a new world,

1154
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:25,731
you know,

1155
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,260
you don't know anybody.

1156
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,000
There's no friendly faces,

1157
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,110
you know?

1158
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,680
Nope.

1159
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,880
Everybody's looking at you like,

1160
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,870
what are you doing here?

1161
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,840
Even the soldiers you're
with are leery of you.

1162
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,330
So it's like you're just on your own.

1163
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:38,841
You know?

1164
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:40,700
It's like you taking care of yourself,

1165
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:41,380
self,

1166
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,100
self reliance in that place.

1167
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,300
Nobody's going to carry your water.

1168
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,550
Nobody's going to pack your stuff.

1169
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,340
Nobody's gonna make sure you make
it somewhere on time or don't,

1170
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,050
you know,

1171
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,730
you're just self reliant.

1172
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,200
And so it's,

1173
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:54,951
it's just feels like,

1174
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,600
okay,

1175
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,310
um,

1176
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,780
um,

1177
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,970
I'm on my own and it's kind of a,

1178
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,380
you know,

1179
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,540
and then eventually you
know that that wears away.

1180
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,720
You start meeting people and you start
seeing friendly faces and there's certain

1181
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:06,870
Afghans that you start to,

1182
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,251
to really,

1183
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,084
like,

1184
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,290
especially the interpreters,

1185
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,850
these young men that are in their early
twenties that are risking everything to

1186
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:17,810
work with the US army on the hopes that
they're going to get on the promise that

1187
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,790
they're going to get a green
card from the State Department.

1188
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,120
And there's many of them
that aren't getting them for,

1189
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,003
for whatever reasons,

1190
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,843
I don't know.

1191
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,120
But these young interpreters
that are risking it all,

1192
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:29,331
I mean,

1193
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:30,220
I remember them saying,

1194
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,970
please don't put my face on the picture
because if the Taliban see it and they

1195
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:36,800
can see it now anywhere they said,

1196
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:37,740
then,

1197
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,370
you know,

1198
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,420
they may kill me.

1199
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,200
They may,

1200
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,801
one guy said,

1201
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:44,250
they may hang me in my village by
quarters and yell to my family,

1202
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,090
come get some meat.

1203
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,260
We just slaughtered a sheep.

1204
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,971
And so I said,

1205
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:48,391
okay man,

1206
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,440
I won't show your face.

1207
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,530
But like so,

1208
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:51,870
so,

1209
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,331
but anyway,

1210
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,640
so you served to meet these,

1211
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,880
these young Afghans and you start to
see the commitment they have for their

1212
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,001
country,

1213
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,290
for what a better way of life.

1214
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,910
And it's just so inspiring.

1215
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,060
And then show it to me,

1216
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,920
make friends with soldiers and you know,

1217
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,710
all of a sudden you start to
feel like you're part of the,

1218
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,061
of a,

1219
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:09,391
of a,

1220
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,224
of a group.

1221
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,740
So you,

1222
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,480
you go out with these people and are what,

1223
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,540
what information do they
give you about what's ahead?

1224
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,010
Did they say we're leaving,

1225
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,941
come with us.

1226
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:21,420
I mean,

1227
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,460
how do you know what's going to happen?

1228
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,000
Do you,

1229
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,410
are you privy to meetings?

1230
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:26,190
Like

1231
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,371
yeah,

1232
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,190
so there's a process called the
military decision making process.

1233
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:34,191
MDMP and it's when an order comes down
from above that you have a mission,

1234
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,760
you sit and you do a big briefing and
you do what's called mission analysis.

1235
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,520
And so the leadership of the
battalion in this case task force,

1236
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:45,000
White Devil of the 82nd airborne that
we were embedded with on one of these

1237
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:45,834
missions.

1238
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,973
Um,

1239
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,540
Lieutenant Colonel Paul Larson,

1240
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,470
the commander of task force,

1241
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:50,304
White Devil,

1242
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,210
um,

1243
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,190
we will call up mission analysis meeting.

1244
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,430
And so all of the leadership
of the battalion 800 guys,

1245
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,270
but just the,

1246
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,850
the leadership would assemble and
you would go through the mission,

1247
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,684
you would talk about it.

1248
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,520
This is what they want us to accomplish.

1249
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,910
This is the resources we,

1250
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,220
we think we need.

1251
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,150
Um,

1252
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,983
now I need,

1253
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,350
you know,

1254
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,270
all of us to go back
and make a mission plan.

1255
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,350
How are we going to move,

1256
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,580
you know,

1257
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,570
200 guys,

1258
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,560
you know,

1259
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,990
200 miles to the border of Pakistan.

1260
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,450
How are we going to set up
shop out there for two weeks?

1261
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,530
What villages that were going to air
assault based on intelligence that we can

1262
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,020
generate because they only
have finite resources.

1263
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:25,890
So everything has to be,

1264
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,540
everything has to be,

1265
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,270
all,

1266
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,270
all operations are,

1267
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,810
are driven by intelligence.

1268
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,710
You don't just go somewhere on the hopes
you go there because you have a reason

1269
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:35,544
to go there.

1270
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,960
That there's bad guys there,

1271
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,990
that there's routes there that they're
moving explosives from Pakistan and

1272
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:40,824
Afghanistan.

1273
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,180
And so you do an admission
analysis and then you know,

1274
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,110
everybody comes back
together a few days later,

1275
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,370
you lay out the plan,

1276
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:47,851
you were fine.

1277
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,271
The plan,

1278
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:49,350
you do the location Scout,

1279
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,820
I call them location scouts,

1280
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,713
like a movie,

1281
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,920
like a movie.

1282
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,270
Cause I shot him like that.

1283
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,101
But you,

1284
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:58,020
you actually go to the potential
forward operating bases,

1285
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:59,480
you're going to strike bases,

1286
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,810
you're going to operate from you scout
those you meet with the African partners

1287
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,780
that you're going to partner with because
all these operations we want and we're

1288
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,390
joint operations Afghans and army next.

1289
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,500
And so you meet with them and
then you come back and you,

1290
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,334
um,

1291
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,770
you run it by the general and you say,

1292
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:17,161
okay,

1293
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,120
we've done our homework.

1294
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,230
This is what we need.

1295
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,780
This is what we're going to accomplish.

1296
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,370
These are the risks.

1297
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,320
And the general looks at the plan and
either of course as Jemilla's do either,

1298
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,640
you know,

1299
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,210
it says good no or tweak it and they
usually say tweak it and you tweak it and

1300
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,200
then you're off and running.

1301
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,710
Then you're conducting the operation.

1302
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,313
Now

1303
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,130
how did you decide on the amount of days
that you went there and how many hours

1304
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,490
of footage did you have to go through
to put together this six part?

1305
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,590
It's a six part docu series,

1306
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:47,970
correct?

1307
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,181
Yeah.

1308
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:49,110
At six one hours.

1309
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,620
It's also on direct TV for any
of you that may have at directv.

1310
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,390
The CEO Mike White,

1311
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:54,960
really quick.

1312
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,620
Um,

1313
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,620
I cold emailed him when I got home from
Afghanistan and he decided to move out

1314
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,250
and make this,

1315
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,450
but I had 650 hours of footage and um,

1316
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,610
and you know,

1317
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:09,421
a lot of it was,

1318
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:10,254
you know,

1319
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,790
kind of dead end stories because you
would go out on for a few days with

1320
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:17,700
different soldiers on different
operations and nothing would happen.

1321
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,500
And it was just sort of a dead end
opportunity that you couldn't develop.

1322
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:23,850
So

1323
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,210
put any of that in there to show
that there's a lot of frustration.

1324
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,440
A lot of these things don't pan out.

1325
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,110
Not,

1326
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,351
no,

1327
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:30,710
we,

1328
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,030
we didn't put any dead ends in.

1329
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,360
We didn't put any dead in
characters in let's say we,

1330
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:34,670
we,

1331
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:34,910
we,

1332
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,300
we put in all the characters that we
wanted to and the missions that we wanted

1333
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,440
to show [inaudible] and sometimes
there was conflict in those.

1334
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,460
Sometimes,

1335
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:43,731
you know,

1336
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:46,460
between soldiers you'll
see that there's sometimes,

1337
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,061
you know,

1338
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,630
everyone has this perception
that if you're in the army,

1339
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:49,970
you blindly follow orders.

1340
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,170
It's not the case.

1341
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,560
You may do that in front of
people blindly follow it.

1342
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,000
But behind closed doors,

1343
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,540
you,

1344
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,050
you don't,

1345
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,380
you don't blindly follow anything when
you're dealing with your life and the

1346
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:01,490
life of your teammates.

1347
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,750
The stakes are so high.

1348
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,040
Everybody wants to go home,

1349
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:04,641
you know,

1350
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:07,130
nobody wants to be the last
person to die in Afghanistan.

1351
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,503
So,

1352
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,950
so we actually got to see
that whole process of,

1353
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,563
you know,

1354
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,030
questioning a superior officer,

1355
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,730
whether he's doing the right thing or not.

1356
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,001
So you got to see they,

1357
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,181
they,

1358
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:23,630
they do that in the face
of a superior officer?

1359
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,890
Not Typically in face.

1360
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,080
Typically behind the scenes they will,

1361
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:29,914
if they have to,

1362
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,600
they will if they have to,

1363
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,550
if it's in the moment
and they don't have time,

1364
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,670
like in the moment if the guy
said go jump off that bridge,

1365
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,790
I think he would confront him
face to face cause it's imminent.

1366
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,170
Right.

1367
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,860
But if it's,

1368
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,270
if it's something that you can let slide
for a moment and then go talk to him

1369
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:46,840
later,

1370
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,100
that's typically the way they handle it.

1371
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:51,700
Now are you storing tapes?

1372
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:52,601
I mean how many,

1373
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,300
how many guys do you have over there
that are filming and how are you getting

1374
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:56,134
this stuff back?

1375
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,191
Yeah,

1376
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:57,961
so we're shooting,

1377
00:40:57,961 --> 00:40:58,794
um,

1378
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,030
I have three camera teams plus me and
so I would embed each camera team with

1379
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:04,440
different units doing different missions.

1380
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:09,441
Then I would rotate through the
camera teams and so we would shoot on,

1381
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,370
on,

1382
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:15,630
on cards and we would back every night
and have to backup our media to the hard

1383
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:15,991
drives,

1384
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:17,070
to rugged hard drives.

1385
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,890
And then we would,

1386
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,220
you know,

1387
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,450
have to charge our batteries because we
would run out of batteries oftentimes if

1388
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:25,284
we didn't.

1389
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,920
And then we would send that
media back every three,

1390
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:29,580
four weeks,

1391
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,380
we'd send a dump of footage back home.

1392
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,340
And in my editorial we'd
ingest it and start,

1393
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,240
you know,

1394
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,073
organizing it,

1395
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,700
but 650 hours of footage.

1396
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,773
Wow.

1397
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,140
So did you have a Internet
access when you're out there?

1398
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,640
Like strong inner access?

1399
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,620
Never strong satellite.

1400
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,693
But if you were like,

1401
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,151
you know,

1402
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:48,410
meet a major army base,

1403
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,453
like um,

1404
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,900
Kandahar and then you would have internet
intermittently but not enough where

1405
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,300
you could upload footage
to a server somewhere.

1406
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,780
No,

1407
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,980
very slow speeds.

1408
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,330
Wow.

1409
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,370
So you

1410
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,110
dealing with hundreds of
hours of footage then,

1411
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,060
and you've got to break this down to a
six hour docu series and you have to do

1412
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:12,080
it justice and you have to do it justice
also because not just because it's a

1413
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:12,990
significant part

1414
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,460
of American history,

1415
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:19,930
it's the lives of these soldiers that
you have become friends with and comrades

1416
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:20,710
with.

1417
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,900
But you're,

1418
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,260
you,

1419
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,580
you,

1420
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,400
you're trying to do this
whole thing justice.

1421
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,541
Well.

1422
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:25,990
Yeah,

1423
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,280
I mean that's the reason to do it.

1424
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,114
I mean,

1425
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,090
the reason to do it is to do it justice,

1426
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,051
to do it right,

1427
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,250
to show the way it is,

1428
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:37,210
to not come at it with
an angular is a spin.

1429
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,420
But just to tell their story
and honor how hard they,

1430
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,593
what they do is,

1431
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,710
and to honor all those who
served there and lost their,

1432
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,821
you know,

1433
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:51,220
it's you,

1434
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,470
you,

1435
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:51,760
you,

1436
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,370
I did it because I wanted
to tell their stories.

1437
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,450
You know,

1438
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,640
and you don't do that for money.

1439
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,650
You don't go get shot at from money.

1440
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,270
It just doesn't work that way.

1441
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,570
You go to that because you want,

1442
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,370
because you feel it's important for the
world to know who we are as a nation,

1443
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,730
who are army is and who the
people are behind the army.

1444
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,130
The army is an amazing group of guys,

1445
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,190
Great Amazing Institution and people and
I thought it was really important too

1446
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,290
to show who they are.

1447
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,540
They,

1448
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,130
they are the best of us.

1449
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,510
The best of America I think.

1450
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:29,441
I mean,

1451
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,640
they were some of the smartest,

1452
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:31,301
bravest,

1453
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:34,780
courageous people who,

1454
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,610
who are doing this because they,

1455
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:36,920
they,

1456
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,170
they feel a sense of

1457
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,740
love for their country,

1458
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,920
true love for their country and,

1459
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,440
and the values that we hold deal deer.

1460
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,220
And so I wanted to,

1461
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,890
to show she showcase that

1462
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,970
they have a true love for our
country and true love for the values.

1463
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:58,870
And what do they think they're
accomplishing by being in Afghanistan?

1464
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:03,490
What is the primary sentiment that they
think that they're accomplishing by

1465
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:04,360
being over there?

1466
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,950
By eliminating the Taliban,

1467
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,450
by weakening the Taliban,

1468
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:12,510
by empowering the local so that they can
help reduce their area of the Taliban.

1469
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,800
I don't think they even necessarily
think about some of those things because

1470
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:20,780
they go where the
president tells them to go.

1471
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,020
They go where our country
orders them to go.

1472
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,573
Um,

1473
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,930
I think that's,

1474
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,171
it's a,

1475
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:27,361
it's,

1476
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:30,560
it's a more like personal
kind of thing for them.

1477
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:31,394
And that is,

1478
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,101
you know,

1479
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:32,934
they,

1480
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,420
they're willing to risk it all,

1481
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,250
you know,

1482
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,900
they're willing to give everything,

1483
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,373
um,

1484
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,580
to fight the evil of our generation,

1485
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,200
radical Islam.

1486
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,030
And so,

1487
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:48,883
you know,

1488
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,000
they have commitment
like you've never seen,

1489
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,900
like I've never seen.

1490
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,850
The commitment is phenomenal.

1491
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,271
You know,

1492
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:57,960
you think a suicide bombers committed
and have a vehicle borne IED drivers

1493
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,370
committed and they are,

1494
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,990
but make no doubt about it.

1495
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:01,171
That,

1496
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:01,560
that,

1497
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,560
that our soldier that decides to walk
towards the enemy close and destroy him is

1498
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,120
every bit as committed as,

1499
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,590
as that suicide bomber.

1500
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:13,410
Except we don't go to try to
kill civilians like they do.

1501
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:14,221
Right.

1502
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:15,510
We'd go to try to kill them,

1503
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:16,344
the enemy.

1504
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,300
And so I think that's where they,

1505
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,160
I think that's the message that I got
from my experience there and watching them

1506
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,280
and I think that they're proud of is
that they're willing to do whatever it

1507
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:26,700
takes.

1508
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,050
They'll go anywhere you asked them to.

1509
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,300
They,

1510
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:29,580
they,

1511
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,110
they just,

1512
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:30,943
they will.

1513
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,380
I heard soldiers say it as long as
I've got my body armor and my helmet,

1514
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:35,820
I'll go where they have
the hell you want me to.

1515
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,770
What do you think is a difference between
the perception the average American

1516
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,520
has over here safely guarded,

1517
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,770
protected in,

1518
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,900
in our country?

1519
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,550
What do you think the misconceptions
that most people have are about what's

1520
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:54,420
going on over there?

1521
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,160
What are the primary misconceptions?

1522
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,330
Um,

1523
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,670
that the Africans don't want us there at.

1524
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,200
The African people don't want us there.

1525
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,000
The Afghans want us there.

1526
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,830
The locals want us,

1527
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:06,150
they're the ones that don't want,

1528
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,440
um,

1529
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:07,741
you know,

1530
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,560
radical Islam and Sharia
law to govern the land.

1531
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:11,483
They want us there.

1532
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,380
And so I think that's the thing I
didn't understand when I went there is,

1533
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,400
is how much the locals are
grateful and thankful that,

1534
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,500
that we are there and that we've,

1535
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,090
we've done what we've done.

1536
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:24,241
I mean,

1537
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:27,030
I had Afghan officers in the army,

1538
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,960
thank me.

1539
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,520
I would say to the camera,

1540
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:30,690
I would point the camera at them and say,

1541
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:32,100
do you have any messages from America?

1542
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:36,000
And they would thank America's parents
for sending sons and daughters here to

1543
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,211
die,

1544
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:36,760
for us to,

1545
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,441
to fix us,

1546
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:38,274
to help us.

1547
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,720
Like they really,

1548
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:42,120
really are thankful that we're there.

1549
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:44,310
And that's just something you
don't get a sense of back here.

1550
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,163
Um,

1551
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:47,490
you know,

1552
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,160
one of the other things I'm most proud
about the fighting season that I think

1553
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:52,020
you'll get to see is,

1554
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,800
um,

1555
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,041
you know,

1556
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:56,010
we show how the rules of engagement,

1557
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,443
um,

1558
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,850
work in ways,

1559
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,181
you know,

1560
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:00,441
when,

1561
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:01,980
when it comes to drone warfare,

1562
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:02,851
you know,

1563
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:06,660
there's a perception out there that like
the u s military establishments out of

1564
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:07,494
control,

1565
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,610
that they're just sort of
shooting missiles randomly
it bad guys and don't care

1566
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:12,900
about killing civilians.

1567
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:13,621
Well,

1568
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:15,360
I can tell you if you
watched the fighting season,

1569
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:17,460
you'll see something
different to that narrative.

1570
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,410
You'll actually see how it works and
when they're willing to and when they're

1571
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:25,050
willing to not risk collateral damage.

1572
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,240
The,

1573
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,950
the real issue that people have
is when they read just raw,

1574
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,220
when they read

1575
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,990
the raw numbers of innocent civilians
killed by drones versus the intended

1576
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:35,824
targets,

1577
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,370
and they're pretty heavily and on the
side of innocent civilians killed.

1578
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,480
I think the last count was something
like 80% that that's hard for people to

1579
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:43,780
swallow.

1580
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,271
But here's the thing,

1581
00:47:44,271 --> 00:47:45,104
you don't remember,

1582
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,740
the army is different than the CIA.

1583
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,340
It's different than any
other branch of the military.

1584
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:52,600
That's using drone warfare.

1585
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:57,930
And I think that's an
important distinction that we
have to remember is that the

1586
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:01,560
US army fights according to its own.

1587
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,630
It's a,

1588
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:07,480
it's a set of values and principles that
are different from other organizations

1589
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,470
that do that stuff.

1590
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,900
And I think that's one of the things
about the fighting season is you're going

1591
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:12,610
to see how,

1592
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,840
how different they are.

1593
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,890
Now we also have this conception of these,

1594
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,380
there's perception rather have these
people sitting in a room somewhere with

1595
00:48:24,381 --> 00:48:25,820
like an Xbox controller,

1596
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,840
no one near the action and they're
controlling these drones and firing.

1597
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:36,341
If these black and white screens looking
at night vision and a very nondescript

1598
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,180
images there,

1599
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,840
they're trying to determine whether
or not these are the actual enemy.

1600
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,930
What is the actual reality
of using those drones?

1601
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,001
Well,

1602
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:46,211
I,

1603
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:48,580
I was never with the actual
pilots of the drones.

1604
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,900
Where are those pilots?

1605
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,980
They can be local or they can
be over here in the states.

1606
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,030
I mean they can be,

1607
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,770
they can be remote.

1608
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,470
Um,

1609
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,970
how are they doing it remotely?

1610
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,400
Like if they do it remotely as it
through the internet or is it through

1611
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:02,234
satellites

1612
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,100
gotta be satellite?

1613
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:03,410
I would,

1614
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,030
I don't know.

1615
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,660
But I would think it's got to be sound
light and it's instinct control like

1616
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:07,690
there's no delays.

1617
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,580
It's instinct control of the,

1618
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:09,941
of the,

1619
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:10,481
of the drone.

1620
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,314
But when I

1621
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,071
be some delay,

1622
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:13,620
I mean there's a ping,

1623
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,170
there must be something.

1624
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:17,090
But the reality is the guys I was,

1625
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,050
I worked with,

1626
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,170
I was with task force white
devil when we were using drones.

1627
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,663
Um,

1628
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,030
so our guys would be watching the drone
feeds and you would be looking on,

1629
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:28,670
you know,

1630
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,010
the enemy to see if you
could pick up an RPG,

1631
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,120
um,

1632
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,280
or a weapon that's a prestige weapons
system because it has to be sort of a,

1633
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:39,080
a higher level weapon system to
make them a valid military target,

1634
00:49:39,081 --> 00:49:39,914
let's say.

1635
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,770
So you would be looking at,

1636
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,040
at the drone feeds and then the guys
would be typing and communicating with the

1637
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:50,840
drum pilots in a chat room.

1638
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,090
And so there's real time communication
going on and real time coordination and

1639
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:58,070
realtime jags involved.

1640
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:03,100
John a judge advocate general's I'm
involved in the process at this point of,

1641
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,393
you know,

1642
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,440
have you met the rules of engagement
because there's different kinds of strikes

1643
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:10,790
to there's kinetic strikes,

1644
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:11,780
dynamic strikes.

1645
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,041
So like if you're in,

1646
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:13,874
um,

1647
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:14,570
uh,

1648
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:19,130
troops in combat situation and you're
the ground force commander and you're

1649
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:22,370
running a company and you know that
there's an enemy fighting position by that

1650
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:23,204
rock,

1651
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:23,840
you know,

1652
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,290
theoretically you have the authority if
there's no other assets available to get

1653
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:31,460
the drone to attack the enemy behind
the rock as the ground force commander.

1654
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,260
But then there's other,

1655
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,900
other,

1656
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,280
um,

1657
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,730
kinds of strikes that are like preplanned,

1658
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,750
like you're going after a terrorist
that has a known name and a known face.

1659
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:47,030
And so the rules of engagement for him
will be different than the rules of

1660
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,090
engagement for the troops in
combat rules of engagement.

1661
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,920
So there's all these different,

1662
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,050
and depending on where
you're on and the list,

1663
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:58,490
how bad they want you is how much
risk they're willing to take as far as

1664
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,930
collateral damage.

1665
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,860
Was there ever a time when you were
over there where you second guessed your

1666
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:04,694
decision?

1667
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,680
No,

1668
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:07,860
I,

1669
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,540
I never,

1670
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,051
I mean I,

1671
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:09,530
okay,

1672
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,100
one moment we just been
in a troops and conduct,

1673
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:17,390
we just had like an hour fight with
four different enemy fighting positions,

1674
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,310
about 800 meters north of us.

1675
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,940
And so we'd had about an hour
gunfight from 800 meters.

1676
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,160
But the bullets when they zip overhead,

1677
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,350
they sound like they're
breaking the sound barrier.

1678
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,220
And so there's like a sonic boom and you
could see them playing in the dust all

1679
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:31,611
around you.

1680
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:31,821
And so,

1681
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:32,121
you know,

1682
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,410
all that's going on for an hour.

1683
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,320
And then we,

1684
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,430
we dropped B,

1685
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,140
one bomber flew overhead and we dropped,

1686
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:44,290
you couldn't see it but it dropped 500
pound bombs on the enemy and the firing

1687
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:46,580
stopped and you know,

1688
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,620
after about a half hour and
the ground force commander,

1689
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:50,660
Captain Ray Adams said,

1690
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:52,130
let's go do a battle damage assessment.

1691
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,210
Let's walk over there.

1692
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,493
Let's see,

1693
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,100
you know,

1694
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,060
if there's any left.

1695
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,310
And so at that moment,

1696
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,570
like when,

1697
00:51:59,600 --> 00:51:59,781
you know,

1698
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:04,781
the platoon is strapping up to walk across
800 meters of open valley desert into

1699
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:05,960
this green zone,

1700
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:09,680
which is really thick vegetation where
they can hide anywhere and there's mud

1701
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:10,514
walls everywhere.

1702
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,720
You know,

1703
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,400
I'm starting to think
to myself at this point,

1704
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:14,630
like I have a great wife.

1705
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,310
I really liked to Panga.

1706
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:17,563
I like my,

1707
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,860
I like my wife.

1708
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:19,880
I like my kids,

1709
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,493
you know,

1710
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,060
I'm walking with this young platoon,

1711
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:23,894
you know,

1712
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,030
to this place where we
were just in a fight.

1713
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,351
I said,

1714
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:28,250
why am I doing it?

1715
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,330
And I questioned why am I
doing it and should I go?

1716
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,270
And then I thought,

1717
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,031
oh yeah,

1718
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:35,864
I should go,

1719
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,333
but why?

1720
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:42,350
And then I realized I was going because
they were going and I had to tell people

1721
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:43,184
they were going.

1722
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,383
So I went with them.

1723
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,793
Wow.

1724
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,220
And so you get over there.

1725
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:50,960
And what was the damage assessment?

1726
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,320
Just pieces of clothing.

1727
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,190
Uh,

1728
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,401
you know,

1729
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:56,870
remanence of people.

1730
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:58,463
Um,

1731
00:52:58,490 --> 00:52:59,270
no,

1732
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,481
you know,

1733
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:01,310
a couple guys hiding that we,

1734
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,144
that we found,

1735
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,353
um,

1736
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,880
had shovels in their hands.

1737
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,710
They put down their weapons.

1738
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,570
So there was nothing you could do.

1739
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,710
And um,

1740
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,023
as far as like,

1741
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,990
you couldn't prove anything.

1742
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,240
So I'll remember that.

1743
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,230
I remember this one,

1744
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,040
you know,

1745
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,873
big,

1746
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:18,260
Big Army Guy,

1747
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,530
I'll letting them and these
guys came up to him and after,

1748
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:21,951
you know,

1749
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,180
cat madams question them,

1750
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,070
the Afghan army guys questioned,

1751
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,820
everybody knew that
they were 99.9% Taliban.

1752
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:30,841
You know,

1753
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:31,111
they,

1754
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:32,680
they said that they didn't hear any guns,

1755
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,690
didn't hear any bullets.

1756
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,240
So you know what he talking about?

1757
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,850
The earth just shook from miles.

1758
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,163
Um,

1759
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,100
and we had a look and go and uh,

1760
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,811
as we let them go,

1761
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:42,930
they,

1762
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,120
they went up to try to shake my
hand and I'm holding a camera.

1763
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,020
I couldn't shake their hand,

1764
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,520
tried to shake other people's hands.

1765
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:51,720
Some people shook their hands goodbye
and they went up to this big sergeant and

1766
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,100
tried to shake his hand and he just said,

1767
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,880
you know,

1768
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,350
get the fuck Outta here motherfucker.

1769
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:56,250
I'll get you next time.

1770
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,210
And he was so pissed that
we had to let them go.

1771
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:03,030
Those guys that just tried to kill his,

1772
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,171
his buddies,

1773
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:04,990
him.

1774
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,390
And it's only because they
didn't have their guns on them.

1775
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,170
Yeah.

1776
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,003
Wow.

1777
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,450
That's so weird.

1778
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,711
What a weird,

1779
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,730
weird war.

1780
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,610
The Afghans look at us most and they must
shake their heads sometimes because I

1781
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:17,731
mean,

1782
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:18,181
I know,

1783
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:18,561
I mean I,

1784
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,270
I think I know what would have happened
if we weren't there of camera's weren't

1785
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,104
there.

1786
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,190
If the army wasn't there,

1787
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,020
they,

1788
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,530
those guys would have
never walked out of there.

1789
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,460
There was a time World War II when the
United States had taken a lot of Nazi

1790
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:37,300
prisoners and had them in prisoner of war
camps in America and treated them very

1791
00:54:37,301 --> 00:54:42,301
well and it was a chest before they had
found out how badly Americans were being

1792
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:44,890
treated over in Germany.

1793
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:47,630
And there was all these
different stories of American,

1794
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,480
more prisoners being gunned down,

1795
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:50,590
firing squads.

1796
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:55,591
They would find their frozen bodies tied
and bound and there was a big public

1797
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:57,220
outcry,

1798
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,390
congressional hearings,

1799
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,200
and they were trying to figure
out why are we doing this?

1800
00:55:02,201 --> 00:55:03,580
This is a tough time for America.

1801
00:55:03,581 --> 00:55:06,820
Why are we treating these
Nazi prisoners so well?

1802
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,510
And they're not
reciprocating like what it,

1803
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:10,540
what do we do about this?

1804
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,471
And,

1805
00:55:11,471 --> 00:55:12,304
um,

1806
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:17,370
they decided to keep doing what's right
and keep treating the prisoners under

1807
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:20,590
the same standards of
the Geneva Convention.

1808
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,770
And it's those,

1809
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,800
those regulations when things are horrific
like that where it seems like where

1810
00:55:30,611 --> 00:55:31,091
people are like,

1811
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:31,211
well,

1812
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:31,991
why would you do that?

1813
00:55:31,991 --> 00:55:33,970
Why would you let them go to those?

1814
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Those might be the only thing that keep
a situation like war from breaking down

1815
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:43,930
and becoming even more
horrible than it actually is.

1816
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,310
Agree.

1817
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:45,611
I mean,

1818
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:45,941
I agree.

1819
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:47,230
It sounds counter intuitive,

1820
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:47,620
right?

1821
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,520
I agree.

1822
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,601
I agree.

1823
00:55:49,601 --> 00:55:49,841
I mean,

1824
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:51,700
if you don't have those standards,

1825
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,980
then you know,

1826
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:54,880
then start,

1827
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,080
we'll start cutting their heads off,

1828
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:56,840
I guess.

1829
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,170
Yeah,

1830
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:57,550
right.

1831
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:57,771
Yeah.

1832
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,210
We'll start making youtube videos.

1833
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,193
So,

1834
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,320
but we luckily have those
standards and you know,

1835
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:06,154
we're not them.

1836
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,010
And that was,

1837
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,380
that was one of the main concerns about
Guantanamo Bay that we weren't following

1838
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,640
the Geneva Convention,

1839
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,620
that we had said that we would,

1840
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:17,190
uh,

1841
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,840
we wouldn't do it for al Qaeda,

1842
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:19,831
that I'll kind of,

1843
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:22,020
prisoners would not be treated
under the Geneva Convention.

1844
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:27,021
And the big concern would be what would
happen if they catch our troops over

1845
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,121
there?

1846
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,230
What would they do to them

1847
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,810
to know the answer to that?

1848
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,600
Exactly.

1849
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,680
That was the whole idea of the
Geneva Convention the first place.

1850
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,430
So even though like what you
saw seems counterintuitive.

1851
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:40,323
I mean

1852
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,880
it's Kinda how you have to do it well.

1853
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:43,151
Yeah.

1854
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:47,200
And the soldiers were frustrated and then
of course they follow orders and they

1855
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,390
let him go and they just hope next time,

1856
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,261
like he said,

1857
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:51,020
I'll get you next time,

1858
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:51,760
motherfucker.

1859
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,170
They just hope next time you hold his gun
a little longer so that you can verify

1860
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,770
with either a drone or with your own
eyes that he was an enemy combatant.

1861
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,503
Wow.

1862
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Is there a time that stands out that was
the most brutal or particularly brutal

1863
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,130
of all the different and
firefights are different,

1864
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,350
different scenarios that you encountered?

1865
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,510
You know,

1866
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:16,343
it was a time,

1867
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,230
it was a firefight that
I wasn't there for.

1868
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,010
One of my camera guys was,

1869
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:23,520
was there and river was his name.

1870
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,270
And uh,

1871
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:24,961
he's from Oregon.

1872
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:28,320
He's a biker and a crazy
guy covered in tattoos.

1873
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,600
And missing his front tooth,

1874
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,630
total hillbilly love river and um,

1875
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:39,060
and so river was in a gunfight with this
young platoon and we were reviewing his

1876
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:41,100
footage and I saw a tracer go by him,

1877
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:46,370
like between us that far away
and I just really got Kinda,

1878
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,310
it's so comb the reality
that river almost got shot.

1879
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,090
And then there was another time when I
had to get permission to descend bed.

1880
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,800
One of my cameramen from the U s army,

1881
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,540
Jake,

1882
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:57,900
uh,

1883
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,740
camera guy from Australia that I hired
who lives there and I had a decent bed,

1884
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:04,740
him from the u s army because he was
going on a mission with the Afghans.

1885
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,581
When you say he lives there,

1886
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:06,780
do you mean he lives in Afghanistan,

1887
00:58:06,781 --> 00:58:07,380
Kabul.

1888
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,160
Whoa.

1889
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,690
He's a war is a war journalist.

1890
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:14,760
She lives there all year round now he's
moving to places where he can cover

1891
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:15,510
isis.

1892
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:16,410
He's an interesting guy.

1893
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:21,750
And so and so Jake had it in bed with
the Afghans and I had to go meet with the

1894
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:25,230
general to get permission to get him in
bed with the Afghans because there was

1895
00:58:25,231 --> 00:58:27,510
no US forces on the
ground where he was going.

1896
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,880
And it was a place
called the Tangy valley,

1897
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,080
very dangerous valley.

1898
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,180
The side of the law,

1899
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,650
single largest loss of life of
US service members at 38 died in,

1900
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:39,060
I shouldn't look a,

1901
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,830
that was shot down by RPG in that valley.

1902
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,580
And it was a really important mission
because the Tango Valley is just outside

1903
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:45,414
Kabul,

1904
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,160
but it's a Taliban stronghold.

1905
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:47,994
So they can,

1906
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:52,410
they can plan their operations and
attack cool very quickly from the tiny

1907
00:58:52,411 --> 00:58:53,244
valley.

1908
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,560
And so he was important
that we told this story.

1909
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,300
And so I went to talk with
general towns in and he said,

1910
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,081
okay,

1911
00:59:01,081 --> 00:59:02,420
so you know,

1912
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:04,410
are you prepared to see your camera guy?

1913
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,533
Um,

1914
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,940
you know,

1915
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,520
in an orange jumpsuit on his knees,

1916
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:11,190
on the Internet because the
place you're putting in,

1917
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,070
that's the kind of thing that happens
and nobody is going to go get him.

1918
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,550
No,

1919
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,110
no US allies or us,

1920
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:16,944
we'll go get him.

1921
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:17,910
And I said,

1922
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:18,870
I haven't said yes.

1923
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,010
And that was like probably the hardest
moment cause I had to make a conscious

1924
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,270
conscious decision.

1925
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,060
Right then just say yes.

1926
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,680
Did you express this to him?

1927
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,180
Yeah,

1928
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,661
I mean Jake,

1929
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:30,920
Jake knows Jake.

1930
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,980
Jake knew Jake's Jake.

1931
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:34,970
Did you tell him that?

1932
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,060
That was the sentence that was
the way it was described to you?

1933
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:38,720
Yeah,

1934
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,080
I did.

1935
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,913
What did he say?

1936
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:40,641
No problem.

1937
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,100
Ricky and his cheerful
Australian attitude.

1938
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,771
No problem.

1939
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:48,200
Wiki fucking Australians are crazy,

1940
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:48,860
crazy,

1941
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,693
crazy.

1942
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:52,371
He's a bull.

1943
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:52,750
This guy,

1944
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,240
he's a boy.

1945
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,073
Wow.

1946
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,520
It sounds like a nutty dude.

1947
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,151
What it,

1948
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:57,350
what motivates that guy?

1949
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:02,780
Jay Gum was in the Australian army
and I think he was involved with some,

1950
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,110
some event that was really
traumatizing involving,

1951
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,860
you know,

1952
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,450
some kids getting hurt and killed.

1953
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,350
And so it was somewhere in Indonesia
where the Australians were,

1954
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:13,100
I think.

1955
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,760
And so he ever since has been
involved ever since that event.

1956
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,110
And they left the army.

1957
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,580
Um,

1958
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,810
he's been trying to tell the story of
how war affects kids and so he's got a

1959
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,220
special focus on kids.

1960
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,503
And so that's,

1961
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:27,710
that's what motivates Jake I think.

1962
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,620
And he does this three 65.

1963
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,700
He's over there all the time.

1964
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,750
All the time.

1965
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,240
Does he learn yearn for a normal life?

1966
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,290
No,

1967
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,030
he actually learns for the next gunfight.

1968
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,780
He yearns for the next to gunfight.

1969
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,250
He,

1970
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,510
he's one of those guys,

1971
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,850
the chases gunfights around the world.

1972
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,130
So he's covering isis right now.

1973
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:47,450
He's in with those dudes.

1974
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,710
The Christian militia is out there
that are fighting isis right now.

1975
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:52,933
Wow.

1976
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:54,703
Wow.

1977
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,660
That is intense man.

1978
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,500
So how many,

1979
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,440
how many reporters or how many a
cameraman rather do you have over there?

1980
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,181
There was,

1981
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:01,820
um,

1982
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:06,800
four plus me on j could only stay with
us for about six weeks and had to leave.

1983
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,353
And then,

1984
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,020
uh,

1985
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,510
one of my camera guys was
getting sick all the time.

1986
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,201
I mean,

1987
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:12,711
really bad,

1988
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,070
sick,

1989
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,903
dehydrated.

1990
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,433
Um,

1991
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,120
and so he couldn't leave the fobs,

1992
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,690
so he would cover sort of as
a fob forward operating bases.

1993
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,370
And so he would cover like the drone story
for me because that's in a controlled

1994
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:26,204
environment.

1995
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,260
And so we would,

1996
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,830
the other three we go out into the field
with various platoons and stuff and

1997
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,770
operations and then he would stay back.

1998
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,190
Was there anybody that you got
close to over there that you lost?

1999
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,211
No,

2000
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:41,990
I didn't.

2001
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,860
None of our guys,

2002
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:43,520
um,

2003
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,353
were killed.

2004
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,520
So we killed Taliban.

2005
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,630
We didn't have any arg.

2006
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,420
Our guys killed their wife
while we were with them.

2007
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,510
Uh,

2008
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,690
fortunately was that the first
time you'd see the human body?

2009
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,533
Um,

2010
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,660
fully from act of war I'm
in PR in the real flesh.

2011
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:00,494
Yah,

2012
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,333
for sure.

2013
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:06,350
What was that like was like
the first time you saw it was,

2014
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,800
it's kind of gross is definitely gross.

2015
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,450
There's nothing pretty about it.

2016
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:12,280
It's,

2017
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,113
it's Har,

2018
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,820
it's actually its absolute heart.

2019
01:02:14,821 --> 01:02:15,760
You can tell people died,

2020
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:16,623
violent deaths,

2021
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:18,230
pieces,

2022
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,681
pieces,

2023
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:20,160
missing chunks,

2024
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,200
like ugly.

2025
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,250
Then you had seen all this
I'm sure on the Internet.

2026
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,360
Yeah.

2027
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,270
And now the difference between seeing
on the Internet and being there live,

2028
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,830
we're all comes home and you realize
this is what they're trying to do.

2029
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,180
To the people that are around you.

2030
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,593
Yeah.

2031
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,123
What did that feel like?

2032
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,080
It's not personal I guess
is what I would say.

2033
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,190
You know,

2034
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,511
it's,

2035
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:48,470
it's not like they want to kill Joe.

2036
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:49,610
They want to kill Ricky.

2037
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,320
They want to kill what we represent,

2038
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,080
they want to kill what we live,

2039
01:02:54,081 --> 01:02:54,771
what we are,

2040
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,730
what we live for,

2041
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:57,200
the values we hold dear.

2042
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,780
And so because of religious fanaticism,

2043
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,083
because,

2044
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,190
because I think according to an army,

2045
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,790
until officer I spoke with I thought
was very knowledgeable because in order

2046
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:08,170
for,

2047
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,003
for their,

2048
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,701
for their,

2049
01:03:10,701 --> 01:03:11,610
um,

2050
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:13,610
prophecies to come true,

2051
01:03:13,611 --> 01:03:17,000
they have to start world war
three and then their profit,

2052
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,570
we'll come back and you know,

2053
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,250
bring peace in order to the world.

2054
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,470
But he won't come back until they
are able to trigger a big event,

2055
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,470
a massive event to start world war three.

2056
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,790
And so that's,

2057
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,260
that's the hardcore,

2058
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,610
hottest motivation.

2059
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,501
There's a,

2060
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:41,501
there's a distinction there between the
hardcore jihadist and the average person

2061
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:42,974
who's a Muslim.

2062
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:48,430
And this is what gets sort of turned
around and churned around rather and

2063
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,580
debated back and forth in America when
people start using the term Islamophobia

2064
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:59,210
because there are people that
practice Islam that a very polite,

2065
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,510
peaceful people that don't want
any harm to occur to anybody,

2066
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,250
and then there are radical people that
are out of their fucking mind and want to

2067
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:08,960
shoot people for drawing cartoons.

2068
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:09,471
Yeah,

2069
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,071
the radicals.

2070
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:11,870
I mean even in Afghanistan,

2071
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:13,430
they'll pay a kid 25 bucks,

2072
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:15,470
20 bucks to go plant an IED.

2073
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,840
The kids not doing it necessarily because
he wants necessarily to fight Jihad.

2074
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,570
He wants $20 he wants a pair of Levi's.

2075
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,370
He Wa he doesn't wear Levi's probably,

2076
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:30,300
but he wants something and he needs
money for it and so that kids,

2077
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:31,970
not hardcore Jada,

2078
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,270
he needs money,

2079
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,920
but he dies like anybody else.

2080
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:35,690
When you,

2081
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:36,100
when you,

2082
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,870
when you step over that line,

2083
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,650
it's incredible that the only way to
really get someone to do something like

2084
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:42,910
that is religion.

2085
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,410
It's really the only way.

2086
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,600
It's the only way to get
someone to blow themselves up.

2087
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,020
It's the only way to get someone
to sacrifice their own lives.

2088
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:54,910
You have to give them this idea in their
head that something better waits for

2089
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:55,750
them after they do it.

2090
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:56,770
And you have to have them really,

2091
01:04:56,771 --> 01:04:57,640
really believe it.

2092
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,110
And there's only one way.

2093
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,310
It's gotta be religion.

2094
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,690
There's nothing else you don't know.

2095
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:02,501
One blows themselves up,

2096
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:03,400
her Ferrari's.

2097
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,130
You don't blow yourself up
for diamonds because he can't.

2098
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,420
You can't.

2099
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,260
It doesn't work that way.

2100
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:08,411
Well,

2101
01:05:08,411 --> 01:05:08,831
think about that.

2102
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:09,664
You sex,

2103
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,013
they use

2104
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,160
promise of virgins.

2105
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,200
And that's a powerful
basic urge of men sex.

2106
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,390
And so they must somehow use
that in a twisted way to,

2107
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:23,800
to play on boys,

2108
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,530
teenage boys going through puberty,

2109
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,460
and they convinced them that they're
going to have all the sex you want.

2110
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,363
My Gosh.

2111
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,193
And you believe it.

2112
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,471
Well,

2113
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:37,950
it's also,

2114
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:42,030
you're talking about people with limited
education and they're very young.

2115
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:42,540
Those,

2116
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,390
those two factors together and culturally,

2117
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,530
the entire areas,

2118
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,310
Muslim.

2119
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:52,310
So it's not like the idea of not being
Islamic is almost more foreign than the

2120
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,530
idea of being a suicide bomber.

2121
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,030
Oh yeah.

2122
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:01,710
Especially when some of the suicide
bombers or a mortars and revered with

2123
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:05,220
posters of them and tributes to them,

2124
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,000
you know,

2125
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,833
and

2126
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,310
there was a school in Pakistan and a,

2127
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:14,360
there was a documentary on it or they
were a training these young kids to become

2128
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,290
suicide bombers.

2129
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,210
And they had this sign
on the wall that it,

2130
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:18,741
first of all,

2131
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,450
they showed all these images.

2132
01:06:20,451 --> 01:06:24,020
They had these enshrined images of the
children that had blown themselves up.

2133
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,221
And they had this,

2134
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:25,790
uh,

2135
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:28,280
this sign on the wall that said,

2136
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:32,090
today's students are
tomorrow's holy martyrs.

2137
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,183
And,

2138
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,080
and they were explaining,

2139
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:36,351
you know,

2140
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:40,710
like what that meant and what
it means to fight against the,

2141
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,020
the enemy.

2142
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:43,670
And it was,

2143
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:45,440
it was just so hard to watch.

2144
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:49,970
So hard to look at these young kids that
were being indoctrinated into this way

2145
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:54,160
of thinking and knowing
that this is a washed isn't,

2146
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,310
well,

2147
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,430
you can't fix that.

2148
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,960
You can't go over there now and,

2149
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,080
and fix those teachers,

2150
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,000
tell them they shouldn't be doing this,

2151
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:06,020
fixed the religious leaders to
straighten the mindsets of the people,

2152
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,490
adjust their perceptions.

2153
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:08,510
You're not going to be able to do it.

2154
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,651
Like you're,

2155
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,441
you have a,

2156
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:15,441
an area of the world that's almost
inexorably sick and it just,

2157
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,620
it is what it is and now we
have to deal with it globally.

2158
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,740
You have to deal with the consequences
of those people getting older and going

2159
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:26,030
out in the world and affecting people
with the ideology that's been sort of

2160
01:07:26,031 --> 01:07:27,590
embedded into their brain.

2161
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:29,300
It's,

2162
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,950
that's popping up though worldwide Joe.

2163
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:35,780
That ideology is popping up in Canada
and the US and Europe all through France.

2164
01:07:35,781 --> 01:07:36,920
Look at Charlie Hebdo.

2165
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:37,461
Yeah.

2166
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:42,461
So it's like a cancer and
that is spreading and it
can grow anywhere from any

2167
01:07:43,071 --> 01:07:43,521
mosque,

2168
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:48,110
from any teacher and it's
going to take a global,

2169
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,120
global the whole world to fix it.

2170
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,250
I don't know how else,

2171
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:52,970
you know,

2172
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,140
we do it except,

2173
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,451
except it's a,

2174
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:57,800
oh it's a world effort to,

2175
01:07:57,801 --> 01:08:02,750
to sort of show these people a new way
and it's got to come from within them.

2176
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,280
It's got to come from within them.

2177
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:08,780
Is there resistance in Afghanistan
to religious fundamentalism?

2178
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:13,810
Are there people that are against
like actively and vocally against Al

2179
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,600
and against the Taliban?

2180
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:18,951
Uh,

2181
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:19,784
yeah.

2182
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:20,570
I mean there's,

2183
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:20,930
yeah,

2184
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,950
there's millions of people there that
don't want Taliban rule and they're active

2185
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:26,480
and vocal about about it.

2186
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:27,561
There are,

2187
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,990
and there's a whole
initiative where we're,

2188
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:30,883
you know,

2189
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,790
I think it's,

2190
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:32,780
I forget the movement,

2191
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:36,170
but it's like the anti Taliban
movement and it's literally,

2192
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:36,591
you know,

2193
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:39,020
villages in remote places past June.

2194
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:40,220
Wally is,

2195
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:41,030
um,

2196
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,050
one of their laws,

2197
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:42,530
you know,

2198
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,370
but I think it's stems from that kind of
culture where they're actively against

2199
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,870
the Taliban and resisting
and fighting and you know,

2200
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:51,360
trying to,

2201
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,260
trying to try to create
a new way for themselves.

2202
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:55,700
But it's a crazy place.

2203
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:55,971
I mean,

2204
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:56,960
it's a crazy place.

2205
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,183
Here's a story.

2206
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,500
So this guy was telling me he was an
African and he was talking to me about how

2207
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,890
he knew of a story where one African
man get killed another and the one who

2208
01:09:10,371 --> 01:09:10,900
survived.

2209
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,370
We went to the family of
the one he killed and said,

2210
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,020
I asked for your mercy,

2211
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:16,310
forgiveness and protection.

2212
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,700
And so passion Wally means
they have to do that.

2213
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,170
It means we got to take you,

2214
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:21,861
take you in,

2215
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:22,371
protect you,

2216
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:22,791
feed you,

2217
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,624
how's you,

2218
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:24,920
it's part of this cultural thing.

2219
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,890
And so they took him in and you know,

2220
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:31,460
took him the man that killed
their son and or father.

2221
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:34,340
And he lived with them many years,

2222
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,640
you know,

2223
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,241
10 years,

2224
01:09:35,241 --> 01:09:35,781
12 years,

2225
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:36,051
whatever.

2226
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:36,351
It was.

2227
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:37,184
Long time.

2228
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,000
And then he decided he was
going to go home one day and I,

2229
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:41,271
you know,

2230
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:42,650
I spent a decade there.

2231
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:43,790
They must have forgiven me.

2232
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,624
They loved me by now.

2233
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,190
And as soon as he walks through the door,

2234
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,593
they killed him.

2235
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,810
And why?

2236
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,860
As soon as you walk through the door,

2237
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:52,694
they killed him.

2238
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,040
So as soon as he left,

2239
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,480
as soon as you said he was leaving,

2240
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,320
yeah,

2241
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,130
because,

2242
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:00,750
because then their obligation was,

2243
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:01,730
was fulfilled.

2244
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,620
That's insane.

2245
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,150
So this guy had been with them for
over a decade under their protection.

2246
01:10:08,151 --> 01:10:08,984
They were feeding him.

2247
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:09,530
Yeah,

2248
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,640
because of this law.

2249
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:11,930
Right.

2250
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:12,411
And this is,

2251
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:13,101
what is it called again?

2252
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:14,180
Posh asked June Wally.

2253
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,633
And what does that mean?

2254
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,660
I don't exactly know,

2255
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:22,690
but I believe it means that we will
protect and take care of you if you ask.

2256
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,430
Wow.

2257
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,293
So,

2258
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,270
so they did it until he left
and then they killed him.

2259
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,140
That that's absurd.

2260
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,460
That's only,

2261
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:35,270
again,

2262
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:40,270
that would only take place in a
situation where religion was involved,

2263
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:42,194
I would think.

2264
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:44,120
And then there's other stuff,

2265
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:44,361
man.

2266
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:46,460
It's just like Chai boys dancing boys.

2267
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:46,851
Yeah.

2268
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:47,690
What's that about?

2269
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,700
It's,

2270
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:49,010
it's a,

2271
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,311
it's a,

2272
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,990
it's a status symbol to have a boy and,

2273
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,320
and use them for sexual reasons.

2274
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,700
A status symbol.

2275
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:56,121
Yeah.

2276
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,320
You're a powerful man.

2277
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:59,570
If you have a boy.

2278
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,920
How old are these boys?

2279
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:01,783
Young?

2280
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:02,923
Six.

2281
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,020
Eight,

2282
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:05,853
14.

2283
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,380
How common is this?

2284
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,850
It's pretty common if,

2285
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,120
I mean there's not that many chiefs,

2286
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,400
but if you're achieve

2287
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:16,700
like a warlord.

2288
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,450
Yeah.

2289
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:18,830
Or even even less than that.

2290
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,600
Successful businessman.

2291
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,500
So,

2292
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,333
whoa.

2293
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:24,460
That's what I said.

2294
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,610
There's this weird
stuff goes on there and,

2295
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,700
but this is not something
that is prohibited.

2296
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,530
This is prohibited in Islam.

2297
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:33,810
I didn't dive into it.

2298
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:34,820
I didn't even want to research it.

2299
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,120
Homosexuality has prohibited.

2300
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:36,641
I need more.

2301
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:37,474
I'm looking into it.

2302
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,560
I just heard about it and I heard soldiers
talking about it and people that had

2303
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:44,740
seen it and yeah,

2304
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:46,720
I mean drinking's prohibited.

2305
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:49,570
Other things are prohibitive but you know,

2306
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,290
they,

2307
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,190
I think they do them.

2308
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:53,300
Wow.

2309
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,710
So how,

2310
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:56,630
how is this defined?

2311
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:57,350
Like when you're,

2312
01:11:57,350 --> 01:12:02,000
you're around these people and you see
these guys with these six year old kids,

2313
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,550
like how do you know that it's not as son?

2314
01:12:04,551 --> 01:12:07,800
How do you know which I was never in
the presence of that cause I never saw

2315
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:07,940
that.

2316
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,691
I never saw that.

2317
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,100
So it's not that common.

2318
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,590
I don't know what percentage it is,

2319
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:13,520
but I don't think it's like,

2320
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:14,354
you know,

2321
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:19,450
I I'm going to guess 5% 10% that's a lot.

2322
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,620
Maybe I'm guessing,

2323
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,371
I'm guessing.

2324
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:22,760
Okay.

2325
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,031
Okay.

2326
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:23,331
Right,

2327
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:24,164
right.

2328
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,160
Wow.

2329
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:25,341
Yeah.

2330
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,940
Cause I had heard that from guys who
would want over there and perform for the

2331
01:12:28,941 --> 01:12:30,530
troops that,

2332
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:31,670
you know,

2333
01:12:31,670 --> 01:12:36,260
they'd seen a lot of homosexuality
like and a lot of the sexual abuse

2334
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:41,760
women are for breeding boys or for
pleasure is what statement that they say

2335
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:42,330
sometimes.

2336
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:42,780
Some guys,

2337
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,900
some Afghans and women
are treated terribly,

2338
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,483
terribly,

2339
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,241
terribly.

2340
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:51,630
They're horribly under the Taliban,

2341
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,670
horribly stoned to death.

2342
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:55,921
I mean,

2343
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:57,630
but even though I don't under the Taliban,

2344
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,493
there was a,

2345
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,343
uh,

2346
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:04,400
a woman beaten to death in Kabul a few
months back because the leader in the

2347
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:07,591
church,

2348
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,240
whatever the church he was going to,

2349
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:09,930
uh,

2350
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:10,763
um,

2351
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,090
said that she burned a cron.

2352
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,390
And in fact he was like
an argument they had.

2353
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,224
He and her were,

2354
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,610
she didn't like him charging.

2355
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,160
She had mentally handicapped woman.

2356
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:23,400
She didn't like him charging for
trinkets that he was selling to people.

2357
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,060
And so he said,

2358
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,391
you know,

2359
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:29,460
you burned a cross on to
people and they killed her.

2360
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,080
So women are not treated well there.

2361
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,730
When you got home,

2362
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:43,450
when you did the hundred plus days
there and go home and came back to your

2363
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:47,710
beautiful family and your beautiful
house and Southern California,

2364
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:49,360
what was that like?

2365
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:51,350
Oh my gosh.

2366
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:52,183
Um,

2367
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,020
it was confusing,

2368
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:55,880
really confusing at first,

2369
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:56,540
uh,

2370
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,020
months.

2371
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,000
It took a month to just feel normal.

2372
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,000
But I was so glad when
I got off the plane.

2373
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:07,001
I almost kits the dirty gutter in lax
because of all the problems we have here.

2374
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:12,100
It is such an amazing place
when you from a place like that.

2375
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:16,780
And so that was the
initial feeling and then,

2376
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:17,800
and then,

2377
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,221
uh,

2378
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,380
it was sort of trying to just sort of,

2379
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,273
um,

2380
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,960
care again about the,

2381
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:24,340
the normal things in life,

2382
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,420
you know,

2383
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,820
caring about whatever it is,

2384
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:28,743
bills,

2385
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:29,883
um,

2386
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:30,491
your,

2387
01:14:30,491 --> 01:14:35,491
your kids have issues or concerns that
you have to learn to find important again

2388
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,340
because the things that you
just experienced where like,

2389
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,930
well that's not so bad.

2390
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:41,651
Okay.

2391
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:42,370
So,

2392
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:42,641
okay,

2393
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:43,600
you just lost all your money.

2394
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:44,530
That's not so bad.

2395
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,690
Okay.

2396
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,523
You know,

2397
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:47,171
you just,

2398
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:47,770
um,

2399
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,101
okay,

2400
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:51,100
you just failed that you just got
in a car accident that's not so bad.

2401
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,050
Your boyfriend just dumped you.

2402
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,070
What are you complaining about?

2403
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,320
Your bank accounts at zero,

2404
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:57,430
what are you complaining about?

2405
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,810
Like that was all that learning,

2406
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,780
relearning to care again about
other people's frivolous things,

2407
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,010
but the big picture.

2408
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:06,701
But to those people,

2409
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:07,780
they're not frivolous cause they don't,

2410
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:11,050
haven't had just to that experience
you had the lack of perspective.

2411
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:11,943
Yeah.

2412
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,320
Yeah.

2413
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:12,550
I mean,

2414
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,850
the more intense the situation or
the more intense experiences are,

2415
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:18,040
the more those other
experiences seems so doll,

2416
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,910
which is why spoiled people that
don't have anything go wrong.

2417
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:22,481
I mean,

2418
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,540
that's why they'll,

2419
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:27,700
they will get freaked out about
something so minor and trivial.

2420
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:28,110
Yeah.

2421
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,320
Other victim of their own ignorance and,

2422
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,260
and success or trust fund,

2423
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,130
whatever you call it.

2424
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,210
But the reason why I bring this
up is because in a lot of ways,

2425
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:38,044
that was you.

2426
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:38,651
I mean,

2427
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:40,840
you were a young my
ass off for everything.

2428
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,800
You certainly did.

2429
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:43,060
That's never me.

2430
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,560
I didn't grow up with a
silver spoon in my mouth.

2431
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,460
But you read of this show
called silver spoons,

2432
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:48,700
but I worked right,

2433
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:50,170
but you were rich was a floor plan.

2434
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,420
You were a little kid with
eating off a plastic spoons.

2435
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:53,650
Right.

2436
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,800
But you know what I'm saying?

2437
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,070
A celebrity and a TV star.

2438
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,151
I mean,

2439
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:01,390
you were a huge star when you get there.

2440
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,620
You know what it takes,

2441
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:03,711
it takes an,

2442
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,960
a massive amount of hard work and
dedication and perseverance to get there.

2443
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,610
Nobody's given it.

2444
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,190
So this perception that you know,

2445
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:12,941
somehow we live,

2446
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:13,810
we were privileged.

2447
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:14,883
C'Mon,

2448
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,660
we worked our asses off.

2449
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:19,060
I worked my ass off since
I was five years old.

2450
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,081
Right?

2451
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:23,260
But what am I saying is
you develop that way.

2452
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:23,801
I mean,

2453
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:24,461
you were famous.

2454
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:26,740
I saw you in the champ
and I was a little kid.

2455
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:28,690
My Dad took me to see the champion.

2456
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:31,780
I remember crying when you were
crying over John Voight's dead body.

2457
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,831
By the way,

2458
01:16:32,831 --> 01:16:36,940
that fucking story that you told me
about them being mean to you right before

2459
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:38,230
that to get you to cry.

2460
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,520
That is one of the most fucked
up Hollywood actor stories.

2461
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,580
Did anybody ever told me talking
about my dead grandmother?

2462
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,170
Yeah,

2463
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:48,910
I'm can get you emotionally
invested in that scene.

2464
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,151
I mean,

2465
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:50,290
it worked.

2466
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,060
It really worked.

2467
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,301
I mean,

2468
01:16:52,301 --> 01:16:53,200
it was incredible.

2469
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:56,980
I remember leaving that movie
theater fucking crying the Holy Shit.

2470
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:00,970
But my point being is you,

2471
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,010
you lived a life of privilege.

2472
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,450
You know a lot of ways.

2473
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:05,680
Okay.

2474
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,560
If you say so when it was a
little defensive here for that,

2475
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,533
your

2476
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,440
privilege,

2477
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,870
when it's privileged or earned privilege,

2478
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,760
you earned where five earned.

2479
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:17,683
Right.

2480
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,260
You know what I mean?

2481
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,000
Earn world before Sorta,

2482
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:22,221
okay,

2483
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:23,090
you did your work,

2484
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:24,350
but I mean you're working in acting.

2485
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,370
Acting is not that hard.

2486
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,940
Do you think it's that hard
being not a normal kids?

2487
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:29,300
Hard.

2488
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,133
That's hard.

2489
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,390
Going not to school's hard
and not being on on softball,

2490
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:33,320
little league teams,

2491
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:33,950
hard,

2492
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,360
all sorts of things were hard,

2493
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,690
but definitely unusual but not Kabul.

2494
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:40,160
Hard knock.

2495
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:40,994
Cobble hard.

2496
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:41,490
Yeah.

2497
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,280
Not Cobble hard.

2498
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,280
So going from that to this and
it at this stage of your life,

2499
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,380
the current stage of your life
with all your life experiences,

2500
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,630
it boiling down to this,

2501
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,660
this docu series that
you're putting together,

2502
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:58,610
which is probably the most
intense thing you've ever done.

2503
01:17:59,180 --> 01:17:59,810
Yeah.

2504
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:00,290
I mean,

2505
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:05,290
what a perspective enhancer that's got
to be to go from being a famous child

2506
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,030
with this view of the world

2507
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:15,120
and then as a grown man with a family
to be over there in Afghanistan embedded

2508
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:17,140
for a hundred days,

2509
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:20,890
experiencing firefights
on a daily basis almost.

2510
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,900
It was a great experience,

2511
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:23,111
Joe.

2512
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:24,340
And it changed me forever.

2513
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:25,141
It changed,

2514
01:18:25,141 --> 01:18:28,060
it changed me forever in many great ways.

2515
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,170
I don't,

2516
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:32,200
I don't see any negative that has
come out of it for me honestly.

2517
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:33,663
Um,

2518
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,730
except maybe wanting to do it again,

2519
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:37,501
you know,

2520
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:38,334
and you want to do it again.

2521
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:39,460
I mean that's,

2522
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:43,690
that's the risk is has it sort
of lit a fire in me to like,

2523
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:48,250
well you did a fantastic
job by all accounts on this
docu-series I read reviews

2524
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:48,970
of it.

2525
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,050
People love it and they,

2526
01:18:50,051 --> 01:18:50,261
they,

2527
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:53,200
they say this is really
intense and really,

2528
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,603
um,

2529
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,620
what was the word that I'd read?

2530
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:57,723
But uh,

2531
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,690
comprehensive I think was the
way they were describing it.

2532
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,330
Like you,

2533
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,800
you got deep into this.

2534
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:06,640
This isn't something you can
cover in a 90 minute documentary,

2535
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,730
which is why you decided to
stretch it out over six hours.

2536
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:10,713
Yeah,

2537
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,160
I mean we look at it from the ending
of America's longest war from various

2538
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:15,731
perspectives.

2539
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:16,960
It's epic in scope,

2540
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,730
but we get deep inside those,

2541
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:19,720
those perspectives,

2542
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:20,860
you know,

2543
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,693
um,

2544
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,713
and

2545
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:24,783
know I just,

2546
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,760
I don't know what the future brings for
me right now because that's honestly the

2547
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:30,760
thing I'm most confused about
is like how do I go back to,

2548
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,073
um,

2549
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:32,591
you know,

2550
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:36,430
certain career choices
that I perhaps once was,

2551
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:36,971
you know,

2552
01:19:36,971 --> 01:19:41,971
really excited about and
wanting to achieve and goals
enacting maybe in acting,

2553
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,300
even in films,

2554
01:19:43,301 --> 01:19:44,890
in TV and even in production,

2555
01:19:44,891 --> 01:19:45,850
even producing,

2556
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:46,511
you know,

2557
01:19:46,511 --> 01:19:47,710
even writing,

2558
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,521
whatever it may be.

2559
01:19:48,521 --> 01:19:49,354
Like,

2560
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:50,440
you know,

2561
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,520
I got to figure out again,

2562
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,181
I got to figure out what,

2563
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,430
what's next for me cause
I have no fricking clue.

2564
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,013
No clue.

2565
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:01,150
Just because this experience
was so intense and so
powerful that it just sort of

2566
01:20:01,151 --> 01:20:02,470
reshaped who as a person.

2567
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:03,873
Absolutely.

2568
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,910
Well I'm talking to from the time you
returned mean I could tell that it was

2569
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:10,280
you.

2570
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:10,800
You had,

2571
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,150
there was almost like a rekindling
of a spark inside of you.

2572
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,110
Like you,

2573
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:21,110
you had this new sort of new feeling of
importance of what you were working on.

2574
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,281
That was a very,

2575
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,120
very intense,

2576
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,011
absolutely.

2577
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:28,200
I mean I really felt,

2578
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:28,591
you know,

2579
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:32,550
that I was making a difference as
opposed to just creating entertainment.

2580
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:33,150
Yeah.

2581
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,380
I really felt like I
was making a difference,

2582
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:35,214
like,

2583
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,360
like educating people
about the art of war,

2584
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:41,550
how battles are fought,

2585
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,380
the military science behind it.

2586
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,760
Like,

2587
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,290
because that's what I found interesting
is how do you take an op order and

2588
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:54,291
operational order and then develop it
and then execute it and then how do you

2589
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,960
overwhelm and destroy the enemy when you,

2590
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,940
when you finally find him,

2591
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,360
how do you overwhelm and destroy the
enemy and choreograph the Cynthia

2592
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:04,800
destruction in the moment?

2593
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,240
How do you call in the air weapons teams,

2594
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:09,990
the Apaches,

2595
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,510
how do you call him the B
ones and the fast moving jets,

2596
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:13,210
how'd he call him?

2597
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,043
The artillery,

2598
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:19,730
how do you call all that and coordinate
all that in the moment so that you can

2599
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:21,600
destroy the enemy as fast as possible.

2600
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:23,680
That's what I wanted to see.

2601
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,850
C and I and I found it and I,

2602
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,820
I'm going to show it to everybody.

2603
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:31,770
Do you think from here you'll continue
to do documentaries exploring the

2604
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:34,740
military or will you start doing
other things that interested?

2605
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,190
Because what it seems to me
as your friend is that you,

2606
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:40,350
you just have to have
something that excites you,

2607
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,680
something that interests you and
then you just fucking dive in.

2608
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:44,370
Man,

2609
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,320
you go whole hog now.

2610
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:47,154
That's what you do.

2611
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:47,790
So it is,

2612
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,230
it's the only way I've
ever known how to do it.

2613
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:53,130
As far as anything I've ever
made is at worth anything.

2614
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,330
As far as,

2615
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,163
you know,

2616
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,550
any value has been something that I really
was excited about doing and wanted to

2617
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:01,050
do and was passionate about.

2618
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,740
And so I,

2619
01:22:03,741 --> 01:22:04,950
I don't know what's next for me.

2620
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:05,291
I mean,

2621
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,890
I love dogs and maybe
I'll do something on dogs,

2622
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,940
you know,

2623
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,080
and smile a little more,

2624
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:11,470
you know,

2625
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,303
for while.

2626
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,111
Yeah,

2627
01:22:13,111 --> 01:22:13,944
I love dogs.

2628
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,900
And they're great dogs are gray dog.

2629
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:16,734
Two of them.

2630
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,060
I might need a break.

2631
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:21,990
Yeah.

2632
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,040
I'm going to Alaska,

2633
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:23,820
um,

2634
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:26,980
at the end of June going floating
on a river and fishing with my,

2635
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,230
my son's and my nephews.

2636
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,460
That should be fun.

2637
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,293
12 days.

2638
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,640
So that's kind of my break
I'm really stoked about.

2639
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,410
And then I'll come back in July and 4th
of July in Alaska by the way is off the

2640
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,244
hook.

2641
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:38,880
Yeah.

2642
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,170
You can get all the fireworks,

2643
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:44,160
all the big kinds you
want and just go nuts.

2644
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,150
So that's what we're going to do.

2645
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:45,984
And,

2646
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:47,520
and then I'll hopefully figure it out,

2647
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,354
you know,

2648
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,121
but I know,

2649
01:22:50,121 --> 01:22:52,170
I know I got to take
my family into account.

2650
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,200
You know what they want because you know,

2651
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:57,420
I got a family.

2652
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,613
Yeah.

2653
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,640
Um,

2654
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,610
well you also have the freedom
to make those decisions.

2655
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,090
You know,

2656
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:06,040
you have the freedom to decide

2657
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,040
what you want to do and then really
direct yourself towards whatever your

2658
01:23:11,351 --> 01:23:12,130
passions are.

2659
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:15,700
Is there anything that you're
interested in at the level that you were

2660
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:16,534
interested in?

2661
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:17,561
This military thing?

2662
01:23:17,561 --> 01:23:19,240
Cause I think the military thing,

2663
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,070
you had always had an interest for it,

2664
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:25,570
but it was really sort of sparked by the
series that you had done for the army

2665
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:25,920
that would,

2666
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,740
that really just,

2667
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,730
it's really my grandfather,

2668
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:32,790
it's sparked it like he was a captain
in the army World War II and he took six

2669
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:35,440
what called deuce and
a half flat bed trucks,

2670
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:40,441
big trucks with each one had two
50 calibers mounted on the backs.

2671
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,190
And so,

2672
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:42,670
um,

2673
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:47,470
he took six of those as close infantry
support all the way through France to

2674
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:48,304
Germany,

2675
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,210
to the Rhine River.

2676
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,510
And I think I was the only
person he ever told stories too.

2677
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,670
But I remember sitting
at the feet of his chair,

2678
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:57,760
like as a kid growing up and he
gave me all this memorabilia,

2679
01:23:57,761 --> 01:24:02,761
gave me the dagger that he took off a
dead Nazi mayor gave me his rifle that he,

2680
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:03,873
he carried,

2681
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:04,571
you know,

2682
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:09,571
gave me the things that is being at the
things that he found treasures to him he

2683
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:10,414
gave me.

2684
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,040
And so I think sitting at his feet,

2685
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:12,311
you know,

2686
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:13,770
sort of is what I'm

2687
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:15,771
planted,

2688
01:24:15,771 --> 01:24:16,341
that seed,

2689
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:16,791
you know,

2690
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,390
of,

2691
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,620
of the military.

2692
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,340
And I remember,

2693
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,581
you know,

2694
01:24:19,581 --> 01:24:24,410
he would tell me about the green
berets and the rangers and,

2695
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:27,860
and you know how they would paint their
face black and they could move in the

2696
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:32,450
night and nobody could see them and they
could just kill an enemy very quickly

2697
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:33,290
with their hands.

2698
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,183
Um,

2699
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:34,761
and he would tell me,

2700
01:24:34,761 --> 01:24:35,870
stare stories about them.

2701
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,330
Germans stretching
piano wire across roads.

2702
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:42,140
And so as you come down in a willys
jeep and everybody's decapitated,

2703
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:44,240
they put it right at
the height of your head.

2704
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:44,811
And so,

2705
01:24:44,811 --> 01:24:45,081
you know,

2706
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:49,460
he told me about stories of coming
across those places and you know,

2707
01:24:49,461 --> 01:24:49,821
and then he,

2708
01:24:49,821 --> 01:24:51,200
and then we started mitigating it by,

2709
01:24:51,201 --> 01:24:51,351
by,

2710
01:24:51,351 --> 01:24:55,250
by putting a steel rod at the front of
the jeep to snap the wire before it,

2711
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,203
before he hit it.

2712
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:59,810
And so he would tell me all these
stories about what he went through.

2713
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,450
And I think that's really
where my interest came.

2714
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,710
And to answer your question,

2715
01:25:03,711 --> 01:25:06,440
I don't know if I'm as
passionate about anything,

2716
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:09,600
you know,

2717
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,470
besides my kids,

2718
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:10,921
my wife,

2719
01:25:10,921 --> 01:25:11,200
and,

2720
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,033
and um,

2721
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:13,163
and um,

2722
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:13,750
you know,

2723
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:18,090
us the u s the u s and what we,

2724
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:18,391
you know,

2725
01:25:18,391 --> 01:25:19,180
and the army that,

2726
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,070
that defends it.

2727
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:24,300
What's also got to be really hard once
you experience something that is as

2728
01:25:24,301 --> 01:25:29,301
intense as being embedded in combat in
any crazy war like what's going on in

2729
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:32,004
Afghanistan,

2730
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,060
it's gotta be very difficult to find
something that's going to ignite the spark

2731
01:25:36,061 --> 01:25:36,894
to that extent.

2732
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:38,790
Yeah.

2733
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,121
Yeah.

2734
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:39,261
I'm,

2735
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:39,520
I'm,

2736
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,950
and that's one of the
things I'm concerned about,

2737
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:41,581
you know,

2738
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:42,390
really I am,

2739
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:42,871
I'm like,

2740
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,950
what is next for me?

2741
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:48,900
What do I care about enough to
do what I did this last time?

2742
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,153
Uh,

2743
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,683
don't know.

2744
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,420
So you just might be a
war documentary guy now.

2745
01:25:58,250 --> 01:25:59,083
I,

2746
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,430
I don't know if my wife
can take that honestly.

2747
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,150
So I don't know.

2748
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:06,110
I don't know what's going to,

2749
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,003
yeah,

2750
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:08,540
and you kind of have to be over there.

2751
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,300
It's not like you just
send people over there,

2752
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:11,143
film it,

2753
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:13,190
and then come back and edit it.

2754
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,670
I can't because as far as right now,

2755
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,600
like it was my,

2756
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:18,170
it was,

2757
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,970
it was my working with those units,

2758
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:24,170
those platoons and those leaders
in the squads being there,

2759
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,570
that made all the difference because,

2760
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,500
because I,

2761
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,510
I think they understood,

2762
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,610
they understood my,

2763
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:32,444
uh,

2764
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,060
they could feel while I was there.

2765
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:36,680
And if it wasn't,

2766
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,570
if it's not the right camera guys,

2767
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:40,670
if it's not the right people
in bed with those units,

2768
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,960
they'll shut them down.

2769
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:45,710
If they feel like you're doing
something that will be critical of them.

2770
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:48,260
Or are you paying them an unjust light?

2771
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:48,651
Yeah.

2772
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:50,120
If you're looking for dirt,

2773
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,043
right.

2774
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,490
A lot of them must be,

2775
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,660
they will shut you down.

2776
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,640
How many embedded reporters
that they have over there?

2777
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:56,840
Not like,

2778
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:57,950
not like we did none.

2779
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,810
I mean we were the only
team that was like this.

2780
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:02,180
They had people come from
newspapers for three days,

2781
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:02,750
two days,

2782
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,583
five days,

2783
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:04,401
you know,

2784
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:05,510
go to one place,

2785
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:06,141
you know,

2786
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:06,920
and,

2787
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,551
but no,

2788
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:08,450
this was a massive,

2789
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:14,050
the army putting massive amount of effort
into embedding five of us for three

2790
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:15,974
months,

2791
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:16,790
you know?

2792
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:17,680
And ultimately they'll just see,

2793
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:17,901
you know,

2794
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,960
like the ground force commander
at those units at the unit level,

2795
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,830
if,

2796
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,970
if they don't want you there,

2797
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:23,960
there's nobody,

2798
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:28,280
no general that said you can come to
Afghanistan is going to call up a ground

2799
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:30,830
force commander and say
you will take these guys,

2800
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,820
you will show them.

2801
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,350
It doesn't work like that
because ultimately the ground
force commander has his

2802
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:37,184
authority.

2803
01:27:37,610 --> 01:27:40,550
He's the guy right there that's going to,

2804
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,400
you know that that's a keep you alive,

2805
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:44,600
that has to protect you,

2806
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:45,800
that's to interact with you.

2807
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,360
And if he doesn't want you,

2808
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:48,523
you're gone.

2809
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:50,740
So it's really tough to,

2810
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:51,160
to,

2811
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:51,993
you know,

2812
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:56,240
to think about how I could produce this
without me actually at least going there

2813
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,780
to open the doors and to embed people.

2814
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,071
Right.

2815
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:03,740
But then when you went over
there the first time to Scout,

2816
01:28:03,741 --> 01:28:05,750
how many days did you go
over there for three weeks?

2817
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,900
Three weeks for the first time.

2818
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:07,520
First Time.

2819
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,353
And

2820
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:13,160
did you come back from that three
weeks with any apprehension?

2821
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,590
Um,

2822
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,221
yeah.

2823
01:28:16,221 --> 01:28:16,611
I mean,

2824
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:18,470
I came back because I didn't have any,

2825
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:19,821
you know,

2826
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:23,330
I had to write a big check and I
had to put my money where mouth was.

2827
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,370
And so I had to get John
Paul to write a check.

2828
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,990
And so you know,

2829
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:28,310
you invest your friend's money.

2830
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:29,421
That's tension.

2831
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:30,850
Now that apprehension about that Ma,

2832
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:31,970
you know,

2833
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:34,520
I never asked a friend to
invest money in a project.

2834
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:35,900
I've always only invest in my own.

2835
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,510
And so why'd you decide
to ask someone else?

2836
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,010
Because my wife kept telling me,

2837
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:40,341
Ricky,

2838
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:41,061
you need partners.

2839
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:42,200
You need people to work with,

2840
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:44,330
cause I'm kind of on my own a lot,

2841
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:44,600
you know,

2842
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,270
as far as,

2843
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,710
um,

2844
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,461
and so she's like,

2845
01:28:46,461 --> 01:28:47,570
you need to collaborate with people.

2846
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:48,890
You need to work together with people.

2847
01:28:48,891 --> 01:28:50,990
So I asked my friend John
Paul and she got pissed.

2848
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:52,910
Why you asking our friend for money?

2849
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:53,631
I'm like,

2850
01:28:53,631 --> 01:28:54,110
well honey,

2851
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,340
he's wanting me to work with people,

2852
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:56,091
collaborate with people,

2853
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:59,150
jump Paul's my friend
and he gets the content.

2854
01:28:59,151 --> 01:28:59,751
He's a big boy.

2855
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:00,740
He can risk the money.

2856
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,340
He's worth billions.

2857
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:03,661
And she's like,

2858
01:29:03,661 --> 01:29:03,781
yeah,

2859
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:06,240
but you've changed the dynamic
between us and our friends.

2860
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:06,850
And I'm like,

2861
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,470
honey,

2862
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,370
it's going to be fine.

2863
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:09,630
I didn't know if was gonna be fine.

2864
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,360
But it was a great feeling
when I came home and I,

2865
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,650
I wrote a check to him,

2866
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,390
I'll tell you that and paid him back.

2867
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:16,800
But I had apprehension about money.

2868
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,840
I had apprehension about,

2869
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:20,700
you know,

2870
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,310
all those things you think about like
I had to buy life insurance for all my

2871
01:29:23,311 --> 01:29:23,760
camera man.

2872
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,590
I had to buy death and dismemberment,

2873
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:25,951
insurance,

2874
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:27,120
disability insurance,

2875
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:27,811
you know,

2876
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:31,170
I had to make sure that their
wives were okay with them going,

2877
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:31,981
you know,

2878
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:32,210
and,

2879
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:35,640
and their moms and their dads because
some of the guys were young camera guys

2880
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:36,474
are not married.

2881
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:37,890
And so,

2882
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:38,131
you know,

2883
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:39,630
taking on all that responsibility.

2884
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:40,530
So I had lots of,

2885
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:41,851
lots of,

2886
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:42,684
um,

2887
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:46,170
lots of reasons to back
out all along the process,

2888
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,510
but just pushed,

2889
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:48,811
pushed,

2890
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:49,350
pushed.

2891
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,210
Did you edit the entire thing yourself?

2892
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:54,810
Me and a three story teams and my partner,

2893
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:55,644
Jim,

2894
01:29:56,250 --> 01:29:56,671
retired,

2895
01:29:56,671 --> 01:29:57,504
Colonel Raven.

2896
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,160
And so what we,

2897
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:04,080
what we did was we had three major
in beds and we put a camera team,

2898
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,231
I,

2899
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:04,441
sorry,

2900
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,274
a story,

2901
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:06,031
an editor,

2902
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,120
Tina story producer and an
editing editor on each team.

2903
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,530
So each team only had to learn,

2904
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:11,820
say 200 hours of footage.

2905
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,580
They didn't have to learn
all 600 hours of footage.

2906
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,950
And so then each story producing team
and editor would work with Jim and I and

2907
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:23,340
we would craft the episodes.

2908
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,920
And so I,

2909
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:26,754
I got,

2910
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:27,743
um,

2911
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:28,620
I sent,

2912
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,210
I came back from July,

2913
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:31,080
2014 from Afghanistan.

2914
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,650
I tried to sell this to a
different production companies,

2915
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:37,260
different networks throughout
the entire summer and fall,

2916
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:41,580
couldn't make a deal with any of them
because they really didn't want me to end

2917
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:42,241
up producing it.

2918
01:30:42,241 --> 01:30:45,000
They wanted to bring other people to
take it over and just sort of acquire the

2919
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:45,834
footage.

2920
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:51,380
And so turned down some things that
could have worked out for different deals

2921
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,480
and then went into February and had no,

2922
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:54,931
like,

2923
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:55,980
what am I gonna do with this?

2924
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:56,730
Like,

2925
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:01,230
I got a lot of money invested in
this and I've got a lot of hopes,

2926
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:02,011
you know,

2927
01:31:02,011 --> 01:31:03,690
I told the Army I was going to get it out,

2928
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:04,741
what am I going to do?

2929
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:06,420
So I emailed Mike White's Yoel,

2930
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:09,660
directv cold and him
a link to the trailer.

2931
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:14,690
And then within 18 hours I had
a handshake deal and you know,

2932
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:15,631
and that was in,

2933
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:16,080
um,

2934
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:16,980
February,

2935
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:17,971
middle,

2936
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:18,600
February.

2937
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,740
And I had 12 weeks or 11 weeks to edit
six one hour episodes from all that

2938
01:31:22,741 --> 01:31:23,910
footage and hadn't even started.

2939
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:25,080
Wow.

2940
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,100
That's not ideal.

2941
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:26,580
Right?

2942
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:27,300
It's not ideal.

2943
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:27,961
What would you rather,

2944
01:31:27,961 --> 01:31:29,210
about how much time would you rather have?

2945
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,010
Uh,

2946
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,843
uh,

2947
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,561
maybe,

2948
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:34,170
maybe 16 weeks instead of 11.

2949
01:31:34,230 --> 01:31:37,200
Have you ever considered doing maybe
a director's cut if this is really

2950
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:37,921
successful,

2951
01:31:37,921 --> 01:31:38,320
would you,

2952
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:38,491
I mean,

2953
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:39,720
you have so much footage,

2954
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:42,270
it almost seems like you
could do another six hours.

2955
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:43,650
Well,

2956
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,461
I never thought about it,

2957
01:31:44,461 --> 01:31:45,121
but you're right.

2958
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:45,631
We could,

2959
01:31:45,631 --> 01:31:46,860
we could do other things.

2960
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,630
There's so much that
we had to leave behind.

2961
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,900
There's so much story there.

2962
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,093
Um,

2963
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:53,611
I mean,

2964
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:54,570
I can only imagine.

2965
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,800
We'll see.

2966
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,633
Um,

2967
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,081
it's going well.

2968
01:31:58,081 --> 01:31:58,771
People are liking it.

2969
01:31:58,771 --> 01:31:59,561
Some of soldiers,

2970
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:03,220
Joe on Facebook and sent
me messages and said like,

2971
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:07,570
thank you for making this because now
my wife and my family understand what I

2972
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:10,180
went through in Afghanistan or thank you,

2973
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,160
my son was in,

2974
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,190
in your series.

2975
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:14,140
Thank you for showing us part of his life,

2976
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:14,861
you know,

2977
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:15,161
really,

2978
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:16,450
really nice messages in.

2979
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,940
And to be honest with that was my goal
the whole time was to make something that

2980
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:23,350
the soldiers would look at and say,

2981
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,910
if you want to understand Afghanistan,

2982
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:29,140
then watch the fighting season because
it's the closest you'll get to war

2983
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:29,974
without going.

2984
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,120
There's nothing closer.

2985
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,580
I can't wait to watch it.

2986
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,710
If there's anything else you need to say.

2987
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:36,591
Um,

2988
01:32:36,591 --> 01:32:39,250
is there anything else you want to
tell people about this experience?

2989
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,420
Yeah,

2990
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:40,781
yeah.

2991
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:41,350
You know what?

2992
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,930
We don't

2993
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:42,800
army strong.

2994
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,540
The guys I was with were strong,

2995
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,463
motivated,

2996
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:45,860
you know,

2997
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,180
after 14 years of war.

2998
01:32:47,181 --> 01:32:48,014
Now

2999
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:52,820
we have some really experienced leaders
that have been deployed multiple times

3000
01:32:52,821 --> 01:32:53,240
and been,

3001
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,300
it had been in this fight multiple times.

3002
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,710
And so that generation of experience
is teaching the next generation.

3003
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:01,551
And,

3004
01:33:01,551 --> 01:33:02,210
um,

3005
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:02,450
you know,

3006
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,740
I just want people to understand that,

3007
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,633
you know,

3008
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,580
a military may be having our
army maybe having budget issues.

3009
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,660
I hear about in the paper,

3010
01:33:08,661 --> 01:33:09,410
I may have other,

3011
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:10,243
other issues,

3012
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,080
but one thing,

3013
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:13,640
they don't have a problem
with his leadership.

3014
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,920
The people that lead these young
soldiers are like dedicated,

3015
01:33:18,921 --> 01:33:19,754
trained,

3016
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,950
experienced leaders.

3017
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,200
And their goal is to take
everyone else gets home.

3018
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:25,581
Like seriously,

3019
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:30,320
they're goal is to everything they do
to mitigate risk as much as possible.

3020
01:33:30,321 --> 01:33:32,840
So they keep those kids
home and you can see it.

3021
01:33:32,841 --> 01:33:33,620
That's why they train them.

3022
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,880
That's why they're hard on them so hard.

3023
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:36,170
They want to take them all home.

3024
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,710
And so I just want to leave
it with our army strong.

3025
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:40,911
You know,

3026
01:33:40,911 --> 01:33:41,210
it's,

3027
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:44,660
it's strong and it's
experienced and it's um,

3028
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:49,850
it's a privilege to have told their
story and a thank you to all of the vets,

3029
01:33:49,851 --> 01:33:54,170
whoever served and thank you to those
families that let them serve because it's

3030
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:55,640
a life commitment.

3031
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,200
It's not like a job.

3032
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,780
It's like the whole family's involved.

3033
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,300
And where would we,

3034
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:03,410
where would we be without them?

3035
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,251
I mean,

3036
01:34:04,251 --> 01:34:04,701
honestly,

3037
01:34:04,701 --> 01:34:05,960
where would we be without them?

3038
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,460
We'd have a draft.

3039
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:08,571
We'd have,

3040
01:34:08,571 --> 01:34:09,440
we'd have a draft.

3041
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:09,621
I mean,

3042
01:34:09,621 --> 01:34:10,191
think about it Joe.

3043
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:15,191
We have a volunteer army that
has been at war for 14 years.

3044
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:17,270
All volunteers.

3045
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:17,781
I heard,

3046
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:20,060
I think chairman joint chief of staff,

3047
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,500
Keith Mo not Mullane,

3048
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:23,840
one of the chairman said,

3049
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:24,674
uh,

3050
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:25,641
you know,

3051
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:28,790
an all volunteer army was never
designed to be at war of 14 years.

3052
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:34,520
That's why you have conscripts and drafts
and we don't need it because we have

3053
01:34:34,521 --> 01:34:39,521
that many young people that are willing
to go out there and do this and answer

3054
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:41,810
that call and show up.

3055
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,390
And I think that's just amazing.

3056
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:48,440
And this is the perfect day
to do this on Memorial Day.

3057
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:49,880
So thanks for coming in here.

3058
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:50,893
And uh,

3059
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:53,390
thank you everybody that's served.

3060
01:34:53,391 --> 01:34:54,770
Thank you everybody that's serving.

3061
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,110
Thank you everybody that's listening,

3062
01:34:57,230 --> 01:35:02,210
watching this and thank you everybody
that has watched the fighting season or

3063
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,410
we'll watch it.

3064
01:35:03,650 --> 01:35:05,180
It is available right now.

3065
01:35:05,181 --> 01:35:06,650
You can get it on iTunes.

3066
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,240
A Ricky is on,

3067

We have a fighting season,

3082
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:25,820
