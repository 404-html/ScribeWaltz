1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,930
The joe rogan experience with one
of the things that you've realized.

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,360
And I've realized over the
course of our friendship,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,570
I mean Eddie's been my best
friend since I think 2000.

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,480
We started hanging out in 2018 which is,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,401
comes back to the,

6
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,660
it comes back to the story
of the twister because it is,

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,960
that'd be we became good friends.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,620
Um,

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,981
I was,

10
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,100
uh,

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,521
getting,

12
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:17,800
uh,

13
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,030
uh,

14
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,970
private lessons when I
first started doing Jujitsu.

15
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,660
I was a blue belt onto this dude.

16
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,980
I won't say his name is a very nice guy,

17
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,270
but it's an,

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,040
I'm gonna say something
negative and I was,

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,130
because I was getting a private
lessons from him all the time.

20
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,040
He was the only guy that I was rolling
with and I wasn't really learning nearly

21
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,850
as much as I thought.

22
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,740
I thought like if your kickboxing,

23
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,281
and like you say,

24
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,840
if you get a chance to
work out with rob came in,

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,260
it's way better to work out with rob
came in one on one than it is to go to a

26
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,010
private class.

27
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,780
Like he's going to correct
all your technique.

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,520
So I thought that would
be the case with Jujitsu.

29
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:47,520
Like I would get really good going to
class and ain't like that at Eddie was the

30
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:48,420
first person to tell me.

31
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,230
And uh,

32
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,750
Eddie came to a,

33
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:50,950
a,

34
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,670
one of the private lessons that I was
having one Silvio and we rolled around a

35
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,530
little bit and white away.

36
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:58,800
He got me in a twister and I had
no idea what the fuck he's doing.

37
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,580
All of a sudden he hooks my knee with
his left leg and his left foot goes under

38
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:06,300
his right knee and he rolls forward
under his left shoulder and I'm spinning

39
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,200
around like a top.

40
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,500
And next thing I know he's got my arm
wrapped around his neck and he's fucking

41
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,640
pulling on my neck like this.

42
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:11,911
I was like,

43
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,650
what the fuck did you just do?

44
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,940
Like I had been doing Jujitsu for two
years and I had no idea what the fuck you

45
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:18,774
just did to me.

46
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,441
And I was like,

47
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,221
God damn.

48
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,641
And you're like,

49
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,450
I'll teach you all this shit.

50
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:21,900
I was like,

51
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,381
dude,

52
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,280
teach me this shit.

53
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,750
And that's how we became friends.

54
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,360
And that's also how I started smoking pot.

55
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:27,901
You know,

56
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,110
I was on the Mark Marin podcast
the other day and this came up.

57
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,500
Um,

58
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,920
you know,

59
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,370
I,

60
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,760
I've thought that marijuana and
all that stuff was for losers.

61
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,170
I thought that it just made you a loser.

62
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,850
You're just going to become unmotivated.

63
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:39,810
You're not going to get anything done.

64
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,700
You're going to be a dummy
and just sit and watch TV.

65
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,631
That's not what I wanted,

66
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:42,811
man.

67
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,590
I wanted to make sure.

68
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,760
We're like our friend bud.

69
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,721
We have a good friend,

70
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:48,450
but who's like super fucking go get her.

71
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,721
You know,

72
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,860
bud is a great guy.

73
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,041
He,

74
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,650
he's the one to put together
the TV show to build that car,

75
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,484
that Barracuda.

76
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,550
And he's also the one who did my garage,

77
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,281
like an MMA garage.

78
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,160
She's always got like a bunch of different
TV shows going on and he's a fucking

79
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,170
go getter and you and I are always like,

80
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:01,800
dude,

81
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
please just let us get you high.

82
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,310
You how many times more than
Dr drew more than anybody.

83
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,860
How many times we've been having this
conversation with him and he's always

84
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:10,981
like,

85
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:12,920
after I make my first million and
then he makes his first million,

86
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:13,061
or like,

87
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:13,730
I'm still looking,

88
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,341
I'm not gonna.

89
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:15,210
I don't wanna slow down now.

90
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,250
Like he just does not want to
slow it down and we're like,

91
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,840
it ain't about slowing down man.

92
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,351
It's not about,

93
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,220
I'm not slowing down.

94
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,150
I haven't slowed down at all.

95
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,980
I work more now than I ever did before.

96
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,730
I'm a busy mother fucker.

97
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:24,990
That's it.

98
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,040
This is not an annoying goddamn
stereotype that potheads or are lazy.

99
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,420
We get a lot of shit done,

100
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:30,900
dude.

101
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,250
I'm doing two podcasts a week.

102
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,061
I'm writing a book,

103
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,350
I'm writing my standup comedy,

104
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:37,230
I'm performing standup
comedy and I'm doing standup.

105
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,710
I'm doing the commentary for the number
one mixed martial arts organization in

106
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,251
the fucking world,

107
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:44,910
and I'm training Jujitsu and I'm doing
kettlebells and I'm raising kids and I

108
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,270
play pool every night and I got to surf
the Internet and I've got to beat off.

109
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,410
There's a lot of shit going on,

110
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:49,561
man.

111
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,520
It's a lot of God damn time.

112
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,630
I'm not lazy at all.

113
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,040
I squeezed it all out every day.

114
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,860
So when people say that potheads
you know that it makes you lazy.

115
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,720
It's just a stereotype man.

116
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,950
And that was a stereotype that I,

117
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,050
before I met you,

118
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,490
man,

119
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,800
I do sleep till about 10 45 every day.

120
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,710
So what time do you go to bed?

121
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,740
Two or three.

122
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:05,861
Yeah,

123
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,730
that's like eight hours.

124
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,600
That's what you're supposed to get,

125
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,050
man.

126
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,180
Most of these people were in
bed at 10 o'clock at night.

127
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,980
That's why when they get up
at six o'clock in the morning,

128
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,060
they were all impressed with themselves.

129
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,441
My,

130
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:13,651
yeah,

131
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,020
bitch,

132
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,550
I slept a one 30 in the afternoon.

133
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,050
But where were you at 5:00 AM?

134
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:19,210
I was writing the greatest bit
I've ever written in my life.

135
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,541
Okay?

136
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,770
That's why I write my best shit.

137
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,740
I was in the fucking isolation tank
traveling through the universe.

138
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,250
All right.

139
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,780
That's what I was doing
while you were sleeping.

140
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,940
So then give me a hard time because
my time is different than your time.

141
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:29,774
Like somehow or another,

142
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,401
you know you,

143
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,710
you were fucking doing yoga
at 5:00 AM so you're the king.

144
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,191
Fuck you.

145
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:33,641
Stupid.

146
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,530
And it's all based on farmers anyway.

147
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,970
It's based on farms.

148
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,700
You have to fucking get up early.

149
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,380
That's nonsense asleep.

150
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,630
The crazy thing is a Joe and I,

151
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,220
before we started smoking weed,

152
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,570
we were totally against it.

153
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,430
We would bag on stoners and
we thought it made you stupid.

154
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:52,160
And I would talk so much shit on stone.

155
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,260
Or is that at 28?

156
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,850
That's when I found out the truth.

157
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,370
That's when I reaped the
benefits of marijuana.

158
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,690
And then when I met Joe,

159
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,800
he was so funny.

160
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,080
I thought this guy's got a smoke pot.

161
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:02,770
He's so funny.

162
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,660
Like I go see him,

163
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,360
you know,

164
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,770
do stand up at the comedy store.

165
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,131
And I'm like,

166
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,380
that's that dude who trains
at John Jack Machado's.

167
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,191
He trains at my school.

168
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:09,311
Hey,

169
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:09,821
what's up dude,

170
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:10,660
I train at your school.

171
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,651
And I was like,

172
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,490
watch them do comedy.

173
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,323
And I thought he was critical.

174
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,410
He's got a smoking.

175
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,320
Eddie and I had a bunch of
fortuitous meetings just out of the,

176
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,360
out of the blue before we became friends.

177
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:19,910
At one time.

178
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,070
Eddie's eyes aren't so good.

179
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,480
And one time we were at a,

180
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:22,960
uh,

181
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,240
at Mel's diner and it was late at night,

182
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,451
man,

183
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,590
it was like one o'clock in the morning.

184
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,131
And I'm like,

185
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:27,430
Yo,

186
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,680
ed,

187
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,310
hey,

188
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,020
hey,

189
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,853
Yo Eddie.

190
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,250
He's like,

191
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,461
man,

192
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,810
who's this motherfucker talking to me,

193
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,051
man,

194
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm going to have to fight this dude in
front of my chick that's remember that.

195
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh my God,

196
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,730
you remember that?

197
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:36,941
Yeah.

198
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:37,301
You taught,

199
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,370
I was like some dude who's
just fucking with you.

200
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,540
So I had it down.

201
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm like,

202
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,913
I thought you were.

203
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,310
Cause I was with the check and I thought
you were saying something to the check.

204
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,600
Yeah.

205
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,930
You didn't hear what I was saying
and you can't see that good.

206
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,160
So he couldn't see me from a distance.

207
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,570
So by the time I came up to your table,

208
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,710
Chris's mother Fucker,

209
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,190
and then you'll,

210
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,431
oh,

211
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,264
hey dude,

212
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,670
I didn't watch news radio.

213
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,650
And at that point it was
before a fear factor.

214
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:58,930
So I never watched news radio.

215
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,490
And so I was like,

216
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,731
okay,

217
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,260
I hear he's an actor or something,

218
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,210
like I barely remember it.

219
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,300
But then when I saw you at the college,

220
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,570
that was by luck to,

221
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,010
you didn't come there with me.

222
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,641
You just came.

223
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:09,851
Yeah.

224
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,450
It was just I want to go see come cause
right when I started smoking weed,

225
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,780
I began to appreciate comedy way more
cause we'd better all of a sudden my mind

226
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,440
figured out how to write comedy.

227
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:23,711
Right.

228
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:24,730
When I started smoking weed,

229
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,440
I never understood.

230
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,430
I was fascinated with comedy,

231
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,960
but I never understood how
they put bits together.

232
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,490
I didn't understand the setup.

233
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,440
I didn't understand the
structure of comedy.

234
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,970
But as soon as I start smoking weed,

235
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm like,

236
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,620
I know where they're doing.

237
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,680
I know what they're doing now they're
doing this and they're taking that and

238
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:39,130
then do it.

239
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,700
So I understood the basic foreign layer.

240
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,030
So I just became fascinated
and then I saw you.

241
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,640
I'm like,

242
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,520
does that do for my Jujitsu school?

243
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,400
He's an actor and you killed me.

244
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:47,900
You were just,

245
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,280
you were all nothing but dick
jokes and like relationship jokes,

246
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:52,120
chick jokes,

247
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:52,954
dating Joe.

248
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,130
But you would kill in it.

249
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,000
And then when you came,

250
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,811
you walked off stage.

251
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:55,991
I'm like,

252
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:56,680
hey dude,

253
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,590
what's up dude?

254
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,040
I go,

255
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,300
you fucking were awesome.

256
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,171
And then we,

257
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,990
then that's when he invited me to
give him a private or something.

258
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,930
That was after when those
taken privates with that dude.

259
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,270
Yeah.

260
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,910
And then you came down to class and then,

261
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,470
and then the,

262
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,680
the pot smoking began.

263
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,543
That was it.

264
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,430
They were see people that
are in relationships and
get mad at everything all

265
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,090
day.

266
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,470
Girls Nitpick it guys.

267
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,420
And the guy fucking fires back and you go,

268
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,640
well you guys are not
handling this so well.

269
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,800
And then you guys are
handling this kind of silly.

270
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,510
You don't have to do this.

271
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,823
You know,

272
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,471
that's hard.

273
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,191
It's hard to watch,

274
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,490
man.

275
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,540
Especially when people have kids.

276
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,230
Dude.

277
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,090
That's when it gets hard,

278
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:31,760
dude.

279
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
That's when it gets hard.

280
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,733
Are going to front.

281
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,290
I got in front of Scott a
kid and him and his wife,

282
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,543
the um,

283
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,640
the,

284
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:38,871
the,

285
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,530
you seem,

286
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,630
they seem like they don't like each other.

287
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,111
They seem like they're,

288
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,340
they're both upset at each other.

289
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,990
Do I know?

290
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,823
Yeah,

291
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
I know he talked him.

292
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,730
It's unfortunate.

293
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,121
You know,

294
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,540
it's like,

295
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,141
God damn,

296
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,640
you guys get this
beautiful situation here.

297
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,540
You look should love each other.

298
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,110
Come on,

299
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,943
get it together.

300
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,640
You know what?

301
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,540
Either one of them smoke weed.

302
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,200
There might be a part of the problem,

303
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,880
right?

304
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,650
I think everybody needs a little weed man.

305
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,760
A little perspective.

306
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,680
It's a little perspective enhancer.

307
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,401
You know,

308
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:06,670
don't you think when you smoke with
me like smoking weed with your girl,

309
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,470
it doesn't matter.

310
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,470
This is a nice thing.

311
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,581
The best thing,

312
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:09,880
right?

313
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,481
It's like you,

314
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:11,314
you like,

315
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,460
you chilled together,

316
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:12,830
you know,

317
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,780
you hang out together.

318
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,310
It feels better when he kissed each other.

319
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,144
You know,

320
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,740
it's like a,

321
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,820
a super sensitivity drug.

322
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,390
You know,

323
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,870
it makes you super sensitive.

324
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,060
I mean,

325
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,000
he makes you really,

326
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,740
really like that person.

327
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,041
You know,

328
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,380
all their good qualities get accentuated.

329
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,520
You really appreciate them.

330
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,930
Almost like you're seeing with new
eyes or you can get really paranoid,

331
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,570
you know,

332
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,210
or freak the fuck out all the dot.

333
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,044
Guys.

334
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,420
I was watching your phantom buzzes
for guys texting her and her phone.

335
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:40,991
Oh Man,

336
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:41,210
I've,

337
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,440
I've had some serious anxiety attacks now.

338
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,860
I was watching cops last night and it
was like I've had at least five first.

339
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,300
The biggest anxiety like,

340
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,143
sorry to break your,

341
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,961
hold onto that thought.

342
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:53,231
Brian.

343
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,590
I want to hear these anxiety attacks.

344
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,020
I never smoked pot growing
up just but once a year.

345
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,320
Sorry Brian.

346
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,153
Get in there.

347
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,293
Don't be scared.

348
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,020
That's perfect dude.

349
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,863
It's early.

350
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,410
It's only eight 20 man shows us one
star for two hours getting their son.

351
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,300
Plus we've got to go get
some food after this.

352
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,961
We gotta hurry.

353
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,280
People are getting start
getting here at nine.

354
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,561
Why are they getting here?

355
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:23,170
An hour and a half early
did do the chronicle's.

356
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,660
Oh,

357
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,500
who's coming at nine

358
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,110
I just told everyone to come in
as close as nice as possible.

359
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,441
Oh,

360
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,250
okay.

361
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,360
So they'll all be here around 10
like last time in high school,

362
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,194
I didn't smoke weed,

363
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:36,801
like I said,

364
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:41,310
once a year at a party or something and
I would always get paranoid wasn't into

365
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,144
it at all.

366
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,530
I did not like smoking weed.

367
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,383
It all growing up.

368
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,770
11th grade lunch,

369
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,570
there was a big stoner crowd.

370
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,150
There's probably like a hundred people
in the stoner crowd and everyone thought

371
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:52,370
I was a stoner cause I hung
out in the stoner crowd.

372
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
But if you look closely,

373
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,830
I was like on edge.

374
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,530
I wasn't really in with those guys,

375
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:57,990
man.

376
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,090
That wasn't really it.

377
00:08:59,091 --> 00:08:59,970
It appeared I was,

378
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,220
but actually wasn't hanging out with them.

379
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,700
It's just me and three
other guys on the side.

380
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,420
And one day I got pulled into the crowd
and they're passing around a joint and I

381
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:06,661
said,

382
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:07,140
fuck it.

383
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,160
I didn't want to be a Douche.

384
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,050
I was kind of like stoked
that they pulled me in,

385
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,280
smoked a little bit of weed,

386
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,114
is that lunch.

387
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,420
And I walked to my next class and I said,

388
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,880
who knew?

389
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,101
Knew,

390
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:15,730
knew dude,

391
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,410
dude.

392
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,340
I sat down.

393
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,203
I was,

394
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,923
yeah,

395
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,280
exactly.

396
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,113
Boom,

397
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,650
boom.

398
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,230
So it was history and I'm
sitting there as US history.

399
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,870
I'm so fucked up out of my mind.

400
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,440
I'm like,

401
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,011
I freaked out.

402
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,821
I was getting paranoid.

403
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:30,270
So I thought,

404
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,740
how am I going to get through this class?

405
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,181
So I call,

406
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:33,120
I'll just look straight.

407
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,080
Don't look at anybody,

408
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:34,860
just look straight.

409
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,693
Don't do nothing.

410
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,061
I go,

411
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:36,481
Oh my God,

412
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:37,201
I'm freaking out,

413
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:37,831
but I'm not.

414
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:38,491
No one's going to know.

415
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,240
No one's going to go.

416
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,210
And then I looked to the side and there's,

417
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,680
people are looking back on

418
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,860
my eyes got fucking,

419
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,620
they said there were people were like
turning around pointing at my eyes and I'm

420
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:49,771
like,

421
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,101
fuck,

422
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:50,760
don't look.

423
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,593
Please don't.

424
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,850
Everyone's laughing.

425
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:54,061
I'm like,

426
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:54,450
fuck.

427
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,220
And then some girl handed
me or compacts with,

428
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,120
look at your eyes.

429
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,630
I looked at my eyes and they were so red.

430
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,050
It was fucking like a Zombie's eyes.

431
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,480
Would you,

432
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,141
you have,

433
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:04,650
um,

434
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,090
you have contacts.

435
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,190
Did you have contact and
have contacts back then?

436
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,330
You have glasses,

437
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,530
like black frame?

438
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,831
Yes,

439
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,161
I did.

440
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:12,420
I did work every now and then.

441
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,381
Every now and then.

442
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,670
But not to school.

443
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:15,450
Fuck No.

444
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,960
But my,

445
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,793
I looked at,

446
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,050
at my eyes and I freaked out.

447
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,000
I just stood up and walked out of class
and when to the bathroom and I sat on

448
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:24,751
the bathroom floor.

449
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,081
Meanwhile,

450
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:28,170
everyone's in cloud and I sat on the
bathroom floor just freaking out,

451
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,870
like just panicking like I
was on a rack or something,

452
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,010
just sitting on the bathroom floor.

453
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,830
The teacher calls the campus cop,

454
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,570
total asshole,

455
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,710
big ass mustache,

456
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,723
total asshole.

457
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,750
He opens the door,

458
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:40,584
he,

459
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,693
he opens the luxury.

460
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,660
You put those two together,

461
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,240
so,

462
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,750
so big ass must never forget him.

463
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,770
He opens the bathroom door and
I'm sitting down and he opens.

464
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:48,990
It goes,

465
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,980
what are you doing in here?

466
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
And I immediately started crying.

467
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:51,990
I'm like,

468
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
Ooh.

469
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,350
Like I pretended like I was sick
and everybody had known that I like,

470
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,010
I was fucked up on weed because the
teacher knew that everyone was laughing.

471
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,150
I just walk out of class.

472
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,410
He grabbed me by the neck,

473
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,080
pick me up and drag me to the
principal's office and I'm like,

474
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,850
I just started crying.

475
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:12,840
So just pretending that I was
sick and he knew I wasn't sick.

476
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,210
So he brought me to
the principal's office.

477
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,140
He had a to pay on.

478
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,720
It was awesome and he was really cool.

479
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,321
He goes,

480
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:19,920
what's wrong?

481
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,221
I go,

482
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:20,910
I'm sick.

483
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,530
I need a bed.

484
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,350
Corn Dog,

485
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm sick.

486
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,730
And he goes,

487
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,930
and the cop was like,

488
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,370
it wasn't buying it at all,

489
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,350
but the principal just
looked at me and said,

490
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,983
all right,

491
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,913
let him go home.

492
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,060
And he just let me go home.

493
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,250
And I just walked home like all fucked up.

494
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,120
I got home,

495
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,410
just laid down on my bed and I'll
never forget looking at the VCR clock,

496
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,050
just watching the minutes click by just,

497
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,943
I couldn't wait.

498
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,200
It just seemed like it
was going to last forever.

499
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,230
Just watching the clock
please feeling go away.

500
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:50,340
I hate this feeling.

501
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,563
I hated it.

502
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,321
Yeah.

503
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,580
I only got high maybe a dozen

504
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,540
times before I started getting high with
you over the course of my whole life.

505
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,950
But one time I did when I was
15 with this girl that I dated,

506
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,120
she was a,

507
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,421
she,

508
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,550
it was her idea and my friend Josh,

509
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,670
we all three of us got high together and
I was probably like 1514 maybe 1415 and

510
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,050
I stole my dad's.

511
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,923
We'd,

512
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,920
he had some super strong weed,

513
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:18,520
man.

514
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,821
I mean,

515
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,560
it was,

516
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:19,890
I don't,

517
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,171
I mean,

518
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,160
I was a little kid,

519
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:21,760
right.

520
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,020
And I don't know how we smoked it.

521
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:23,890
I don't remember anything,

522
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,980
but what I do remember is
just lying on the couch.

523
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:29,650
My whole body just tangling,

524
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,420
like little electrical circuits are going
off and my whole body and then I was

525
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,290
time traveling.

526
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,890
I would,

527
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,610
I would be on my back on
the couch and then boom,

528
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,760
I'd be in front of the fridgerator and I
had no recollection of how I got there.

529
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,600
It was like instantly I appeared in
front of the refrigerator and then boom,

530
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,940
I was in the bedroom and I couldn't
remember walking to the bedroom.

531
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,190
It's like my short term memory was
so fucked that every few steps,

532
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,230
my whole brain just rebooted and I'm like,

533
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,064
how did I get here?

534
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,770
Erased all the steps up
to get to that point.

535
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,790
There was no memory.

536
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,470
I mean my brain was fucked.

537
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,430
We both fucked.

538
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,600
We're giggling,

539
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,000
but I was scared of weed
after that for awhile.

540
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,520
I didn't do it again for for a long time.

541
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:09,871
That was a,

542
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:10,840
that was a scary one.

543
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,730
I hated it,

544
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,250
man.

545
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,370
I couldn't believe that people
could function and smoke weed.

546
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,820
I didn't get it guys in the
bands that I was in growing up,

547
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,850
it was always one star or two stoners
and every time he made a mistake playing

548
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:23,221
bass,

549
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:23,531
I'll be like,

550
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,010
blame the weed and go see you coming
in and fucking stone that fucking weed.

551
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,330
Just fucks your brain up is,

552
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,240
you know what I would do
with Andy Dick on Newsradio.

553
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:31,680
Really?

554
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
They would come in high and he
wouldn't remember his lyrics.

555
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:33,941
I'm like,

556
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:35,110
the freak is high again.

557
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,120
Like you'd be all pissed.

558
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,953
I was totally man.

559
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,730
I was such a dick to stoners growing.

560
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh,

561
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,180
me too dick.

562
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,990
I was fully,

563
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,880
you're addicted people.

564
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:43,211
I'm sorry.

565
00:13:43,211 --> 00:13:43,361
You're,

566
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:43,841
you're addicted.

567
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,120
The people that you're
afraid of yourself being,

568
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,451
you know,

569
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,650
I was afraid of being a stoner.

570
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,010
You know what's interesting about that
fight was that was the first fight that

571
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,210
Brock overing fight a couple weeks.

572
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:57,211
So that was the first UFC that
I've seen as a spectator in Vegas.

573
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,280
It since 2003 or two.

574
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,761
Oh Wow.

575
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:01,840
That was the first one.

576
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,520
I was so wasted.

577
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,540
I got so drunk.

578
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,140
Everyone's buying me shots do
from Toronto or buying me shots.

579
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm like drinking Blue
Moon Beers all night.

580
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,390
I blacked out at the end of the night,

581
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,410
passed out of the hotel.

582
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:15,244
I woke up,

583
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,110
I knew Overeem one,

584
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,060
but I didn't know exactly how he want,

585
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,013
but I knew he wasn't,

586
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,840
I had no recollection of Nick Diaz.

587
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,910
Donald's Serone at all.

588
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,330
Really?

589
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,350
I didn't know how that went at all.

590
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,233
Man.

591
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,280
You're tripping on acid
because you look so fucked up.

592
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,821
Yeah,

593
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,031
man,

594
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:31,241
it was,

595
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:31,690
I was,

596
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,860
I was having so much fun.

597
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,140
The greatest show ever invented.

598
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:35,830
Yeah.

599
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,390
The Indian came out in full force,

600
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:37,601
man.

601
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:40,230
I scalped a couple of months for

602
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,130
those that don't know.

603
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,530
That's a Joey Diaz always
said about Eddie Bravo.

604
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,220
Give him,

605
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,510
give him a couple of drinks that Indian
comes out because apparently according

606
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,440
to Joey Diaz,

607
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,130
Indians and Mexicans are related.

608
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:53,600
They're all,

609
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,070
it's all the same blood line dog

610
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,860
and you know,

611
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,190
um,

612
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,580
you know,

613
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,510
if I drink too much,

614
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,660
like there's a lot of people that have
Indians inside of them that come out.

615
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,340
If the infant comes out,

616
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,330
if the enemy comes out,

617
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,140
odds are I'm going to forget
95% of the night I've been,

618
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,500
I've been in some situations with Eddie
where I had to like hold this fucking

619
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,910
hand and walk him home.

620
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,380
What about Germany?

621
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,390
Germany was a couple of different ones.

622
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,141
How about England?

623
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,250
When I had to wake you up,

624
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,790
we were banging on the fucking
door banging on his door,

625
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,090
man.

626
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,360
I had security come out cause I thought
he might be in England for the UFC.

627
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:26,511
Yeah,

628
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,620
we were in for the UFC.

629
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:28,850
It's time to take the flight,

630
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,421
you know.

631
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:30,201
And I always say,

632
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:30,471
you know,

633
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:30,981
hey man,

634
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,540
we got a flight in like an hour.

635
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,201
You know,

636
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:33,400
you,

637
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,951
you're cool.

638
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:34,491
You're going to pat.

639
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah.

640
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,620
Fucking cause we're trying
to stay up all night.

641
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,540
We try to stay up all night so
we could sleep on the plane.

642
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,470
So um,

643
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,210
it's in the morning and we got to go.

644
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,710
The car is waiting for us when my shit,

645
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,790
we've got to get to that airport earlier.

646
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,780
It's an international flight.

647
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,920
I've got passports and shit.

648
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,431
Bang,

649
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,611
Bang,

650
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:46,881
Bang.

651
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:47,570
Knocked on the door.

652
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,170
No Eddie,

653
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,381
Bang,

654
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:48,531
Bang,

655
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:48,771
Bang.

656
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:49,371
Knocked on the door.

657
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:50,740
No 80 call cell phones.

658
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,201
No,

659
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,034
Eddie,

660
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,211
go downstairs,

661
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,044
have the phone,

662
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,210
the desk call his room,

663
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,613
no answer.

664
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,101
So I said,

665
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:58,341
listen,

666
00:15:58,341 --> 00:15:59,810
I'm worried about my friends safety.

667
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:00,261
He was,

668
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:00,560
uh,

669
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
he was intoxicated last night.

670
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:02,600
And um,

671
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,110
you know,

672
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,130
I want to make sure that he's okay.

673
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:04,964
Can you open the door?

674
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,991
They opened the door.

675
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,570
This motherfucker is
sleeping with the lights on.

676
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,840
The lights were on and he's on the bed
completely unconscious with his fucking

677
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,040
cowboy boots on.

678
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,530
Just asleep in there.

679
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,050
Eddie.

680
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,123
Eddie,

681
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,430
you open up your eyes.

682
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:22,701
You Go,

683
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:23,534
what's up dude?

684
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,520
It's just like that simple,

685
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,810
that simple.

686
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,420
It's me and two security
dudes at were screaming,

687
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,750
Hey Eddie.

688
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,040
And you just pop your head up,

689
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,343
subdued.

690
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,310
You were blasted.

691
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,910
Nothing.

692
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,451
Nothing,

693
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:38,661
man,

694
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:41,000
you were that I help you stuff your shit.

695
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,120
I remember you had a shoe in
your backpack and you're like,

696
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,740
why do I have a shoe in my backpack?

697
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,250
Yeah,

698
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,360
that's the Indian right there.

699
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,393
Right there.

700
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,720
Oh my God,

701
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:53,030
you're bringing is swimming
in a world of soup.

702
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,070
I was fucking alcohol soup.

703
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,280
I was hammered it.

704
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:56,931
Oh my God,

705
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:57,350
look at you.

706
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,183
Look at that face.

707
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,631
That's the,

708
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:00,980
that's the best.

709
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,510
The best story is Germany.

710
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:02,780
Man.

711
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,560
It was so fucked up that you got to
write a blog about Germany was so crazy.

712
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:06,861
Yeah,

713
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:07,451
Texas too.

714
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:07,690
Well,

715
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,210
well here's,

716
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,030
here's a Germany in Germany.

717
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,200
It was like,

718
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:12,530
I dunno,

719
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,430
maybe like we had to leave at like
seven o'clock in the morning and a five

720
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,241
o'clock in the morning.

721
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,460
I talked to Eddie on the phone.

722
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,651
I go,

723
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,250
dude,

724
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,090
what are you doing man?

725
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,391
I go,

726
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:21,620
we got to leave in like two hours.

727
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,820
I'm a power through.

728
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,930
I'm going to power through

729
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,540
power through.

730
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,261
I go,

731
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,490
are you still awake?

732
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,390
I you,

733
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,880
yeah,

734
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,230
Dude.

735
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,630
Awesome.

736
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,580
How was that part yet?

737
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,900
He was still out partying.

738
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,741
So a,

739
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,551
I go downstairs,

740
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,280
I eat breakfast and uh,

741
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,621
I,

742
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,150
uh,

743
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,421
say,

744
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:38,254
all right,

745
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,143
let me go get eddy.

746
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,920
I can't get him.

747
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,753
He's not in his room,

748
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,960
not answering his phone.

749
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,131
I,

750
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:43,040
I the same thing.

751
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,120
I have them open up his door.

752
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:44,880
He's not in his room.

753
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,650
He's gone.

754
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,071
So I'm like,

755
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:46,671
shit,

756
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:47,750
where the fuck could he be?

757
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,100
So then I go downstairs
and I look around and I'm

758
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,490
like,

759
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,750
I keep calling his phone.

760
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,680
He's not answering.

761
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,050
And finally I say to the guy that's,

762
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:55,430
um,

763
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,263
um,

764
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,900
taking care of the cars.

765
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,141
I said,

766
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,340
you've got a car for Joe Rogan.

767
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,383
And the guy says,

768
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,661
oh yeah,

769
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:01,494
he left.

770
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,210
I go,

771
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,511
I go,

772
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,344
what?

773
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,951
And he goes,

774
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,670
he left.

775
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,020
I go,

776
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,131
no,

777
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:06,331
no,

778
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:07,290
I'm Joe Rogan.

779
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,310
You guys have a car from me.

780
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:08,581
He goes,

781
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,151
oh my God.

782
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,890
Somebody already said there
were Joe Rogan and they left.

783
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:11,611
I go,

784
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,331
who the fuck?

785
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,440
What did he look like?

786
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,861
He goes,

787
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,210
I had long hair and tattoos.

788
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:15,481
I'm like,

789
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:16,770
mother fucker.

790
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,440
And he told them that he was me.

791
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,670
He's in his car,

792
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,630
blacked out,

793
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,440
drunk,

794
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,990
blacked out is already
an hour on the road.

795
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,261
Let me,

796
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:25,560
let me,

797
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,800
let me take it from there and say what
happened unless I had partied all night,

798
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,340
man,

799
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,050
me and Jason Uk,

800
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,010
Jason McNabb,

801
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:32,400
we,

802
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,710
he was just getting me hammered all night.

803
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,720
And I don't remember all I remember the
last thing I remember was part taking

804
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,820
shots at some clubs,

805
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,520
last thing.

806
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,520
And then fast forward to me waking
up in the back of this car with my,

807
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,240
my backpack in my suitcase,

808
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,160
like in the back of this car.

809
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,540
And Joe Rogan is calling me.

810
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,250
So I wake up,

811
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,510
it's bright.

812
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,201
And I'm like,

813
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,490
how the fuck did I get back here?

814
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:01,130
Joe's calling me and I answered,

815
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm like,

816
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,273
Joe,

817
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,320
you fucking took my car.

818
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,070
I hung up the phone
and I asked the driver,

819
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,310
I'm like,

820
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,143
where are we going?

821
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,691
He's like,

822
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:09,871
dude,

823
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,190
we're on the auto bond dude.

824
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,630
He's flying down the Autobahn.

825
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,141
He looks back,

826
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:13,950
he's like,

827
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,940
we're going to the airport.

828
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,660
I'm like,

829
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,070
Oh shit.

830
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,090
How the fuck did this happen?

831
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,800
So I'm trying to remember
what the fuck happened.

832
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,843
I opened up my,

833
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,691
my,

834
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,200
uh,

835
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,710
my,

836
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,870
my backpack and I always put my shoes,

837
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,610
my extra shoes in my suitcase,

838
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,350
always I pocket certainly all the time.

839
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,710
There's one shoe in my backpack and I,

840
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,840
and I always keep my
computer in my backpack.

841
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,141
I'm like,

842
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,974
where's my computer?

843
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,960
My computer is in my suitcase.

844
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,470
So in a drunken stupor I just
must have just grabbed everything,

845
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,260
put shit in like a Zombie pack.

846
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,970
Shit up like a fucking idiot.

847
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,260
And I woke,

848
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,440
I wake up in the back of this card and
then I find that Joe kept calling and I

849
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:50,101
didn't know what to say.

850
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,540
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

851
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,770
I needed time to think.

852
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,940
So I finally answered.

853
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,421
I go,

854
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:54,630
dude,

855
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,141
I'm sorry.

856
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,280
I don't know how this happened.

857
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:59,040
I have no idea how I ended
up in the back of this car.

858
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,760
We get,

859
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,001
you know,

860
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:02,400
and he ended up getting
a cab and at the airport,

861
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,660
Joe is so mad at me,

862
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,830
he wouldn't talk to me.

863
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:06,030
He was so pissed off.

864
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,500
I was just so ridiculous.

865
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,230
It was the second time in a row
we went traveling internationally.

866
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:15,690
The second time I had a babysitter
who was from England to this.

867
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:16,201
It was just like,

868
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:16,861
Jesus,

869
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,694
man,

870
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,560
you had to write a blog about it.

871
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,251
And I had a,

872
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,810
well it's you.

873
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:24,130
You're the first guy that I
ever met where I used to sell.

874
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,420
You know,

875
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:24,871
people say,

876
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:25,321
Oh man,

877
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,460
I blackout when I get truck.

878
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,720
Shut up their chain.

879
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:28,554
Blacking out.

880
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,870
You just pretending you're black and
now cause it makes it convenient.

881
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,110
I didn't,

882
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,790
well you know,

883
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,780
I was just seeing the Indian come out man.

884
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,471
But like I said,

885
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,240
I never used to think that it was real.

886
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,030
I used to think that people would say
that they blackout drunk and like,

887
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:39,720
come on man.

888
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,270
But I've looked into Eddie's
eyes and I see durables.

889
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,130
I see dribble eyes like you
ever look at a dribble size.

890
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,070
They're just black and dark and you
don't know what's going on there.

891
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,970
Mostly nothing.

892
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,720
You know,

893
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,460
I didn't even know Eddie was Mexican.

894
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,530
I thought he was fucking with
me for like the first two years.

895
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:54,700
Cause at the comedy store you're like,

896
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,610
I'm half Mexican.

897
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:55,810
I'm like,

898
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:55,961
no,

899
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:58,760
you're nine Mexican or you said
something like that to him.

900
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,300
Then he used to say he was having,

901
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:00,881
yeah,

902
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:01,900
you said something else,

903
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:04,080
Japanese and health Eskimo
or something like that.

904
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,830
It was one and he said half Japanese,

905
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,760
half Mexican or something.

906
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,980
I used to say that when I was a teenager
just because I was an idiot and I want

907
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,060
her to see who would believe it.

908
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:13,751
And I'm like,

909
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:13,931
wow.

910
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:14,050
The,

911
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,400
if people believe anything.

912
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,140
Did you used to do that with a lot of
things he used to like tell people crazy

913
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,910
stories and see how
far you can go with it.

914
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:22,721
Man,

915
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,010
it still happens I think the whole,

916
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,083
the whole,

917
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:25,931
the whole,

918
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:26,764
Ah,

919
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,450
why do you get into doing that,

920
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,470
Matt?

921
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,690
Do you have a hard time not doing?

922
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,051
You look at,

923
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:34,480
if you look at the [inaudible] and then
you look in and then you look at that,

924
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,590
what we did on the Joe show,

925
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,400
like with a 10 foot zip
and the templates crews,

926
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,200
let me tell people you don't know.

927
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,670
Let me tell you what we did.

928
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We were in Denver and I was doing
standup and Eddie and Tate and Brian and

929
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:48,620
Duncan.

930
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,780
We were all hanging out and we're
walking and we went through this little

931
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,600
shopping area that,

932
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:54,971
what does it,

933
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,740
those sixth street malls
that what it's called,

934
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,640
whatever the mall is,

935
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,623
whatever street it is.

936
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,051
Anyway,

937
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,550
we're going to this downtown Shami here
and we see a wig store 2005 2005 was it?

938
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,170
And just as a goof we decided to go in
this wig store and then first of all we

939
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:13,171
were high as fuck and somewhere in this
wig store we came up with the idea of

940
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,620
having a fake band and that you guys
were all going to wear these wigs.

941
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:17,990
So we all,

942
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,791
everyone bought wigs.

943
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:23,791
Tate had this crazy afro wig and you
had this crazy wig and everyone decided

944
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:29,440
that we were going to play a band called
10 foot screws and we even announced

945
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:32,950
the band like as having
an after party in town.

946
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,120
So people thought that it was like
a real band and Eddie goes on stage,

947
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,290
I get off stage,

948
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,320
the show's over and he goes on stage
with his fucking wig on and sunglasses we

949
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,250
have video of it's still right.

950
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:45,421
Yeah.

951
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:46,550
Well there was a whole show.

952
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,690
Which episode is it?

953
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,191
Seven yeah.

954
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,240
How do people find that one?

955
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,360
Just type in Joe show seven but you know,

956
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,710
all the episodes were on your website,

957
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:57,940
but since you moved the servers,

958
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,290
now everything is kind of weird.

959
00:22:59,320 --> 00:22:59,591
It was,

960
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:01,300
there were probably
getting too much bandwidth.

961
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,200
The premise of it was Joe wanted to put
together reality show based on him going

962
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,190
to all these clubs across the
nation and his posse and me,

963
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,000
Tate,

964
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,781
Brian,

965
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:14,321
Dunkin,

966
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,154
Ari,

967
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,540
even Larry back then,

968
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,100
we were all there as a producer.

969
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,713
We were all in this.

970
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,691
He was the producer.

971
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,310
That's what Joe was the
origin of the word powerful.

972
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,750
When you hear me say powerful,

973
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,010
it's all because there's one dude,

974
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,053
our friend Lara.

975
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,991
So the show,

976
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,621
what was that called?

977
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:30,454
The Joe show.

978
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,660
We had her on your website.

979
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,450
We did about 11 or 12
episodes or something,

980
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,910
and episode seven we were in Denver.

981
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:40,330
We were trying to come up with
a pet premise and then it was,

982
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,260
it was all about,

983
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,160
we just,

984
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,390
we just formed a band.

985
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,130
So Joe's on stage and we,

986
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,460
the way we sold it was Dunkin
would get on stage and would say,

987
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,480
uh,

988
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,780
uh,

989
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,420
who's going to the 10
foot screws showed an I,

990
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:53,961
that's what we call it,

991
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:55,010
10 foot screws.

992
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,170
And that was Brian's idea.

993
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,540
And so we wanted to,

994
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,110
so Dunkin was getting everybody in the
audience use of the fact that we got 10

995
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:07,920
foot screws backstage and they're
playing a big show at the dome.

996
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,290
The Dome is next to me,

997
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,200
I'll know on sixth street
to know point a logo.

998
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:12,830
So people were like,

999
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,251
oh shit,

1000
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,180
there's a concert tonight.

1001
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,740
I didn't know about this 10 foot screws.

1002
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:16,550
Are they big?

1003
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,900
So then it was already there too.

1004
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,280
Who else is already wasn't Ari was,

1005
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,410
wasn't there for Dunkin was
selling it like he would,

1006
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:23,000
he was like the host
and he was selling it.

1007
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,090
We got 10 foot screws tomorrow we're
going to give away some tickets.

1008
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,600
So I've got a stack of half
off drinks on Tuesday night.

1009
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,160
I got a two stacks of them
and Dunkin introduced me.

1010
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,120
I was the lead singer,

1011
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:37,610
I was the total douchebag lead singer.

1012
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:40,340
I was like just basically
playing the singer of oasis,

1013
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,241
but backstage.

1014
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,350
So we,

1015
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,420
I got up on stage and said,

1016
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:46,880
who wants these tickets
to the show tomorrow?

1017
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,340
Backstage they were going nuts.

1018
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,450
So like Paul Stanley,

1019
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:54,140
I divided the crowd to
one side and I said,

1020
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,240
just like Paul Stanek okay this side,

1021
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:57,021
let me hear the noise.

1022
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,370
Like a one to let me hear the noise.

1023
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,480
They went ahh.

1024
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,550
And then I stopped him and I go this side,

1025
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,350
it was just a total Paul Stanley in
1985 rebuff most bands to find that.

1026
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,420
Finally find that and chew it up.

1027
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,530
Just that part of it,

1028
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,364
because when I,

1029
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,650
when I do those tickets into the audience,

1030
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,890
tunes were flying headfirst over tables
that we're scrambling only to find that

1031
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,190
number Tuesday night,

1032
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:23,570
half off drinks and you some crazy man
wearing a wig for a band that doesn't

1033
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:24,240
exist yet.

1034
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,660
So when the,

1035
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,820
the,

1036
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,030
the,

1037
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,240
the concert led out,

1038
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,010
people had to walk by backstage.

1039
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:28,641
It was a weird,

1040
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,421
the club was set up,

1041
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,490
weird word never walking
out next to backstage.

1042
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:34,100
So we had the door open and
dudes are walking by gone,

1043
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,180
where's that bad?

1044
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,191
So we were,

1045
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:38,370
we grabbed one dude and we pulled in,

1046
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,300
we pulled in maybe three dudes
and we pulled him close the door.

1047
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:46,250
Now they're backstage with 10 foot screws
and me and Tate are just douche bags

1048
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,050
were total douche bag.

1049
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,150
You remember those fucking
questions you guys,

1050
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,350
now that I'm thinking about it,

1051
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:53,570
it was a great guy who
got down on his knees.

1052
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,433
Yes.

1053
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,521
He wanted to.

1054
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,400
He was astounded.

1055
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,920
Do whatever to hang out with the pan.

1056
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,760
He didn't,

1057
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,000
he thought we were real band,

1058
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:01,640
so we got them to do crazy shit.

1059
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,620
He just wanted to hang out with the bed.

1060
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:03,870
So good.

1061
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,030
We're going to have to get on your knees.

1062
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,720
Okay.

1063
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,680
You're going to have to pray for us.

1064
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:07,490
Pray with us.

1065
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,640
I can no band sometimes
parading them before they go on.

1066
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,270
Thank you Jesus.

1067
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,051
And he would replete,

1068
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:12,884
thank you Jesus.

1069
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,761
And you said for this,

1070
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:14,160
dig them.

1071
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,160
It's a psych and then he jumped
up and ran away and then Tate was,

1072
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,690
he's like six foot four.

1073
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,770
He was so intimidating to the guided one.

1074
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:23,690
I fire back,

1075
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:23,990
right?

1076
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,850
Just Tate sitting there
looking like a monster,

1077
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:26,684
you know,

1078
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,040
he was scared.

1079
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,150
And then we got girls that he probably
thought that you were about to try to get

1080
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:33,040
him to suck your Dick.

1081
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,730
And I keep really probably thought that.

1082
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,121
I mean,

1083
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:35,751
do you think about it?

1084
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,660
You're some fucking
Wacko living in Colorado.

1085
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,970
You know some dude who's willing to go
to some green room for some band that he

1086
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:41,900
doesn't even know,

1087
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,040
never heard of before,

1088
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,381
some van,

1089
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,214
it doesn't even exist.

1090
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,250
He's on his knees praying back and forth.

1091
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,440
You in his head when you said that
for this dictum about the saga,

1092
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,281
he probably was not,

1093
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:50,611
oh,

1094
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,570
I fucked up.

1095
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,770
I fucked up.

1096
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,281
I'll do it,

1097
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:54,120
but damn I didn't.

1098
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:54,954
I'm not going to like it.

1099
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,810
And that was a great episode of too.

1100
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:02,520
And then the other good episode was when
we were on Boston number in Boston and

1101
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,441
Ari Solo,

1102
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:04,320
Ren Dunkin,

1103
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,490
they both sell to the audience.

1104
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:09,930
They open up and they said backstage
where we're auditioning for the Joe Rogan

1105
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:11,100
life stories that they're going to film.

1106
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,470
And we're looking for
guys to play Joe Rogan.

1107
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,750
We want authentic guys from Boston.

1108
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,880
So the guys in the audience are thinking,

1109
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,601
Oh shit,

1110
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:20,940
they're auditioning to play for play.

1111
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,451
Joe Rogan.

1112
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,020
I think I could do,

1113
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,100
you could do 100 you could do it.

1114
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,400
So people lined up and
we had a fake audition.

1115
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,480
Like I'm this bad.

1116
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,360
Probably shouldn't talk about this
cause I think what you did was illegal.

1117
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,060
Was it?

1118
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,590
Yeah,

1119
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,560
I'm pretty sure he did.

1120
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm sorry.

1121
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:33,871
Yeah,

1122
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,520
we probably just didn't really happen.

1123
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,310
We denied the yeah.

1124
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,531
Yeah.

1125
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:37,761
This,

1126
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,630
this is all in another dimension.

1127
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:40,470
We deny this.

1128
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,110
We denied this parallel university.

1129
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,430
Bravo does not seek to get
suited this moment in time.

1130
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,480
This is all fiction.

1131
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,070
Dunkin was the director.

1132
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,970
Never happened.

1133
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,863
It never happened.

1134
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,550
This didn't take place.

1135
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,240
He can't timber saying hello.

1136
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,290
Much respect to the Korean Zombie.

1137
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,920
Any Bravo's wearing a Korean Zombie
shirt and what this means for you.

1138
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:03,300
Non MMA people.

1139
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,510
There's a guy named
chance on Junge who's a,

1140
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,950
they call them the Korean Zombie.

1141
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:08,850
That's his nickname.

1142
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,560
And this weekend on a Saturday night
at the UFC against Leonard Garcia,

1143
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:17,010
he pulled off the first
twister ever in the UFC.

1144
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,530
And the significance of
course is at Eddie Bravo.

1145
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,800
Our guests today actually
invented the twister.

1146
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,510
I didn't invent it.

1147
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,390
Well you invented rest set
up the set setup the setups.

1148
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:27,691
Yes.

1149
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:28,441
The finishing move.

1150
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:28,681
No.

1151
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:29,790
And you called the wrestling mode,

1152
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,620
but people used to finish
people within wrestling.

1153
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,511
You can,

1154
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,970
but did they do it your way
with the escrow on the forehead?

1155
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:37,410
I thought that was all like your,

1156
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,220
your uh,

1157
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,080
innovation to turn into a submission.

1158
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,310
Ah,

1159
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,661
no,

1160
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:42,901
no,

1161
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:43,111
no.

1162
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:44,010
People were cranking,

1163
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,830
cranking in exactly the way I crank it,

1164
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:48,120
but I'm pretty sure.

1165
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,780
Um,

1166
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:48,961
did you,

1167
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:52,080
had you seen other people get submitted
with it before you ever started doing

1168
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:52,914
it?

1169
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,320
We would like to in high school,

1170
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,520
I wrestled a couple of years and then I
wrestled in Santa Anna High and in ninth

1171
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,310
grade a guy named Jesse
Barrios and another guy,

1172
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:04,470
his buddy is the one who showed me,

1173
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,180
I can't remember his name,

1174
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,530
I couldn't even remember it for my book.

1175
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,480
But Jesse Barrios is his friend,

1176
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,710
Santa Ana high school in 1985 if
anybody out there is from that,

1177
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,570
there's Jesse Barrios friend,

1178
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,910
the other leg rider on
that wrestling team.

1179
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,511
Fuck,

1180
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,410
I don't know what his name is.

1181
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:19,920
Anyways,

1182
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,190
he showed it to me and both
of those and in wrestling,

1183
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:28,191
leg riding is for weak people
and all that means is as we need,

1184
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:29,340
we're so weak.

1185
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,340
We need to use our legs a lot more than
the big strong dudes who are wrestling

1186
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:34,581
and,

1187
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:34,741
and,

1188
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:37,380
and hitting the weights and
had big chest and shoulders.

1189
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,010
Those guys really didn't rely on their
legs as much as the weak guys like me.

1190
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,950
I would skip Russ,

1191
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,540
uh,

1192
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,410
weightlifting a practice.

1193
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,150
I was in the back where I was hiding.

1194
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,110
I was,

1195
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,890
I was weak.

1196
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,060
Even back then.

1197
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,620
I was a terrible athlete.

1198
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,000
I've never been a great athlete.

1199
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,130
So I had to rely on using my legs.

1200
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,290
And I thought,

1201
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:56,521
you know,

1202
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:57,354
they came to me,

1203
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,660
Jesse came to me and I go,

1204
00:29:58,661 --> 00:29:58,901
dude,

1205
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,010
you'll be perfect for this.

1206
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,120
You know,

1207
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,350
cause they knew I just get out,

1208
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:05,080
just get smashed if I try
to go heads up with people.

1209
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,290
So it's a pending move in that
I learned in wrestling and um,

1210
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:11,951
I got,

1211
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:12,940
I got pretty good at it.

1212
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:13,480
I would,

1213
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,310
that was my shit even in high school.

1214
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:15,701
That was my,

1215
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:17,140
that was the thing I always tried.

1216
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,380
I got some cool ass stories
that maybe one day I'll,

1217
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:20,651
I'll,

1218
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,484
I'll uh,

1219
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,541
I'll talk about him,

1220
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,980
but I have some cool wrestling stories.

1221
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,401
But anyways,

1222
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,420
I sucked at wrestling.

1223
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:27,700
I only had one take
down two fucking years.

1224
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,534
I sucked.

1225
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,170
So I just totally relied
on leg riding and,

1226
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,131
and using the,

1227
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,480
it's actually called the guillotine.

1228
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:36,040
It's actually not called the twister,

1229
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,330
it's called the guillotine.

1230
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,130
But when I started doing an end Jujitsu
Higgin Machado and John John Machado

1231
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,830
would just call it the twister because
the guillotine already existed.

1232
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,350
There's a lot of people out there that,

1233
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,980
that think that I'd like took
this wrestling move and I said,

1234
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,660
I'm going to try to fool the world and
change the name and say I invented it.

1235
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,260
There's thousands of people
that think that it's hilarious.

1236
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,120
In my books from day one,

1237
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,200
I I,

1238
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,780
it was to hold on a second.

1239
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:06,910
You're being a little bit modest because
you invented all these setups and

1240
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:09,400
turned it into a very
high percentage finish.

1241
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,120
Yeah.

1242
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,720
Answered a lot of setups from a lot
of different places where it became,

1243
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:13,871
I mean,

1244
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,060
do it.

1245
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,280
Then none of that stuff existed,

1246
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,080
but this is the transition.

1247
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:18,370
So I ended up

1248
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
quitting wrestling.

1249
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:19,771
The work,

1250
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:20,604
the work,

1251
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,750
the work will,

1252
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,501
the work ethic.

1253
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:25,410
You need to be a good wrestler or
something that is just not in my body.

1254
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:26,244
Chemistry,

1255
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,640
I was not made to work
really hard physically I,

1256
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,790
I just,

1257
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,930
I hated work.

1258
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:31,830
Regular jobs.

1259
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:34,980
I knew that's why it was
all about rock stardom or,

1260
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,720
or playing football.

1261
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:37,180
It was a,

1262
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,180
I just want her to be like a famous dude
who just played for a living and got

1263
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:44,670
paid and was a fucking
adored by everybody.

1264
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,570
That's what I wanted.

1265
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,310
I didn't want to work.

1266
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:48,061
I hate it.

1267
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:48,960
Or of course,

1268
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:49,800
who doesn't want,

1269
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:53,250
Oh my God would work like
actually like killed me inside.

1270
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,180
So it drove my artistic side.

1271
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,330
Okay.
