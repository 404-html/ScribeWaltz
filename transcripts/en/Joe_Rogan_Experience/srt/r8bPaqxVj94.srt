1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,090
Tell me to do it right before we do it.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,090
Hold on.

3
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,060
Why aren't they getting this running out
here in the song?

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,740
It just sit there on your arm.
But the video's not making sound video 

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,150
to not make it sound like it's not.
The program's just freaking out to like 

6
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,710
get the fuck off the phone.
You live in front of hundreds of people.

7
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,130
I didn't know John [inaudible].
Ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,680
winner of last comic standing.
Not like those faggots he beat.

9
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,740
Yeah.
He's the God damn champion.

10
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,830
We the first champion of laptop.
I was second.

11
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,990
Fuck was the first uh,
Dat fan that fan.

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,700
Good old debt.
Was that,

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,700
does that in any way diminish your 
accomplishment?

14
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,550
What ever happened to that dude?
I don't know what happened to him.

15
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:36,230
I think he's a,
he does.

16
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:36,680
Well,
he,

17
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:41,681
I think he said he does a lot of shows 
and the things sell out and stuff like 

18
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:41,750
that.
So kissing his ass.

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
That's actually a nice guy.
He is taking a lot of guys like to bag 

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,020
on the guy for it because when he he 
wanted,

21
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,940
he was really,
really green and new.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,020
But I don't fault anybody for that.
He's always been nice to me.

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,050
He's been nice to meet.
I've never seen him wants to stand up.

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,450
And I saw him.
One,

25
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,980
I judge the first last comic standing 
and he fucking crushed it.

26
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,630
Did,
uh,

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,260
the,
uh,

28
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:11,261
the last,
that was when we caught and stealing 

29
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:11,900
material and that's when I get screamed 
at me.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,710
Right,
right.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,980
Almost had a heart attack.
That was a fucked up story because this 

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,730
dude aunt was stealing jokes,
like book jokes,

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,090
jokes at a movies,
old friendships.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,900
And I complimented them first instead of
your really good performer.

35
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,610
You got a lot of energy,
you know.

36
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,750
But I've heard that shit before.
And then Buddy Hackett started fucking 

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,090
you fucking eighth out.
My cat just got scared.

38
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,320
She was fast.
Fast.

39
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,220
Give me a maybe come here.
She got scared when I use my buddy 

40
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,220
hackett voice.
She gets here,

41
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,170
baby.
Come here.

42
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,780
We want to be on TV anymore,
Buddy Hackett voices.

43
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,510
Um,
give me one.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,460
Anyway,
the story wasn't Buddy Hackett.

45
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,630
Um,
when I,

46
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,560
uh,
when I started,

47
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,140
when I started saying that this guy was 
stealing material,

48
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:10,141
Buddy Hackett got really upset because 
what bloody Hackett's like an old 

49
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:13,120
school,
like he's a comic from like,

50
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,150
you know,
the catskills days and those guys all 

51
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,150
stolen,
terrible,

52
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,560
you know,
they all did each other's jokes and 

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,600
there was no internet back then.
There wasn't even any fucking TV.

54
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,150
You had some gags and he did them and 
nobody knew.

55
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,300
Yeah.
And if you didn't do your gags first,

56
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,130
you know the guy in front of you,
did them,

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,600
you know.

58
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,140
You know what's funny is that a lot of 
guys from that era,

59
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,260
like everyone,
Bob Newhart's famous for the phone bank.

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,470
Yeah.
Bob Newhart's,

61
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,480
famous for it.
He's like on the phone and he'll do one 

62
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,971
sided,
the one side of the phone conversation 

63
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,220
to Larry's.
But there's a lot of guys from that era 

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,350
who did the same exact phone bit.

65
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,730
So.
Oh,

66
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,920
well,
um,

67
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,310
while he was yelling at me,
there was a part of me that wanted to 

68
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:58,310
go,
shut the fuck up.

69
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,360
You will cock sucker.
But I didn't want.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,630
He died two weeks later,
which means he was real close to death 

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,660
that night could have.
So if I yelled at him,

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,300
he might've killed over and fucking died
right there,

73
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,790
and it was,
there was a 10 percent,

74
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,590
10 percent of me.
That was like,

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,270
why am I listening to this old Douche 
bag?

76
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:23,271
Because my philosophy on old people has 
always been that old ass holes were 

77
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,720
assholes and they're young.
They just survived.

78
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,780
You know,
they just became an asshole when he 

79
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,140
turned 80.
That guy's a Douche bag and I,

80
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:31,560
I've,
I've thought about yelling at him,

81
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:32,340
but I said,
you know what,

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,070
that's not gonna help anybody.
And I'm like,

83
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,680
what's the point?
This is on television,

84
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,280
so everyone's going to see this guy's 
material.

85
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,440
They're going to see what's going on.
Everyone's going to know what happened.

86
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,470
So I did not think.
So here we are with a John Safran neural

87
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:52,361
linguistic programming freak.
John Heffron is recalibrating his mind.

88
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,490
He said some very negative negative 
patterns that he was following earlier 

89
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,790
on in his life and he's abandoned all 
those.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,820
No more drinking,
no more bad stuff.

91
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,810
John Heffron is all about positive 
energy and and,

92
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,370
and Tony Robbins,
right?

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,410
Well,
kind of.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,480
Yeah,
but Tony Robbins without the.

95
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:17,150
I'm walking on on fire and going to a 
seminar with $20,000.

96
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,520
Really motivated people.
Yeah.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,300
What is the walking on fire?
Well,

98
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:24,270
it probably helps you.
It teaches you to walk on fire.

99
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,300
How you would then apply that skill to 
other things in your life.

100
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,760
I have no idea.
You know,

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,720
because even if you having an argument 
with your girl,

102
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,730
you can't go a,
I can walk on fire.

103
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,790
It wouldn't apply to anything else,
but walking on fire guys fighting that 

104
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:42,831
bus boards.
It's great if a guy jumps in front of 

105
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,320
you with six boards.
Yeah.

106
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,880
What's the fucking point in breaking 
boards?

107
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,960
I don't,
I don't get that.

108
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,640
Or the,
the break in the.

109
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
I guess it's your power and a punch but 
not.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,700
Well,
that is.

111
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:52,590
If a guy is standing there,

112
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,600
boards break pretty easily.
That's the sad thing.

113
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,130
Those boards are used for 
demonstrations.

114
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,850
They all break.
When I was a kid type window,

115
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,560
whenever we used to open up a new 
school,

116
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,870
we would all have to go and do 
demonstrations.

117
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,390
And what part of the demonstration was 
he out of kick boards,

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,370
break boards.
So it was just always seemed so silly.

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,300
That's awesome.
Um,

120
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,470
what was I going to say?
We're talking about nero linguistic 

121
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:17,470
stuff.
Oh yeah.

122
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:17,660
Buddy Hackett.

123
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,560
So you're saying,
so you're doing all this programming and

124
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:25,130
this programming leads to you better 
performances on stage?

125
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,730
Yeah.
It's basically that it just kind of.

126
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,000
We rewires your brain to every.
Everybody.

127
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,330
If something happened to you,
you probably racked similar in every 

128
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,201
single situation.
So this Kinda just trains your brain to 

129
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,711
maybe take a the best.
It gives you options to handle those 

130
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,030
situations where you have zero options,
then you're just going to freak out.

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,360
And if you have a few,
you're usually take the best option for 

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,360
you,

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,620
but it also keeps you from doing a 
shitty things,

134
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,210
right?
It keeps you from rolling your life.

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,970
Yeah.
For me,

136
00:06:55,971 --> 00:07:00,971
it's troubling for me.
What I did is you kind of work 

137
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,611
backwards.
You figure out what you want to 

138
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,321
accomplish and then you kind of get all 
those feelings and what it feels like 

139
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:09,701
once you accomplish those and it kind of
let your brain know this is the way I 

140
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,120
want to go.
This is make every decision.

141
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,540
I'm in the right way to,
to obtain that goal.

142
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,430
You know,
I think for me it's,

143
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,420
you know,
some people go,

144
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:18,060
oh,
that's all,

145
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:23,061
it's all common sense stuff,
but there's a big difference between a 

146
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,090
common sense and uh,
you know,

147
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,550
it's common knowledge or actually 
applying it,

148
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,560
but you apply it now you're,
you're all about doing that.

149
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,310
Yeah,
I do.

150
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,350
Before I get on stage,
I do some techniques to get me because 

151
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,350
you know,
as stand ups you can get,

152
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,320
uh,
people don't realize it's not what you 

153
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,821
travel with guys day your life.
But a lot of times I'm working with 

154
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,560
dudes that bugged me.
Cereal,

155
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,610
yeah.
Or whatever.

156
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:52,611
So you get in a bad mood for 8 billion 
different reasons before you get on 

157
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,570
stage and then you enter that stage and 
you're kind of in a pissy mood,

158
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,370
which then that comes across to the 
crowd.

159
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,370
Or what I would do is I would say a 
group of guys let's say,

160
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:01,300
and in my head I would go,
oh,

161
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:06,301
those guys are going to heckle.
And then I start playing this movie in 

162
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:06,301
my head,
oh,

163
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:06,510
they're going to heckle right up my 
favorite joke.

164
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,070
Oh,
it's going to wrap that thing.

165
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,370
And I start to go like literally play it
out as if it happened.

166
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,370
So then when I got on stage,
I was already mad at these guys that 

167
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,111
didn't say anything so I can take the 
stage or the little bit more 

168
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:23,810
testosterone.
And then that puts a weird vibe on the 

169
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,740
crowd even though those guys might have 
not said anything the entire show.

170
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,110
But now I do that with every part of my 
life.

171
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:29,610
And I think a lot of people do,
you know,

172
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:30,060
you're like,
oh,

173
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,570
look at that girl over there.
I'd asked her,

174
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:33,090
I asked you probably gonna say no 
though.

175
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,270
She probably getting to st o will make 
me feel stupid in front of all my other 

176
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,270
friends and blah,
blah,

177
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,270
blah.

178
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,340
Just the same.
There's a lag.

179
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,570
There is a definitely a lag because I'm 
watching us on the video and it's 

180
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,650
totally different from what we're 
saying.

181
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,410
It's like John's still talking on the 
video,

182
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:52,780
but right now I'm going to have that 
though.

183
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Really was.
Is that because you streamed gay as 

184
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:57,960
fuck?
It's just

185
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,410
we're live streaming video,
you know,

186
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,850
because it.
Would it be better if we were on 

187
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:03,850
blog.tv,
you know,

188
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,100
I mean,
it doesn't really matter about Justin 

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Dot TV.
Would that be better?

190
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,810
Who cares if people are watching this 
care man?

191
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,950
God's saying lag.
He's upset.

192
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,550
Now.
How did,

193
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,580
how did they know there's a lag?
Because he's watching the video and the 

194
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,580
sound is different.
No,

195
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:19,920
no.
The sound and video is the same,

196
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,800
isn't it?
Yeah.

197
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,790
Okay.
Fifteen years,

198
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,380
uh,
15 seconds delay.

199
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,730
Well,
how the hell do you know there's alive 

200
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:30,730
then?

201
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:30,730
Probably on a slow,
shitty,

202
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,540
shitty ass in that connection.
Why are you blaming us and aol dial up 

203
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,270
John from.

204
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,830
Not only is he a standup comedian,
he also hosted the MMA awards this year,

205
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,590
which was a total fucking disaster.

206
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,700
Really complete.
I didn't say it was a total.

207
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,470
The edited version.
Kim,

208
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:51,440
on awesome way.
You told it to me.

209
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,090
For me,
for me it was the check cleared.

210
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,190
The check is clear.
It's talk.

211
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,640
Yeah,
the check is coming there,

212
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:02,641
but for me it was weird that the people 
who got to see it on versus got to see 

213
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:06,540
it live as if it was happening.
So there was a lot of,

214
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,850
shoot this guy,
this guy sucks.

215
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,270
I'm just.
Those youth described to me talking 

216
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,540
about me hosting.
Um,

217
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I didn't get to those sitting at,
in the safety of their computer and 

218
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,010
being maybe 15 or 16 years old,
you would probably think that it's stuff

219
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,380
not realizing that hosting something 
like that.

220
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,030
Gentlemen,
the sound.

221
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:33,031
If you just have to press refresh,
if you press refresh your sound and 

222
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,440
video should sync up.
That's what's going on.

223
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,680
Some dude said that the MMA awards were 
laying.

224
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:37,550
Well,
you know what?

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Compared to my thing to that lane lane,
this is my thing is,

226
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,950
is lane to what is it is what I don't 
get.

227
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,730
There's people compare them and may 
awards to what the Oscars.

228
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,970
No,
not much money.

229
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,940
It's just not interesting to watch,
you know,

230
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,280
show it was that.
It was highlighted clip show and people 

231
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,500
got to realize I think for the first one
and the budget they had.

232
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,560
That's why,
you know guys like you or Kevin 

233
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:08,560
[inaudible] people.
I was like,

234
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,611
why is it Rogan host?
Why isn't Kevin j like big guys that 

235
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,430
people know honestly because they had $0

236
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,270
plus also the,
the hosting thing.

237
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,780
I couldn't have hosted it because I'm a 
commentator

238
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,040
anyone and make some,
you know,

239
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,010
I'm,
I'm a human,

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm a fan and I'm as objective as 
possible when it comes to other 

241
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,530
organizations.
Like I'm always talking about fate or,

242
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,680
and I'm always talking about Iot and all
these different guys who fight.

243
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,280
Alistair overeem and different guys are 
fighting other organizations.

244
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,770
I'm,
I'm a big believer in,

245
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,290
you know,
you have to look at all.

246
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,130
I mean,
if you're a fan,

247
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,990
you have to like all the different 
organizations.

248
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:49,991
You can't just be loyal.
Obviously the UFC is the greatest job 

249
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,571
I've ever had and it's a fucking awesome
Gig and I appreciate the hell out of it 

250
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,950
and I loved the job.
But as a fan,

251
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:58,951
you know,
you can't just only follow the fighters 

252
00:11:58,951 --> 00:11:58,951
and the fights that are in that 
organization.

253
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,610
That's just silly.
I love my favorite thing.

254
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,790
I tweeted this,
so I was watching you do a commentating,

255
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,430
one of the fights.
I love when you call out an entire group

256
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,640
of 20,000
people for billing because I can,

257
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,740
I get mad like we'll just drunk.

258
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,990
The bottom line is I understand that 
they didn't like the decision.

259
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,750
That makes sense,
but once the dude is talking,

260
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,640
when they're interviewing,
the dude booing him,

261
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,820
all he did was like Erin Simpson versus 
Tom Laurel.

262
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,370
What was the last one like you can't 
boot.

263
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,980
Erin Simpson.
The guy thought his ass off.

264
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,910
He got hurt really bad the first round 
and came back and won the second and the

265
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:36,630
third and it was a really gutsy 
performance man.

266
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,890
And he had mandarins and even in the 
third round he outpaced Tom Lawler and 

267
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,310
it was just a great fight overall,
great fight.

268
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,470
And I don't know how anybody couldn't 
have enjoyed it.

269
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:49,290
I mean,
I think in situations like that,

270
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,520
I hate clothes decisions because close 
decisions like that man,

271
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:58,350
it could have gone either way.
And so the fight really took place.

272
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,380
Everybody saw what happened and to 
decide that one guy won it or another 

273
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,150
guy wanted when it's that close,
I would much rather have a draw.

274
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,880
I think that fight could have easily 
been a draw.

275
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,150
You know?
A lot of people thought that Tom Lawler 

276
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,951
one,
which I definitely think he won the 

277
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:15,951
first round,
but I think Erin Simpson when the second

278
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:20,400
and third,
although not in as large a margin second

279
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:22,950
very slight and the third a little bit 
more.

280
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,140
I think if you looked at it on paper you
could say,

281
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,210
well maybe you could give the first 
round ten eight,

282
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,780
but the bottom line is forget about all 
that.

283
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,590
The bottom line is it was a great fight 
and guys should feel like a loser.

284
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Like there's no way Tom Walsh will feel 
like a loser after that fight and 

285
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:39,740
there's no way Erin Simpson should have 
done booed.

286
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,150
I anytime I've been at live fight or you
hear the people,

287
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,960
I don't get mad,
but I love when people start going start

288
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:52,961
yelling,
stand him up when they've been on the 

289
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:52,961
ground for maybe 35 seconds.

290
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,220
Yeah.
It's still one more if guys or guys feel

291
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,710
out each other like,
I'm okay with an expired.

292
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,820
I mean I spar MMA is my golf.
I don't smarter really trying to tell 

293
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,950
anybody.
I enjoy the workout of it.

294
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,530
But even,
you know,

295
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,310
you have to fill out a guy.
You don't just go,

296
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,860
go and then start start.
You know,

297
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,950
people expect like hockey fight 
sometimes where it just erupts 

298
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:14,950
immediately.
They walk out,

299
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,610
they go toe to toe and started.
Well,

300
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,860
I think it's just that the one of the 
action is great.

301
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,890
It's so exciting that people want to 
keep that part going and then when it 

302
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,550
goes to the ground,
the uneducated fans,

303
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,220
if they don't know what's going on,
they get upset,

304
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:32,240
but promise the referees in small towns,
like when we go to Memphis,

305
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,310
I don't say small towns,
memphis is in a small town,

306
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,720
but we you go outside of Vegas.

307
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,840
A lot of times they use local referees 
and these guys,

308
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,870
they're too busy.
They get involved.

309
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,170
They actually too much,
you know,

310
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,740
fight guys,
fight mma,

311
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,710
fighting.
Hey,

312
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,790
you know guys in the guard is working as
guard is trying for an arm bar.

313
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:52,791
I was trying for something.
I'm going to stand you up and we're 

314
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:52,791
standing out like what the fuck?
Talking about.

315
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:52,960
You understand what these guys are 
fighting,

316
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,710
fighting.
I don't think most people realize the 

317
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,881
difficulty.
I mean just have somebody your size if 

318
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:03,851
not a little bit bigger laying on top of
you and then stand up from that 

319
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:05,360
position.
Just letting that person just with their

320
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,850
weight and how hard it is just to stand 
up.

321
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,200
What do you mean?
Like if I'm on,

322
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,910
if I'm on my back and you're on top of 
me and I and I scrambled and I get it,

323
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,620
that we both,
we stand up together.

324
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,050
That's a huge feat in itself.
It is.

325
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,860
You know,
it might,

326
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:22,010
it maybe not that.
That shouldn't be that way.

327
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,370
You should get up is if you got up.
It shouldn't be the referee stands.

328
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,660
You have.
I hate all that shit,

329
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,840
but I've always said that if,
if someone like Brock Lesnar can take 

330
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:31,840
you down and molest you for five 
minutes,

331
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,830
then that's tough shit.
Tough Shit.

332
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:38,831
He's got you on your back.
You got to find a way that a way to get 

333
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:40,220
back up to feet and if you can't,
it's five minutes of him punching you in

334
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:45,221
the face and that's life.
And if your technique to avoid that is 

335
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:46,160
to turn and run in circles so we can't 
tackle you,

336
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,620
then do is whenever it gets here and 
believe me,

337
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,770
that's going to you.
What's going to decide your career is 

338
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,120
going to be fans and with their fans,
like your style,

339
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,510
whether or not you sell tickets,
whether or not you know,

340
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,570
you optimize your potential as a mixed 
martial artist and the fans are going to

341
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:10,571
let you know whether or not they like 
your style and if you've got a boring 

342
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:10,571
ass style,
even if you like winning fights,

343
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,240
nobody's gonna give a shit.

344
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,770
They're not going to buy your paper 
views.

345
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,500
And that's like,
that's like that's commerce,

346
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,360
you know,
that's how it's supposed to work.

347
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,980
You know,
it's supposed to be let,

348
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,370
let the market dictate what the people 
like.

349
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,460
People are not,
not I,

350
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:26,030
I,
you said you sent a clip the other day,

351
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:29,930
a tag team,
but what do you think the evolution,

352
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,880
if you were just to pretend to 
evolution,

353
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,170
you think maybe 40 years it'd be like 
maybe numb chuck's on Iraq,

354
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,720
like on a hook on the side of the cage 
where then.

355
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,330
No,
because that's not as fun.

356
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,970
The Fun thing is man to man.
No weapons.

357
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,640
That's what I mean.
You could go the Roman gladiator style,

358
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:50,000
have dudes have sword fights and there 
would be certainly be fucking crazy,

359
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:52,620
but ultimately I don't think it would be
as enjoyable.

360
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:57,621
It just be more fucked up because your 
champion Musashi,

361
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,770
Musashi beat 62 men and a sword fights,
but unless you're Musashi,

362
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,860
you know what's going to happen,
you're going to get fucking sliced up.

363
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,020
You sucks about that tag team idea is 
half the people probably think that's a 

364
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,770
great idea.
You know they all came from wrestling.

365
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,270
No,
they don't go to the.

366
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,920
Go to the youtube clip that I posted up 
on tag team member,

367
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:21,440
man.
Every fucking.

368
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,440
What the fuck is this shit now?
Why was that?

369
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,240
What happened?
Then?

370
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:31,241
What happened from the transition of 
wrestling thinking that's an awesome 

371
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:31,340
idea to all those fans.
Wrestling's fake.

372
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,300
Basically,
you know the real.

373
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,390
The evolution is war.
It's like football.

374
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,280
It's like a team of MMA guys on one side
of the field that it's know

375
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,080
I got.
I got a hulk Hogan story for you.

376
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,790
By the way,
when we're at the UFC,

377
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:51,791
he sat right in front of me and he has 
this really weird hair where it looks 

378
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,981
like it's a wig almost,
but he pulled out a comb and during the 

379
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:56,800
UFC the whole time he's just calming the
back of his hair and like,

380
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,030
like just like kind of go like this and 
like flipping it over his shoulder and I

381
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:05,031
was just like,
is this really the hall cogan that I 

382
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:05,031
know is combing his hair?

383
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,520
Well,
he probably does it like for like,

384
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,380
it's probably a show like part of his,
his image and it's just because,

385
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,130
I mean,
he's silly.

386
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:14,700
He's always on when he's out in public,
you know,

387
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,660
he's the hipster dude interviewing him.
Was the shift.

388
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,660
Was that fucking awesome man?

389
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,960
He was really nice guy.
Huh?

390
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,630
It's great guy.
Real Nice Guy.

391
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Every interview you.
Well,

392
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,770
not every interview you've done.
I saw you interview.

393
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,620
There's been,
there's been a fight in the stands right

394
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,360
before you go to talk to them.
They,

395
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,420
uh,
it happened with a semester so long 

396
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,750
you're interviewing rocky and there was 
a,

397
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,720
there was a thing that happened with 
home.

398
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,980
There's always like a little moment 
right before it's funny I guess,

399
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,010
or to make them more realistic.
Maybe you could have cage fighting or 

400
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,950
where you have to queue fighters and 
then random people standing around like 

401
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,921
a bar fight.
So then you'd have to worry about 

402
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,250
throwing a punch back and have it going 
to be robots in a name in the future.

403
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,590
No human chimp hybrids.

404
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,830
People are going to like infuse their 
body with chimp DNA and jumped on top of

405
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,150
the cage.
They're going to be so much stronger and

406
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:11,190
faster.
Well,

407
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,430
is this going to be some definitely just
going to be genetic engineering in the 

408
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,711
future.
And when genetic engineering becomes a 

409
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:19,711
reality,
forget about steroids.

410
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:24,091
Steroids are going to be nonsense.
It's going to be nothing when they get 

411
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,090
gene diastat,
you know the,

412
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
you ever seen the video of,
um,

413
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,100
there's a,
there's a couple of kids that have been 

414
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,991
born with myostatin problems.
And what happens is they develop like a 

415
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,540
extreme amount of muscle.
They have all like there's whippets,

416
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
there's a dog called a whippet and they 
breed these dogs to try to make them 

417
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,830
fast,
to make them sleek and run fast and 

418
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,750
occasionally they have an error in their
genetics and they get giant muscles.

419
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,690
It looked like they didn't only look 
really like photoshop,

420
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,520
but it's a real dog,
like super roided up shredded and no fat

421
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:02,521
and it's incredible,
but that's all they've done it already 

422
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,461
to mice.
They've engineered mice so that these 

423
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:08,461
mice have this mile staten,
a inhibitor situation going on and they 

424
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,010
have giant muscles and they can.
They live longer.

425
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,280
I mean,
I'm all for a minute.

426
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,090
I hope all that stuff comes around right
around the time when I'm in my sixties,

427
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,410
seventies,
it's gonna Happen,

428
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,000
man.
I'm going to own it.

429
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:22,880
Well,
it's.

430
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,670
Everything is going in a direction where
like science fiction,

431
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,790
like the things that we thought of as 
being completely ridiculous in the 19 

432
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,331
eighties.
This stuff that you would see in a 

433
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:36,331
movie.
I mean it's all real now.

434
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:40,800
You know,
I mean you see that new Microsoft touch 

435
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,651
thing where they have a table and you 
can put something on the table and it 

436
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:45,490
recognizes what that something is and it
gives you information on it.

437
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:47,920
I mean that's like minority of type 
shit.

438
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,930
I mean this is all going to happen.

439
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I was talking about that new cell phone 
idea that Nokia has where it's a phone 

440
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,430
that you're talking and then he flipped 
on your wrist when you were doing,

441
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,470
you know,
it's like turns into jewelry.

442
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,560
Yeah.
And it wraps around you.

443
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

444
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:07,191
It's like,
like the bracelets as the old metal 

445
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:09,131
bracelets.
Are you still like flip on your wrist 

446
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:09,131
and that girls would have um,
but it's,

447
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:13,101
it's a cell phone at the bendable lcd 
and they just happened at the other day 

448
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:14,570
and it's pretty much what it is.
They can unsweetened and out,

449
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:16,070
use it as a phone and then when they're 
done,

450
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:17,300
you just clip it on your wrist.

451
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,650
What's that?
Neo Technology or the took sharkskin the

452
00:21:23,651 --> 00:21:26,680
hallway.
It's all bladed and made the suit that's

453
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:29,280
almost unstoppable and stuff for like 
soldiers were.

454
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,340
You were almost like a wetsuit,
but it's an nothing can get through it.

455
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,490
So it's like Kevin Vocabulary,
but it's thinner and stuff then it's 

456
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,911
ever been before.
So he could wear it as a full body and 

457
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:41,911
you can't stab someone with it.
Um,

458
00:21:41,911 --> 00:21:44,860
well regular Kevlar can be stabbed 
straight on.

459
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:49,861
You know,
with a knife you can get through 

460
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,151
capital.
But this is some sharkskin is what some 

461
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:53,140
guy invented.
He invented it to stop shark attacks,

462
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,880
but it's not that chain mail stuff.
It's like a wetsuit.

463
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,050
That can't be another messing with that 
stuff.

464
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,150
One day I going to have a real iron man 
suit.

465
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,370
Yeah,
it's going gonna be crazy if they don't 

466
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,260
already know the guys who are gonna look
like Halo.

467
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,540
The dudes from from Halo.
Definitely

468
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,220
all that technology,
like star wars where you're going to 

469
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,220
have a helmet that you pull out.
So you know,

470
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,520
because he can't breathe the air 
outside.

471
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,480
Yeah,
there's going to be that.

472
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,410
But I think most of the war is going to 
be fought.

473
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,980
Like what the CIA's doing a Pakistan 
right now,

474
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,430
they've got drones.
These drones are flying over Pakistan,

475
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:32,431
just launching missiles down on people.
The bottom line is that all things 

476
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:36,331
accelerate.
No things stay exactly where they are 

477
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:39,511
and the only time they degress is when 
there's a gigantic national competitor 

478
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:43,110
catastrophe or somebody blows up a bunch
of nuclear weapons and we would go back 

479
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:48,271
to being fucking cave men.
I mean that's the only way things are 

480
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:49,780
going to decelerate,
but the way things are going right now,

481
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,210
they're gonna move and crazier and 
crazier direction.

482
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,270
I mean,
we've asked them fast.

483
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,650
We went from,
from bows and arrows to guns to cannons 

484
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,450
to and it keeps going and going and 
going and now it's fucking drones.

485
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:03,130
They're firing missiles from the sky.

486
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,300
I mean that's.
And then,

487
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,480
you know,
the Star Wars program they were trying 

488
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:09,480
to do during the Reagan administration,
you know,

489
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,161
they were trying to have it so that they
have satellites that can shoot down 

490
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:17,401
missiles from space.
But apparently that was all bullshit 

491
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:17,970
apparently.
That never really worked in a PR.

492
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:23,010
There's a gigantic conspiracy wrapped 
around the scientists that were involved

493
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:27,790
in the star wars program because 
apparently a fuck load of them have died

494
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,120
under suspicious cause.
Yeah,

495
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,310
there's a,
if you google it,

496
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,760
anybody wants to Google it.
We could google it right now and I'll 

497
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,790
put up a link for you guys,
but I don't know if this is a legit,

498
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,030
um,
obviously I don't know if it's a legit 

499
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,151
conspiracy theory,
but the star scientists understanding 

500
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:50,660
what I need to conspiracy theory stuff 
that you talked about.

501
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:51,890
Is there one site,
if you,

502
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,450
let's say you're a new guy,
Alex Jones' infowars.com.

503
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
Warner's Geo Marconi,

504
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:01,190
scientists,
death conspiracy theorists.

505
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Mystery of the dead scientists.
Conspiracy with the PD has a little page

506
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:11,921
on between 1982 and 1990 25 British 
based GDC Marconi,

507
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:14,840
scientists and engineers who work.
Oh,

508
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:16,040
that's the sting ray.
Oh yeah.

509
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,610
Star Wars defense initiative.
Yeah.

510
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,050
Um,
died under mysterious circumstances.

511
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,800
Wow.
Police investigations found his death to

512
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:29,801
be unconnected to the same police that 
are out Taser and grandmas and shit is.

513
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,710
That was that he did.
It was probably the snacks out of the 

514
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,760
vending machine,
probably how aids was created.

515
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,020
There's so many sites on this.
I don't even want to link it because I,

516
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,930
I just.
Yeah,

517
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:46,931
you know what I'll do.
I'll link the Google search so you do 

518
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:49,721
your own work because uh,
who the fuck knows how many of these 

519
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,210
guys are completely crazy.

520
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,530
So I just sent it out there.
Who knows?

521
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,850
Who knows how many guys are completely 
out of the fucking mind and who knows 

522
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,820
whether or not it's real.
You know,

523
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,070
Star Wars was ringing,
right?

524
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,460
Yeah.
Well the Reagan administration was 

525
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,921
famous for um,
a bunch of secret shit was going on.

526
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,280
It says rag and introducing Star Wars.
His announcement of what it was back in 

527
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,820
the day.
What are you showing it?

528
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,800
What are you going to show a video or 
something?

529
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:23,150
Don't do that.
Nobody gives a fuck.

530
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,440
Don't put that up.
Star Wars.

531
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,550
It's the whole thing.
Why not weakened?

532
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,940
So people have them introducing star 
wars because I don't want to put a,

533
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,510
it's a,
it was just a program where they shot,

534
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,800
supposedly had satellites that can shoot
down missiles from space.

535
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,410
But apparently it was never functional,
never,

536
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:50,411
never proven to be effective.
They spent billions and billions of 

537
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:51,590
dollars on it and all these scientists 
dying.

538
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,270
The big theory was that,
you know,

539
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,060
these guys knew too much and they knew 
that it was horseshit and so they had to

540
00:25:56,061 --> 00:26:00,410
kill them off before they talked.
I wouldn't put it past them,

541
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,530
you know,
you get the CIA involved and if you ever

542
00:26:03,531 --> 00:26:04,710
read like economic,
uh,

543
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,760
confessions of an economic hitman and 
you find out the shit that our 

544
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,080
government does to other countries.
Like they'd kill scientists,

545
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,090
they'll kill anybody.
They don't give a fuck,

546
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,450
you know,
the same people that wanted us to go to 

547
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,330
war in Iraq and were willing to lie 
about a weapons of mass destruction.

548
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:25,331
You know,
everybody's a going on and on about 

549
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:25,331
September 11th.
Like,

550
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:28,780
do you really think the government would
allow innocent people to die during 

551
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,890
September 11 so they could go to war?
I don't know,

552
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,010
but do you really think they believed 
there was weapons of mass destruction?

553
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,010
Do you really think that we're over in 
Iraq and Afghanistan for good reasons 

554
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,660
that benefit you and I know and millions
of people have died because of that,

555
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,210
at least a million civilians have died 
because of that,

556
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:50,211
and so if they're willing to do that,
you don't think they're willing to kill 

557
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,000
a few thousand here and there.
Of course they are.

558
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,330
And forget about the few thousand that 
died during nine slash 11.

559
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,810
The million people that died in Iraq or 
human beings,

560
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,900
they're just as legitimate as the people
that died in the twin towers.

561
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,970
I mean,
it's all completely ridiculous.

562
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,620
Someone says,
can we change the topic to something 

563
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:09,620
fun?
I love be praised as his name.

564
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,720
Somebody say,
please look up.

565
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,780
That's the definition of literally you.
You might engage it.

566
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:18,060
Use that word too much.
You don't know what it means.

567
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,120
Oh,
how do you know what I know what's,

568
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,880
what's that?
The literal translation?

569
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,640
I know it literally,

570
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,760
you know,
I was talking to somebody recently who 

571
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:29,760
has a,
uh,

572
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,380
Joe Rogan UFC,
a drinking game where a guy gets rocked,

573
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,480
know a button.
He prewashed it.

574
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,430
I forgot what he said.
He,

575
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,160
uh,
he prewashed watched it and then bed his

576
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,190
friends a Bj Penn spider monkey lakes.
Is it Turner,

577
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,420
monkey lows?
It's just kind of a weird brand and I 

578
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,420
don't know if you've ever said,
I've never heard that.

579
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,280
I might've said it when you do a 
hundred.

580
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

581
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,430
She's,
I don't.

582
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,160
I might've said that one day.
I forgot.

583
00:27:58,161 --> 00:28:00,920
I said it doesn't inspire them or listen
to this guy.

584
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:03,860
There's no such thing as a legit 
conspiracy theory.

585
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,720
Okay.
Smart man.

586
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,870
Like you fucking know how funnier 
people.

587
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:10,880
There's no such thing as real conspiracy
theories.

588
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,030
Of course there are stupid.
Look up the Gulf of Tonkin.

589
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,090
Gulf of Tonkin incident is a real 
conspiracy theory where the government 

590
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,011
really did lie and say that there was an
attack on American citizens and that's 

591
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:27,580
what got us into the Vietnam War.
Look up the lookup.

592
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,620
The northwoods document.
The northwoods document is a real 

593
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,131
conspiracy that the joint chiefs of 
staff drafted up and signed and then it 

594
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,751
was vetoed by Kennedy and what it was 
was basically they were trying to get 

595
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,420
people enthusiastic about a war with 
Cuba and they were going to plan attacks

596
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:45,800
on American civilians.

597
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:51,010
They were going to blow up an airliner 
and blame it on Cuba and say that 

598
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,790
Americans were on board.
They were going to attack ships.

599
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,490
They were gonna attack,
Guantanamo Bay.

600
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,980
They were going to throw mortars into at
Guantanamo Bay,

601
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:02,981
and they were ready for us casualties,
which meant they were willing to kill 

602
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:05,040
Americans in order to get us to go to 
war with Cuba,

603
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:09,080
but these are real.
They look up how fucking cigarettes.

604
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,290
You want to read theory.
How can politicians all want to talk 

605
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,960
about drugs and we need to keep drugs 
out of schools.

606
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Drugs in this country can't even fucking
come close to the death and destruction 

607
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
that health problems that cigarettes 
have cost,

608
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,610
but yet you don't hear a peep out of 
those guys about cigarettes.

609
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,730
Cigarettes kill 400,000
people a year in this country alone.

610
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Every fucking year,
that's a real legit conspiracy where no 

611
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,170
one is talking about it.

612
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,620
And the reason why they're not talking 
about is because tobacco companies,

613
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,780
finance campaigns,
politician,

614
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,300
those are conspiracies.
What a conspiracy is,

615
00:29:44,301 --> 00:29:48,480
as someone conspires to do something,
there's hundreds of legit conspiracies.

616
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,690
Look up the Iran Contra affair.
I look up the fact that Oliver North and

617
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,650
all those guys were involved in doing 
illegal shit in order to,

618
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,740
to help to bring in a.
I just want seeing where they bring 

619
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,010
cocaine into,
into the US.

620
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,840
Well,
that's the,

621
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,890
that's the accusation.
And there's a bunch of books that had 

622
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,171
been written that and CIA agents who 
have said that there was a guy named 

623
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:14,460
Gary Webb who's got a bunch of shit on 
that and it was a dude named barry seal 

624
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,910
who actually was bringing in cocaine 
from other countries.

625
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,210
Got caught and when he was about to go 
to trial was murdered.

626
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,210
And that was to go the bringing coke 
from at,

627
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,570
um,
those like Afghanistan type countries to

628
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:28,370
help support them to fight the Russian.
Yeah.

629
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,390
And here's another one is,
you know,

630
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,540
people say,
Oh man,

631
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
this is good.
They help us.

632
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:37,680
And sure,
some CIA I'm sure do that.

633
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:39,390
But the CIA,
one of the,

634
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:44,391
one of the planes that's been to 
Guantanamo Bay crashed last year in 

635
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:48,861
Mexico with four tons of cocaine.
I'm going to put up that link.

636
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,980
Yeah.
And it didn't even fucking make the news

637
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,990
man would make royders and it didn't,
uh,

638
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,570
it didn't make any of the big news 
programs.

639
00:30:58,571 --> 00:30:59,980
I'll put up that link for you guys.

640
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,880
Okay.

641
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,920
But this is the fucking CIA plane.
Yeah.

642
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,660
Polite.
Rupert was the La Compact.

643
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:07,970
Busted that.
Yeah.

644
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,240
Yeah.
They had a special on hbo or something.

645
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,150
The two [inaudible].
There were two black dudes that were the

646
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:15,800
ones at all funnel through.

647
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,970
Yeah.

648
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,450
The bottom line about human beings 
though is that people are so 

649
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,860
lackadaisical when it comes to shit.
And so they,

650
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,140
you know,
you could add that stuff could be on the

651
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,430
news and people would care more about 
John and kate.

652
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,810
You know,
John has to pay $10,000

653
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,660
a month in child support and alimony who
actually going to do it?

654
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,780
And that would be big news,
whereas people wouldn't give a fuck 

655
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:44,780
about,
you know,

656
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,120
the CIA selling drugs.
They would,

657
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,210
all you have to do is have one person on
television say it's bullshit and that's 

658
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:50,210
all the.
I mean,

659
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,921
that's all you need to get.
Ninety percent of the people to believe 

660
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:54,921
it.

661
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:57,760
And uh,
and a lot of those shows and a lot of 

662
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:57,760
the news ones that there's people,
that's what they do for a living,

663
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,610
they say they can put their name in a 
database to be an expert about whatever.

664
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,030
And then CNN or Fox or go,
we need a guy that knows about.

665
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,050
And then you're the expert on drug 
addiction.

666
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,470
Yeah.
It's been proven that oil companies have

667
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:16,471
hired scientists to dispute the fact 
that human beings have created global 

668
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,500
warming.
You know,

669
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:22,530
who the fuck knows whether or not 
they're right or wrong when it comes to 

670
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:22,530
global warming.
And most people that arguing,

671
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,550
they arguing from the point of being a 
conservative or being a liberal.

672
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,510
Liberals always say we have to stop and 
conservative say there's no connection.

673
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,550
And that's just because they're a bunch 
of fucking parents.

674
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,810
They here,
you know,

675
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,190
all these different people rush limbo or
whoever on the radio saying that there's

676
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
no connection that you're these shortly 
liberals and they just repeat the same 

677
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,140
dumb shit and conservatives do that and 
then liberals,

678
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:47,141
they see that fucking Al Gore Cock 
sucker and then go Al Gore so that me 

679
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:49,220
and my boards made a billion dollars off
of this fucking climate gate.

680
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,250
If you look at like what Al Gore has 
made,

681
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,910
the money that Al Gore's made since an 
inconvenient truth came out,

682
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:56,090
it's fucking staggering.

683
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,330
He's made an incredible amount of money 
off of this and the people that would 

684
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,090
benefit from all these carbon taxes,
I mean,

685
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,430
they're setting this up to make money 
and that's what they're doing.

686
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,860
No one's doing this.
There's,

687
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,540
I'm sure there's a few scientists 
they're doing with the right intentions,

688
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,690
but most of the politicians have to push
them in as they have ulterior motives 

689
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:13,690
and they're trying to make money off of 
this shit.

690
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,220
Hey,
Joe Rogan.

691
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:19,880
Did you hear Johnny Bananas?
Twenty one at Gmail Dot com says,

692
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,110
who'd you hear that the y chromosome is 
evolving faster than the x chromosome?

693
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,840
That's because we're men.
Bitch.

694
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,660
Johnny bananas were the only ones with 
the why.

695
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,660
The women don't get the why.
The why is the future.

696
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,560
Yeah.
I just saw,

697
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,930
I just saw a documentary about that,
uh,

698
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,110
that males are disappearing because of 
all the chemicals.

699
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,870
Yeah.
I've heard that too,

700
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,220
that that's why guys act more girlish.
Now.

701
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,500
If you look at,
well,

702
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:46,800
that's,

703
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,630
there's a surplus of men.
There's the,

704
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,810
when there's a search,
when there's a surplus of men rather men

705
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,230
act more aggressive and grow more facial
hair and become more masculine and have 

706
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,040
more testosterone.
When there's a surplus of women,

707
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,190
men tend to relax and they tend to be 
more feminine and they tend to shave 

708
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,050
more and be more metrics.

709
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,130
Actually,
this one was about that.

710
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,570
The other chemicals that probably our 
parents,

711
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,580
our parents parents did in the sixties,
all the plastics and all that kind of 

712
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,900
stuff where they said wasn't bad for 
you.

713
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:22,170
Now they realized it is and for some 
reason that those chemicals affect men 

714
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:25,240
more like defined the alligators that 
live by,

715
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:26,950
let's say Dow in,
in the,

716
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:30,900
in the swamps had smaller balls,
then alligators,

717
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,350
um,
you know,

718
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,020
generations earlier that all those 
chemicals were shrinking.

719
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:40,021
The alligator balls.
I don't know what job you have that 

720
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:40,090
that's your guy.
That one guy goes,

721
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm going to measure it out,
get her balls.

722
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:42,990
Yeah,
you know,

723
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,640
I'm going to measure it and we might 
need this data later.

724
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,700
But that's what,
that's what they say is just from all 

725
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,670
the chemicals and stuff that men are 
acting less like Matt and producing more

726
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:54,740
sperm I think in the sperm.
Less the girl.

727
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,900
No less from like,
so young guys now have less sperm than 

728
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,200
their dad probably have,
which it should be the internet,

729
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:07,370
you know,
we're getting rid of more spring in our 

730
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:07,370
guides

731
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,770
because we're jerking.
You didn't have it.

732
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I bet it's very much more difficult for 
your dad or your dad about masturbation 

733
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,270
because they used to have to set up a 
projector that pull the shades down,

734
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:26,370
pull the screen,
run that little 16 millimeter black and 

735
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,380
white old lady molestation nowadays too.
I wonder what the odds are.

736
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,160
Well,
it actually goes down.

737
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,290
I don't think it's dumb.
You don't have or go even back further 

738
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,841
than that.
That was guys had to put up the 

739
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,491
projector.
Even go the guys before that had the 

740
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,390
paint stuff on walls in caves and then 
you know that there's way more people 

741
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,830
now.
So there's way more molestation.

742
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:51,160
But per capita I'm wonder.
I wonder the Japanese,

743
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,640
the Japanese believe that if you show 
all that shit,

744
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,100
you show rape and molestation and crazy 
sex.

745
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,450
You know,
like that's why they're in a school.

746
00:35:57,451 --> 00:35:59,010
Girls on that shit.
They feel like that.

747
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:04,011
It gets it out of your system.
Then if you watch like violence in in 

748
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:04,860
video and movie form,
that somehow or another,

749
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,760
it gets it out of your system.

750
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,860
Why did they blur all their porn?
Now?

751
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,360
The only blur.
The pubes yeah,

752
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:09,960
that's weird.

753
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,430
Wait,
you're allowed to get fucked by a 

754
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,430
technical,
but he can't see it.

755
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:20,460
Can't you see pussy or indeed not bad 
witness reload.

756
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,310
But if you squint,
like in the old days in the news,

757
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,270
if you squint you can see this magic and
then I find myself like squinting going.

758
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,510
There's other porn that I can be 
watching that's way more like the old 

759
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,170
old school kind of French kind of 
European pork.

760
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,000
Do you remember my news when you're,
um,

761
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,820
the old days when you would go on the 
road and you'd go to hotel rooms and the

762
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,960
dirty movies would be scrambled,
but they would only be like legally.

763
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Yeah,
if you can get online through them and 

764
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
you'd see like a Ted that would go into 
the mouth and you,

765
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,140
you'd have enough to jerk off to.
It used to be able to use to be able to 

766
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,250
get like a three or four minute preview 
to see if you want it.

767
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:03,251
So you'd have 10 and hit the second 
preview.

768
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,880
I was proud of myself.
I would,

769
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:09,970
I would get hard.
And then as the preview was going to be 

770
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,790
done in 15 seconds and with the vhs,
like if we borrowed from somebody you 

771
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:17,501
could see like what their thing was 
because when you put it in and hit play 

772
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:17,600
whatever scene,
you know that,

773
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:19,700
that they just had stopped after they 
were done.

774
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,570
So you're like,
really?

775
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,880
That's the thing.
You did someone have a bit about that.

776
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,520
Chris rock had a bit about that,
about you know,

777
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,730
how he went.
Turns out one of his porns and he had 

778
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,540
left at a certain scene.
But then because of the vhs tape,

779
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,290
when he went to it the next time it was 
a different scene is like someone's been

780
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:39,380
watching my.
That's so true.

781
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:41,120
Right?
That was.

782
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:42,110
Yeah.
I remember.

783
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,540
I remember renting vcrs,
this 18 vcr.

784
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
And then leave it in there when you take
it back or something or you'd rip off of

785
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,360
the.

786
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,190
I remember,
I like birthday parties.

787
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:59,191
My mom would go to the library and rent 
a movie projector just to show like 

788
00:37:59,191 --> 00:37:59,680
Moody's birthday party.

789
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,930
Do you think the CIA had a hand in Gary 
webs death?

790
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,990
I don't know the story behind other Gary
Webb die,

791
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,240
so the tablets going to be announced 
next week.

792
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:17,350
Uh,
supposedly by apple and they don't know 

793
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,221
what the name is.
It's like I slate or ipad now I'm 

794
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:22,641
sitting in bed at like four in the 
morning am I can think of what could it 

795
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:22,641
be called?
And I'm thinking why wouldn't they?

796
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:24,660
It like I tag whatever they call it.
It,

797
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,570
it's like a go online at [inaudible] dot
TV.

798
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,040
Just in case,
you know,

799
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,530
I'm,
I'm addicted to domain names for 

800
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:34,530
riddick.

801
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,280
I've got,
I've got like 8 trillion that I would 

802
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,280
never for any reason.

803
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,020
Do you have a lot?
What's some of them that you own?

804
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,290
I've owned a.
let's see,

805
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,600
this is back in aol days like it 
obviously.

806
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:45,610
I never did.
Lol.

807
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,170
Stop,
stop,

808
00:38:47,171 --> 00:38:50,700
stop.
This Gary Webb guns are asking that they

809
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,780
were talking about the whole dropped all
the stuff about the CIA and the,

810
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:55,370
the,
the,

811
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:57,040
the,
the is and everything.

812
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,640
She committed suicide according to the 
coroner.

813
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,000
Shot himself in the face twice.

814
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,980
Well,
if it didn't work the first time,

815
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,160
definitely

816
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,820
I guess.
Yeah,

817
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,110
that was the guy that said all the 
cocaine guy.

818
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,940
Credible sources.
Cook.

819
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:19,480
No.

820
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:20,940
Yeah,
this is the,

821
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:25,941
this is the guy that was releasing all 
the information about the CIA selling 

822
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:26,760
cocaine.
Alright,

823
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,230
hold on a second.
Copy this.

824
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,760
Paste it for you guys.

825
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,630
Yeah,
that was an interesting uh,

826
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,260
because when the Iran contract stuff was
going on,

827
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,920
I think I was like,
you know,

828
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,280
11 or 12 in there.
I had a oliver north for president t 

829
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,150
shirts.
Yeah.

830
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,180
I didn't even.

831
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,010
That's an interesting shot himself in 
the fucking face twice.

832
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,490
That's hardcore.
Oh,

833
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,000
ouch.

834
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,880
Hm.

835
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,980
Who knows.
Anyway,

836
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,450
what are you talking about?
The tablet?

837
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,920
No,
our addiction.

838
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,740
Addiction to domain names.
Like what?

839
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:05,820
What's some domain names that you did 
you buy?

840
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,620
Because I,
I'll think of something usually when I'm

841
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,490
really stoned.

842
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,440
Bye.
John [inaudible].

843
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,360
John F funds a fag.
John Headphones.

844
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,880
A loser should've.
Should

845
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,200
are scam.
Scam.

846
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,450
Because you always see those at the 
first.

847
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:24,451
Whatever the whatever you're looking,
you always see the word scam at the top 

848
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:24,451
and then when you click on whatever it 
is,

849
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,520
it just pro whatever you're looking.
Because I think naturally if you're 

850
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,180
looking to buy something,
you see the scam,

851
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:33,130
you're like,
well I'll go to the negative first.

852
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,430
Oh,
some dude said it was doug stand hopes 

853
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,430
bit about his mom with the porno.

854
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,430
Yeah,
that makes sense.

855
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,790
That makes sense.
It's awful.

856
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,730
There's a company called rip off report 
and this is like,

857
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:47,731
I don't know how this is legal at all.
If somebody's mad at your company or 

858
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:50,320
something like that,
they can put something on there.

859
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,470
And what this company does is it uses 
spam techniques where it spans like 

860
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,480
message boards and all this shit all day
long.

861
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,730
So Google puts it on the top of your 
list.

862
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,960
So my friend has a fashion company that 
does like dresses and stuff like that.

863
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,110
And the first thing that comes up when 
you google is rip off report,

864
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,510
this person's ripping you off and blah 
blah blah.

865
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,100
And Michelle are my friends,
like how do I get rid of this kid?

866
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,540
They're like,
well if you give us $2,000,

867
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,950
we'll take it off.
It's like,

868
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,640
what

869
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,340
second?
So the company that reports on people 

870
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:25,720
for scams,
they're basically just extorting.

871
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Yes,
it's called ripoff report and then in a 

872
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,200
funny thing is that you receive them and
they'll take your name off of it.

873
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:37,590
Holy Shit.
A rip off report dot Com and it seems 

874
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,070
like it's a legit company.
So if you have a problem with,

875
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,340
you know,
like somebody's business or something 

876
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,591
like that,
you can say you can write a letter like 

877
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:45,591
this person ripped me off and stuff like
that.

878
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:46,740
That's extortion,
extortion.

879
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,490
And if you go online there's a lot of 
people suing this company or is it about

880
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,900
12 different lawsuits going on for this 
company right now,

881
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,020
but she's been trying everything to get 
the shit off.

882
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,120
Like she's.
She was on TV the other day.

883
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,610
Doesn't matter still.
First thing you google her name,

884
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:01,200
it comes up.
Is that her name?

885
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,280
Michelle window.
Am I c h e l l e Dot Wendel w e n t.

886
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,110
it's somebody like that.
I don't know how successful,

887
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:14,720
but either way it's people like that 
don't have the report.

888
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Wow.
Don't have the money to go after her to 

889
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:19,760
go after them,
you know what I mean?

890
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,170
That's pretty expensive.
I'm in.

891
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,070
I was going to sue a company recently 
and it was just,

892
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,370
it ended up being just so much money 
that you had to go,

893
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:33,371
well,
do I want to use that just to say that 

894
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:33,371
I'm right

895
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:33,490
or do you just save,
you know,

896
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,650
both of those people are ex employees to
that wrote those things real.

897
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,270
She fired.

898
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Yeah.
It seems like there'd be some kind of 

899
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:45,840
like libel or something.

900
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,590
Yeah.
Well they're getting sued,

901
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,610
but I mean,
but the whole thing that's weird about 

902
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,640
it is,
is that it's like,

903
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,970
uh Oh,
what was that?

904
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,400
Even time

905
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:01,570
already should have fear just showed up.
Ladies and gentlemen,

906
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,250
that crazy Jew.
We didn't even call him and tell him to 

907
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,250
come here.
I have a special guest.

908
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,760
My special guest this week is John Half 
Ron.

909
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,920
It's not already should fear what is 
that mumbles over her or I should fear 

910
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,160
came because probably he knows I got the
best weed.

911
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,580
Let's talk about our latest twitter,
which is twitter.

912
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,670
I've had a lot of people ask me how many
percentages of artists' twitters are 

913
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,920
have to do with suicide or no,
I was going to say a shitty of some type

914
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,310
of something.
Leaving his Bong Hall.

915
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,810
He talks about someone says something

916
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,460
disappointed that you're not getting 
high.

917
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,300
The reason why we're not getting high it
was because up until a few moments ago,

918
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,420
my little baby was in the house and my 
mom and the baby and we're in the media 

919
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:47,490
room right now and

920
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:51,610
there's no ventilation up in this bitch 
high.

921
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,680
He's down here with a shotgun in his 
mouth.

922
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:01,530
He's been doing all this shit lately.
It's so now she's coming to get you a so

923
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,470
you got to call her because I'm doing.
Where are you at next?

924
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:09,370
Where are you at this weekend?
Right?

925
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:15,330
I'm a nowhere this week or next week and
then I'm in the following week.

926
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,890
Sorry,
have you about deleting your mind space?

927
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,410
Because I'm actually to the point where 
I'm thinking by deleting my mind space,

928
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,450
I still put a blogs.
I still will take a blog.

929
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,600
Whenever I put up a log I'll.
I'll throw it nine out of 10 times.

930
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,490
I'll throw it up on my space as well,
just because I think more people

931
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,380
a few more.
We'll read it my space because it has 

932
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,820
the date and you don't have to be a fan 
to actually see the dates,

933
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,430
so you don't have to be a fancy that 
taste.

934
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,020
So you see there's two different things.
Facebook is really confusing.

935
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,260
There's a fan page.
I have a fan page or something else that

936
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:49,420
you don't have to be a fan to to see the
dates.

937
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,160
Oh really?
Yeah,

938
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,750
it's a.
what's the two?

939
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:55,750
It's a fan page and a group and the 
group.

940
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,310
It's so annoying.
Facebook,

941
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:58,090
so knowing with this,
but yeah,

942
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,610
group.
Facebook by the way is A.

943
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,510
I don't want any more pillows sent to 
me.

944
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,530
I don't want any.

945
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,230
I have.
I don't see any of that.

946
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,850
You turn off any kind of event.

947
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,380
Pillows are blessings.
I appreciate that.

948
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,540
How do you.
It's in your settings,

949
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,010
so confused.
It's like there's this pillow fight,

950
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:18,060
so you'll go to your thing and there'd 
be like 50 people hit you with pillows.

951
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,380
I want to find the dude who invented 
glitter kegs,

952
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,350
glitter tags.
I don't want anybody putting my wall.

953
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:27,540
Who would've ever thought that would be 
popular?

954
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,260
Have you been to the mall and glitter 
your iphone

955
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,090
or people that can tag you.
Like I'll get comics that I'll have like

956
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:40,920
their video on youtube and they'll tag 
me and then suddenly their video of them

957
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,540
on is on my.
It's my,

958
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,500
it's like my property,
that's my grass.

959
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,900
Stay off my grass

960
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,240
and Joe were talking about this the 
other day.

961
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:49,310
We have a friend that doesn't want,
you know,

962
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,050
people.
He's very private,

963
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,250
but since somebody just posted a photo 
of them and now every single person that

964
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,110
that person is friends with can see 
like,

965
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,520
you know,

966
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,550
please go right to the photo.
Yeah.

967
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,340
Private.

968
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,760
Yeah.
Facebook's a mess.

969
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,660
Yeah.
The security settings are sketchy.

970
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,860
And there was a dude who was a former 
facebook employee that was talking about

971
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:07,130
it,
you know,

972
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,630
divulging all the information but how 
they do things and

973
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,700
well,
you know,

974
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,710
that's how they're doing.
A lot of people are seeing a lot of 

975
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,081
people's identity is to go you.
And I'll get enough information from 

976
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:21,921
your site just in general that I,
that I can then use that to piece mail.

977
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,950
Well,
how about this?

978
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,030
There was a failure stuff.

979
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,200
A bunch of dudes are getting scammed.
This is very common where guys are 

980
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,130
pretending to be chicks and they're 
pretending to be tricks online.

981
00:46:31,131 --> 00:46:33,780
And some dude was posing as a model and 
scam.

982
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:36,410
$15,000
out of some doctor in Florida.

983
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:39,460
Sent pictures,
photoshop naked pictures and,

984
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,320
and apparently this dude had a girl's 
voice,

985
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,650
like a really feminine voice.
I'll put up the link for you guys,

986
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,990
but it's fascinating how fucking 
gullible dudes.

987
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:49,940
I like.
How the fuck do you not know?

988
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,890
Did you put up the link to somebody 
wanted to know about what you're talking

989
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:56,330
about earlier with the mice?

990
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,920
No,
I didn't put up the milestone inhibitor 

991
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:01,920
thing,
but I'll put it out.

992
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,830
I'm going to put,
put up this like put a John from twitter

993
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:03,550
up there though,
right?

994
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,660
I need follow up.
John [inaudible] followed on her

995
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:10,740
1000 followers finally got exit forever.

996
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,610
I tried to keep mine too.
I go in spurts with twitter,

997
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:15,500
sometimes I want a twitter three in a 
row,

998
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,680
but then I'll then I'll feel bad and 
then won't do any for like a day or two,

999
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:24,490
but then I realized everybody's 
following a lot of people so it's not 

1000
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:24,490
that annoying.

1001
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,990
It's weird how like,
it's so different.

1002
00:47:25,991 --> 00:47:30,991
Like my space,
I had no problem getting frames on or 

1003
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:30,991
whatever,

1004
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:35,310
but with twitter people are a little bit
more picky because they have to read 

1005
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:35,430
your shit everyday.
That again,

1006
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,450
it's different how like twitter,
like some people are huge on twitter,

1007
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,510
you know,
you wouldn't think there they are like 

1008
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,510
twitter makes no sense to me.
Now numbers why?

1009
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,850
You know,
like Aston Kutcher is the most popular 

1010
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,100
magazines and it goes on CNN and he 
talks about his twitter on CNN and Larry

1011
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,180
King every day,
but he's not even a quarter.

1012
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,400
That fucking dinosaur.
Nobody gives a shit about it.

1013
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,930
Larry King,
the young people with twitter don't give

1014
00:48:02,931 --> 00:48:07,931
a fuck about Larry King,
but they certainly give a fuck about 

1015
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,061
Aston Kutcher,
that handsome devil with his elderly 

1016
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:10,160
wife.
They love that dude.

1017
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:16,910
Wonder how long are going to keep her 
because Ashton's only like fucking 27 

1018
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:16,910
years old,
right?

1019
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:16,910
Isn't it?

1020
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,500
He's got me in his thirties now.
Like.

1021
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,270
Yeah.
Okay.

1022
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,790
Let's say he's 35.
Okay.

1023
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:23,110
Then she's 47 at 20 years.
Forty years.

1024
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,840
She's going to be 57.
Who?

1025
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,610
That's a tough sell.
I think it's great.

1026
00:48:28,611 --> 00:48:29,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

1027
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,940
I'll probably go 20 years backwards.
He hangs out with Bruce Willis video.

1028
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:40,270
Maybe Bruce Wells takes a degrees or 
asked.

1029
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,180
Yes,
exactly.

1030
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:52,730
That's weird.
I don't want to hang around with some 

1031
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,781
dude who made babies with my wife was 
fucking her like every night sleeping in

1032
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,310
bed with her and coddling with.
But you know what?

1033
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,160
I'm not that open minded.
Maybe Ashton's really open mind or maybe

1034
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:01,810
it's just hanging out with him.

1035
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,640
Awesome.
I'm in with the Hollywood crowd was so 

1036
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,761
cool.
We hang out and party b while bruce is 

1037
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:11,761
like,
go get me a beer.

1038
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:12,420
Oh,
get your peer.

1039
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,140
Actually,
accidents got better creative.

1040
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,770
Bruce.
Nowadays I dare you.

1041
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:18,100
I dare you with those terrible movies he
makes.

1042
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:23,710
How dare you say that you'd be 
motherfucker the fuck up boy.

1043
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,880
But like how many shows his ass in 
fucking producing right now and that's 

1044
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,590
doing some news to share that I did in 
my head.

1045
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,300
And they all suck.
Every single one of them still make 

1046
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,570
Bruce Willis is bruce.
You see the butterfly effect?

1047
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,260
How many people?
How many?

1048
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,960
How many people have asked him saved in 
a movie?

1049
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,460
Good.
Good point.

1050
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,370
I've never watched it.
I know,

1051
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,180
but I'm trying to.
The Butterfly.

1052
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,420
Awesome comedy.
Have you seen that is awesome.

1053
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,390
Unintentional comedy boost.
What?

1054
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:00,230
Action flicks.
Okay.

1055
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:05,231
All the die hards.
You know how many people as Ashton 

1056
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:05,510
Kutcher killed him?
Was that movie The monkey moving?

1057
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,830
18 monkeys.
12 monkeys.

1058
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,260
Monkeys.
Six months.

1059
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,280
Numbers International.
Roy?

1060
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,130
Yeah,
it was.

1061
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,710
He probably got lost or died on the way 
over here is cheap as carpet with him.

1062
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,380
Ask Him because she was pretty selfish 
as far as movies.

1063
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,390
He say he didn't save the world.
Anybody.

1064
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,040
Do you have a video we can play while we
go

1065
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,030
for a.
we'd break.

1066
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,230
Oh,
that's a good idea.

1067
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,200
This the video work done.
Does it?

1068
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,950
It just wasn't set up for that.
What can you play that?

1069
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,990
While we go do a,
we'd break pick up already and we're 

1070
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,781
going to go smoke some weed and the show
will be infinitely funnier in five 

1071
00:50:43,781 --> 00:50:43,781
minutes.
Um,

1072
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,010
let's play global thermonuclear only 31 
years old.

1073
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:52,930
She's Sam.
These bitches know what time?

1074
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,290
Everything to.
Hold on.

1075
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:57,350
Let me get something.
How often do I get poned pew?

1076
00:50:57,351 --> 00:51:00,800
How do you say?
Poned in real life and say,

1077
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,800
that's nice to say.
Someone wants to know how often,

1078
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,900
how often they get tapped.
I get tapped at least every month at 

1079
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,110
least once a month.
Last month I got tapped one,

1080
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,930
two,
three times.

1081
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,500
I got tap three times last month and was
because uh,

1082
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,780
moving back to la from Colorado,
I was in,

1083
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,660
I was out of shape.

1084
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,860
I wasn't training that much and you 
know,

1085
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,820
you roll with good guys to get tapped.
Especially when you're tired.

1086
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,840
When you roll like after the first guy,
the first guy you know,

1087
00:51:26,841 --> 00:51:31,100
you drill the way we do it a 10th planet
is your drill for the first half hour,

1088
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:35,840
40 minutes and that gets you tired,
but you still have good energy.

1089
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:38,570
But then the first role you have full 
energy,

1090
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:40,130
you know the first role,
you feel great,

1091
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,830
but if you roll with a tough guy and 
everybody attends planet,

1092
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:45,060
I mean your role with Brown belts and 
purple belts,

1093
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,140
all those dudes are tough.
All those dudes are capable of tapping 

1094
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,391
you out and then it's a matter of how 
much endurance you have because if you 

1095
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:52,880
know,
you put yourself in bad positions,

1096
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:57,881
you know,
especially if you're pulling guard all 

1097
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,651
the time because I'm trying to work on 
my bottom game now to try to work on my 

1098
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:00,950
guard.

1099
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,570
And if you,
if you get tapped,

1100
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:03,860
I get tapped.
Shit,

1101
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,810
I get tapped all the time.
Once a month.

1102
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,520
If you don't,
if you don't get tapped,

1103
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,670
you either not rolling with good people 
or you're not trying.

1104
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:13,520
You're not opening yourself up.
If you don't open your game up,

1105
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,380
you don't improve.
You gotTa,

1106
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,220
you gotTa.
First of all,

1107
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:21,250
if I just wanted to get on top all the 
time and always hold position and not 

1108
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,731
take any chances.
You could go a year without getting 

1109
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:25,340
tapped.
But if you want to learn and you want to

1110
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,220
develop your game,
you can't worry about being tapped.

1111
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,630
When you get tapped,
you got to go,

1112
00:52:29,631 --> 00:52:31,640
okay,
that's one more way that I won't get to.

1113
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,690
Our friend Scott got me in this crazy 
arm bar from inside my guard.

1114
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:42,010
I was,
I had him in my car and he got me in an 

1115
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:42,010
arm bar that's never happened before.

1116
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,960
It's some crazy thing where as you scoop
under the leg to try to toss the guy and

1117
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,170
get him in an arm bar.
He has this way of locking your arm with

1118
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:51,140
his leg and they pulls on it.
It's real dangerous felony.

1119
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,620
My elbow was going to go and I was like,
you motherfucker.

1120
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,650
I'm like,
I to get that.

1121
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,610
And then I had them show it to me,
but now he tried to do it again,

1122
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,810
uh,
the day before yesterday.

1123
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:02,030
And he couldn't get me in it,
but it's just because he got me in it.

1124
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,580
Hey,
you got in.

1125
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:08,590
Did you let yourself in the housekeeper?
Awful Shapiro,

1126
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:10,790
the Ari Shapiro,
Ladies and gentlemen with Lola,

1127
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:15,260
she's lonely.
And she goes,

1128
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,510
no,
you got a video.

1129
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,680
Yeah,
looking for something good.

1130
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,060
Arash fierce.
You're already come.

1131
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:23,540
Say Hi to the American public.
All 518 people.

1132
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,230
You don't even know where the fuck we 
were over here.

1133
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Look at this already close to Ma'am to 
sexual.

1134
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,300
It's weird,
Huh?

1135
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,100
Oh,
watch out here comes a goofy had it's 

1136
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,100
going to come in and put you where you 
are.

1137
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,490
What?
I'm looking for.

1138
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:52,491
Videos that video,
uh,

1139
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,580
bring my mass in.
Um,

1140
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,450
he'll,
he'll create problems.

1141
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,730
Whatever.
I'm standing with that door a gate.

1142
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:04,630
And I was like,
come on killers around.

1143
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,630
Doesn't know me.
I need somebody who knows.

1144
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:11,010
I wouldn't come in if I saw johnny.
Brutus is small.

1145
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,390
You have some.
He's not going to do anything.

1146
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:15,300
But here's something interesting.
If Johnny thought you were scared,

1147
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:16,710
he booked.
Were you afraid of bitch?

1148
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:20,510
Who Take advantage?
They don't have fun.

1149
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,760
Good man.
What do you,

1150
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,920
what did you find that?
That six.

1151
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:30,020
It's a six minute special on how this 
local person is given a medical 

1152
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,610
marijuana to,
to his autistic kid legal.

1153
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Oh yeah,
that's the one where the kid is all 

1154
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:37,850
fucked up and he gives a little pieces 
of it every day.

1155
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,130
Yeah,
that's really interesting.

1156
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:41,670
In six minutes,
ladies and gentlemen,

1157
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,870
we're going to just show you a little 
clip of video so that we can go get high

1158
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,890
and then we come back.

1159
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,220
This is going to be a totally fucking 
different show and talk for a little bit

1160
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:55,090
like filmy pitches where they're saying 
that will cure autism or autism.

1161
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:57,840
It helps autism people that have autism.
Yeah,

1162
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:58,890
they're kids.
This,

1163
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:03,891
this guy has a medical marijuana 
prescription for his kid because this 

1164
00:55:03,891 --> 00:55:05,020
kid has autism and yeah,
this is a local guy.

1165
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:10,030
Couldn't nothing was working,
nothing was helping and what are the 

1166
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:10,440
positive effects almost.
It just relaxes.

1167
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,260
It calmed him down.
You're going to go full screen with that

1168
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:17,820
bitch still working on which we're still
trying to iron out clunky.

1169
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:20,370
We need to get a good program and we're 
trying to.

1170
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,210
Which I right?
How smart is my master?

1171
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:28,211
If he's real smart,
we'll bring them in after the break to 

1172
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:28,810
get a breakfast session identification 
for weeks.

1173
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,090
We got to push the time,
the patient pills,

1174
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,360
boxes,

1175
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,870
medical marijuana is nothing new but 
new.

1176
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:49,690
That's one issue in particular.
Could children ticket to share Calvin 

1177
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:53,490
here with an incredible story about one 
families fight for their son.

1178
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,080
Micah in Victoria.
When you say that sounds so shocking to 

1179
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,080
so many,
but California's prop 2:15,

1180
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:04,350
the compassionate use act was passed by 
voters a decade ago and it tells a lot 

1181
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,360
of seriously ill patients with a 
doctor's recommendation to use marijuana

1182
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:10,120
legally,
but what about for children?

1183
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,270
We did find this one family with a truly
remarkable tale to tell us in this case,

1184
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,880
Ela exclusive report.

1185
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,490
Tell me what the school's like.

1186
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,230
This is Sam 10 year old who lives with 
his dad,

1187
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:32,520
his mom and his sister Lucy in northern 
California.

1188
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:38,430
Sam has autism from age two to age.
Sam's disorder made him violent and 

1189
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:43,880
aggressive.
His parents,

1190
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:47,330
Steve and Angela were truly living a 
nightmare every day

1191
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:52,890
where he was hurting other children at 
school and it places a lot of times 

1192
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:57,161
would be enlightened store and he would 
just escalate this bolt off and go and 

1193
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,710
hit another child in the face.
One time he pulled the TV game,

1194
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:04,430
Dr Moore,
all the furniture and I got and I had to

1195
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:08,480
put him in a food for maybe an hour.
We just were.

1196
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,500
His whole body was spasming.
It was just later crying and older.

1197
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,880
Sam's parents worked with expert doctors
who recommended a succession of 

1198
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,830
conventional prescription medications 
like risperdol and a host of others,

1199
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,480
but Sam just gained 20 pounds and became
harder to handle,

1200
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:29,680
so

1201
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,670
we were like,
okay,

1202
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,560
he's getting more interest,
is getting bigger and stronger now.

1203
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,040
Least 20 pounds bigger from the 
resperdol the child,

1204
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:43,041
but we had grown to love was gone.
It was just like when you looked at and 

1205
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,840
when you talked to him,
he had just disappeared.

1206
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:51,510
Finally at their wit's end and faced 
with the very real prospect of needing 

1207
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:56,241
to institutionalize their son.
Sam's parents decided to try something 

1208
00:57:56,241 --> 00:58:00,620
unconventional and controversial.
Last year they began treating Sam with 

1209
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:02,160
medical marijuana.

1210
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:07,220
When you think about it,
it really is the perfect medication for 

1211
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:07,220
that kind of behavior.
It's just very calming.

1212
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,310
So this is the medicine right here.

1213
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:12,410
Steven Angela got a recommendation from 
a medical cannabis doctor.

1214
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,260
They told Sam's pediatrician about their
plan,

1215
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:19,370
and Steve Grew Sam's new medicine in 
their backyard.

1216
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:24,490
We had six plants.
This is where Steve took out his tomato 

1217
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,770
plants to grow and then harvest the 
cannabis from the marijuana flowers.

1218
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:32,771
He could make a concentrated form what 
people refer to as this ball represents 

1219
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:37,950
roughly four months of doses for Sam 
later.

1220
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:42,970
Steve softens the cannabis with heat,
then takes what appears to be just a 

1221
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,840
speck of pond.
Sam's Joe's for the day.

1222
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,060
What affected the medical cannabis have 
on Sam was the first time we did it.

1223
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,990
We just wanted to do,
um,

1224
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,300
to see if it would work at all.
And it was just an amazing experience.

1225
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,610
I can't,
I'll never forget it,

1226
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:58,420
you know,
to watch what happened to him.

1227
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:03,510
It was just like this Bush and doesn't 
tend to upgrade and this,

1228
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,030
uh,
you know,

1229
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:06,700
obsessiveness,
it's just like,

1230
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,860
it just went away just like it just 
calmed him down.

1231
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,660
Well,

1232
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,560
we were with the family.
We watched Steve put Sam's daily.

1233
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:16,440
Joe sent a piece of melon and take it to
him.

1234
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,530
Within roughly 20 minutes.
Be Effects were clear,

1235
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:32,830
were earlier.
Sam had been animated an antsy after 

1236
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,390
eating his Spec of Sam became calm,
relaxed,

1237
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,620
and social.

1238
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:43,530
As a mother,
how would you feel about people saying 

1239
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,860
to you that you're getting your son's 
stone everyday for?

1240
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,650
At first I was very concerned about 
that,

1241
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,640
but recently I've been sharing the story
with more and more people,

1242
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:54,840
you know,
friends and coworkers,

1243
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,490
and I find that your,
the more I tell people,

1244
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:59,530
the more I share with people,
the more comfortable I am with it.

1245
00:59:59,531 --> 01:00:02,550
It has saved our lives and I think about
what it's done for our son.

1246
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:07,700
Could stamp story help others.
Respected La area pediatrician 

1247
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,841
Christopher toles shirt says,
we don't know enough about cannabis for 

1248
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:11,841
kids,

1249
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,020
for all the parents out there whose 
children may have autism.

1250
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,200
I think the message here is that this is
intriguing information that needs more 

1251
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,921
research before we can confidently say 
that marijuana is a safe and effective 

1252
01:00:22,921 --> 01:00:23,360
treatment for once,

1253
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,150
but for this California family,
medical marijuana has literally being an

1254
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:34,250
answer to their prayers as homecoming 
for their son.

1255
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,030
It was just

1256
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,790
medication that we saw on that gave us 
the results that we were always hoping.

1257
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,990
I mean,
I think that really is a kid that he was

1258
01:00:45,991 --> 01:00:47,440
happy,
he was smiling.

1259
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:52,720
He had lost that for so long and it was 
so sad and wondered if we'd ever seen it

1260
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:57,721
again.
It just feels like I have more control 

1261
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,790
to help my son instead of the baby on 
Dr.

1262
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:04,790
May have the best intentions with Sam.
I want to do what's best for my son.

1263
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,490
For him.

1264
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,240
One important notes that Sam's parents 
tell us that they have followed the 

1265
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,601
letter of the law regarding his 
medication and that they've wrote only 

1266
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:22,900
the amounts of marijuana that prompts 
you.

1267
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,730
15 allows the medication is for Sam and 
for nobody else.

1268
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,910
Now,
Sharon,

1269
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,660
does he?
Does he take his medication every single

1270
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:32,320
day?
You know,

1271
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,390
they,
they started off at 7:00

1272
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:39,391
in the morning he was going to get,
then they would give him a second dose 

1273
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,791
in the afternoon,
but after two years it started as an 

1274
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:41,791
eight.
He's now 10.

1275
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:44,980
They sometimes don't have to give it to 
him and only give it to them as needed,

1276
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:49,981
which is incredible.
It really has changed his behavior 

1277
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:49,981
according to them.
Alright,

1278
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:51,090
sure.
Terrific story.

1279
01:01:51,091 --> 01:01:56,091
Thank you for the reporting.

I'm

1282
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:06,230
sure you'll find shares report to the 
American Academy of Pediatrics.

1283
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:13,860
I want to party with that kid.
I was listening to this online last 

1284
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:13,860
night.
Dr.

1285
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:18,040
Drew was on and he was talking about 
marijuana and how he was just so.

1286
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,120
He's just always

1287
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,540
fight that.
He's like,

1288
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,220
they're just,
they're just dumb.

1289
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,970
People were so silly about his take on 
marijuana,

1290
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,330
medical marijuana,
people that want medical marijuana.

1291
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:35,331
He thinks they're silly and they're 
ruining America and he thinks that all 

1292
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:37,881
drugs are bad.
That the one state of mind and state of 

1293
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:37,881
mind that you're currently in is the 
only one.

1294
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,630
He shouldn't be drunk.
You shouldn't be high.

1295
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,150
You shouldn't be drugged up.
He does not get it.

1296
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:47,151
That is not true.
There are drugs that are terrible for 

1297
01:02:47,151 --> 01:02:47,151
you.
The ones that you see on his show,

1298
01:02:47,151 --> 01:02:49,550
the crystal Meth,
the fucking heroin and Oxycontin,

1299
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,250
those are all fucking horrible for you.
That's a guarantee.

1300
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:56,030
But zoloft.
Well,

1301
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,520
for some people it's not.
I don't know.

1302
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:03,530
You have to ask him,
but the what he says about marijuana is 

1303
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,050
ridiculous because he lumps marijuana in
with like heroin and drugs.

1304
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:06,580
Yeah.
It's.

1305
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:12,590
I'd rather get my kids.
There's so much proof that it's not 

1306
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,020
addictive and it's like my argument 
about it,

1307
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:15,790
it's like anything can be addictive.
You can get addicted to cheeseburgers.

1308
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,600
If you're a fucking retard,
you could be one of those dudes who gets

1309
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,250
addicted to Washington,
his hands.

1310
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,830
You know,
people become compulsive.

1311
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,780
Bullshit.
Perfect example.

1312
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,710
People get addicted to things,
van.

1313
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:31,711
That's what we do.
It doesn't mean you shouldn't have the 

1314
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:31,711
things have other people telling you 
they'd benefit from it.

1315
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:33,720
That's what's fucking stupid about this 
whole marijuana thing.

1316
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,720
There's no heroin activists.
There's no,

1317
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,220
you know,
there's no crystal Meth,

1318
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,270
uh,
activists.

1319
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:44,271
There's like,
you've got to get on crystal meth or 

1320
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:44,271
heroin,
but people keep telling you that weed as

1321
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:46,590
enhance their lives and help the way 
they think and made them a better person

1322
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:48,720
and that fuck doesn't want to believe 
that dude in the,

1323
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:53,721
uh,
in the article was that Commerce 

1324
01:03:53,721 --> 01:03:56,610
Margaret magazine article in Fortune,
Fortune magazine.

1325
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:58,450
Yeah.
The one dude was on the case the first,

1326
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:01,290
like six people case study.
He said he's never gotten high,

1327
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,180
but he smokes it constantly,
all day long.

1328
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,370
All it helps us with is like arthritis
