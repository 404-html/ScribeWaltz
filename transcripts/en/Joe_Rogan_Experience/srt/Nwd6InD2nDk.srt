1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,480
Well good already.
Damn.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,950
I didn't even see a countdown.
Jamie,

3
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:07,660
you're so fast.
Uh,

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,501
thanks for doing this,
mark.

5
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,730
Appreciate it man.
Totally.

6
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,770
My pleasure.
I've enjoyed your tweets.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,730
I've checked out your website and mark's
Daily Apple and,

8
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:17,140
uh,
all of your,

9
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:17,974
uh,
the different rules for the primal 

10
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:20,584
blueprint.
And I found this really fascinating 

11
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,100
because,
um,

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,010
it seems really straightforward.
It seems like,

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,873
oh,
well this makes like eat lots of 

14
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:30,304
animals,
insects and plants move around a lot at 

15
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:33,670
a slow pace,
lift heavy,

16
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:34,504
things run really fast.
But what you've done essentially is 

17
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:41,320
created a guideline for optimizing your 
health and your body.

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,630
Yeah.
Um,

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,463
you know,
I've always wanted to be healthy from a 

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,270
really early age,
like 12 or 13 and a read a lot of books.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,460
Uh,
wanted to do the right thing.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,230
Um,
tried to figure out the,

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,720
the hacks,
uh,

24
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,500
before they were called hacks and got to
the point where I was,

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,703
you know,
I was doing a lot of running because 

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,090
aerobics was supposedly going to make 
you live longer.

27
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,923
I was eating complex carbohydrates and a
ton of them in order to fuel the 

28
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:08,974
aerobics.
I became a pretty good a endurance 

29
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,390
athlete,
but I fell apart,

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,303
uh,
as a result of the training and the 

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,863
result it turns out of the Diet.
So the Diet was very proinflammatory as 

32
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,750
we say.
So I started doing research into,

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,530
uh,
the ways in which I could re access this

34
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,080
health that I was seeking from the early
age,

35
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,573
uh,
and not fall apart and not be decrepit 

36
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,670
and beat up.
Uh,

37
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,580
and this became my mantra is how can I 
be strong,

38
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,414
lean,
and fit and healthy with the least 

39
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,760
amount of pain,
suffering,

40
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:41,950
sacrifice,
discipline,

41
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,870
calorie counting,
portion control,

42
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,123
and everything else.
And where it led me was down this path 

43
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,820
of looking at human evolution and how we
got to where we are today,

44
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:52,654
how we derived this genetic recipe that 
we all have that wants us to be strong 

45
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:58,504
and fit,
combining the research only in the last 

46
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,610
10 or 15 years,
uh,

47
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,503
with the modern genome [inaudible] 
sequencing the genome and figuring out 

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,990
the actual mechanism of how lifestyle 
behaviors and foods and sun exposure and

49
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,310
sleep turn genes on or off.

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,613
Uh,
and they can turn on genes that make us 

51
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,663
a strong and build muscle.
They can turn on genes that burn fat 

52
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,070
more efficiently,
then say glucose.

53
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,930
Uh,
they could turn off genes that caused us

54
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,250
to be moody and depressed,
turn off,

55
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:29,370
Geez,
it might predispose us to,

56
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,670
um,
to get cancer.

57
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,270
And when I arrived at was sort of a 
simple set of guidelines.

58
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,104
He's 10 primal blueprint laws that not 
ironically emulate a human nature and 

59
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:44,560
human behavior for the first two and a 
half million years of our existence.

60
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,663
So the genome was,
was forged in this crucible of eat 

61
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,550
plants and animals,
uh,

62
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,850
avoid poisonous things,
move around a lot.

63
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,950
At a low level activity.
Sprint once in a while,

64
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,784
lift heavy things.
Every human that ever lived up until 

65
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,790
10,000 years ago did that every single 
day.

66
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,624
And that's how those genes got passed 
along to the next generation to become 

67
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,064
us.

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,023
Where we've screwed up is in the last,
certainly the last couple of hundred 

69
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
years,
but starting 10,000 years ago with a 

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,833
agriculture,
we went from being a hunter gatherers 

71
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,043
and moving around a lot to being 
sedentary and sitting in one place and 

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,980
uh,
eating processed foods.

73
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,390
Um,
uh,

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,080
not terry,
not disposing of our waste.

75
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,951
Uh,
lots of,

76
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:30,784
lots of little things that sort of 
conspired to make us a smaller and 

77
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,734
weaker and more susceptible to disease.
So you were involved in triathletes and 

78
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,600
endurance activities which kind of break
down your body.

79
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,990
That's one of the big issues that a lot 
of people have with,

80
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,200
uh,
with that kind of training.

81
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,930
It's just constant and brutal and that's
catabolic.

82
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,091
It's,
it's,

83
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:51,890
uh,
you know,

84
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,990
it's a,
it's a great pursuit.

85
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,660
I wouldn't take back my years as an 
endurance athlete.

86
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,494
I was a marathoner in the 70s,
and then it was a triathlete in the 

87
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,810
early days of triathlon and the,
uh,

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,660
all throughout the 80s.

89
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,900
But the training was a,
it's devastating.

90
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,610
It really does tear you down.
And you,

91
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,923
the assumption was at the,
at the time that you had to put more 

92
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,720
miles in than anyone else to be one of 
the best.

93
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,970
You had to,
uh,

94
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,120
you know,
dial everything down.

95
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,100
You had to work harder.
You had to suffer more.

96
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,910
It had to struggle more to achieve 
greatness or to,

97
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,070
or to win races.
Um,

98
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,720
what we've discovered in the last five 
years is that it doesn't have to be that

99
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,580
way.
How crazy is that?

100
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,390
That it's only the last five years?
I mean,

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,720
we're talking 2010,
2011.

102
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,940
Yeah.
Um,

103
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,630
so you know,
a lot of this,

104
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,790
uh,
this new paradigm is based on science.

105
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,040
It's been brewing for 40 years,
but it wasn't the,

106
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,970
the findings weren't palatable to most 
of the athletes who are training.

107
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,900
They certainly weren't palatable.

108
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,900
The coaches who'd had been invested in 
training a certain way,

109
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,630
putting it a lot of miles,
eating lots of carbohydrates,

110
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,860
managing glycogen throughout an event,
uh,

111
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,490
which meant not only,
um,

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,590
carbohydrate loading the night before a 
race,

113
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,424
but seeing how many gel packs you could 
slam down in an hour to keep the sugar 

114
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,000
burn throughput going.
Uh,

115
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:13,720
and that's certainly what my generation 
of athletes,

116
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,610
uh,
wound up depending on.

117
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,110
And,
and we all trained that way and it,

118
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,090
and it was sort of,
um,

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,193
it was counterintuitive to think that 
you could learn how to burn fat as much 

120
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,314
more efficiently,
that you could possibly go faster by 

121
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:26,554
going slower under certain circumstances
that you could spend time in the gym 

122
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,930
doing heavyweights and have that 
manifest itself in a,

123
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,340
in,
in better endurance.

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,233
So these,
these later sort of developments that 

125
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:43,030
come out of the laboratory and come out 
of the clinical studies,

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,553
you know,
they were sort of interesting to the 

127
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,890
people who are reading them,
who knew how to read the studies,

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,700
but it didn't make it into the 
mainstream a training mechanism.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What was the science based on where the,
where people had used carbo loading carb

130
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:58,220
loading

131
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,910
and using all those gel packs and eating
a lot of pastas and stuff.

132
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,990
Wait,
where did that come from?

133
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,160
Like what,
what was the,

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,390
the idea behind that?

135
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,550
Um,
it was,

136
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,810
that came from studies that they go back
into the 30s and forties,

137
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:11,644
but it was basically this notion that 
the body needs to burn glucose to go 

138
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,120
fast.
Uh,

139
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,103
that it,
it was assumed that you couldn't burn 

140
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:26,020
fat at a high rate of throughput.
And if you couldn't burn fat,

141
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,940
then the only thing he could do was 
manage your glycogen.

142
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,990
There's muscles can store four or 500 
grams of glycogen Max,

143
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,290
which is only enough to run 20 miles,
let's say.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Um,
and uh,

145
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,210
if you couldn't,
so you,

146
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,140
you had to learn how to manage that 
glycogen so he didn't deplete it in a,

147
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,180
in a marathon for instance.
So you'd hit the wall at 20 miles.

148
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,220
So how'd you get through the wall?
Well,

149
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:49,750
you start to learn how to,
I mean,

150
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,584
gatorade became out of the science.
The gatorade was the great first real 

151
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,580
performance enhancing substance that 
athletes used.

152
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,580
You could drink this sugary drink that 
had salt in it in a race and um,

153
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,860
and then stave off that wall a couple of
more miles.

154
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,800
So for years,
for decades,

155
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,663
um,
the science revolved around a 

156
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,880
continually try to continuing to try to 
figure out how to manage glycogen.

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,640
So Tim noakes,
Professor Tim noakes out of South Africa

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,833
was the go to guy in this.
He wrote a book called the Lore of 

159
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,680
running.
It's a 900 page tome.

160
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,660
He,
he was the,

161
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:26,494
um,
the source that everyone's cited for 

162
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,133
decades when it came to carbohydrate 
intake and glycogen management and all 

163
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:37,390
of the things that had to do with fuel 
partitioning during an endurance event.

164
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,460
And about five years ago,
he looked at the research partly because

165
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:47,170
he was,
he'd been a runner himself.

166
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,213
He'd been employing this same strategy 
of carbohydrate intake and carbohydrate 

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,720
management.
Uh,

168
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,520
but he was a type two diabetic.
He'd become,

169
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,190
he had become,
despite his training,

170
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,080
a type two diabetic.
Um,

171
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,510
I think his uncle and his father had 
died as type two diabetics.

172
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,610
So he,
you know,

173
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,444
he got the fear of God put it in him and
he started to re evaluate the research 

174
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,400
and he literally had an epiphany.
He goes,

175
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,234
Oh my God,
I've been,

176
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,373
I'm the guy that's been promoting this 
way of training for decades and now I 

177
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,980
have to completely change my,
my,

178
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,040
my opinion on it and say,
what I told you was wrong.

179
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,233
And the body is developed and was 
designed to be a great fat burning 

180
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:27,844
machine and not rely so much on 
carbohydrate and not rely so much on 

181
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,170
glycogen or glucose.

182
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,643
Um,
and the guy is taking so much shit for 

183
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,444
it in South Africa.
They like trying to run him out of the 

184
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,170
country.
There's a trial going on right now.

185
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,750
Oh yeah.
Here's a professor Tim noakes.

186
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,880
And in my mind,
that's the epitome of a heroic science,

187
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,470
a man of science.
He,

188
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,393
he's gone down a path.
He's dedicated his life to being the 

189
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,670
guy.
And then he,

190
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,650
he looks at the research and he goes,
Holy Shit,

191
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,910
I,
I messed up.

192
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,750
This is terrible.
I,

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,733
you know,
I've been telling you the wrong thing 

194
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:03,114
and I'm willing to,
to basically fall on my sword and tell 

195
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,470
you that because it's this new 
revelation is the truth.

196
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,420
Well,
that's how it's supposed to be,

197
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,051
right?
I mean,

198
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:13,884
that's what science is supposed to be.
It's not supposed to be relying on this 

199
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,530
bad information just because you've 
taught it to people.

200
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,300
It's supposed to be,
you find the new data,

201
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,670
the new data doesn't correspond with the
old data.

202
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,900
You have to let everybody know.
I sound that it's like,

203
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,570
you know,
that's like Unicorn farts.

204
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,890
I mean it's,
it's a really,

205
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,180
science is,
is kind of dirty and,

206
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,014
and uh,
and messy and there are no black and 

207
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,040
whites in science.
There's no absolutes.

208
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,040
There no is no right or wrong answer.
They're just theories and opinions going

209
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,874
forward.
And if you're a scientist who's had an 

210
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,070
investment in your life's work being one
way,

211
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,503
you're going to,
you're going to defend that position 

212
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,473
even sometimes in the face of new new 
information that that really becomes a 

213
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,440
huge issue when they deny information 
just because it's bad for their ego.

214
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,360
And just because it's bad for their 
career and they can just,

215
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,961
I mean,
he can,

216
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,970
I'm sure have just kept his mouth shut 
and just coasted and everything would've

217
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,813
been fine.

218
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,743
It,
uh,

219
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,540
well it would have been fine for awhile,
but they,

220
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,520
the coroner had been rounded.
I mean,

221
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,980
enough other scientists,
uh,

222
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,200
had,
had started to look at this and I,

223
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,453
you know,
he,

224
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,350
uh,
he cited me as one of his influences in,

225
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:22,350
in helping to turn that corner.
But here's a guy,

226
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,260
he was reading my blog posts and sort 
of,

227
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,311
you know,
having,

228
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,050
uh,
uh,

229
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,883
a new perspective cast upon his 
information and was willing to look at 

230
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,184
some of the research that I,
and Rob Wolf and a number of other 

231
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,830
bloggers in the new,
in the emerging Paleo sphere.

232
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:39,330
We're talking about that,
that we are,

233
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,860
um,
we're born to,

234
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,160
to excel at burning fat and we shouldn't
have to depend on sugar.

235
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,370
And in fact,
the less sugar we burn in a lifetime,

236
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:52,371
it probably the better off we are.
So for the longest time when people were

237
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:55,080
doing all this carbo loading and when 
they were,

238
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:55,914
I'm just following the old methods,
they were creating extra inflammation 

239
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,990
because of this food.

240
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,640
I mean this,
the,

241
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,160
the,
the,

242
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,290
when you're talking about simple 
carbohydrates,

243
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,590
pasta and bread and such,
they cause inflammation.

244
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,424
Correct.
So sugar is proinflammatory if you have 

245
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,360
high blood sugar levels that causes 
inflammation.

246
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:17,670
And if you are,
when you say that to people,

247
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,210
like explain to me what,
what do you mean by inflammation mean?

248
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,810
Like joint inflammation?
So,

249
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,610
um,
good question.

250
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,970
So inflammation is a process in the body
that's designed to deal with an insult.

251
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
So he twisted ankle,
um,

252
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,810
and inflammatory process begins the,
uh,

253
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,780
the ankle swells up because a water 
accumulates there.

254
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,650
The cells are being,
uh,

255
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,510
partly protected by the,
the water,

256
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,573
uh,
white blood cells rush to it to try and 

257
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,680
assess the damage and fix it,
repair some of the damage.

258
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,813
Uh,
there's a a long process where the 

259
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,710
temperature of the localized temperature
of the areas raised.

260
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,410
Um,
all of this is contemplated to deal with

261
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:01,411
a short term insult that hopefully over 
time it repairs.

262
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,063
Um,
in many cases it repairs even stronger 

263
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,380
than it was before.
You know,

264
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,214
you break a bone.
And sometimes that where it broke his 

265
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,520
stronger,
um,

266
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,800
or a callous is an example of a,
you know,

267
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:16,801
a stronger skin from having been 
irritated but the same.

268
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,183
And we can,
the same sort of process happens if you 

269
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:24,220
get a bacterial insult.
If you get a microbial insult,

270
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,313
you know,
you get infected with somebody and 

271
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,040
something and uh,
maybe by somebody and you get,

272
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,360
uh,
uh,

273
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,450
and there's a,
there's a reaction to that infection.

274
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,790
Um,
and it may happen in the bloodstream if,

275
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,703
if the,
if the bacteria goes into the 

276
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,760
bloodstream,
then there's a,

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,953
there's a response to that which,
which is an inflammation and 

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,810
inflammatory response.
Uh,

279
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,510
now if you,
uh,

280
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,640
and by the way,
a lot of this happens as a result of,

281
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,700
of genes within cells being turned on or
off based on signals they get from their

282
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,604
immediate environment.

283
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,623
So genes don't work in a vacuum.
Something has to turn the gene on or 

284
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,190
off.
Something has to give the reason,

285
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,100
the gene reason to build a protein or 
have whatever action.

286
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,110
It's going to have.
So when you've got,

287
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,690
um,
let's,

288
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,520
so now let's go back to the food 
analogy.

289
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:14,410
You've got certain foods that you can 
eat that cause the body to,

290
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,430
um,
to initiate an inflammatory us,

291
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,300
what we call a systemic inflammatory 
response.

292
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,380
It just,
it just,

293
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,473
uh,
maybe emulate something that would've 

294
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,170
happened in an infection,
but now it's caused by an over abundance

295
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,004
of a maaco sits omega six fatty acids.
So you're literally turning on genes 

296
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,440
that are causing a systemic 
inflammation.

297
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,910
Now,
over time,

298
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:34,711
um,
in,

299
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:36,670
in the short term,
not a big deal,

300
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:37,920
one meal here,
uh,

301
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,793
you know,
some,

302
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,360
uh,
some,

303
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,650
uh,
temporary insult,

304
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:42,910
not a big deal,
but over time,

305
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:46,030
if your diet is such that you're 
continuously,

306
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,383
um,
presenting these sorts of foods that 

307
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:53,650
would prompt inflammatory genes to turn 
on,

308
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,693
you get what,
what is known as an inflammatory 

309
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:56,500
response.

310
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,570
Now,
um,

311
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,210
sugar has that response.
A refined grains can have that response.

312
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,480
Sometimes even whole grains because of 
the,

313
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,793
uh,
there's portions of the grain that we 

314
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,460
say are natural,
but they're actually,

315
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
um,
uh,

316
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,460
there,
there's slightly toxic to the body.

317
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,773
Uh,
the industrial seed oils that are 

318
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,380
pervasive in our diet,
that would be,

319
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,191
you know,
corn oil,

320
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,560
soybean oil,
canola oil.

321
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,950
All of these can have the effect of 
causing a systemic inflammation,

322
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,000
that systemic inflammatory response in 
the body.

323
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,770
Uh,
when,

324
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,230
and a lot of times you'll see like 
you'll see it,

325
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,520
you look at the biggest loser and you 
go,

326
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,790
God,
that dude lost 25 pounds the first week.

327
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,130
That's unbelievable.
How do you do that?

328
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,860
How do you burn off that much fat?
They don't burn off that much fat.

329
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,694
They lose that much water because by re,
by eliminating the proinflammatory 

330
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,850
foods,
the inflammation,

331
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:52,010
the systemic inflammation that was 
causing them to carry literally 30 or 40

332
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:52,844
or 50 pounds of excess water,
that causes of inflammation goes away 

333
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,200
and the water goes away.

334
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,333
The swelling goes down.
So you could look at the cause of heart 

335
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,394
disease.
Heart disease isn't caused by 

336
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,134
cholesterol or saturated fat.
It's the proximate cause of heart 

337
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:13,490
disease as we know it today is systemic 
inflammation.

338
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:16,250
It's an inflammatory response in the,
you know,

339
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,540
in the,
in the blood vessels.

340
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,450
So when you,
when you say someone looks puffy.

341
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,550
Yeah.
Like people who drink a lot of alcohol,

342
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,870
they start looking puffy.
That's lit.

343
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
That's actually literally,
they're,

344
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,830
they're inflamed.
We get water.

345
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,341
Yeah.
They're,

346
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,070
they're retaining water as a result of 
an inflammatory response.

347
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,050
The body is having.
So,

348
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,430
um,
where we went to that from training,

349
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,380
um,
I don't,

350
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,070
I don't know how we,
how we get down that road,

351
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:40,904
but the idea of,
of eliminating these proinflammatory 

352
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,680
foods,
um,

353
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,270
oh,
so I'll tell you where it went.

354
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,650
I had arthritis in my feet at the age of
27,

355
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,543
28.

356
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,653
Uh,
I had to smile this hard running and 

357
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,640
biking and from the Diet because I had 
this systemic inflammation,

358
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,663
right?
I had this diet that was promoting an 

359
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,500
inflammatory response throughout my 
body,

360
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:06,590
not just in the ankle that I might have 
just twisted or whatever.

361
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,001
Uh,
I had,

362
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,940
um,
uh,

363
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,200
I had arthritis in my hands when I was 
even into my,

364
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,953
um,
even after I cleaned most of my diet up 

365
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,293
into my forties,
I had arthritis in my hands or my 

366
00:16:18,861 --> 00:16:23,000
fingers that I thought was just a normal
artifact of getting old.

367
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,590
And the last thing that I eliminated 
from my diet was grains,

368
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,890
which I found were causing,
were a huge cause of issue for me.

369
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,030
When I got rid of grains,
the arthritis in my fingers went away.

370
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,030
All grains,
sprouted grains as well at zeal bread.

371
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,020
Yeah,
I mean,

372
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,160
you know,
yes,

373
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,490
yes.

374
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,290
Let's,
for purposes of this conversation,

375
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,530
let's say all grains and then we'll talk
about what that means over time.

376
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,850
But I'm getting rid of all grains.
Uh,

377
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,463
I got rid of,
I had irritable bowel syndrome most of 

378
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,140
my life that I thought was because I was
a type a stress ladened individual.

379
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,130
It couldn't handle it well.
Um,

380
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,850
and that literally that ibs had run my 
life.

381
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,710
Um,
that went away.

382
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,030
The,
um,

383
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,733
the upper,
upper respiratory tract infections I 

384
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:11,030
would get several times a year went 
away.

385
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:11,923
Uh,
I had lingering sinus infections after 

386
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,150
I'd have an upper respiratory tract 
infections that those one way and I,

387
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,063
all these things I'd assumed were just a
normal artifact of being human and 

388
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,764
getting older and part of life.
It doesn't everybody suffer these 

389
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:28,790
things.
They went away.

390
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:33,530
And that was a real epiphany for me to,
to realize it.

391
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,160
If I had made,
um,

392
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,110
I'm basically a researcher and if I had 
done all the research and still defended

393
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,370
my right to eat grains in the,
in the face of the research I was doing,

394
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,280
how many tens of millions of people you 
know,

395
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,290
might be effected by this.
So,

396
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,760
and I don't want this to an anti grain 
crusade today,

397
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,594
but I'm,
I'm,

398
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,710
I'm sort of suggesting that a lot of 
what happens to us in a,

399
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,160
in life,
um,

400
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,063
certainly a lot of the root cause of 
illness or the beginning etiology of 

401
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,030
disease,
um,

402
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,980
has deep roots in what we eat or 
sometimes more importantly,

403
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,814
what we don't eat.

404
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,710
One of the things you said,
I think this is really fascinating,

405
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:12,544
is turning genes on and off.
And for most people like me who don't 

406
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:21,250
have background in medical science and 
don't necessarily understand genes,

407
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,570
the idea of genes being turned on or off
by lifestyle,

408
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,690
by a dietary choices,
things along those lines.

409
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,100
It just doesn't make any sense to 
people.

410
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:30,510
They go,
well,

411
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,880
no,
no,

412
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,890
you got your genes so you don't got your
jeans.

413
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:33,724
You know,
he gave the got red hair or you got big 

414
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,990
feet and that's genetic and that's it.
No,

415
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,033
exactly right.
So,

416
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,053
so yeah,
there is a huge assumption that the 

417
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,940
genes are finished when we're born.
Right.

418
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:43,774
You know,
and then we just grow and we have our 

419
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:46,060
eyes and we're,
we're,

420
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,240
we're doomed to be 50 pounds overweight 
because our parents are,

421
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:51,340
or we're doomed to get breast cancer 
because her mother did.

422
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,970
Or,
um,

423
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,280
genes are at work every second of every 
day.

424
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,660
Uh,
rebuilding,

425
00:18:58,661 --> 00:18:59,950
renewing,
regenerating,

426
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,920
recreating us based on the signals that 
they get.

427
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:07,120
So jeans are these little switches,
it that cause the production of proteins

428
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,860
that actually run our body.
So it's a proteins.

429
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:09,694
They make a that run our body,
whether it's muscle protein being built 

430
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,190
or whether its enzymes to cause certain 
reactions to take place.

431
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,840
And um,
and the jeans,

432
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,093
uh,
are basically not doing anything until 

433
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,990
they get a signal from the environment.
Now,

434
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,250
the,
when I see the environment,

435
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,653
um,
it might start from what we perceive as 

436
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:28,984
the outside environment,
but eventually it's a biochemical 

437
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:32,440
signal,
uh,

438
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,393
or some sensation,
some transmission of information that 

439
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,044
gets through the cell to the genes 
themselves and causes a gene to turn on 

440
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,110
the switch to turn on the protein to be 
built.

441
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,490
And that manifests itself in whatever 
that gene is assigned to do.

442
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,193
Uh,
so the beauty of the primal blueprint 

443
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,283
and the lifestyle that I've been 
promoting for 10 or 15 years is this 

444
00:19:56,831 --> 00:20:01,060
notion that we can discover these hidden
genetic switches that we all have.

445
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,170
And we can make choices in our lives 
that direct us in a,

446
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,013
in a direction of health versus down 
this slippery slope of illness and 

447
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,770
disease and,
and falling apart.

448
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,900
Um,
they're,

449
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,300
uh,
they're not right or wrong.

450
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:17,890
They're not good or bad.
They're not black or white.

451
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:18,724
They're just choices.
And I'm not going to criticize you for 

452
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:21,544
making whatever choices you make.
My job as a blogger and certainly a 

453
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,983
running mark's daily apple and writing 
the books that I write is to offer you 

454
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,100
some,
some,

455
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,090
uh,
educated choices that you might elect to

456
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:37,240
undertake based on what you tell me your
goals are.

457
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,160
So,
you know,

458
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,891
if you say,
well,

459
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,710
I want to lose weight and I'm want to 
get stronger and I want to,

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,650
you know,
uh,

461
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,930
maybe participate in a five k we can 
look at a number of different,

462
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,243
whether their dietary and I mean they,
the more the better because all of the 

463
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,684
strategy will have some impact,
but there's certain foods you can eat 

464
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:57,370
that will cause you to become better at 
burning fat,

465
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,833
uh,
and will cause you to burn two to build 

466
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:01,654
muscle,
uh,

467
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,640
more effectively.
Um,

468
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,803
there's an amount of sleep that you'll 
get that will reduce the amount of 

469
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:10,510
cortisol that you secrete.
Cortisol is an adrenal hormone,

470
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,120
uh,
that we secreted in response to stress.

471
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,090
Cortisol tends to make us carry a little
bit of extra weight,

472
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,740
some of us.
So if I can reduce,

473
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,250
if I can increase my sleep and improve 
my sleep patterns,

474
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,840
uh,
and reduce cortisol,

475
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
it all has effect an effect back at the 
gene level,

476
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,190
uh,
to,

477
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,950
uh,
to,

478
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,430
to get me closer to where I want to get,
want to be.

479
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,940
How much do you sleep?
Um,

480
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,280
probably nine,
eight and a half to nine hours a night.

481
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,330
Wow.
Yeah.

482
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,080
They say wow,
because that's a lot or that's,

483
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,923
that's a lot.
Yeah.

484
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,021
Um,
you know,

485
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:41,854
I have friends who,
who brag about getting 10 and make no 

486
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,150
apologies for it.
Um,

487
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,710
and,
and almost more,

488
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,470
more importantly is the consistency of 
sleep.

489
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,830
So I don't like to stay up late because 
I wake up early,

490
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:55,840
I wake up the same time every day.
So if I stay up late,

491
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,640
you wake up six 30,
you one of those,

492
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,380
get out of the house and go run around.
No,

493
00:21:59,381 --> 00:21:59,880
no,
no.

494
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,840
I'm a no.
I,

495
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,270
I sort of Mosey on down to the coffee 
pot,

496
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,810
make a pot of coffee and read the paper 
and you know,

497
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,653
I ease into the day and I typically hit 
the gym around nine 30 or or go paddle 

498
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,360
or whatever it is I'm going to do for 
the day.

499
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,830
I don't do it first thing in the 
morning.

500
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,190
I want to be kind of refresh for it and 
ready for it.

501
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,373
Um,
but then we can talk about sun exposure 

502
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:21,671
and we can say,
well,

503
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,504
you know,
so many people are Vitamin d deficient 

504
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,303
and uh,
they've been that way because 

505
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,260
conventional wisdom has suggested that 
they stay out of the sun,

506
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,370
that the sun is bad for you.
That any amount of sun exposure is,

507
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,453
you know,
is going to cause you to get or 

508
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,180
predispose you to getting cancer.
Well,

509
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,163
what we say in the Paleo community is 
they're probably more people who have 

510
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:41,344
gotten cancer from having avoided the 
sun than ever got cancer from too much 

511
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,320
sun.
And the reason I say that is because sun

512
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:51,190
exposure,
uvb light is what?

513
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,024
That's the stimulus that causes 
cholesterol in the skin to convert to 

514
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:56,314
vitamin D.
And vitamin D is one of the most 

515
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,130
important vitamins that she actually 
should be a hormone.

516
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,840
It's a,
but at one of the,

517
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,540
one of the implications is that vitamin 
D is,

518
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,850
is strongly involved in cancer 
prevention.

519
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:09,130
So the more vitamin D you have,
the more,

520
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,173
the less risk,
the lower risk you have for most 

521
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:12,304
cancers.
Isn't the issue with people sun damage 

522
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,630
though?
The issue is no,

523
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,440
exactly.
So if you go out and get sun burned,

524
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,270
and I've never advocated that,
but,

525
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,240
but there's a difference between 
spending a little,

526
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,163
a little bit of time in the sun 
unprotected and going in and putting on 

527
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,274
a shirt or even if you want to stay out 
putting on some sunscreen at that point 

528
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,160
versus,
you know,

529
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,030
just uh,
rubbing baby oil and us and a,

530
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,831
what was it?
Iodine.

531
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:40,030
We used to put back in New England and 
there was very little sons.

532
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:42,460
They had to get a cram for that.
Suntan.

533
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,600
I had dine.

534
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Huh?
I didn't know that.

535
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,550
No,
I did baby oil.

536
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,040
Baby oil with iodine was even,
it was like a,

537
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,240
it turbocharge.
It was like,

538
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,253
it was like the,
it was like the buttered coffee of 

539
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,260
Suntan Lotion.
That's what that stuff is.

540
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:58,540
Yeah.
What's the mechanism behind iodine?

541
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,960
Like how does that show?
I don't even know.

542
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,460
I don't even know.
But that was the,

543
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,810
again,
that was the old wives' tale.

544
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,683
Conventional.
Okay.

545
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,160
I went,
I was worst burn I ever got.

546
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,510
Um,
uh,

547
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:09,344
it was a winter break or spring break.
I went to Williams college in Western 

548
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:13,634
mass.
We drove from Williamstown to Fort 

549
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,750
Lauderdale,
straight through,

550
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,573
straight through,
uh,

551
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,490
in a BMW 2002.
There wasn't great little car,

552
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,700
great car.
Four of us smell like a goat farm by the

553
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,460
time he got down there and,
uh,

554
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,710
fell asleep on the beach at nine o'clock
in the morning and then just burned to a

555
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:35,330
crawl from zero sun exposure,
you know,

556
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:37,230
all winter,
um,

557
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,760
all the way down to Florida,
all the way down the beach barbecue.

558
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,880
There you go.
Wow.

559
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,333
Yeah.
That doesn't sound like it's 

560
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,690
recommended.
Nope.

561
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,973
Um,
now just just to clarify a inflammatory 

562
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,060
response.
So when you're eating grains,

563
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:55,490
like say if you're reading a lot of 
pastas and things along those lines,

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,530
what exactly is happening that's causing
an inflammatory response?

565
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,810
Your body's processing the,
the gains.

566
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,600
And so pasta,
bread,

567
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,730
um,
a lot of cereals,

568
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,590
especially the processed cereals,
sugars,

569
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,250
they,
well,

570
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,350
so,
so those grains turn into sugar.

571
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:13,184
I mean,
they turned to glucose like really 

572
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,610
rapidly.
As soon as they hit your,

573
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,210
your gut and the body doesn't really 
know which glucose,

574
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,044
it doesn't know the difference,
whether it doesn't know the difference 

575
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:25,580
in a bowl of skittles producing the 
glucose and a loaf of bread,

576
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,830
it's just,
it's just glucose to the body.

577
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,920
So if you raise that level high enough,
um,

578
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,270
you will have some issues.
Now,

579
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,104
if you,
if you introduce high fructose corn 

580
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:35,721
Syrup,
which is,

581
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,680
uh,
which is,

582
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:37,190
uh,
uh,

583
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,560
you know,
uh,

584
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,560
frankenfood created in the 70s to um,
to provide sweetness at a lower cost,

585
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
uh,
typically coming from corn,

586
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,000
uh,
now you've,

587
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,690
you're introducing yet another variable,
another agent,

588
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,590
because a fruit toast in and of itself 
is,

589
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,330
is a somewhat inflammatory.

590
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,390
So this is,
uh,

591
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,170
that's the,
that's the,

592
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,810
the glucose portion of what we're 
talking about here.

593
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:03,350
But then some of the grains have what we
call these anti nutrients in them,

594
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,223
uh,
that may cause issues with some people 

595
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,273
in their gut may open the gut wall and 
cause it to literally leak fecal matter 

596
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,130
into the bloodstream.
Whoa.

597
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,143
Yeah.
So if you've heard of leaky gut 

598
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,140
syndrome,
um,

599
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,680
that's probably a reason why a lot of 
people,

600
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,923
uh,
have autoimmune diseases or at the very 

601
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:24,890
least a systemic inflammation.
That's fascinating.

602
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,250
And that's caused by your body 
processing too much glucose.

603
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,580
It's not caused by your body processing 
too much glucose as it is.

604
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,850
Uh,
it's a side effect of it.

605
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,713
Yeah.
There's a,

606
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,583
um,
because it's not the glucose it's 

607
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:42,371
causing that in that case is now we 
moved on from sugar and glucose being a,

608
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:45,720
a cause of inflammation to,
um,

609
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,603
uh,
certain elements in Ho let's say whole 

610
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:54,471
grains that turn on certain genes that 
cause certain responses,

611
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,554
one of which may be in some people to 
open the junction between the cells 

612
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:03,150
lining the gut and allow undigested food
particles,

613
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,043
shall we say.

614
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Uh,
to,

615
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,173
to enter the bloodstream.
Now the body sees those undigested food 

616
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,120
particles,
which the gut is only supposed to really

617
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,690
allow in a free fatty acid,
simple sugars.

618
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,100
Um,
and,

619
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:17,790
and,
uh,

620
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,840
you know,
uh,

621
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,740
amino acids,
single peptides die,

622
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,574
peptides may be,
but if you get a large undigested food 

623
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:26,700
particle in the bloodstream,
sometimes the body goes,

624
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:27,510
hey,
that's a,

625
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,343
that looks like a bacteria.
We better go get that thing and set up 

626
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:31,614
an or an immune response to it.
So you get an initial form of 

627
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:36,840
inflammation where the body's just 
saying,

628
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,674
look,
there's some foreign matter in the 

629
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,990
bloodstream.
We don't recognize it.

630
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,220
We're going to kill it.
And that's sort of bad enough in it,

631
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,650
in and of itself.
But if you,

632
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,790
if you,
um,

633
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,480
if that continues long enough for some 
people,

634
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,220
sometimes that,
uh,

635
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,690
inflammatory response that,
that immune response,

636
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,190
now it goes to look for similar 
molecules and it might see,

637
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,500
uh,
a,

638
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,510
a Beta cell and the pancreas and go,
oh,

639
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,344
that looks just like that other thing.
I just set up a response for let's go 

640
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,250
kill this.
Or it might do it with,

641
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,750
um,
the,

642
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,633
the,
um,

643
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,960
in cells and the joint,
the chondracytes in the joint.

644
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,090
And you may get rheumatoid arthritis as 
a result of it.

645
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,400
That's an autoimmune response to body 
set up,

646
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,070
setting up an immune response to itself.

647
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,520
So when you hear people talk about 
gluten sensitivity and you know,

648
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,470
people are trying to go gluten free,
do you think that a lot of,

649
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,723
a lot of what that is,
is the body responding to an excess of 

650
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:39,300
this glucose in the body,
uh,

651
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,340
excess of focus in the two different 
things.

652
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:43,530
So the glucose is one thing that the 
sugar is,

653
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,320
is what it is that from breaking down 
breads and Pastas or,

654
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,610
or candy or cakes or pies or um,
you know,

655
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,720
um,
snickers,

656
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:53,790
whatever it is,
our soft drinks,

657
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,770
which is a huge issue,
um,

658
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,410
cause softdrinks or,
or a large part of the problem.

659
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,560
But gluten is a different,
an entirely different mechanism.

660
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,210
Now we're talking about,
uh,

661
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,560
a protein,
a protein.

662
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,300
It's a plant protein is folded so 
densely that there,

663
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,600
the theory is that humans haven't had 
enough.

664
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,590
Most humans haven't had enough time to 
adapt to,

665
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,523
uh,
the digestion of that type of a 

666
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,360
molecule.
And as a result,

667
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,380
uh,
there,

668
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,230
it causes problems within the lining of 
the gut.

669
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,183
Right.
But what I was getting at was the p 

670
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,670
people always talk about having gluten 
sensitivity,

671
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,533
but really what you're saying is that a 
lot of what people are having issues 

672
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:36,190
with is these simple carbohydrates is 
like breads and pastas against,

673
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,400
sorry.
Sorry to be,

674
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,290
that's just,
there's like two parts to this equation,

675
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,040
right.
And

676
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,600
either part is kind of bad,
um,

677
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,560
and together they're kind of like,
why would you do that?

678
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,790
So,
so on the,

679
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,190
on the glucose side,
and it's just unfortunate.

680
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:54,160
Gluten and glucose have the first glu 
but they're not related.

681
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,320
So,
so on the Gluco side,

682
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:57,550
that's the sugar,
that's the,

683
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,680
that's the thing you want to avoid.
Partly because the,

684
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,514
one of the other things that happens is 
even if you don't have an inflammatory 

685
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:03,940
response,
it raises insulin.

686
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,803
Insulin is a,
is a storage hormone that tends to take 

687
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,014
every calorie you ate at the last meal 
in excessive what you needed and store 

688
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:12,880
it as fat.
Now,

689
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,220
if you're a skinny,
uh,

690
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,160
east African marathoner,
then you're going to burn it off.

691
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:18,994
But if you're a typical American eating 
couple hundred extra calories a day in 

692
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:25,300
the form of this sugar,
you tend to store it as body fat.

693
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,523
And if you haven't built a mechanism to 
burn off the body fat that causes 

694
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:31,870
problems over time,
that increases your risk for cancel,

695
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,704
that,
that increases your risk for heart 

696
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:33,874
disease.
That increases your risk for type two 

697
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:38,200
diabetes.
I don't think I have gluten sensitivity,

698
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:41,590
but I do know that when I went,
when I decided to go gluten free,

699
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,370
I kind of quit it after a while,
but I did it for about six months.

700
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,670
My face got thinner,
a lost body fat.

701
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,560
I had more energy,
I felt better.

702
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,270
And uh,
I attributed it.

703
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,880
I was trying to figure out what it was,
but I tried.

704
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,300
I don't think I have a gluten 
sensitivity.

705
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:58,980
I just attributed to the fact that 
eating all that pasta and breads and all

706
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,420
those things was just giving me all this
extra sugar,

707
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,910
eliminating that from my diet made a 
difference and that,

708
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:04,744
so that is the sort of the first line of
defense for a lot of people who want to 

709
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,440
lose weight.

710
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,010
It's just just by getting rid of those,
those foods,

711
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,530
and I want to say limiting yourself,
but you know,

712
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,450
including meat,
fish,

713
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,470
fowl,
eggs,

714
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:18,490
nuts,
seeds,

715
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,620
all the vegetables,
a little bit of fruit,

716
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,010
healthy fats,
oils and nuts.

717
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,540
Um,
you know,

718
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:28,300
that's a pretty nice plate of food that 
you can offer yourself up.

719
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,320
Um,
as long as you get rid of the,

720
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,870
the,
the carbohydrates,

721
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:32,704
the simple carbohydrates,
you're well on your way to re reducing 

722
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,030
the,
the excess body weight,

723
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,930
which includes the excess retain water 
in the fullness and the face and all the

724
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,773
things that we talk about.
Now if you give those up and you find 

725
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,200
that you,
that your joints work better or that you

726
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:48,034
have,
uh,

727
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,010
you know that your immune system works 
better,

728
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:54,040
you don't get sick as often,
which is what a lot of people notice.

729
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,700
Now we probably are looking at the fact 
that you might have some,

730
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,563
some level of sensitivity to gluten and 
gluten sensitivity exists on a spectrum 

731
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:05,500
of no problem at all to I'll die if I 
eat it.

732
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,040
And you could be anywhere in the middle 
anywhere on that spectrum.

733
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:13,120
I mean this again sort of the operative,
a mantra here,

734
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,080
no,
no right or wrong,

735
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:15,310
no black or white,
no,

736
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,930
no good or bad,
just choices.

737
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:21,010
But if you're a person who really wants 
to dig deep and kind of make those,

738
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,540
those changes that are going to get you 
closer to your goal quicker,

739
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,490
that might be a choice that you might 
look into.

740
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,713
So there's no right or wrong,
but there is a spectrum in terms of 

741
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,430
tolerance.
Your tolerance might be much better than

742
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,400
mine and some people just really 
shouldn't have it in the Diet at all.

743
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:37,234
Whether some people can have a fairly 
good amount of it and really not have 

744
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,110
too many issues.

745
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,821
Yeah.
We say what,

746
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:41,840
you know,
what can I get away with?

747
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,240
And that's,
that's sort of an interesting concept in

748
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,800
and of itself because people,
humans,

749
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,023
you know,
we tend to see what we can get away 

750
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:49,550
with.
You know,

751
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,020
you might save saves,
this is,

752
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,230
this is really good for me and,
um,

753
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,970
or this is really bad for me.
I'm never going to do it again.

754
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,670
But if I don't die from it and it,
there's no consequences,

755
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,210
then I'm going to take it right up to 
the edge and sometimes a little bit past

756
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:04,400
the edge.
So there are a lot of people who can get

757
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,340
away with eating a lot more 
carbohydrates than others,

758
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,630
even though they don't train hard and 
maybe not gained that much weight.

759
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,360
There are a lot of people who can get 
away with,

760
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,500
uh,
with consuming,

761
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,551
um,
you know,

762
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,750
Omega six oils and not get into that 
proinflammatory state as readily or as,

763
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,320
or as quickly.

764
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,360
You just,
you know,

765
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,720
as,
as Ronald Reagan said,

766
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,763
you know,
man's got to know his limitations or it 

767
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:26,840
was that dirty Harry,
one of the both.

768
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,340
But I think it was dirty Harry.
Yeah,

769
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,640
I think,
I think Reagan restated it later on,

770
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,440
but yeah,
so,

771
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:35,500
uh,
I was reading this article yesterday and

772
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:38,570
I talked about this yesterday in the 
podcast about this woman who,

773
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:39,404
uh,
she wrote this article about she's in 

774
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:41,264
her seventies and how her whole life 
people have been shaming her for being 

775
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:49,280
fat and she was sort of like trying to 
promote fat acceptance.

776
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,750
And you know,
and I,

777
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,310
when I,
when I see articles like that,

778
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,220
there's two reactions.
One reaction as,

779
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,350
as,
as a human being.

780
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:58,510
I look at her and I say,
oh,

781
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,353
this poor lady,
you know what a fucking shitty roll the 

782
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:03,254
dice.
She's gotten life and she's been 

783
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:08,150
overweight her whole life feeling fat 
and gross and she's trying to get people

784
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,710
to lay off her,
leave me alone.

785
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,543
And she sort of,
it's a very biased account and not 

786
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:13,874
science or exercise physiology based 
where she sort of describing all the 

787
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,920
various times in her life where people 
have said she's unhealthy.

788
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,280
But meanwhile she's been very active and
she like lists all the different things.

789
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,500
She did tree climbing and hiking and all
this different stuff.

790
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,334
Right?
Which obviously to a guy like you or 

791
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:35,981
someone like me who knows a lot about 
competitive athletics and like the uh,

792
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,810
the amount of calories she's actually 
burning out versus putting in,

793
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,940
it's probably skewed.
It's probably fucked up.

794
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,180
And I don't,
she didn't really discuss the actual,

795
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:45,803
what she was actually eating.
She was talking about very bland foods 

796
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:52,130
and a thousand cars a day the doctors 
are trying to put her on,

797
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,570
which is the wrong approach.
Right?

798
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,610
Absolutely.
And it's really,

799
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,100
when I,
when I see things like that,

800
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:03,101
I don't see a woman who's like 70 years 
old who's coming to accept the fact that

801
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:05,690
she's overweight and it's no big deal.

802
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,411
And who,
you know,

803
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:07,940
everybody's got these,
you know,

804
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,043
ideas about body image that they're 
based on skinny supermodels that are 

805
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:14,530
actually anorexic.
And yeah,

806
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,373
I usually just leave me alone and I'm 
plump and I'm healthy and everything's 

807
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,340
fine.
I don't buy it.

808
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,840
I,
I look at that and I say,

809
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:24,920
this poor lady has been given a bad set 
of directives.

810
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,010
She's been getting given bad information
as far as her diet.

811
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,370
And you don't have to be fat like you 
can,

812
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:35,030
you can eat healthy foods and,
and you know,

813
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,040
and live a healthy life and your body 
would lose a lot of weight

814
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,430
just eating healthy foods.
That's absolutely true.

815
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,370
And so that,
that brings us back to this,

816
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,140
you know,
this idea of,

817
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,060
um,
good or bad and,

818
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,810
and judgment because you know,
people self judge,

819
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:53,850
people judge other people.
Um,

820
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,050
I have to be very careful,
uh,

821
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,650
when I look at people not to make that 
judgment.

822
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,730
I mean,
my tendency is to,

823
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:01,740
is to say to myself,
Holy Shit,

824
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:02,310
I could,
I could,

825
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,320
I could fix that person or I could help 
that person.

826
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,360
You know what I mean?
And people resist that.

827
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
Well,
and I don't do it.

828
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,150
I mean,
I say it to myself because it's,

829
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,140
it's pretty clear that,
um,

830
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,560
you know,
you have to want to change.

831
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,900
And,
and we,

832
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,310
we talked about what,
you know,

833
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:18,370
what can I get away with?
Well,

834
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:21,720
if I can get away with being fat and 
people still reasonably like me,

835
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,554
then I don't have to do the work and 
therefore not motivated to do what it's 

836
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,390
going to take to get to that point.

837
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,950
Um,
but it's,

838
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:29,670
uh,
uh,

839
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,470
it's a,
it's a slippery slope with,

840
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
with talking with people about,
you know,

841
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,520
like what's the ideal body composition,
right?

842
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,383
It's,
um,

843
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,550
the ideal body composition is where your
body says back to you,

844
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,691
Joe,
man,

845
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:44,880
I love what you've done with the place.
This is phenomenal.

846
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,650
You know,
you've lost 50 pounds,

847
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,790
not you,
but you know,

848
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,770
you're,
you don't get sick as often.

849
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,720
You've got all the energy you want,
you maintain it.

850
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,100
Uh,
without a lot of,

851
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:53,580
uh,
you know,

852
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,380
dieting or anything like that.
You eat pretty much,

853
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,180
you know,
how you know you're supposed to eat,

854
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,030
but you're never hungry.
That's your ideal body composition,

855
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,680
man.
And if it doesn't look like the cover of

856
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,080
muscle and fitness or shape magazine,
so be it.

857
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,210
Um,
by the way,

858
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:07,044
I can get you to that point for a lot of
people where you are on the cover of 

859
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,260
shape magazine or muscle and fitness,
but it's going to cost and it's going to

860
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:15,900
cost not in money,
but it's going to cost and sacrifice and

861
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,630
discipline and pain and,
and hating life.

862
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,321
So,
you know,

863
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,640
the science can get us there,
but is it worth the life?

864
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,363
The,
the main thing we do at the primal 

865
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,470
blueprint is we try to live an awesome 
life.

866
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:29,520
So,
so in fact,

867
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,380
my tagline is primal blueprint live 
awesome.

868
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,370
Living awesome means enjoying as much of
every moment,

869
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,920
every day as you can extract and the 
greatest amount of pleasure,

870
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,010
whether it's movement,
whether it's with friends,

871
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,070
whether it's food,
um,

872
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,510
again,
with the least amount of pain,

873
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,290
but in a way that's sustainable.
So it,

874
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:49,124
it,
it not only benefits you right now and 

875
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:52,980
today,
but over the long haul,

876
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,570
you're going to live longer.
You can be happier.

877
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,130
Um,
you won't get sick,

878
00:37:56,131 --> 00:37:59,450
you won't tap into your 401k to pay for 
a $200,000,

879
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,450
whatever,
uh,

880
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,930
operation.
Um,

881
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,353
it's about,
it's about how can I enjoy life right 

882
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,464
now today,
now back to the overweight person who's 

883
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,670
trying to,
trying to get to that point.

884
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,870
And I,
I see a lot of,

885
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,733
you know,
overweight people are quite happy I 

886
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,560
guess.
Um,

887
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,230
but I see a lot of others who are maybe 
hiding it and going,

888
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,020
you know,
I'm,

889
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,240
I'm,
I'm the jolly,

890
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,380
you know,
fat person.

891
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,880
But inside I'm,
you know,

892
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:24,690
I'm,
I'm the sad,

893
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,790
whatever the sad clown.
Um,

894
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
you got to deal with that,
that,

895
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:28,951
you know,
there's a lot of,

896
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,700
and there's a lot of baggage.
So some of this stuff comes from the,

897
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,773
the changes you make in your diet.
So there's a lot of easy things that we 

898
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,590
do.
I can,

899
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,620
I can write anybody a program that 
they'll love that,

900
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:39,970
that says,
um,

901
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,863
you know,
we're gonna,

902
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,020
we're gonna have a buttered coffee for 
breakfast.

903
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,980
We're going to have a two eggs and a 
little bit of Bacon.

904
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:50,080
We'll have a salad with some salmon on 
it for lunch,

905
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:50,914
we'll have whatever and they'll never be
hungry and you'll start to burn fat and 

906
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:54,670
life will be wonderful.

907
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,233
And um,
and sometimes they'll get to a plateau 

908
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,530
and they'll go,
what happened mark?

909
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:00,550
I did everything right.
Well,

910
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,690
you know,
you went from,

911
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,990
you're a woman,
you went from two 25 to one 75.

912
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,300
You know,
you still have some work to do,

913
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,134
but for right now you're at your ideal 
body composition because in terms of 

914
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:12,490
your body,
the body,

915
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,260
it's a survival mechanism.
You know,

916
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:15,820
if you,
if we get to this,

917
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,080
you know,
this sort of,

918
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:18,730
um,
uh,

919
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,370
secular,
uh,

920
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,520
or you know,
discussion about life and what we're,

921
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:25,900
what we're,
what we're after.

922
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,260
The human body is a vessel designed to 
carry two strands of RNA DNA into the,

923
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,914
into the future.
And it's a bizarre permutation of 

924
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:36,820
several hundred million years of 
evolution.

925
00:39:36,821 --> 00:39:37,654
But the bottom line is the body is,
is designed to survive long enough to 

926
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,000
procreate.
And that's,

927
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,913
that's the reality of human and 
evolution and the fact that we live 

928
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:48,490
longer and we enjoy life.

929
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,380
This is all wonderful in icing on the 
cake.

930
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,214
But from the body's perspective,
your ideal body composition is that 

931
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,990
composition at which again,
you don't get sick,

932
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:56,890
you move around,
great.

933
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,390
Um,
you,

934
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,540
uh,
you,

935
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,520
you know,
you can meet a mate,

936
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,920
uh,
you have all the energy you want.

937
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,220
You're not hungry.
So that's it.

938
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:06,054
If it's,
if you're a woman and that's one 75 for 

939
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,340
now,
you get,

940
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,060
you got to go.
This is fabulous.

941
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:11,650
I embrace this.
I feel good at,

942
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,400
you know,
whatever.

943
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,233
Now,
if you want to get dropped the next 25 

944
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:15,071
pounds,
okay,

945
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:15,904
now we got to look at refiguring that 
the diet out and adding some sprints in 

946
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:22,050
there and doing some,
some little tweaks in there and we'll,

947
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,260
we'll,
we'll get down there,

948
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,400
but it requires number one,
um,

949
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,213
I identifying an appreciation for what 
you've done so far to get to where you 

950
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:33,754
are.

951
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,723
A number two,
it requires acknowledging any past 

952
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,690
insults in your,
in your life.

953
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,603
And there's a lot of stuff going on in 
the mind and the brain that wants to 

954
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:47,620
keep people a protected with armor.
Um,

955
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,570
whether it's,
um,

956
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,930
sexual abuse,
whether it's,

957
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:50,710
uh,
you know,

958
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,120
verbal abuse,
uh,

959
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,093
uh,
some,

960
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,060
you know,
scenario that happened in childhood.

961
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:55,894
There are a lot of people carrying a lot
of emotional baggage around with them 

962
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:02,890
that in some cases,
if you dealt with it,

963
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,073
you know,
in an inappropriate manner that might 

964
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,060
free you up to lose a little bit more 
weight.

965
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,260
And I've seen this happen.

966
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,273
So when you're saying armor,
do you mean in terms of like emotional 

967
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:16,240
armor or is it the body fat that they 
keep on top of them?

968
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:20,290
Is it almost like a distraction or is it
the food that distracts them?

969
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,393
The overconsuming of food to sort of 
nullify the effects of the abuse or 

970
00:41:25,781 --> 00:41:28,260
whatever trauma.
It could be any of those,

971
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:29,500
any of those and all those.

972
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,250
Um,
but it's,

973
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:34,150
I see it fairly,
um,

974
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,560
where people will,
you know,

975
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,840
do everything right and then hit a 
plateau and wonder what I need to get to

976
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:39,850
the next level.
And do you got to,

977
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,990
sometimes you need to really do the deep
work.

978
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,891
Yeah.
Why,

979
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,724
why?
I tried to explain to someone when they 

980
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:46,580
try to gain weight when people are 
carrying,

981
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,120
I want to,
I want to put some muscle on.

982
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,053
Um,
I tried to explain to people that like 

983
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:53,580
that that is not an easy thing to do.
And matter of fact,

984
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,443
your body doesn't want to do that.
Your body has a limited amount of 

985
00:41:57,031 --> 00:42:01,170
resources and it does not want to spend 
resources created on this extra muscle.

986
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,330
And in order to do that you have to be 
uncomfortable.

987
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,820
Like this is the only way.
And people say,

988
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,673
Oh,
I've been doing all this lift and I'm 

989
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:07,824
not getting any weight.
Well you probably lifting not enough 

990
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:12,600
weight.
You're not putting in enough intensity.

991
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,640
You're not a,
you're not eating enough.

992
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,940
I mean in order you have to get your 
body to say,

993
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,580
all right,
this has hall wants to do dead four days

994
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,000
a week now or squats or you know,
he,

995
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:23,834
he's doing all this heavy stuff.
We have to adjust accordingly because 

996
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:28,554
the,
the environment in which we're existing 

997
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:34,620
in obviously changed and now we are 
going to need a lot more muscle.

998
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,633
No,
I mean,

999
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,703
that's again,
the nature of the human body is to 

1000
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,374
preserve itself,
to pass the genetic material along to 

1001
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,710
the next generation.
Part of that preservation is,

1002
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,160
I don't want to waste precious resources
building something that I won't need,

1003
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,210
right?
So,

1004
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,680
um,
in,

1005
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:49,514
in a lot of people,
how that manifests itself is if you 

1006
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:52,780
don't lift weights,
you don't have any muscle.

1007
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,910
So you have this lack of muscle,
this lack of,

1008
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,810
of,
of um,

1009
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,510
uh,
of muscle mass.

1010
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,850
And you know,
he said,

1011
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:02,180
well,
what,

1012
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,650
what's wrong with that?
I'm skinny.

1013
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:04,341
Well,
you know,

1014
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:05,174
you could be skinny,
but you could be what we call skinny 

1015
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:06,920
fat,
no muscle.

1016
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,600
You got a little bit of excess fat,
you're memory,

1017
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,870
more prone to getting type two diabetes.
But almost more importantly,

1018
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:13,940
if you don't train,
and as you get older,

1019
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,970
it becomes more and more important to 
maintain muscle mass.

1020
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,300
Um,
people don't die of old age.

1021
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:22,670
They die of organ failure because they 
just,

1022
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:23,803
you know,
something wasn't keeping up with the 

1023
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:26,294
body.
But the concept of dying of old age is 

1024
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,440
kind of ridiculous when you think about 
it.

1025
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,760
So the typical old age scenario is you 
got a 75,

1026
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:39,440
85 year old man or woman,
hasn't done anything active for years.

1027
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,020
So there's no muscle mass.
Um,

1028
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,150
and because there's no muscle mass and 
they haven't done anything active,

1029
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,890
the bones,
there's no bone density.

1030
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,730
So the bones go,
hey,

1031
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,230
I don't,
I don't want to,

1032
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,273
I don't need to build a structure 
because this clown isn't going to the 

1033
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:54,380
gym and doing anything to require it.
So I'm going to,

1034
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,330
um,
save resources,

1035
00:43:56,331 --> 00:44:00,110
not build bone density.
The muscles are not building bone mass.

1036
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,150
Now the heart's going,
this is easy.

1037
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:06,350
I can pump blood all day at at 5% of my 
volume or maybe 15% of my volume.

1038
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:07,610
The lungs go,
Hey,

1039
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:08,331
I,
you know,

1040
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:11,030
there's no,
no requirement for excess oxygen.

1041
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,923
This,
this clown's just sitting around in a 

1042
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:17,180
chair all day or you know,
watching tv or doing minimal activity.

1043
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,313
So the lungs,
they sort of ceased to function at full 

1044
00:44:21,111 --> 00:44:22,730
capacity.
Same with the liver,

1045
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:24,460
same with the kidneys.
And as,

1046
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:29,461
as you go down this path,
then one night you get up to take a leak

1047
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:30,794
and you trip over the cat and you fall 
and you break your hip cause of bone 

1048
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:34,524
density sucks.
And now you wind up in the hospital and 

1049
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:42,081
you get pneumonia and you die because 
the lungs can't expel the sputum for the

1050
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:44,550
pneumonia and,
and the heart can't keep up.

1051
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,470
So you maybe you die of congestive heart
failure.

1052
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,304
I mean,
this is a very typical scenario for a 

1053
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:49,974
lot of people and it all goes back to 
creating a need for the body to want to 

1054
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,950
change that.

1055
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,903
Great.
Um,

1056
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,160
Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston movie 
where,

1057
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,700
how dare you say that there you say that
great.

1058
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,534
Vince Vaughn,
Jennifer Aniston movie gnosis things 

1059
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:05,551
ever.
Sorry.

1060
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:06,890
There was a great line in,
uh,

1061
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,853
in a mediocre Vince Vaughn,
but you're the one I'm talking about 

1062
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,080
where she,
they're,

1063
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,960
they're having a fight and uh,
and she says,

1064
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,030
honey,
come help me do the dishes.

1065
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:18,600
He goes,
no,

1066
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,860
that's all right.
I'm going to watch the game.

1067
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:20,820
And she goes,
no,

1068
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,010
help me do the dishes.
He goes,

1069
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,611
Nah,
I'm just,

1070
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:24,444
that's all right.
I'm going to be over here watching the 

1071
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:25,584
game.
I just watched the game.

1072
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,600
She goes,
come help me do the dishes.

1073
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:28,170
He goes,
all right.

1074
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:28,621
All right.
All right.

1075
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:29,940
All right.
I'll come help you do the dishes.

1076
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:30,870
She goes,
nevermind.

1077
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:32,010
I don't want you sh.
He says,

1078
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:32,700
why?
He says,

1079
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,320
I don't want you to help me do the 
dishes.

1080
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,900
I want you to want to help me do the 
dishes.

1081
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,920
Oh,
Christ.

1082
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:39,600
Right,
so get a new chick.

1083
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,210
The so the body,
the body,

1084
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,310
sorry about that was an arcane movie 
reference,

1085
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,144
but the boss,
you got to give the body the body needs 

1086
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,970
to want to change and you do that by 
using your,

1087
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,270
your brain to elect to go to the gym and
lift weights or to embark on a,

1088
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,173
on a,
a more rigorous and strenuous regimen 

1089
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:03,060
than you had previously encountered.
Well,

1090
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:05,280
changing patterns is very difficult for 
people.

1091
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:08,940
That's why New Year's resolutions are 
always such a joke because everybody,

1092
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,370
I mean,
the amount of people that stick to those

1093
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:15,330
things that they prescribed on January 
1st like this is it.

1094
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:16,164
I'm going to write it down.
I'm going to January 1st from here on 

1095
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:19,224
out.
It's all salads and salmon and running 

1096
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:25,971
up hills and then come February 13th for
lucky fucking over.

1097
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,290
So over your right,
back to the same thing.

1098
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,480
So sustainability is a huge part of 
this,

1099
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,343
uh,
of any program like that and that 

1100
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:34,530
changing patterns.
And that's what we like about the primal

1101
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,690
blueprint is that the foods are 
sustainable.

1102
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,910
So I mean literally and figuratively,
the Diet,

1103
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,730
the eating strategy is a sustainable 
strategy.

1104
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,950
Rule number one is you never let 
yourself go hungry.

1105
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,383
You just,
instead of eating a Bagel in the middle 

1106
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,581
of the afternoon,
you know,

1107
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:48,414
you eat a spoonful of coconut butter or 
something that's got fat in it that 

1108
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,050
satisfies and you scoop coconut butter 
for a snack.

1109
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,930
Coconut butter,
just butter.

1110
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,140
You know,
like the peanut butter.

1111
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,960
Oh hell yeah.
You just take a scoop of that.

1112
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,660
Not,
but not coconut people just checked out.

1113
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,620
They're like,
this fucking guy's,

1114
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,450
well,
should we talk about the same thing?

1115
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,250
Coconut butter,
I like peanut butter.

1116
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,810
That's the meat of a coconut.

1117
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,950
It's like what's in an almond joy?
I want to fucking cook.

1118
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,980
Like I don't want a candy bar.
I don't want a god Damn Colantoni man.

1119
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,223
Okay.
So you have to suspend disbelief a 

1120
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:19,914
little bit here and a humor me,
go buy a jar of coconut butter and try 

1121
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:24,594
it instead of a cookie or whatever.
Do you participate in any sort of 

1122
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:30,580
intermittent fasting?
Not really.

1123
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:31,780
And I'll,
I'll tell you why.

1124
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,673
Um,
this is again about seeing what we can 

1125
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:36,340
get away with.
And I'm pretty lucky that I can,

1126
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,760
I can get away eating what I eat.
Now I have,

1127
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,410
on the other hand,
it compressed eating window.

1128
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,930
So you could argue that I intermittently
fast every day.

1129
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,793
So I,
I eat from 1231 o'clock to 7:00 PM and 

1130
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,940
then I don't eat again.
So you don't eat it all in the morning?

1131
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,390
It's,
no,

1132
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,790
there's no concept of the word breakfast
for me.

1133
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,640
I have a cup of coffee and that's it.
So I'll go to the gym fasted,

1134
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,863
I'll do whatever workout I'm doing,
whether it's a heavy weight workout or 

1135
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:02,680
whether it's,
I mean,

1136
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,330
it could be a leg day,
could be,

1137
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,320
you know,
uh,

1138
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,380
intervals on a bike.
It could be a two hour paddle faster.

1139
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,214
You find that when you do that,
that you have less energy than if you 

1140
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:12,754
have like some fruit.
The difference here is I'm really good 

1141
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:16,204
at burning fat,
so I derive my energy from stored body 

1142
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:19,624
fat better than a lot of people.
Not because I'm genetically gifted in 

1143
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:24,664
that way,
but because that's how I've lived my 

1144
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:26,044
life.
That's how I've orchestrated my eating 

1145
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:30,490
strategy over the past 15 or 20 years.
So I become,

1146
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,230
I wake up,
I have all the energy I need.

1147
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:33,064
I don't need to tap into the stored 
glucose in the form of glycogen in my 

1148
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:37,990
liver or in my,
uh,

1149
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,680
in my muscles.

1150
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,710
So you essentially have you follow a 
Ketogenic Diet?

1151
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,270
Yeah,
but it's not ketogenic.

1152
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:45,040
So it's,
it's a high fat,

1153
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,470
moderate protein,
moderate carb diet.

1154
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:48,783
But I have enough carbs.
I have maybe a hundred to 130 grams of 

1155
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:53,010
carbs a day.
Uh,

1156
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,070
which would be in,
in,

1157
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,400
in no one's estimation would that be 
ketogenic?

1158
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,803
But I'm good at burning fat because I've
spent enough time in that sort of low 

1159
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:02,194
carb area.
I've built the metabolic machinery to 

1160
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:06,130
burn fats really effectively.
So I'd probably,

1161
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,413
you know,
I'm just going to suggest that I have a 

1162
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,591
lot more mitochondria in my muscle cells
then than other people do because of the

1163
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,470
restricting the carbs and restricting 
the sugars and forcing my body to become

1164
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:19,330
good at burning fat.
How does that work?

1165
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,490
So how does that pertain,
baby?

1166
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,533
Please tell me.
So how does it promote more 

1167
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:25,630
mitochondria?
Well,

1168
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:27,970
when it's called mitochondrial 
biogenesis,

1169
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:30,940
so when you are,
when you're born,

1170
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:31,774
you're born again with this recipe that 
wants you to become really good at 

1171
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,970
burning fat and it very quickly you 
change the script.

1172
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,833
So you,
the parents feed you grool and oatmeal 

1173
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:44,020
and why back and toast and whatever and 
uh,

1174
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,830
and pureed vegetables and you become 
very dependent on,

1175
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,290
on carbohydrate.
And the body says,

1176
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,610
I don't need to burn fat because I'm 
getting fed carbohydrate all the time.

1177
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,310
And a couple of responses are,
um,

1178
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,860
I got to get rid of this excess glucose 
because,

1179
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,390
uh,
if I don't,

1180
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,253
it'll,
it's toxic body shouldn't have more 

1181
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:04,630
than,
you know,

1182
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,910
90 to 100.
Uh,

1183
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,033
your,
your blood sugar count should stay 

1184
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:12,730
between say 85 and 70 and a hundred Max.
Um,

1185
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:14,520
what does the number of,
uh,

1186
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,650
you know,
milliliters per desk deciliter?

1187
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,513
I forget what the exact number is.
They're all over the place with 

1188
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:25,810
cholesterol and blood sugar.
But the point is that there's the entire

1189
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:30,080
amount of sugar in your bloodstream 
right now is probably the tablespoon,

1190
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,790
you know,
five grams of sugar.

1191
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,280
Um,
so it's not copious amounts.

1192
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,140
And,
and if it rises above that,

1193
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,650
you start to get into problems that 
sugar can interact with,

1194
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:40,783
with protein molecules and cause a 
reactions that lead to a clogging of 

1195
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:46,340
arteries,
a destructive,

1196
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,350
a destruction of,
of nerve tissue.

1197
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,290
That's where the,
the diabetic damage comes from.

1198
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:54,200
Just excessive amounts of sugar that are
in the bloodstream.

1199
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,453
So you,
so the body wants to kind of keep that 

1200
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,630
level low.
Um,

1201
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,850
and if you continuously feed it 
carbohydrate a all day long,

1202
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,760
if you're not burning it off,
if you're not running 20 miles a week,

1203
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,040
there's a tendency for the body to store
it,

1204
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,650
store the excess as,
as body fat,

1205
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,330
uh,
and over time.

1206
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,450
For some people that's a real problem.
For others who can get away with it,

1207
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,890
not,
not so much a problem.

1208
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,473
So we were,
many of us are at grow up depending on 

1209
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,373
uh,
this carbohydrate as a main source of 

1210
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:26,174
fuel.

1211
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,220
Uh,
and you know,

1212
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:29,054
you eat a carbohydrate meal,
a high carbohydrate meal causes a surge 

1213
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:32,294
of insulin because the insulin is there 
to take the glucose out of the 

1214
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:36,530
bloodstream and store.
Cause again,

1215
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,780
it's dangerous to have too much.
Um,

1216
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,643
but the,
sometimes the insulin surge is so great 

1217
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,043
that it drops the blood sugar and then 
you get hungry again a couple of hours 

1218
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,893
later.
That's why there's these swings 

1219
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:46,664
throughout the day.
If you are a sh what we call a sugar 

1220
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,360
burner.
Uh,

1221
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:54,200
if you,
if you try and look at a way,

1222
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:56,000
a different way to configure your 
energy,

1223
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,230
um,
uh,

1224
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,063
sources.
If you restrict sugar and restrict 

1225
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,020
carbohydrate a little bit,
you don't have to,

1226
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,030
you know,
be draconian about it,

1227
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,150
but you start to create the need for the
body to,

1228
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,160
to start to burn.
Some of it's stored body fat.

1229
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,001
You say,
well,

1230
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:11,910
the body goes well,
if I've,

1231
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:12,943
I've got to save,
saw my glucose from my brain because at 

1232
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,860
the brain runs on glucose and ketones 
and I'm going to,

1233
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,090
um,
and I'm going to,

1234
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,580
I'm going to learn how to burn fat more 
efficiently.

1235
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,833
And in order to do that,
I got to build more mitochondria cause 

1236
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:27,194
that's where the fat burns inside the 
Mitochondria and explain to people what 

1237
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:30,584
Mitochondria.
So Mitochondria are the powerhouses of 

1238
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,100
the cell.
So every cell has,

1239
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,310
most cells have mitochondria in the 
muscle.

1240
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:42,311
Cells have lots of Mitochondria that are
creating ATP,

1241
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:45,040
which is the energy currency of the body
uses to move to,

1242
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,010
to live,
to exist.

1243
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,590
What does ATP sound for a and 
triphosphate?

1244
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,633
It's a very,
we're not going to get a biochem lesson 

1245
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:51,714
right now.
That's okay.

1246
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,910
But ATP is,
this is this currency of the body and it

1247
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,860
can be recycled using,
um,

1248
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,470
certain different pathways,
a glycolytic pathway,

1249
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,130
which,
which doesn't require oxygen.

1250
00:53:02,131 --> 00:53:02,990
And,
and,

1251
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:06,980
and one of the pathways is,
is using oxygen in the Mitochondria.

1252
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:11,981
So that's a very important place to not 
only build more mitochondria,

1253
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:15,620
but improve the efficiency of the 
Mitochondria and how that happens.

1254
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,483
And this is the elegance of this again,
is it certain signals that you give the 

1255
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,384
body by,
by cutting back on the amount of 

1256
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,053
exogenous carbohydrate you take in those
signals go directly to the cells that 

1257
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:29,430
say,
I've got to make more Mitochondria.

1258
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:33,750
And then unique to every other organelle
in the body.

1259
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,870
Mitochondria have their own DNA.
Um,

1260
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,763
no other organelle within a cell has it,
but Mitochondria had their own DNA and 

1261
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,060
the DNA and the Mitochondria go,
well,

1262
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:44,370
we better be more efficient at what we 
do.

1263
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,520
So you upregulate the mitochondrial 
biogenesis,

1264
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:50,880
the creation of more Mitochondria,
and you upregulate the efficiency of the

1265
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:53,100
Mitochondria all done at the level of 
gene.

1266
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:57,780
All done through a signal that you gave 
by in this case,

1267
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,763
restricting carbohydrate.
And it could be increasing the amount 

1268
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:01,614
of,
uh,

1269
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:02,520
of,
um,

1270
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,353
uh,
low level aerobic activity you do 

1271
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,120
theirs.
And it can be both.

1272
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,640
And that we talk about that in,
in my new book,

1273
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,953
primal endurance.

1274
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,790
Read your new book and I want you to 
mark down what he just said,

1275
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,550
like the time on the podcast.
What time is it here?

1276
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,750
Like,
uh,

1277
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,720
an hour and 10 minutes in or something 
like that.

1278
00:54:20,721 --> 00:54:22,190
Three minutes and 53.
That's it.

1279
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,960
Okay.
Um,

1280
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,960
that's very important.
I'd never heard that before.

1281
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:31,610
I did not know that your body can change
the amount of Mitochondria.

1282
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,050
Absolutely.
That's,

1283
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,913
that's incredible.
That's just from restricting 

1284
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:37,860
carbohydrates.

1285
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,341
Well,
it's,

1286
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,174
it's from a comp.
There are a lot of things you can do it 

1287
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,060
a certain forms of,
uh,

1288
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,490
of weightlifting.
You can do like what,

1289
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,180
um,
you know,

1290
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,080
you,
you could do,

1291
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,830
um,
sustained a maximum power output stuff.

1292
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:52,080
So you know,
you've got a dead lift.

1293
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,550
What are you going to dead lift Max of 
500,

1294
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:55,380
which are dead lift Max jail,
somewhere around there.

1295
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:56,820
Okay.
So a little heavier than that.

1296
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,420
I'm Kinda Yo.
Um,

1297
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,420
so you'd,
um,

1298
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:05,430
you'd do a workout in the gym where you 
do 80% of your,

1299
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,820
of your Max,
a se to 400 pounds,

1300
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,713
and you might do it four or five times 
and then rest a few minutes and then do 

1301
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:14,094
it again,
four or five times and rest a few 

1302
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:15,654
minutes and do it again and do it 
instead of doing three sets of 10 of 

1303
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:19,650
whatever it is you're going to do.

1304
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,360
Um,
you,

1305
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,253
you load this up,
you load deeper and deeper into the 

1306
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:26,020
fibers.
Uh,

1307
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,400
to the extent that the workout's over 
when you,

1308
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,630
when you can only do one,
you know,

1309
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,461
and,
and you know,

1310
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:34,590
you can only do one.
You don't even try to get the next one.

1311
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,000
The workout's over.
And maybe it's,

1312
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,310
um,
maybe that winds up being 15 sets by the

1313
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:39,144
time you're done,
but you've maximally overloaded so much 

1314
00:55:41,611 --> 00:55:44,130
at a high,
not 100% Max because that's,

1315
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,930
now we're talking about danger,
danger,

1316
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:47,580
issue,
but you know,

1317
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:51,290
you can do 80% Max and three or four.
So that's one example of,

1318
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,313
of how we can,
and then that'll prompt those muscle 

1319
00:55:54,661 --> 00:55:56,520
tissues to,
to want to build more Mitochondria.

1320
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,140
Because if you probably heard,
you know,

1321
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,150
a truly effective weight session causes 
you to burn fat throughout the day.

1322
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,123
Right?
Yeah.

1323
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,040
Well,
it's one of the best ways to get lean.

1324
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,700
And it's one thing that people sometimes
aren't aware of.

1325
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,100
Most people when they want to get lean,
they think about cardio.

1326
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,770
They start doing a lot of extra cardio.
I know

1327
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,830
it's weightlifting that really makes you
lean.

1328
00:56:17,831 --> 00:56:18,261
Yeah.
No,

1329
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:19,260
I mean,
um,

1330
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,240
weightlifting and spreads nothing,
as I say,

1331
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,230
nothing cuts you up like sprint hills.
Yeah,

1332
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,940
yeah.
Hills really do it.

1333
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,230
Um,

1334
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,350
when you were talking about increasing 
mitochondria,

1335
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,184
like how,
how much of an increase are we talking 

1336
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:32,614
about?

1337
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,370
Double.
Double.

1338
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,410
Yeah.
I mean,

1339
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,880
up to up to double.
Wow.

1340
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,320
Yeah.

1341
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,040
And what are the other effects of having
double the amount of Mitochondria?

1342
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,410
What are the other positive benefits?
It's,

1343
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,761
um,
you know,

1344
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:45,594
more energy throughout the day because 
now you're so good at burning fat and 

1345
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:51,210
you have all this machinery to burn the 
fat,

1346
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,280
um,
that,

1347
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:53,890
uh,
you,

1348
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,550
you're hungry less often.
And you know,

1349
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:58,280
it's interesting when we look back at,
um,

1350
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,980
how hunger runs our lives.
And again,

1351
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,250
if you look at the carbohydrate sugar 
burning paradigm,

1352
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,220
you get up in the morning,
have the most important meal of the day.

1353
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:12,810
It might be a bagels and toast.
Special K.

1354
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,170
Yeah,
yeah.

1355
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,430
Special K,
um,

1356
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:15,690
a glass of juice.
Don't forget,

1357
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,190
tell you,
you,

1358
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,320
I have that instant sugar water hundred 
and 50 grams of sugar before you,

1359
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,283
you know,
before you head out the door and you're 

1360
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,900
not even supposed to have 150 grams of 
sugar in a day.

1361
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,970
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,

1362
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,320
it was.
Most people said what I'm saying,

1363
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:26,154
I'm saying you're not supposed to have 
more than I like one 50 is a max amount 

1364
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:30,900
of total carbohydrates that I have in a 
day.

1365
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,740
So sugar is as a minor minor subset of 
that.

1366
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,210
And then,
but then,

1367
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:36,690
uh,
you know,

1368
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:40,590
you get to work and 10 30 rolls around 
and it's time for a break.

1369
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,350
Don't break room,
don't at somebody brought donuts today,

1370
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,930
shelly.
Uh,

1371
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,670
and then,
you know,

1372
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,060
where are we going for lunch?
Ah,

1373
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:49,920
Skoda,
you know,

1374
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,820
get a pizza or whatever.
And uh,

1375
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,070
again,
another break in the afternoon,

1376
00:57:53,071 --> 00:57:53,904
they get home and you have dinner and 
maybe you have some ice cream or 

1377
00:57:56,761 --> 00:57:59,160
something watching tv.
And the next thing you know,

1378
00:57:59,161 --> 00:57:59,851
you've,
you know,

1379
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:04,500
you've taken in six,
700 grams of carbs in that day.

1380
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,510
Well,
if you're good at burning fat,

1381
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:07,830
the first thing that happens,
you wake up in the morning,

1382
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:08,720
go,
ah,

1383
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:09,690
I don't need to eat.
Really.

1384
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:11,160
I don't feel like I need to eat.
It's,

1385
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:12,790
I'm not hungry.
And,

1386
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,460
and one of the things we talk about in 
the panel blueprint,

1387
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:15,300
if,
if you're not hungry,

1388
00:58:15,301 --> 00:58:16,290
then don't eat.

1389
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:20,130
That's,
these are the signals your body's giving

1390
00:58:20,131 --> 00:58:22,620
you.
And if you can get away with not eating,

1391
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,740
and when I say don't eat it,
it's clear.

1392
00:58:25,741 --> 00:58:28,560
It's important that we have to say,
because I'm not hungry.

1393
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,880
If you're hungry,
eat,

1394
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,720
but if you're not hungry,
then Eh,

1395
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,790
you know,
move on.

1396
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,351
Um,
I did,

1397
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:35,184
uh,
a thought experiment a while back and I 

1398
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:37,404
thought,
you know,

1399
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,020
it's interesting cause when I was,
when I was in college,

1400
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,263
um,
every one of my college buddies know me 

1401
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,960
as Arnold.
They don't even know me as mark.

1402
00:58:45,961 --> 00:58:48,480
They call me arnold because when we were
in college,

1403
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:49,314
there was a TV show called green acres,
and there was a pig on the show called 

1404
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:57,530
Arnold Ziff.
And I could eat more than anybody in,

1405
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,130
in the,
in the college I went to,

1406
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,180
including the football team.
And so people would call me Arnold Ziff.

1407
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,880
And so I became Ahrens,
Arnie Arnold for most of my life.

1408
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,753
It's just because the amount of food,
just because the amount of food I could 

1409
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:09,450
eat.
And,

1410
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:11,830
um,
did you have a contests or is this,

1411
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,553
everybody knew.
It's like you're going to eat that 

1412
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:14,964
dessert.
You're going to eat those,

1413
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,790
you're gonna eat that steak.
You can have that.

1414
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,053
Um,
but I was running a hundred miles a 

1415
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:19,794
week.
I was a skinny shit have weighed 30 

1416
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:23,300
pounds less than I weigh now,
but I just,

1417
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,550
the throughput was,
was where it was.

1418
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:30,770
And because I had a leaky gut,
probably a lot of it just went right out

1419
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:33,740
the button out the button.
So,

1420
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,090
um,
uh,

1421
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,530
the thought experiment was that my whole
life I sort of was guilty of this.

1422
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:44,390
Like how much food can I eat and not 
gain weight and not be uncomfortable.

1423
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,261
You know,
that's,

1424
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,640
and I think a lot of people look that 
way.

1425
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,510
It's like,
all right,

1426
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:50,120
we're going to go eat lunch.
How much food can I eat and a,

1427
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,840
and not gain weight or how much of that 
cake or that pie can or whatever.

1428
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,760
People I think tend to this is this is 
the,

1429
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:58,080
what can I get away with part of it?
Well,

1430
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,530
what if you shifted that around and you 
said,

1431
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,573
what's the least amount of food I can 
eat and maintain muscle mass and 

1432
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,114
maintain energy and,
and not get sick and most importantly 

1433
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,763
not be hungry.
And you find if you do this experiments 

1434
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:14,450
pretty interesting.
If you become good at burning fat,

1435
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,770
your,
your appetite.

1436
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,693
So self regulates and so mitigates that 
you find yourself pushing a plate of 

1437
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:22,394
food away after a couple of bites or not
being hungry or eating just the right 

1438
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:26,950
amount of food to,
to,

1439
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,100
to get you through the day.

1440
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,190
What do you keep your body fat out?
You know,

1441
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:33,710
so I'm 62 now and build.
Great.

1442
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,573
Well thank you.
I mean my people would look at me and 

1443
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,221
go,
oh,

1444
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,510
you must be six,
7%.

1445
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,740
No,
probably nine,

1446
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,360
maybe nine and a half,
maybe 10%.

1447
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,763
Um,
a lot of people lie about their body 

1448
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:44,910
fat.
Uh,

1449
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:45,743
you know,
you hear these stories of the wide 

1450
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:47,420
receiver that's,
you know,

1451
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:49,000
two and a half,
3% body fat.

1452
01:00:49,001 --> 01:00:50,060
It's,
that's not even possible.

1453
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,110
It's impossible.
Yeah.

1454
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,201
Yeah.
And,

1455
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:53,870
and even with the bodybuilders,
the ones that,

1456
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,700
that get down that that lien are so 
close to death,

1457
01:00:59,360 --> 01:00:59,871
you know,
that's a,

1458
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:00,704
that's dieting down that the day before 
the contest to get there and they 

1459
01:01:03,131 --> 01:01:05,120
better,
they pack it right on afterwards.

1460
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:05,990
So,
so,

1461
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,951
um,
yeah,

1462
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:08,270
so the body fat thing is,
uh,

1463
01:01:08,271 --> 01:01:09,104
I,
I've stayed at this same V v visible I 

1464
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:13,680
should say,
um,

1465
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,650
you know,
body fat level

1466
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,883
since I was in my twenties.
So this is a result of a lot of 

1467
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:22,040
strenuous exercise,
a lot of long distance running,

1468
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:22,650
a lot of the,
the,

1469
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,483
the different things that you 
participate in as well as this body 

1470
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,853
burning fat primarily because you're 
talking about if you've been in this 

1471
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,773
same body fat percentage,
most of your life do you haven't 

1472
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,440
adjusted what usually happens now?
So now forties when you adjusted your,

1473
01:01:40,441 --> 01:01:42,590
you're done in my forties.
So,

1474
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,100
so what happens now is I,
I don't run at all.

1475
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,120
I was a career runner for the first part
of my life and uh,

1476
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,023
uh,
I haven't run a mile.

1477
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,810
I have not run a mile in like 13 years.
What do you do now for exercise?

1478
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,550
So I lift,
uh,

1479
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,820
twice a week.
I do an upper body sort of full,

1480
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,040
full routine.
I don't separate,

1481
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,560
you know,
chest and Tris and back and buys and all

1482
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:07,030
that stuff.
I just do a full routine.

1483
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:07,893
That's a smart way to do it.
That's separating stuff kind of 

1484
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,960
malarkey.
Well,

1485
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:11,794
it's at separating stuff as if you don't
have a job and it's good for a body 

1486
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,200
building to go to the gym every day and 
do two hours and whatever.

1487
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,620
But yeah.
Um,

1488
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,630
I,
I try to get some long,

1489
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,930
either a paddler a hike in once a week.
Um,

1490
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,380
I do a pretty focused a interval ride on
a bike,

1491
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:29,214
but half an hour once a week.
And then my big thing meaning like a 

1492
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:33,150
stationary bike,
stationary bike.

1493
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,910
And then I,
and I go to the gym,

1494
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,100
not to ride the bike,
but to catch up on our reading.

1495
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,160
Oh,
okay.

1496
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,560
I read while I'm on the bike and 
whatever.

1497
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,480
Um,
but uh,

1498
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,373
then the,
the big workout for me is my Sunday 

1499
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,863
ultimate Frisbee game.
So you laugh like you get to some 

1500
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,030
images,
some pastoral hipsters barefoot.

1501
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,390
I don't even know exactly what ultimate 
Frisbee is.

1502
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,760
The greatest game ever been fed.
Lucky you can always,

1503
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,090
you've got to get you out.
Joe.

1504
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,850
Whole demeanor changed.
Got his smile line.

1505
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,830
Your eyes lit up.
What is all,

1506
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,780
what are you doing?
Ultimate is just,

1507
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:08,100
um,
it's a,

1508
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,993
it's a very fast paced game.
It's played on a field like a football 

1509
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:11,814
field or a soccer field.
Two teams trying to advance the Frisbee 

1510
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:16,620
down the field by making completed 
passes to their teammates.

1511
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,300
When you're a pastor,
you can't,

1512
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,193
you can't run,
but everybody else on your team is 

1513
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,420
trying to get open.

1514
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,880
So they're running,
trying to get away from their defenders.

1515
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,730
You complete a pass and eventually if 
you complete a pass over the,

1516
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:30,600
the end zone or the goal line at a point
and a,

1517
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,230
but if at any point in time Jamie just 
puts them on the board here.

1518
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,280
Oh,
there he goes guys.

1519
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,180
Yeah,
check that out.

1520
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:37,340
So yeah.
So Watch,

1521
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,000
here we go.
Yeah.

1522
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:39,630
So,
uh,

1523
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:40,980
you know any,
at any point in time,

1524
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,590
well they need some black people on this
report because first of all,

1525
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,390
no,
there's a white guy was running slow.

1526
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:49,320
She definitely got to that anyway.
It's a pretty,

1527
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:50,610
it's a pretty athletic game.
These are,

1528
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:51,960
I don't know who this is.
This is a,

1529
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:54,060
I'll tell you what,
they're not black.

1530
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,430
There is a good layout right there.
Okay.

1531
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,500
Um,
that was a good catch actually.

1532
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,334
No and we,
but we have those every week that we 

1533
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,040
played a bunch of those.

1534
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,620
So it's a very fast paced game.
And if you,

1535
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,460
if you lose the Frisbee,
if it's turned over by your teammate,

1536
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,280
either drop it or something,
it becomes the other teams,

1537
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,220
a frisbee going in the opposite 
direction and now you've got to get back

1538
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:17,100
on defense and defend the same guy that 
was defending you in most cases.

1539
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,593
Okay.
So if you throw the Frisbee and the 

1540
01:04:20,191 --> 01:04:22,530
other guy doesn't catch it,
then the other team gets it.

1541
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:23,364
Correct.
And then it got to try and do the same 

1542
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:24,804
thing.
Interesting.

1543
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,360
And so you're sprinting a lot.
A lot.

1544
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,380
I mean we have,
you know,

1545
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:30,960
soccer players come out and basketball 
players come out and they go,

1546
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:31,471
dude,
this is,

1547
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,090
I couldn't walk on Monday after that 
game.

1548
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,650
That's,
that's just ridiculous.

1549
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,740
So you know,
running except ultimate thing except you

1550
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,060
know,
eight to ten second bursts.

1551
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:41,160
And how that,
how that plays out for me is,

1552
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,053
um,
you know,

1553
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,983
some of the recent research is you go,
instead of doing intervals like the old 

1554
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:47,154
days,
we do 60 seconds or a minute and a half 

1555
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:49,404
interval as a marathon,
or I used to go to the track and do 16 

1556
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:55,830
times one half mile,
you know,

1557
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,000
uh,
at race pace.

1558
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:00,420
So now we're doing all out sprints,
10 seconds,

1559
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:02,010
15 seconds,
maybe 20 seconds,

1560
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:03,720
but your Max,
Max Max the whole way.

1561
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,450
And then,
uh,

1562
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:04,850
uh,
uh,

1563
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:08,490
sufficient enough rest and come back and
do it again and do it six,

1564
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:09,324
seven,
eight,

1565
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:09,871
five,
six,

1566
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:10,704
seven times and you're done.
That workout is over and you have 

1567
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,873
accrued the benefits probably at a 
greater rate than would have had you 

1568
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:18,010
done

1569
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,770
the old method of training,
which was to do,

1570
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:21,701
you know,
again,

1571
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:22,534
repeat quarters or 200 or whatever.
So do you think that a lot of what the 

1572
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,134
old methods were doing was just as,
as people getting through with mental 

1573
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:31,990
toughness and you're,
you're getting some benefit of it,

1574
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:36,280
but you're also kind of breaking 
yourself down too much?

1575
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,210
Yeah.
So most of endurance athletics is,

1576
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,060
is pain management and overtraining.
Yeah.

1577
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:48,090
It's like half the races that I was,
I thought I was most prepared for.

1578
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:49,683
Um,
I sucked in because I was overtrained I 

1579
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:51,874
left everything on the training field.
That's a big problem with fighters as 

1580
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,010
well.
With UFC fighters.

1581
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:57,844
It's a gigantic issue.
I'm trying to figure out what is the 

1582
01:06:01,511 --> 01:06:03,420
right amount of work you should do.
Yeah.

1583
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,443
And especially with fighters because in 
mixed martial arts or dealing with 

1584
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,033
different disciplines,
you have your grappling every striking 

1585
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:12,820
give,
putting them all together.

1586
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:14,330
You have submissions,
you have takedowns,

1587
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:15,183
you have a bunch of different things 
that you have to train as well as 

1588
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,810
rigorous strength and conditioning 
programs.

1589
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:23,350
And there's a lot of debate as far as 
what should you put,

1590
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,393
uh,
most time and effort into and some of 

1591
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:27,940
the more successful people,
it's really an interesting,

1592
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,043
have been going away from skill training
during camps when they prepare for a 

1593
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:33,754
fight and going almost exclusively to 
strength and conditioning programs with 

1594
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,534
very minimal skill training where the 
strength and conditioning program takes 

1595
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:43,330
precedent over everything else,
which I find very fascinating.

1596
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,760
The idea behind that being you already 
know how to fight.

1597
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,760
So what they're going to do is get your 
body to a place where it can function at

1598
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,594
the highest work rate.
And a big factor in that is maintaining 

1599
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,053
a healthy heart rate and make sure,
making sure that you don't overtrain 

1600
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:59,950
making sure that you have enough 
recovery time,

1601
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,113
100% agree.

1602
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,410
Um,
we,

1603
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,550
we say that in,
in,

1604
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,700
um,
training triathletes and runners here.

1605
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,110
You know,
the amount of time you spend on the bike

1606
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,000
after you've been doing it for a couple 
of years,

1607
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:10,900
you know,
how to ride.

1608
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,823
So let's train the component.
Let's break the race down into its 

1609
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,580
component parts.
You know,

1610
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:16,414
how can you,
how could you sustain your power over 

1611
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:20,284
the next three hills to where your 
output on the third hill is essentially 

1612
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:24,244
the same as it was in the first hill 
versus in the old days where you are 

1613
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:27,364
100% going over the first hill and at 
90% over the second hill in 77% going 

1614
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:34,810
over the third hill because you didn't,
you hadn't trained that part of your,

1615
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,310
of your,
um,

1616
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,233
in your,
in your regimen that one of the things 

1617
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:41,164
we say to endurance athletes is how many
races have you finished where you were 

1618
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:46,390
out of breath and maybe you had to 
sprint,

1619
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:47,253
you know,
to,

1620
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,790
because you were neck and neck with some
guy.

1621
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:49,624
But most endurance athletes don't finish
a marathon out of breath because long 

1622
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:56,570
ago their form fell apart.
Um,

1623
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,513
their,
their muscle tissue started to break 

1624
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,420
down because they hadn't trained for 
sustained power.

1625
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,300
And so the,
the,

1626
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,680
the aerobic part of it was like,
feel we could do this all day long.

1627
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,000
You're just going slow because you 
didn't,

1628
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:07,923
you didn't train appropriately.
So there's some strength training 

1629
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:14,620
components like even to something like 
marathon running.

1630
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:15,860
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1631
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,290
So now we're,
we're saying that the next,

1632
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,543
you know,
the next breakthroughs in in marathon 

1633
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:25,610
running will come from somebody who has,
who has trained Quito genically and,

1634
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,710
and we didn't talk about that yet,
but you know,

1635
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:30,440
has restricted carbs to the extent that 
they,

1636
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:31,610
um,
cyclical.

1637
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,890
He,
they know how to access ketones,

1638
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:38,420
which are a byproduct of fat metabolism 
and they can use the ketones in place of

1639
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:40,550
glucose or glycogen.
Uh,

1640
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,760
they can use the ketones to fuel the 
brain to,

1641
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:44,623
to will them to continue the pace 
they've done the work in the gym where 

1642
01:08:48,411 --> 01:08:49,244
they can maintain a sustained power 
output over 26 miles and not have it 

1643
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:55,490
fall apart and not have formed breakdown
22 miles into the race.

1644
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:56,870
Uh,
and,

1645
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,273
and if you put all of these,
these different component parts 

1646
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,150
together,
now you and do it with a,

1647
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,770
with an elite,
a world class athlete,

1648
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,090
you know,
now you look at,

1649
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,100
at the next level of records being 
broken,

1650
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,870
the problem is it's so antithetical to 
the way we trained for the last 40 years

1651
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,910
that you take,
uh,

1652
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,150
an elite,
um,

1653
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,980
professional runner who's already had 
some amount of success.

1654
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,813
And you go,
dude,

1655
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,770
uh,
we want to shift everything around.

1656
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,530
It's going to cost you the next 18 
months to adapt,

1657
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,540
but there's a good chance that you'll be
better.

1658
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,850
The guy's gonna go,
ah,

1659
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,230
you know,
so hard for his.

1660
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,590
Yeah.
And it's so hard.

1661
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,030
Well,
it's so hard to,

1662
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,760
to give up something and give up 
something that's working right.

1663
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,341
You know,
to,

1664
01:09:36,341 --> 01:09:37,220
to get to that.
Yeah.

1665
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,493
Um,
I want to go back to something you said 

1666
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,460
while you were just explaining that,
that you,

1667
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,350
you get someone to train ketogenic.
Yup.

1668
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,660
And what do you mean by that?
So now you,

1669
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,160
there are periods of time when you're 
restricting carbs so much that you're,

1670
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,203
you're creating a more ketones,
which are this byproduct of fat 

1671
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,920
metabolism.
So you've already become good at what we

1672
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:59,810
call your become fat adapted.
As we say,

1673
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,003
you become good at burning fat and now 
you're building further metabolic 

1674
01:10:03,321 --> 01:10:03,710
machinery.

1675
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,770
That access is ketones better.
So now ketones,

1676
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,700
which we we refer to as the fourth fuel.
So you'd have proteins,

1677
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:11,451
fats,
carbohydrates,

1678
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:13,190
ketones are the fourth fuel,
the body.

1679
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,533
Uh,
we evolve to use ketones very 

1680
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:17,690
efficiently.
There was,

1681
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,130
there were times throughout millions of 
years of human evolution where it wasn't

1682
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:22,964
like you skip lunch,
it's like you skipped last week eating 

1683
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,204
right and you had to maintain muscle 
mass and maintain a thought capability 

1684
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,840
and maintain speed and health,
um,

1685
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:34,783
despite not eating anything.
And the only way to do that was to 

1686
01:10:36,471 --> 01:10:37,304
access was to access the stored body fat
that you'd stored from overeating or 

1687
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:45,290
eating slightly more than you needed be 
at the last time there was actually food

1688
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,860
present,
which is why we're all wired to overeat.

1689
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:52,310
And this ability to,
uh,

1690
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,940
to use the byproduct of the fabric 
capitalism to fuel the brain.

1691
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,910
So ketones actually the brain loves to 
run on ketones.

1692
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,433
Uh,
one of the things that happens in 

1693
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,100
particularly in endurance contest,
and I suspect that happens in mma fights

1694
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:06,470
toward the end of the fight is,
um,

1695
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,151
you know,
you,

1696
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:09,350
you feel gassed and you run out,
you starting to,

1697
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,510
to run low on glycogen and you're 
starting to,

1698
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,823
um,
to really feel like the wheels are 

1699
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:15,900
coming off.
More often than not,

1700
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:19,050
it's a brain just is a lack of glucose 
to the brain.

1701
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:23,070
The brain isn't being powered enough and
the brain goes a timeout.

1702
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:23,904
We gotta,
we gotta,

1703
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,800
we gotta pull over the side of the road 
and take a nap.

1704
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,873
So it'll make you mentally exhausted 
because your body's running on glycogen 

1705
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:32,670
and glucose rather than exactly.
Exactly.

1706
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:33,504
So,
so when you run out of glycogen and 

1707
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:38,850
glucose,
the old theory was,

1708
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,833
well,
the reason that you hit the wall in any 

1709
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:42,630
of these events are you bonk,
as they say,

1710
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:43,863
uh,
is because you've depleted glycogen so 

1711
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:46,800
much.

1712
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,380
The muscles can't function anymore.
Well,

1713
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:50,214
the research now shows that you'd never 
really deplete the glycogen in the 

1714
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:56,670
muscles.
If you go from 500 or 600 grams total in

1715
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,920
the body,
you never get lower than one 50.

1716
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:01,140
So there's always some glycogen laughed.
So what's going on?

1717
01:12:01,141 --> 01:12:04,290
Well,
it's the brain and its lack of access to

1718
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:07,410
glucose that is shutting you down.
And Tim noakes,

1719
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:08,244
the guy we talked about,
professor Tim noakes at the beginning 

1720
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:10,920
of,
of the show here,

1721
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,193
um,
he coined a phrase that the central 

1722
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:14,520
governor theory of the brain,
and he said,

1723
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:17,760
the reason a lot of people hit the wall 
isn't because you're out of glycogen.

1724
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:21,300
But it's because the brain as an 
override mechanism says,

1725
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,390
in order to prevent further damage,
we have to stop.

1726
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:25,830
And,
and it,

1727
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:26,843
it manifests itself as a system,
as a sensation of tiredness and 

1728
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,473
whatever.

1729
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,010
Now,
if you could find a way to bypass that,

1730
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,390
uh,
and,

1731
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:39,390
and keep the brain going,
because remember,

1732
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:41,070
it's,
it's the brain running on glucose,

1733
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,640
uh,
that once it runs out of that fuel says,

1734
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,590
um,
I'm sensing there's no fuel,

1735
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,440
so we're going to pull over.
So that's what ketones do.

1736
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:53,640
So when you become good at accessing 
stored body fat in producing ketones,

1737
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,140
and you've built the metabolic 
machinery,

1738
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,300
particularly in the brain,
to use those ketones,

1739
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,003
and we know from history and from 
genetics and from modern science that 

1740
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,320
that the brain runs really well on 
ketones.

1741
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,710
Now you founded a substitute fuel for 
glucose,

1742
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:11,640
so you can run out of glucose and yet 
the ketones will keep the brain,

1743
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,860
you know,
revving and uh,

1744
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,220
and,
and guiding you at the same pace again,

1745
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:20,580
provided you've done the,
the work in the gym to maintain the,

1746
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,740
um,
the form and the power.

1747
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:23,851
Uh,
and it's,

1748
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:25,170
uh,
so you know,

1749
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,650
this is all,
I'm going to say kind of theoretical now

1750
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:30,930
because the real world records haven't 
been broken yet.

1751
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:32,370
Some are being broken in the ultra 
events,

1752
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,204
the hundred mile run.
There are a number of guys doing 

1753
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:38,850
ketogenic and low carb training who are 
breaking records like crazy.

1754
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,203
I'm Zack bitter is a guy who in the in 
the lab has shown that he could derive 

1755
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:48,591
96% of his total energy running seven 
minute miles from fat.

1756
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:52,403
So,
in other words,

1757
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,830
it's seven minute miles,
which is like race pace for,

1758
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,000
I mean it's,
what am I saying,

1759
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:57,834
race based sprint pace for most people.
It's not that fast for a marathoner or 

1760
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,590
even an elite runner and elite runner,
but it's a,

1761
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:08,850
it's a substantial patient for,
for a guy running a hundred miles a,

1762
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:09,684
it's a pretty good clip.
And to derive 95 to 96% of all energy 

1763
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,363
from your stored body fat or from 
exaggerates Fathi or eating and just a 

1764
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:21,880
tiny bit required from glycogen or 
glucose.

1765
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,283
I mean I think 30 or 40 years ago we 
would've said not only was that 

1766
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:26,854
impossible,
that was like twice as it twice times 

1767
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:29,224
impossible.

1768
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,940
Well,
the benefit of that for athletes has got

1769
01:14:31,941 --> 01:14:32,774
to be incredible in terms of motivation,
in terms of enthusiasm towards the end 

1770
01:14:36,411 --> 01:14:37,244
of the race or an end of a fight or 
something along those lines where your 

1771
01:14:39,951 --> 01:14:40,784
body would run out of the glycogen into 
glucose and instead you have fat to 

1772
01:14:44,211 --> 01:14:45,440
burn.
So your,

1773
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,280
your mind doesn't drop off as much.
Your mind doesn't hit that wall.

1774
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,530
Right.
That should be she,

1775
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,393
I mean,
that alone should be motivation for 

1776
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:55,280
people to at least attempt to pursue 
that.

1777
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:56,200
Yup.
Now,

1778
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,380
when it comes to highly glycolytic,
uh,

1779
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,660
experiences like mma and you know,
you can't,

1780
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,610
you can't derive a us a substantial part
of your energy from fat that's still has

1781
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:07,960
to come from,
from glycogen.

1782
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:08,711
Why is that?
Well,

1783
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:09,570
because,
uh,

1784
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,830
there's a point at which,
uh,

1785
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,910
your,
your throughput of oxygen,

1786
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:15,160
you know what I'm talking about,
endurance athletes,

1787
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,280
they're measuring their output over two,
three,

1788
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,380
seven hours.
You know,

1789
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:21,790
now you're talking five,
five,

1790
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:22,690
five minute,
uh,

1791
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:24,920
now you've got a,
uh,

1792
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,013
you know,
you got to that same output is 

1793
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,810
concentrated now and you're going,
um,

1794
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,600
at a,
at a fairly high rate.

1795
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:32,231
Although,
you know,

1796
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:33,064
I,
you see them,

1797
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,263
you know,
they're jumping around and dancing 

1798
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:36,790
around and you know,
moving back and forth.

1799
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:37,624
So there's recovery periods in there,
but you still have to have that hundred 

1800
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,583
percent intense glycolytic output.
So when you're in a hold and trying to 

1801
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:45,490
escape or when you're,
you know,

1802
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:47,920
you're trying to defend her and try to 
come in for a barrage,

1803
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:50,440
you have to be at 100% of,
of output,

1804
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,600
but it's brief periods of time.

1805
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:57,630
So conceivably you could train in the 
gym to access that part of,

1806
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:03,220
of your body that Burns fats that Burns 
ketones.

1807
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,241
Um,
you know,

1808
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:06,310
almost the most important part would be 
making weight.

1809
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,390
You know,
if you,

1810
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,550
if you're look,
especially in mma,

1811
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:12,190
it's about power to weight ratios to a 
certain extent.

1812
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:13,540
I mean,
there's a lot of obviously skill,

1813
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:14,920
but,
but a power to weight ratio.

1814
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:15,970
If I'm,
if I'm,

1815
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,130
you know,
142 pounds,

1816
01:16:18,131 --> 01:16:19,540
I don't know what the weight with the 
divisions are,

1817
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,810
but if I'm,
if I'm carrying around,

1818
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:27,730
I'm at one 65 and I have to cut down to 
one 42 to get to my division.

1819
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,230
Um,
I'm going to lose power.

1820
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:31,480
But if I maintain that power and I 
never,

1821
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:35,620
I never even get up to one 65 anymore 
because I'm not gaining fat because I've

1822
01:16:35,621 --> 01:16:38,350
learned how to burn fat and I could stay
effective and functional at,

1823
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,273
at,
at the weight that I'm at that has 

1824
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:41,740
benefit,
you know,

1825
01:16:41,741 --> 01:16:43,570
and it's a power to weight ratio 
concept.

1826
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,150
You would have to have some sort of a 
hybrid diet then yes.

1827
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:48,720
In,
in something like mma.

1828
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,650
Yeah,
it was so,

1829
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:50,483
so once you've built the metabolic 
machinery to burn fat and to burn 

1830
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,260
ketones,
it doesn't go away when you start eating

1831
01:16:55,261 --> 01:16:56,190
carbohydrates.
So you can,

1832
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,310
you can do what we call this cyclical 
approach where you spend,

1833
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,380
uh,
in,

1834
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,213
in the early phases of your training,
you become really good at burning fat 

1835
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,200
and,
and you do stuff that's,

1836
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,453
that's contemplated to,
to make you the best possible fat 

1837
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:09,650
burner.
You can pay a,

1838
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:12,470
then you might introduce some 
carbohydrates,

1839
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:13,363
uh,
the day before a really hard glycolytic 

1840
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:17,450
workout.
It doesn't,

1841
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,343
that doesn't turn off your fat burning.
That doesn't even really negatively 

1842
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:25,190
impact your ability to handle ketones if
you do it for six weeks.

1843
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:26,600
And you do nothing but cars for six 
weeks,

1844
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:27,434
then it all shifts back again.
Upregulation and downregulation of of 

1845
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:34,160
enzymes based on gene input,
a gene expression.

1846
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:37,700
But if you built the metabolic machinery
and you keep coming back to it,

1847
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,370
then you can craft a strategy where you 
say,

1848
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:41,660
well,
tomorrow we're just going to do,

1849
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,730
um,
100% glycolytic stuff.

1850
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:47,480
It's gonna be be prepared to puke all 
afternoon or whatever.

1851
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,070
You have a,
you know,

1852
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,933
150 grams of carbs and the sweet potato 
that for dinner that night you topped 

1853
01:17:52,941 --> 01:17:55,310
off your glycogen stores,
you're still good at burning fat.

1854
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,480
You have all the glycogen that you even 
could possibly have loaded if you'd just

1855
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:02,660
been a carbohydrate based athlete ever 
since.

1856
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,063
You just pick the,
the times when you're going to up the 

1857
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:06,854
ante with,
with ex extra carb intake and you make 

1858
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:10,250
sure it's not sugar,
but it's,

1859
01:18:10,251 --> 01:18:11,390
you know,
a good,

1860
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,793
um,
you know,

1861
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:13,683
a starchy carb in this case,
something like a sweet potato or you 

1862
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,690
know,
yam or something like that.

1863
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,890
So how do you regulate the amount of 
sugars that are in your body?

1864
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:24,260
Do you limit the amount of fruit that 
you eat?

1865
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,300
Do you uh,
or how do I,

1866
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,170
can you eat as much fruit as you like or
is that not a good idea?

1867
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,760
It's just not a good idea.
It's just,

1868
01:18:31,761 --> 01:18:32,630
it doesn't,
uh,

1869
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,690
most fruit,
some amount of fruit is good.

1870
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:38,180
But I think what,
what cracks me up is number of people to

1871
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:40,550
say I'm on a,
I'm on a very healthy diet.

1872
01:18:40,551 --> 01:18:41,384
I'm eating a,
you know,

1873
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:42,853
12 servings of fruit a day and I go to 
Jamba juice and I get a big fruit 

1874
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:46,550
smoothie and I go,
dude,

1875
01:18:46,551 --> 01:18:48,710
you're taking it more sugar than,
you know,

1876
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:50,690
the guy is drinking two,
six packs of coke.

1877
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,500
So even sugar that comes from fruit is 
not necessarily healthy.

1878
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,380
Correct.
Now again,

1879
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:59,720
all these things exist on a spectrum,
right?

1880
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,110
I might have blueberries every day 
because I love blueberries.

1881
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,970
Grew up in Maine,
you know,

1882
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:06,650
picking them wild.
So I love blueberries,

1883
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,170
but they're low in sugar,
they're Tart,

1884
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:12,590
they've got antioxidants in them,
and I don't overdo them,

1885
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,650
but you know,
you will limit yourself to like a cop or

1886
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:16,280
something like that.

1887
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:21,280
I don't even limit at look at for 99 a 
pack for organic blueberries.

1888
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:26,120
I limit myself based on budget,
not on right on any other metric.

1889
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:27,163
Um,
how many servings of fruit will you 

1890
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:30,080
allow yourself in a day?
Oh,

1891
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:34,610
just because I don't feel the need to 
eat fruit.

1892
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:35,750
It doesn't,
it doesn't,

1893
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,900
I don't have a craving for it.
Um,

1894
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:41,540
maybe made a,
maybe two servings is the most elliot in

1895
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,374
a day.
Some days.

1896
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,000
None.
Um,

1897
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,560
but I don't,
you know,

1898
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:46,940
bananas,
um,

1899
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,803
some of the citrus fruits,
some of these things can be way over 

1900
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:53,570
done pretty quickly.
And I'm not necessarily saying don't eat

1901
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:56,570
fruit.
I'm just saying don't consider fruit the

1902
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:59,390
healthiest possible alternative to,
you know,

1903
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:00,224
bread and pasta and then replace all of 
the calories you've got from bread and 

1904
01:20:02,511 --> 01:20:05,660
pasta and cereal and whatever.
Don't replace that with fruit,

1905
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:06,883
but figure out a way,
like vegetables for the most part are 

1906
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,120
the ideal source of carbohydrates in our
diet.

1907
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,880
They're locked in his fibers matrix.
Um,

1908
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:15,900
it's,
you know,

1909
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:16,943
they're basically low glycemic index,
so they kind of drip into the 

1910
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:22,140
bloodstream at a,
at a reasonable pace.

1911
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:27,141
Don't cause a huge surge in glucose.
So celery with coconut butter would be a

1912
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:31,110
much healthier alternative than a 
banana.

1913
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,910
That's it.
Again,

1914
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,930
not that healthy.
Healthier is the wrong term.

1915
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,430
And we were making choices here based on
what we're trying to accomplish.

1916
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:39,960
No good or bad,
no right or wrong,

1917
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:40,771
but,
but in a,

1918
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:41,604
in a,
in a,

1919
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,070
you know,
like in a perfect world,

1920
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,260
celebrate the coconut butter is a great 
choice.

1921
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:49,050
And a banana at the right time is maybe 
a better choice,

1922
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:51,300
like postworkout bananas,
good choice.

1923
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,440
I mean,
it depends on who you are.

1924
01:20:52,441 --> 01:20:56,250
If I fast after the workout too,
because that's kind of interesting.

1925
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:57,683
There's so much of,
of these little nuanced science bits 

1926
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:02,790
that you pick up.

1927
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:03,623
And I've been in the supplement business
for 30 years designing supplements for 

1928
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:08,244
other companies.
And one of the supplements I made a 

1929
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,060
bunch of years ago,
um,

1930
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,920
for a very large company today,
um,

1931
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,413
was a post workout drink and everybody 
loved it and everybody thought it was 

1932
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,400
the greatest thing they'd ever tasted.
And it was in,

1933
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:21,810
it had,
um,

1934
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:22,933
uh,
you know,

1935
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,730
had it had carbohydrates and it had some
protein.

1936
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:28,290
It had some creatine and it was great 
drink.

1937
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:29,903
But the purpose of the drink was to 
recover from the hard workout you did 

1938
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,603
today.
So you could do the bitch again 

1939
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:40,380
tomorrow.
And that's not how I train anymore.

1940
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:44,610
So I don't do two hard days in a row.
So for that particular purpose,

1941
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:47,760
if you're going to train hard every day 
and you want to replace glycogen,

1942
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,820
then that's a strategy.
And that's a choice.

1943
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:51,570
If he say,
well,

1944
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:53,910
we're going to do some hard glycolytic 
work today,

1945
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:55,350
we're going to,
for whatever reason,

1946
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,180
going to do some hard glycolytic work 
tomorrow,

1947
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,630
then then let's have a post workout,
high carb,

1948
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,340
relatively high carb,
um,

1949
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,580
supplement because there's this window 
in which the body manufacturers glycogen

1950
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:11,370
refills glycogen stores at a higher 
rate,

1951
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:12,503
just workout.
That was the whole reason for the 

1952
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:14,763
postworkout meal.
That's why people like to drink 

1953
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:18,570
chocolate milk.
Exactly.

1954
01:22:18,630 --> 01:22:21,780
Exactly.
But if you are,

1955
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,910
um,
you know,

1956
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,000
so,
so if you're going to go,

1957
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,710
uh,
from day to day,

1958
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,540
then that's probably a good thing.
Now,

1959
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:31,350
another strategy would be to go really,
really hard today.

1960
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:33,240
Do a deep leg day and then fast.
Well,

1961
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:34,074
what happens when you fast is you don't 
replenish the glycogen but you preserve 

1962
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:39,084
the pulse of,
of growth hormone and testosterone that 

1963
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:41,784
happens as a result of the leg day,
which we you would otherwise blunt by 

1964
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,460
taking in a sugary drink.

1965
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,720
Whoa.
Okay.

1966
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,430
So again,
these are,

1967
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:51,603
it's,
it's,

1968
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:54,450
it's complex and yet it's pretty cool.
The science is pretty cool.

1969
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:56,860
So,
uh,

1970
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:58,400
insulin,
uh,

1971
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,890
has an effect on growth hormone and 
testosterone actually lowers it.

1972
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,370
So if you are eating a,
were a,

1973
01:23:05,371 --> 01:23:06,204
a post workout meal that's high in carbs
because you want to refill the glycogen 

1974
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:11,710
stores so that you can do it again 
tomorrow.

1975
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,033
Um,
then the postworkout meal will cause a 

1976
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:19,570
rise in insulin,
which will blunt the glycogen,

1977
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,463
excuse me,
the growth hormone and testosterone 

1978
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:26,341
pulse that you got from that workout.
But you'll have glycogen stores slightly

1979
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,290
more ready for the hard work out again 
tomorrow.

1980
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,420
Now what are you trying to accomplish 
here?

1981
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:35,500
What what I'm saying is I'd rather just 
do the workout really hard,

1982
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,610
get all of the benefits,
the growth benefits then looking for and

1983
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:43,420
not have to do it again tomorrow I want 
to work as little as pot I want.

1984
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:44,313
If I want to do a leg day and Puke,
you know because of it today I don't 

1985
01:23:48,311 --> 01:23:51,520
want to do it again tomorrow.
I only working out to get the benefits.

1986
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,500
I'm not working out for the sake of 
working out.

1987
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:57,970
I'm not working out every single day 
because I just love to go to the gym and

1988
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,430
some people do by the way,
and I'm not going to judge that,

1989
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:01,653
but if I'm working out to get the most 
amount of benefits I can from the work 

1990
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:09,571
that I've chosen to do and in this case 
that includes my strategy post workout.

1991
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:11,800
That makes sense.

1992
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,633
It does,
but it's fascinating because I've never 

1993
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,120
heard that before.
There's a catch 22.

1994
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:21,121
So refueling the glycogen levels 
actually deplenishes though it blunt.

1995
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,370
Blunt is the best word.
Yeah.

1996
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,430
Deplenishes I sent even a word.
I like it.

1997
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:28,323
You make it up.
Let's trade trade market right now to 

1998
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,440
plan it.
Just,

1999
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,750
I said it like it was real too.
Um,

2000
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,720
but I've never heard that before.
So there's,

2001
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,570
there's gotta be catch 22 in there then 
it seems like.

2002
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:46,770
So is there a negative effect of having 
those hard workouts more than one day in

2003
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:49,330
a row?
And would you be better off in,

2004
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:54,040
would you gain more if you went the way 
you're doing it by not replenishing,

2005
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,080
I'm saying you do.
Wow.

2006
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,093
Now it's even for an elite athlete 
that's competing in a sport like say 

2007
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,170
mixed martial arts or something along 
those lines.

2008
01:25:02,171 --> 01:25:02,380
Yup.
Well,

2009
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,213
it depends on what the game plan is for 
the week and what the game plan is to 

2010
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:10,000
get you into the ring or to get you to 
the starting line.

2011
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,860
And in this case,
if,

2012
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,860
if we say,
um,

2013
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,920
you know,
you're doing,

2014
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,500
um,
uh,

2015
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,110
let's just use a leg day again,
you know,

2016
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:23,050
you're doing hard legs,
you don't want to do it again tomorrow.

2017
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:23,884
So there's no need to,
to take the post workout drink because 

2018
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,013
here's what else.
The other thing that happens is if you 

2019
01:25:31,061 --> 01:25:34,450
have,
if you wait a couple of hours,

2020
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:37,000
maybe you have an hour or two,
you have a meal,

2021
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,640
but it's not even a high carb meal.
It's just a regular meal.

2022
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,650
It's not high carb.
It's not contemplated to,

2023
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:46,720
to increase glycogen stores,
but within that meal and within the next

2024
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:49,110
meal and within the next meal,
your body will riff.

2025
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:51,370
It'll replenish glycogen.
Eventually it'll,

2026
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:52,690
it,
it wants to do that.

2027
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,553
It's not,
you're not preventing it from 

2028
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:58,891
replenishing glycogen.
So there's no immediate urgency to do it

2029
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:01,540
with a,
with a post workout drink.

2030
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,403
If the meals for the rest of the day or 
the next morning have some amount of 

2031
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,124
carbohydrate,
some of which will go to replenishing 

2032
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:10,363
glycogen.
So you might wind up instead of having 

2033
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,880
restored,
you know,

2034
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:16,220
275 grams of glycogen.
Yeah.

2035
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,133
Restore 230 big deal.
What about the benefits of forcing your 

2036
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:22,774
body to do more work to up your 
conditioning level and would that be 

2037
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:32,671
mitigated or wood with some like what 
you will your strategy being too,

2038
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,593
not replenish the stores after the 
workout and to not have those hard 

2039
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:41,020
workouts two days in a row?
If you,

2040
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:45,260
if you instead had the hard workout 
when,

2041
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:49,180
through your idea of allowing your body 
to have its natural,

2042
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,033
uh,
uptake of testosterone and growth 

2043
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:52,264
hormone because of that hard workout,
then giving yourself adequate time to 

2044
01:26:54,821 --> 01:26:57,430
recover before engaging in the next hard
work.

2045
01:26:57,431 --> 01:26:58,264
I would you in fact have more progress 
then keeping slamming your head up 

2046
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:03,880
against the wall,
which is at least with like,

2047
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,730
uh,
wrestlers and for mixed martial artists,

2048
01:27:06,731 --> 01:27:07,564
a lot of the time that's the standard 
operational approach is to beat your 

2049
01:27:10,301 --> 01:27:11,134
body down to be absolutely exhausted.
And you think that's in fact maybe 

2050
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,880
counterintuitive?
I totally think,

2051
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:17,480
I totally think that is wow.

2052
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,410
I mean,
the,

2053
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,900
the notion that,
um,

2054
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,130
and again this is during sports and,
and mixed martial arts are,

2055
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:28,440
are very similar in it's about pain 
management.

2056
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:29,850
It's about,
it's about managing,

2057
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:33,300
um,
literally a pain and perceive pain,

2058
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,880
um,
and a exertion over time.

2059
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,160
Um,
so you know,

2060
01:27:38,161 --> 01:27:39,590
to the extent that you can,
um,

2061
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:41,363
that you can train in the gym in 
selective areas that all come together 

2062
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,910
in the fight.
That's a legitimate choice.

2063
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,013
But another choice and the one for the 
last 30 years is sort of the rocky 

2064
01:27:51,811 --> 01:27:52,644
Balboa choice,
which is just go hard every single day 

2065
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:57,460
and build up the cause.
Maybe when it comes up,

2066
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:58,830
maybe it's the,
you know,

2067
01:27:58,831 --> 01:28:02,170
the fifth round and mental toughness,
um,

2068
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:06,960
really comes to play there and you're 
able to dig deeper just because you know

2069
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:07,794
how to beat yourself up.
So it's not to say that one's better 

2070
01:28:10,171 --> 01:28:12,180
than the other,
they're just alternative strategies.

2071
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:14,190
One of the greatest runners the country 
ever produced.

2072
01:28:14,191 --> 01:28:15,024
Steve Prefontaine was fairly talented.
He was not the most talented runner in 

2073
01:28:19,021 --> 01:28:20,430
the world.
And,

2074
01:28:20,431 --> 01:28:21,210
uh,
and he would,

2075
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:23,760
he would go to the starting line and 
he'd look at some guy who was,

2076
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:28,920
who was clearly a more talented but 
hadn't had,

2077
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:29,783
they'd run the Sim similar times and 
Prefontaine would look them in the face 

2078
01:28:31,771 --> 01:28:32,581
and go,
dude,

2079
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:33,414
he said,
you may be more fit and more talented 

2080
01:28:34,261 --> 01:28:36,360
than me,
but I'm willing to die for this.

2081
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,030
I'm willing to hurt more.
And,

2082
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:39,090
and he was,
and that's,

2083
01:28:39,091 --> 01:28:40,200
he could dig,
dig deep.

2084
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:44,350
And maybe it was a result of his hundred
and 20 mile weeks of training and,

2085
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:45,184
and beating himself up every day.
I suppose there's value in that in a 

2086
01:28:48,451 --> 01:28:52,530
sport where you know,
from the time that gun goes off till the

2087
01:28:52,531 --> 01:28:53,364
time you cross the finish line,
you never sang to yourself in a 

2088
01:28:56,101 --> 01:28:56,580
marathon.

2089
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:57,630
Fuck,
this is fun.

2090
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,220
Let's do this again.
You know,

2091
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:00,600
you never know if you're at the elite 
level,

2092
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:01,800
you never that,
right?

2093
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,800
So it's about pain management.
And there's,

2094
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,693
there's a legitimate strategy in maybe 
having some days where you do what I 

2095
01:29:10,471 --> 01:29:15,471
outlined and some days or some weeks 
where you do what you outlined is,

2096
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:17,100
are they mutually exclusive though?
Like,

2097
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:17,940
here's the question.
Like,

2098
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:21,600
do you have to beat yourself up in order
to be mentally tough?

2099
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:24,000
Can't you be mentally tough just through
meditation?

2100
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,420
I don't think you have to beat yourself 
up to be mentally tough.

2101
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:29,760
And the danger there is you literally 
beat yourself up,

2102
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:33,810
but the dangerous you overtrain and 
maybe that,

2103
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,673
maybe doing that and trying to force 
yourself into these mentally tough 

2104
01:29:37,741 --> 01:29:38,574
exercises is actually a form of weakness
because you're not able to look at your 

2105
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:44,400
body objectively.
You're not able to assess it.

2106
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,350
And more of a scientific fashion.
I mean,

2107
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:47,250
I'm telling you,
back in the,

2108
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:51,810
back in the day when I was doing 
training for marathons and triathlons,

2109
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,800
I defined myself worth as based on the 
previous workout I'd done,

2110
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,083
you know,
and you skip a day and you feel like a 

2111
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:03,830
slacker and hoser and a loser.
Um,

2112
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:05,490
and,
and yet,

2113
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:06,940
um,
I,

2114
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:07,783
oh,
I was chronically overtrained all the 

2115
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:11,670
time.
I wish I had those days back because,

2116
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,060
you know,
I would have,

2117
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,820
I would,
my career would have been extended.

2118
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,920
On the other hand,
if I had him back,

2119
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:17,754
I probably wouldn't have arrived at 
where I am today through the pain and 

2120
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:22,010
the suffering and the sacrifice,
you know,

2121
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:24,240
trying to figure out how to fix that.
Yeah.

2122
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,010
Yeah.
Um,

2123
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:29,040
my friend Steve Maxwell,
who's a strength conditioning coach,

2124
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:29,903
says that you should monitor your heart 
rate every morning and if your heart 

2125
01:30:34,261 --> 01:30:37,560
rate is over a certain beats per minute,
it's over what?

2126
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,980
It's naturally normal,
five plus beats per minute.

2127
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,990
You just take the day off.
That's one.

2128
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,380
That's one modality.
That's one protocol.

2129
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,540
Um,
there's now heart rate variability,

2130
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:49,374
which,
which looks beyond what the heart rate 

2131
01:30:51,151 --> 01:30:51,984
is.
It looks at the,

2132
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,823
at,
at the time between the beats and 

2133
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:58,590
suggest that if there's greater 
variability,

2134
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,560
if there's more time or there's,
there's you know,

2135
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:02,394
0.8 seconds here and 1.1 second here and
0.7 and 1.1 that that's better than 

2136
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:07,494
having 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9.
It's sort of counterintuitive because 

2137
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:10,524
you'd think the heart,
you'd want the heart to beat 

2138
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:12,500
metronomically.
Yeah.

2139
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,810
But if it's beating metronomically it's 
a sign of overtraining annually.

2140
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:18,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2141
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:19,890
It's a sign of,
even if it's a low heartbeat.

2142
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,580
Um,
so correct.

2143
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,430
If you wake up and you got 40 beats per 
minute,

2144
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:25,380
but they're all the same equal beats.
Yeah.

2145
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:26,520
That's not going to happen.

2146
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,353
It's typically going to be higher with 
if you've overtrained as well as having 

2147
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:35,480
a metronomic interval to it now.
Um,

2148
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,443
but there are programs you can get so 
you can wear your heart monitor and get 

2149
01:31:38,881 --> 01:31:39,714
these hrv heart rate variability 
programs and they'll literally tell you 

2150
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:45,270
what the score you for the day till he's
use those.

2151
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,440
I don't,
um,

2152
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:50,520
primarily because,
um,

2153
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:53,640
I have a premature ventricular 
contractions,

2154
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,940
so I'm,
I'm now at 62.

2155
01:31:56,941 --> 01:31:59,980
I've been doing this for 40 years.
Um,

2156
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,730
actually 50.
I started running when I was 12 a to and

2157
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,430
from school,
just like that nut brown African lad,

2158
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:09,820
you know,
with my converse,

2159
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:10,654
uh,
you know,

2160
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,890
uh,
sneakers on.

2161
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:12,724
And,
um,

2162
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:16,450
so I've been doing this a long time and 
I spent so much of my career,

2163
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,680
stupidly,
foolishly,

2164
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,440
my heart rate,
heart rate out every day.

2165
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,030
So I've,
uh,

2166
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,400
I've,
I've written about this for the last two

2167
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:25,234
decades about how training for endurance
competition is somewhat antithetical to 

2168
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:30,970
health and certainly training the way we
used to,

2169
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,960
which is accumulating miles and miles 
and miles in,

2170
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:34,450
in,
uh,

2171
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:34,870
in,
uh,

2172
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:36,520
at a heart rate that we call the black 
hole,

2173
01:32:36,521 --> 01:32:38,290
which is,
um,

2174
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:42,400
it's too high to benefit,
uh,

2175
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,190
on a regular basis,
but too low to,

2176
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:46,053
um,
to create sort of the interval training 

2177
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:47,980
deal.

2178
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:48,813
It's,
uh,

2179
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:51,160
uh,
it again explain it in the book,

2180
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:56,161
but we,
we spent years and years and years,

2181
01:32:56,231 --> 01:33:01,231
decades training a lot of athletes at 
say anywhere from 75 to 85% of their max

2182
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:04,330
heart rate for an hour,
two hours,

2183
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:05,470
three hours at a time.
We'll,

2184
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:07,090
over time the heart responds to that and
gets,

2185
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,583
it gets thicker,
the heart muscle gets thicker and 

2186
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,630
thicker.
Um,

2187
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:14,650
partly it's like the heart can't,
it doesn't have a say in it.

2188
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:17,380
So your brain tells your legs to run 
right in the heart goes,

2189
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:19,060
shit,
I gotta I gotta keep up with this cat.

2190
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:21,010
So the heart's pumping away in,
pumping away,

2191
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:23,020
in pumping away.
And if you do this enough,

2192
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,543
day in,
day out,

2193
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:25,870
day out,
over years,

2194
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,900
the heart starts to get damaged a little
bit.

2195
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:29,734
And in some cases it gets thicker.
The ventricle gets thicker and thicker 

2196
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:33,220
because it's growing muscle.

2197
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:33,911
Yeah.
But it's,

2198
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:34,270
it's,
uh,

2199
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:36,490
it's not necessarily a good kind of 
thicker,

2200
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,260
so it's,
um,

2201
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,870
it may be stretched,
you know,

2202
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:41,560
too much.
It may just not have,

2203
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:44,110
it may not recover.
When you go to the gym and you say,

2204
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,280
we're going to do,
uh,

2205
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:46,533
you know,
uh,

2206
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:49,720
200 preacher curls of 75 pounds,
you know,

2207
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,430
you're,
you're going to say,

2208
01:33:51,431 --> 01:33:52,390
well,
you know,

2209
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:53,224
my boss,
well maybe your biceps can handle that 

2210
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:54,994
Joe,
but my camp.

2211
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,193
So,
um,

2212
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,100
you know,
cause they'll,

2213
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,360
they'll fry,
they'll shred,

2214
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:00,010
but they feel it.
You feel it.

2215
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:01,570
The pain is there.
Well,

2216
01:34:01,571 --> 01:34:02,980
the heart doesn't feel that kind of 
pain.

2217
01:34:02,981 --> 01:34:06,790
So if you force the heart to calf to 
keep up and it's a demand Oregon,

2218
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:07,624
it just,
it just feeds whatever the demand is 

2219
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:11,360
from the body.
Uh,

2220
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:14,440
and if that's held at too high a heart 
rate for too long,

2221
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:17,380
over decades,
it can manifest itself in problems.

2222
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:20,560
There's item,
there's an epidemic of Afib,

2223
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:24,700
atrial fibrillation in my generation of 
runners from that very problem.

2224
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,080
So anyway,
having said that,

2225
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:29,440
so I have the occasional premature 
ventricular contraction,

2226
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,630
which is just a couple of cells in the 
heart,

2227
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:34,630
maybe a thickness in the ventricle that 
misfire every once in a while.

2228
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:36,580
It's not,
it's not life threatening.

2229
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:37,960
It's not,
it's just annoying.

2230
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,423
But it,
it,

2231
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,383
it makes my hrv look really good cause 
because there's big interval between 

2232
01:34:44,171 --> 01:34:45,280
beats sometimes,
you know,

2233
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:47,230
but it's an,
it's a false positive.

2234
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:49,450
Wow.
That's fascinating.

2235
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,420
So you don't necessarily monitor your 
heart rate because of that?

2236
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,313
No.
So you kind of more go on the way you 

2237
01:34:55,391 --> 01:34:56,290
feel.
Yeah.

2238
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,380
And again,
as you know,

2239
01:34:57,381 --> 01:34:58,730
I'm at my,
at my age,

2240
01:34:58,731 --> 01:35:00,530
I just want to have fun.
I just want to play.

2241
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:01,580
I,
I don't,

2242
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,600
I'm not seeking to win any age group 
competitions anymore.

2243
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,760
Those days are long behind me.
It hurts too much.

2244
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:08,510
It,
it's,

2245
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,920
it's too much.
You know,

2246
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:10,754
I'm,
I'm trying to extract the greatest 

2247
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:12,590
amount of pleasure out of my life.
So when I,

2248
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:16,100
when I go to the gym,
it's pretty much contemplated to,

2249
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,890
um,
to do as little as possible.

2250
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:21,680
That keeps me looking good naked.
But also,

2251
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,320
uh,
it keeps me somewhat immune from injury.

2252
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,940
It's a very honest of your brother or 
whatever,

2253
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:27,340
you know,
a lot of,

2254
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,650
I don't even care about that anymore.
Yeah,

2255
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:30,111
yeah.
No,

2256
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:31,790
I still going to care about that until 
the day I die.

2257
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:32,650
But,
uh,

2258
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:33,643
but,
but,

2259
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,550
but for the most part it's about,
um,

2260
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,640
it's about avoiding injury when I'm 
playing.

2261
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:39,530
So if I'm playing Frisbee,
you know,

2262
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:40,760
I'm,
I'm sprinting,

2263
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:41,291
uh,
I'm,

2264
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:46,291
I'm keeping up with 20 somethings on a,
on a long bomb run to the end zone a and

2265
01:35:46,821 --> 01:35:47,654
then have to come up,
turn around and come back and get them 

2266
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:50,324
on defense.

2267
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,320
Um,
that,

2268
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,630
that,
that has some cost attached to it.

2269
01:35:53,631 --> 01:35:55,940
Some,
some metabolic costs for an old guy like

2270
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:57,500
me.
So the stuff I do in the gym is trying,

2271
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,690
is trying to keep me from getting 
injured,

2272
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,913
knock wood and uh,
and then I spent time on the paddle for 

2273
01:36:03,831 --> 01:36:07,100
two hours and it's a best upper body 
workout you'll ever get paddling.

2274
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,960
Stand up paddling.
Yeah.

2275
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,970
And uh,
um,

2276
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,160
you know,
it's fun and I don't think,

2277
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,570
Oh God,
when's he going to be over?

2278
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:15,291
I'd think,
Oh shit,

2279
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,460
I gotta get back cause I've got a 
meeting,

2280
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:17,294
you know,
I'm out hanging out with dolphins and 

2281
01:36:17,871 --> 01:36:20,420
whales and looking down at fish and 
catching the wave once in a while.

2282
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:22,160
So I'm trying to,
I'm trying to have,

2283
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,650
I'm trying to have fun.
When I,

2284
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:24,910
when I moved,
when I workout,

2285
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,960
I did some,
uh,

2286
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,823
paddling a few years back.
I did a canoe trip down the Missouri 

2287
01:36:30,011 --> 01:36:31,420
River and,
uh,

2288
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,190
it was,
I was shocked at how tired my arms got.

2289
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:37,240
I'm like,
this is like a legit workout.

2290
01:36:37,241 --> 01:36:38,650
Like I thought I was in pretty good 
shape.

2291
01:36:38,651 --> 01:36:39,484
I'm like,
it's going to be nothing paddling St 

2292
01:36:41,351 --> 01:36:42,071
Shit.
No,

2293
01:36:42,071 --> 01:36:42,340
no,
no.

2294
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,240
It's hard.
It takes a good shots when w,

2295
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:45,460
you know,
after paddling,

2296
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,300
and that's how I tr I treated it as a 
workout too.

2297
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,540
Just decided like,
okay,

2298
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:51,220
we're doing this for a couple hours a 
day.

2299
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:52,870
I'm going to go hard.
I'm going to just,

2300
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:54,670
I'm going to leave it all out there on 
the river,

2301
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:55,983
you know?
And we were with some other guys who 

2302
01:36:56,761 --> 01:36:58,240
were under the boat.
I was trying to kick their ass.

2303
01:36:58,450 --> 01:36:59,283
So I was just trying to stay ahead of 
them the entire way and calling them 

2304
01:37:01,481 --> 01:37:03,460
pussies and yelling at them.
Yeah.

2305
01:37:03,461 --> 01:37:05,010
But it's great.
It's lat work out.

2306
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:05,940
It's Serratus,
you know,

2307
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:07,150
it's deltoids,
it's everything.

2308
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,440
One of the big issues with a Jujitsu 
competitors and,

2309
01:37:11,441 --> 01:37:14,230
uh,
people just practice even as a hobby is,

2310
01:37:14,231 --> 01:37:16,840
um,
is a joint injuries,

2311
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,500
inflammation in the joints and um,
and also spine injuries,

2312
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:23,170
a lot of bulging discs,
a lot of things along those lines.

2313
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,513
Do you think that some of that can be 
mitigated by reducing the amount of 

2314
01:37:28,810 --> 01:37:30,160
inflammatory foods?

2315
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:31,671
You know,
you,

2316
01:37:31,671 --> 01:37:35,270
you,
you've got such a trauma based sport,

2317
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:38,300
um,
maybe a little,

2318
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:39,200
you know,
if you're,

2319
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:40,633
uh,
if you're 10% less prone to getting the 

2320
01:37:42,831 --> 01:37:45,530
disc issue or um,
or the joint,

2321
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,740
the joint pain as a result.
But a lot of that is just the brute,

2322
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,620
just the brute force of the impact and,
and uh,

2323
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,970
you know,
that's just,

2324
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,920
that's a choice that you make to be in 
those sports.

2325
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,130
Well,
I'm not

2326
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,040
even impact like with grappling,
a lot of it is just,

2327
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,820
it's just twisting and twisting and 
constant pressure and yeah,

2328
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,073
just the day to day grind.
I think Jujitsu is one of those sports 

2329
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:12,000
where a lot of recreational 
practitioners who get really addicted to

2330
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:13,380
it because it's really fun.
You know,

2331
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:14,214
you're essentially,
you're having a life or death struggle 

2332
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:19,530
with someone and you can tap out and 
then go right back at it.

2333
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:21,620
And it's,
it's very different than a lot of other,

2334
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:23,550
other martial arts in that way that you 
can,

2335
01:38:23,551 --> 01:38:26,400
you can kind of do it a full blast,
right.

2336
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,750
Whereas sparring,
like kickboxing and things along,

2337
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,613
you really can't do it full blast for 
very long because the body just can't 

2338
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:33,750
take it.
The head can't take it.

2339
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:34,613
Especially.
Yeah.

2340
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:37,140
Um,
but with Jujitsu,

2341
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:40,950
a lot of guys are injured then they,
they just wrap themselves up and kind of

2342
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:42,440
go back in where they say,
oh,

2343
01:38:42,441 --> 01:38:46,260
I'm just going to roll light and my next
bother may just lay off my neck.

2344
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,450
And I always wonder,
like,

2345
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:49,284
is there maybe a dietary choice that 
could perhaps limit the amount of 

2346
01:38:53,071 --> 01:38:56,040
inflammation that you're experiencing 
after these brutal workouts?

2347
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:56,941
It depends.
I mean,

2348
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:57,660
if the,
if the,

2349
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:01,680
if the Diet is currently horrendous,
then just probably some amount of,

2350
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,460
some amount of,
um,

2351
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:04,290
of,
uh,

2352
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:05,123
you know,
uh,

2353
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,240
management of that,
that could,

2354
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,340
that could be increased in pain 
management.

2355
01:39:08,341 --> 01:39:10,950
Could be a little bit better and less 
inflammation for sure.

2356
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:14,330
But if the Diet's already good,
then um,

2357
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,293
you're still,
you're still putting the body through 

2358
01:39:17,191 --> 01:39:18,024
some unnatural torsions.
I'm just amazed that we were talking 

2359
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:23,700
about your hands and arthritis deep into
your forties,

2360
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:27,030
that you were able to mitigate that just
by changing your diet.

2361
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,860
It was so powerful.
It was a,

2362
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:29,694
it was really,
actually the most powerful thing for me 

2363
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:32,874
was the ibs cause it,
it literally ruined my life or ruled my 

2364
01:39:35,461 --> 01:39:36,180
life.

2365
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:36,990
Um,
but,

2366
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,640
but the arthritis thing was like,
I mean,

2367
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:39,474
I play golf with friends and I was like,
I can't even grip the frig and club the 

2368
01:39:42,751 --> 01:39:43,584
way I need to.
Yeah.

2369
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,260
And now you have no bag.
I'd meet you and I go,

2370
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:47,940
shit,
is joe going to try to out bro,

2371
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:49,030
shake me,
you know,

2372
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,880
and take roads,
take me to the ground with,

2373
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:51,803
you know,
with a,

2374
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,180
with a firm grip.
Have it when they get the tips here.

2375
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,010
Oh Geez.
All silver.

2376
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,930
Those tapes of the fingers guys were 
shit.

2377
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,620
I hate those fucks.
Yeah.

2378
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:02,250
Um,
so that's,

2379
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:04,440
that's very well,
I'm very careful.

2380
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:05,274
Shaking hands too,
because I know a lot of people with 

2381
01:40:06,661 --> 01:40:07,494
broken hands cause yeah,
fighters especially like after fights 

2382
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,553
you have to be real careful.
Like I give them like the most gentle 

2383
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,110
handshake possible.
Um,

2384
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,040
what other,
um,

2385
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:24,080
what other ways do you think there are 
dietary ways to reduce information other

2386
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:28,190
than a reduction of grains or,
or elimination of grains?

2387
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:29,043
Know I say if you,
if you get rid of the industrial seed 

2388
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:33,450
oils,
so you replace the soybean oil,

2389
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:35,970
the canola oil,
the corn oil,

2390
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:36,883
and,
and look at the labels of the 

2391
01:40:37,801 --> 01:40:39,600
ingredients because they're all over the
place.

2392
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,833
The different,
what's the different mechanism in the 

2393
01:40:42,061 --> 01:40:42,894
body as far as like the way your body 
processes s soy or corn oil versus 

2394
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:50,520
coconut oil is the profile of fatty 
acids.

2395
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:51,623
These are polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Sometimes they're partially 

2396
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:54,490
hydrogenated,

2397
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:56,500
sometimes they've got,
they've been processed with,

2398
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:57,334
um,
sort of nasty processing agents like a 

2399
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:00,643
nickel.
And,

2400
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:02,470
uh,
they've been,

2401
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:06,040
uh,
they've undergone enough alteration that

2402
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:06,874
maybe they contain some transfats.
Transfats are known to be 

2403
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,900
proinflammatory.
Um,

2404
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:12,820
uh,
the Omega six,

2405
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:15,520
by the way,
Omega six in and of themselves are not,

2406
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:17,590
they're not bad.
They're,

2407
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:19,690
there's Omega three,
there's or make a six or nine to seven.

2408
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:20,411
There's 12.
There's all these,

2409
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:21,244
but the three to six ratio is the one 
that's gotten the most pressable s 

2410
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,400
decade omega three fatty acids that are 
found in,

2411
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:27,980
uh,
you know,

2412
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:29,080
uh,
fish,

2413
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,303
krill oil or fish oil,
things like that that just supplement 

2414
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:33,220
with fish oil a little bit.
Yeah.

2415
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,530
Not a lot,
but a little bit,

2416
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:37,120
um,
couple of capsules,

2417
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,470
um,
every other day.

2418
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,250
Oh,
really?

2419
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,083
Other day.
Yeah.

2420
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,450
Uh,
and I,

2421
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:42,780
and I manufactured them too.
I mean,

2422
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:44,320
it's part of my,
my,

2423
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:45,580
um,
my line of products,

2424
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:48,550
but because my diet is pretty much based
on,

2425
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:49,703
um,
uh,

2426
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:53,390
an otherwise healthy intake of Omega 
threes and more importantly,

2427
01:41:53,391 --> 01:41:54,520
a reduction of Omega six.

2428
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,563
So it's,
it's not the Omega threes are by 

2429
01:41:56,741 --> 01:41:57,574
themselves.
Antiinflammatories they are and Omega 

2430
01:42:00,311 --> 01:42:02,950
six are proinflammatory,
but it's this ratio.

2431
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:04,203
Um,
there's some requirement for Omega six 

2432
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,230
in the body,
but when the ratio gets way thrown off,

2433
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:10,180
it tends to be a pro inflammatory 
reaction.

2434
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:11,014
Where do Omega six has come from?
That those are the industrial seed oils 

2435
01:42:13,271 --> 01:42:14,104
that we talked about.
So there's a slight benefit to having 

2436
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:17,460
some industrial seed.
Well,

2437
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:17,711
no,
no,

2438
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:20,170
there's a slight benefit to having omega
six from other sources.

2439
01:42:20,171 --> 01:42:21,610
So what are the other sources?
Um,

2440
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:22,331
you know,
any,

2441
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:24,500
any most,
uh,

2442
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:27,110
fish.
We'll also have oh six.

2443
01:42:27,170 --> 01:42:27,731
Um,
you know,

2444
01:42:27,731 --> 01:42:28,541
they're,
they're everywhere.

2445
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:31,110
They're in any kind of fatty food,
um,

2446
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,070
nuts.
We'll have them.

2447
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,400
Uh,
uh,

2448
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,253
that's probably the source of most 
people on the Paleo movement get the 

2449
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:39,610
Omega six from.
Um,

2450
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,050
but yeah,
it's,

2451
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:44,680
it's about sort of the totality of the 
Diet,

2452
01:42:44,681 --> 01:42:45,980
not,
and,

2453
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:48,490
and it's largely a result,
again,

2454
01:42:48,491 --> 01:42:49,324
of what you're not eating,
what you eliminate from the Diet that 

2455
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:52,690
has the greatest effect,
not what you're reading.

2456
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:53,590
So when people say,
well,

2457
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,611
Paleo Diet,
I mean,

2458
01:42:54,611 --> 01:42:56,680
I've had such great results on the Vegan
Diet,

2459
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,230
or I've had great results on a,
you know,

2460
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:00,250
in some Vegetarian Daddy,
oh,

2461
01:43:00,251 --> 01:43:01,120
well,
you know,

2462
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:01,954
you're,
you're not eating the same shit we're 

2463
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:03,904
not eating.
So the fact that you get your protein 

2464
01:43:05,741 --> 01:43:06,574
from plant sources,
I'm maybe gonna suggest you could have 

2465
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:12,670
more protein,
but it's not that big a deal.

2466
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:13,504
It's really about what you've eliminated
that that has the greatest impact on 

2467
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:17,480
your health.
Yeah,

2468
01:43:17,481 --> 01:43:18,090
I

2469
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:21,240
have conversations like that often with 
people that are Vegan.

2470
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,880
When they start talking about all the 
different things they eat,

2471
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:25,740
how much better they feel,
and then I tell them,

2472
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:28,110
listen,
I eat all the same things you eat.

2473
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:31,140
Like my diet is pretty vegan other than 
meat.

2474
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,250
Yeah.
I mean,

2475
01:43:32,251 --> 01:43:33,690
most of what I,
like this morning,

2476
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,730
what I had,
I drink a Kale shake.

2477
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:38,820
So I blend Kale with cucumbers and I 
know it's gross,

2478
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:43,560
but it makes me feel amazing.
I blend Kale with cucumbers,

2479
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:45,270
garlic,
um,

2480
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:48,920
celery,
ginger and pear.

2481
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:52,150
I throw a pair in and a I that up.
Oh

2482
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:52,993
and a half a beat.
I blend that all up and I had an elk 

2483
01:43:55,821 --> 01:43:58,850
stake.
So the two things together,

2484
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,990
that's,
that's what I eat.

2485
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:01,520
That's my lunch,
you know,

2486
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:03,050
that's what I had.
I didn't eat breakfast.

2487
01:44:03,051 --> 01:44:04,200
I just ate lunch today.
And how does it,

2488
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,350
how does the Kale shake tastes like 
shit.

2489
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:07,520
Yeah,
it doesn't as good.

2490
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,413
One of my rules is,
one of my rules is I don't put anything 

2491
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:12,614
in my mouth.
It doesn't taste awesome and it feels 

2492
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:14,810
good man.
I'm telling you,

2493
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:15,644
I eat that.
I get this burst of nutrients I'm going 

2494
01:44:17,741 --> 01:44:18,830
to,
I'm going to keep doing it.

2495
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:19,693
All right,
well I'm not going to terrible with a 

2496
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:22,220
full pair in.
Yeah.

2497
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,510
You know,
cause the full pair,

2498
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:25,490
I mean so big Bartlett,
pear,

2499
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,830
a little bit of garlic.
Very,

2500
01:44:27,831 --> 01:44:29,510
yeah,
it's very sweet.

2501
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,010
Yeah.
But is that too much sugar?

2502
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,660
That one pair?
It's,

2503
01:44:32,661 --> 01:44:33,494
it depends on how much,
what your sugar load is over the course 

2504
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:35,690
of a day.
If that's,

2505
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:39,110
if that's the only sugar you get.
Pairs are pretty high and you know,

2506
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,100
they're pretty high in sugar.
But um,

2507
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,303
if the whole pair,
I don't think I eat a pear before yoga 

2508
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:46,790
class too.
That's what I was,

2509
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:50,550
that that gets me through a yoga class 
cause I got pairs.

2510
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:51,950
Your favorite fruit or something like 
pears.

2511
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:52,940
Wow.
Is that okay for you?

2512
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:54,530
It's totally good.
I just get the first,

2513
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:57,080
first guy I've known it's favorite fruit
as a payer.

2514
01:44:57,110 --> 01:44:58,580
Really.
I mean I like a pair,

2515
01:44:58,581 --> 01:44:59,480
but I said,
ah,

2516
01:44:59,481 --> 01:45:02,180
I like mangoes.
Mangoes are my also favorite.

2517
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:02,930
Those are awesome.
Yeah,

2518
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:05,000
I,
I'd take sliced so I'll do that.

2519
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:06,760
What would we be better?
Pears and mangoes,

2520
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:08,300
I guess.
No difference.

2521
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:09,134
Difference,
difference.

2522
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:12,020
But fruit is what I usually choose 
before I work out.

2523
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:12,853
But now I'm thinking that maybe fruit is
a little too high in sugar listening to 

2524
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:19,070
you or I should limit the amount of it I
have in a day.

2525
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:20,421
And again,
if you,

2526
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:21,254
if,
if you like where you're at and 

2527
01:45:22,251 --> 01:45:24,800
everything's good and life is wonderful 
and you enjoy it,

2528
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:26,150
then I'm not going to tell you to stop 
doing it.

2529
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,700
Well,
I'm all about optimize them.

2530
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:28,613
I mean,
I,

2531
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:31,460
um,
if I can chug down those Kale shakes,

2532
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:34,220
I'm obviously willing to eat some 
horrible shit to feel better.

2533
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,420
Um,
this is not,

2534
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:36,810
it's not that horrible.
I,

2535
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:41,060
I kind of exaggerate a little bit how my
tolerance for gross food is pretty high.

2536
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:41,894
I can,
I can,

2537
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:42,883
I can eat it.
Jerry eat any of that shit on fear 

2538
01:45:45,351 --> 01:45:45,861
factor?
Yeah,

2539
01:45:45,861 --> 01:45:47,120
I hit a bunch of good,
good.

2540
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,310
I uh,
I balls,

2541
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:50,360
sheeps,
eyeballs.

2542
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:51,590
I super worms.

2543
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,341
Those,
those worms,

2544
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:55,080
they use a on cadavers cleanup bones.
Yeah.

2545
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,970
I ate a tomato hornworms it was pretty 
gross.

2546
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:02,320
I ate a Madagascar hissing cockroaches.
That was the one that was at,

2547
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,160
that's the one I think it would have 
drawn the line in.

2548
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,540
That one was the easiest to do.
Yup.

2549
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:09,230
Yeah.
It's all psychological but that's chewy.

2550
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,470
But it's very mild.
Like it has almost no flavor.

2551
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:15,500
It was all just in your head.
That was no big deal at all.

2552
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,140
The really hard things to eat.
It's really interesting.

2553
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:18,974
The smells were probably the hardest 
part and a big factor in the smell was 

2554
01:46:25,401 --> 01:46:26,234
the um,
he would add this really expensive 

2555
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:31,640
cheese.
They would go to this beverly hills.

2556
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,390
What is up for module?
What is it?

2557
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,860
One of those fucking places called where
they sell the cheese for Masuri.

2558
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,083
Anyway,
it was a very expensive type of French 

2559
01:46:40,911 --> 01:46:45,230
cheese that just smells like fucking 
death because cheese,

2560
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:50,250
a big part of what makes a cheese 
fragrant or interesting is the culture,

2561
01:46:50,251 --> 01:46:51,870
which is actually bacteria.

2562
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:52,763
Yeah.
So we would buy this bacteria laden 

2563
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,003
cheese that smelled so fucking bad.
They would take it and they would open 

2564
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,204
the little cup,
the little plastic tub in front of me 

2565
01:47:02,431 --> 01:47:04,380
and sticking from,
oh.

2566
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,341
They'd be like,
dude,

2567
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:07,890
that shit is expensive.
Really expensive.

2568
01:47:07,891 --> 01:47:08,724
And we would throw that into like a 
blender full of maggots and that's what 

2569
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:15,240
would make it disgusting.
The maggots on the,

2570
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:18,150
on their own.
That's really didn't have that much of a

2571
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,380
smell or taste.
Yeah.

2572
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:21,810
It's more psychological than it is 
anything.

2573
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:24,390
Yeah.
A lot of stuff on fear factor.

2574
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:27,480
And then there was a lot of,
it was just the sheer volume.

2575
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:29,640
Like they would have to drink,
you know,

2576
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:33,450
a gigantic blender,
phil with his horrible shit.

2577
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:36,570
And there's the amount of mass that 
you're putting in your body and you have

2578
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:39,750
like three minutes to do it or whatever 
and keep it down and keep it down.

2579
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2580
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,393
I think we gave them like they had to 
keep it down for like 30 seconds or 

2581
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:44,514
something like that.
So that at the end of that 30 seconds 

2582
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,540
they would sprint towards everybody 
hurl.

2583
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,490
Oh yeah.
I saw more people.

2584
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:55,730
I probably seen more people throw up 
then like a very small percentage of the

2585
01:47:57,061 --> 01:47:59,520
population than most ers.
Right?

2586
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:00,513
Yeah.
Well maybe ers would have me like 

2587
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,470
nightclub bouncers might have me,
if you,

2588
01:48:04,471 --> 01:48:06,870
if you put in 20 years as a nightclub 
bouncer,

2589
01:48:06,871 --> 01:48:09,750
you'd probably see more people puke than
me because you're seeing it every night.

2590
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:11,720
Maybe it was only one day a week.
Yeah.

2591
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:15,540
But one day a week I'd watch it at least
two people just fucking hurl.

2592
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:19,290
Just raw projectile vomit.
Yeah.

2593
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:20,420
But,
uh,

2594
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:22,590
again,
more psychological than anything,

2595
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:23,671
you know,
the,

2596
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:25,350
uh,
the actual taste of those things,

2597
01:48:25,351 --> 01:48:26,880
especially the roach was nothing.

2598
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,520
It's like really no big deal.
Like if I was,

2599
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,663
was,
I was starving somewhere and I found 

2600
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:35,040
like a,
a big batch of a hissing cockroaches,

2601
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:35,874
those Madagascar ones,
I would definitely scoop those up and 

2602
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:38,460
eat them.
Well,

2603
01:48:38,461 --> 01:48:39,294
you know,
um,

2604
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:40,543
uh,
there's a,

2605
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:41,493
a bar company called Xo that makes their
bars out of cricket protein and I'm an 

2606
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:48,870
investor in their company there and I'm 
fascinated by the concept that,

2607
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,213
that uh,
you know,

2608
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,233
billion and a half,
2 billion people around the world eat 

2609
01:48:52,501 --> 01:48:54,240
insects all the time and think nothing 
of it.

2610
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,750
Yeah,
well that's what a lobster is.

2611
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:57,953
One of the things that we found out when
we did fear factor was if you have an 

2612
01:48:59,941 --> 01:49:02,850
allergy to shellfish,
you also have an allergy to roaches.

2613
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:08,090
We found that out the hard way because a
guy who listed shellfish as an allergy,

2614
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:09,023
eight,
a roach and got really sick and we had 

2615
01:49:10,081 --> 01:49:12,180
to take him to the Er,
they got to give him an adrenaline shot,

2616
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:13,283
the whole deal.

2617
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:16,830
So the,
the enzymes apparently are very similar,

2618
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:18,053
but you can eat those bugs and there's 
the very high in protein and very good 

2619
01:49:21,571 --> 01:49:24,300
for you.
And they can also be an excellent source

2620
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:28,260
of protein for a inexpensive source of 
protein.

2621
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:31,800
For a lot of people it's the cricket 
thing is very sustainable.

2622
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:35,180
It's like 20 times less resources,
fewer resources to,

2623
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,730
to an equivalent amount of,
uh,

2624
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,830
of steak and also equivalent amount of 
amino acids.

2625
01:49:40,831 --> 01:49:42,840
It's like a very good profile.
Yeah,

2626
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:43,733
that's really fascinating to me that you
could get like really high quality 

2627
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:47,154
protein from,

2628
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:50,080
yeah,
we're,

2629
01:49:50,081 --> 01:49:52,300
we're prejudice against bugs I guess.
I mean,

2630
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:55,060
I'm trying not to be anymore.
Do you eat your bars?

2631
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,860
Oh yeah.
Get all the time.

2632
01:49:56,861 --> 01:49:58,540
All the time.
All the time.

2633
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:02,140
Just because I don't,
I don't use those kinds of snacks.

2634
01:50:02,141 --> 01:50:04,260
I make my own bar,
but because they,

2635
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,210
the guys who started expo are really 
onto something and they're trying to,

2636
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,750
they're trying to change the way the 
world thinks about sourcing protein.

2637
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,093
So the first hurdle you have to overcome
is making a bar tastes great and not 

2638
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:19,630
turn people off because it's cricket 
because it's crickets and you know,

2639
01:50:19,631 --> 01:50:21,940
there's not like heads and antenna 
sticking out of these bars.

2640
01:50:21,941 --> 01:50:22,774
It's a powder.
It's been ground down to a fine powder 

2641
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:25,203
and it basically looks and probably 
taste the same as whey protein isolate 

2642
01:50:28,271 --> 01:50:30,370
does.
Once it's ground down,

2643
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:31,180
down,
down.

2644
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:32,013
Um,
do you lose any of it when you're 

2645
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:36,070
dehydrating in or grinding it down or 
turn away?

2646
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:37,420
It's,
it's,

2647
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:38,253
it retains its properties pretty nicely.
So there's no benefit whatsoever to 

2648
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:43,120
eating it fresh.
Um,

2649
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,381
not necessarily.
No.

2650
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:46,030
I mean,
if you can compact more into,

2651
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:47,530
uh,
I mean that's the beauty of,

2652
01:50:47,531 --> 01:50:52,180
of I think insect protein powder is to 
be able to fortify foods,

2653
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:53,500
uh,
that,

2654
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:54,780
that otherwise,
you know,

2655
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:58,690
rather than having 40 crickets on a 
stick,

2656
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,350
you know,
to,

2657
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:02,590
to have the powder equivalent in a bar 
is kind of a neat way of doing it.

2658
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:05,380
I've eaten crickets like that too.
Like roasted crickets.

2659
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,240
You don't taste bad at all.
Not Bad.

2660
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:08,450
It's all in the head.
Yeah,

2661
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:09,820
it really is.
It's all in your mind.

2662
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:10,371
Like you,
you,

2663
01:51:10,371 --> 01:51:11,204
you chew them,
they're crunchy and they're broasted 

2664
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:14,320
over a fire.
They're actually not bad at all.

2665
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,513
I mean,
they're sold as delicacy in the streets 

2666
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:17,621
of sure.
You know,

2667
01:51:17,621 --> 01:51:19,060
in Bangkok and most of Asia.

2668
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:19,893
Yeah.
Especially if you put some spices on 

2669
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:21,514
them or some point that they can 
actually be quite tasting like maybe 

2670
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,930
some butter or some oil and some spices 
on them.

2671
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:27,183
Yeah.
We have these ideas about different 

2672
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:30,570
things that are good to eat and not good
to eat.

2673
01:51:30,571 --> 01:51:34,660
And since more based on custom than 
anything and a lot of ways,

2674
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:35,893
yeah.
I wonder how many people that are vegan 

2675
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:39,310
would be willing to eat bugs,
you know,

2676
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:43,090
Vegan as far as I know it goes against 
their religion,

2677
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,620
which I don't even want to use honey.
No,

2678
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:45,610
I it's,
it's crazy.

2679
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:47,223
That's funny you say that because we've 
got a bar that we just introduced with 

2680
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:53,470
grass fed whey protein isolate and,
and uh,

2681
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:56,050
um,
it's got collagen in it.

2682
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:57,610
It's a great bar.
Um,

2683
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:02,670
and we tried to bake one for the Vegan 
community and because it has honey in it

2684
01:52:02,831 --> 01:52:04,930
is as a suite near the Vegan said,
well we can't,

2685
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,480
we can't eat cause it has honey,
it's bs,

2686
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,700
you know,
that's there's are slaves,

2687
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:11,560
man.
Yeah.

2688
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:14,830
Whatever.
Okay.

2689
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,480
Whatever they want.
You know,

2690
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,620
you want to go that way.
Yeah.

2691
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,563
Honeys.
Awesome.

2692
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:19,983
It fucks.

2693
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:26,410
Is there any like nutritional benefit to
being a Vegan or is it an deficits,

2694
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:27,370
you know,
it's involved in it.

2695
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,103
Um,
I think that's probably some foods that 

2696
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:33,880
you're not getting that would provide a 
micro nutrients,

2697
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:37,660
the micro nutrition that would be 
beneficial to you in the long run.

2698
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:41,350
And,
and yet the human body is so frigging,

2699
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:42,710
uh,
adaptable to,

2700
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:45,290
to any sort of dietary strategy.
I mean,

2701
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,610
you know,
you see,

2702
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,440
uh,
eight foot tall,

2703
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,970
uh,
Africans,

2704
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:50,833
you know,
the go play in the NBA that grew up on 

2705
01:52:52,911 --> 01:52:53,510
a,
you know,

2706
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:56,580
500 calories a day and cow patties.
Um,

2707
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,400
you know,
during the Irish potato famine,

2708
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:01,640
people live for six weeks on shoe 
leather and seaweed.

2709
01:53:01,641 --> 01:53:03,890
I mean,
the human body is pretty adaptable.

2710
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:06,640
So you on that one hand,
um,

2711
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,633
you can't describe the perfect diet.
So if you're choosing to be Vegan and 

2712
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:14,630
that's what you want to do and,
and you're mindful about it,

2713
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,660
um,
and you're not militant about it and not

2714
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:19,550
trying to convince everybody else that 
that's what they ought to do,

2715
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:20,990
then then go for it.

2716
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:22,440
Well,
that doesn't exist yet.

2717
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,860
So few.
That's,

2718
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,390
that was a requirement.
That's the Unicorn Fart.

2719
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,650
A requirement of membership.
Yeah.

2720
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:31,610
Um hmm.
What,

2721
01:53:31,970 --> 01:53:32,990
like what,
what are the,

2722
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:36,110
there's a few plants that do have a 
full,

2723
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:37,760
complete amino acid profile,
right?

2724
01:53:37,761 --> 01:53:39,950
Like keen Wa is one of them.
Yeah.

2725
01:53:39,951 --> 01:53:41,480
I mean there's great plants.
I don't know,

2726
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:44,060
I wouldn't say they have a full amino 
acid profile.

2727
01:53:44,061 --> 01:53:45,680
It's what's lacking.
Well,

2728
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:47,240
there's probably,
if there's nothing lacking,

2729
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:48,103
it's the,
it's the relative amounts that make the 

2730
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:51,620
difference.
So it's a protein efficiency ratio,

2731
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:52,700
right?
Uh,

2732
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,510
the,
the,

2733
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,343
the,
um,

2734
01:53:55,190 --> 01:53:57,480
the protein amino acid score that,
that,

2735
01:53:57,481 --> 01:53:59,560
uh,
really determines whether a protein is,

2736
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,490
is exceptional and that's where the,
you know,

2737
01:54:01,491 --> 01:54:03,470
meat and eggs and,
and,

2738
01:54:03,471 --> 01:54:04,160
uh,
you know,

2739
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,890
that dairy and things that someone was 
trying to describe that to me,

2740
01:54:06,891 --> 01:54:11,330
the amount of Broccoli you would need to
get the same amount of protein and amino

2741
01:54:11,331 --> 01:54:14,270
acids as an eight ounce steak,
something insane.

2742
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,370
It's like two pounds of Broccoli.
Yeah.

2743
01:54:16,371 --> 01:54:17,690
I still,
I don't think it's insane.

2744
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:18,524
I just think it's a cause.
Ll those same people will argue that 

2745
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:22,080
there's,
um,

2746
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:24,740
there's,
you know that it's a on a,

2747
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,100
on a,
I think it's on a per pound basis.

2748
01:54:27,101 --> 01:54:29,000
It's almost like it has the same amount 
of amino acids.

2749
01:54:29,001 --> 01:54:30,740
I forget where I,
where I heard that some,

2750
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:31,574
some Vegan side of that to me and I,
I know that broccoli does have some 

2751
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:35,534
amino acids in it.
You just have to eat a big bowl of it 

2752
01:54:37,041 --> 01:54:38,420
and if you're a Vegan,
that's what you do anyway.

2753
01:54:38,421 --> 01:54:39,630
So,
uh,

2754
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:42,630
I'm not going to criticize that choice.
I just think that um,

2755
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:43,663
if you're missing certain amino acids,
you better balance it with something 

2756
01:54:45,891 --> 01:54:48,830
coming from lagoons or some other 
source.

2757
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:49,813
You have to figure out what amino acids 
are lacking based on what plant protein 

2758
01:54:52,711 --> 01:54:53,544
in the human diet was always based on a 
wide variety of things that you were 

2759
01:54:55,791 --> 01:54:57,050
taking it and just,
you know,

2760
01:54:57,051 --> 01:54:58,760
not,
not just one kind of thing,

2761
01:54:58,761 --> 01:55:01,130
but something off of this Shrub,
off of this Bush,

2762
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:05,300
out of this ground and the tuber here 
and some quail eggs here.

2763
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:05,950
And,
you know,

2764
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:09,420
it was always a 200 different choices,
uh,

2765
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,363
within a five mile radius or whatever.
You can just get whatever you get your 

2766
01:55:12,921 --> 01:55:14,570
hands on it.
And that's where the insects came in.

2767
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:15,800
That's where the,
you know,

2768
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,010
we don't talk about,
you know,

2769
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:17,863
amphibians,
but imagine living on frogs and snakes 

2770
01:55:20,131 --> 01:55:21,740
and,
and eggs and,

2771
01:55:21,741 --> 01:55:22,790
uh,
uh,

2772
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,280
you know,
in wheat grass and just,

2773
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:25,400
it's,
uh,

2774
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:28,640
it's pretty amazing the variety of foods
that we can eat.

2775
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:31,220
So typically you start your morning off 
with butter,

2776
01:55:31,221 --> 01:55:32,054
coffee with mct oils,
which I don't just eat a regular coffee 

2777
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:35,900
and it's regular.
That's just,

2778
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,830
I don't,
I don't,

2779
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,010
I'll have a buttered coffee every once 
in a while,

2780
01:55:40,011 --> 01:55:43,110
but I don't,
I don't feel like I need the calories to

2781
01:55:43,111 --> 01:55:45,150
get my day going.
I just want the cup of coffee.

2782
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:46,620
You just want the caffeine,
just want the caffeine.

2783
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,770
And I actually don't want to,
um,

2784
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:52,260
I don't want to interfere with burning 
off my own body fat.

2785
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,040
So,
uh,

2786
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,440
not that it interferes with it,
but that's 500 calories that,

2787
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:56,593
that or 250 calories coming out of the 
coffee that otherwise just coming off 

2788
01:55:59,791 --> 01:56:00,840
my,
you know,

2789
01:56:00,841 --> 01:56:02,700
my gut.
Interesting.

2790
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,223
So when you wake up in the morning,
it's all dependent upon how hungry you 

2791
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:08,790
are.
Yeah.

2792
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:09,953
So if you're hungry,
maybe then you'll have some butter 

2793
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:13,410
coffee.
And if you're not hungry,

2794
01:56:13,411 --> 01:56:15,110
it was her regular coffee,
black,

2795
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:16,920
a nod,
a little bit of cream,

2796
01:56:16,921 --> 01:56:20,340
but just enough to color it and like,
uh,

2797
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:22,350
your first meal of the day,
it's probably lunch.

2798
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,091
Yup.
And what did,

2799
01:56:23,091 --> 01:56:24,380
what does that,
uh,

2800
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:27,000
usually a salad.
I have a big ass salad,

2801
01:56:27,001 --> 01:56:27,990
I call it.
And uh,

2802
01:56:28,110 --> 01:56:28,943
it's um,
it's lots of Greens and some form of 

2803
01:56:31,711 --> 01:56:32,544
protein might be salmon,
might be chicken from last night's 

2804
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:37,140
dinner,
might be a tuna.

2805
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:39,530
Um,
well what size?

2806
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,190
Like an eight ounce portion.
Now it's a bitch.

2807
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:42,053
No,
I mean,

2808
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,530
no,
not much protein.

2809
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:44,393
I,
that's the other thing that I've 

2810
01:56:44,911 --> 01:56:47,940
realized over the years is that we don't
need that much protein.

2811
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:50,460
And even if you're doing work in the 
gym,

2812
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,593
you know,
you don't need 200 grams of protein a 

2813
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:53,410
day.
That's bullshit.

2814
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:55,350
You just can't process that.
What is that from?

2815
01:56:55,351 --> 01:56:56,184
That's from a bodybuilding power lifting
my town that's from the muscle and 

2816
01:56:59,491 --> 01:57:00,324
fitness days.
And that's from Dave draper and his 

2817
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,830
fricking,
you know,

2818
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:05,370
blender full of stuff was dave draper.
Oh my God,

2819
01:57:05,371 --> 01:57:07,500
you don't.
So Dave draper's before your time,

2820
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:08,760
man.
So he was on the original,

2821
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,790
uh,
southern California blond bodybuilders.

2822
01:57:11,791 --> 01:57:14,070
He was in every ad for,
for shakes and,

2823
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:17,670
and mass gainers and things like that.
Mass gain.

2824
01:57:17,671 --> 01:57:19,110
Yeah.
It's all sugar,

2825
01:57:19,111 --> 01:57:20,160
right?
Yeah.

2826
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:22,770
Oh that does it.
That's nasty stuff.

2827
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,920
That's just like cheap cheap ass protein
and high fructose corn.

2828
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,840
Yeah.
They're,

2829
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,700
yeah.
Stayed there.

2830
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:31,290
Yeah.
On the beach.

2831
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:32,610
Hello ladies.

2832
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,250
So that guy,
uh,

2833
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:40,530
would advocate massive amounts,
but I mean that guy,

2834
01:57:40,531 --> 01:57:41,100
you know,
when you,

2835
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:42,810
when you can process,
when you take it in,

2836
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:43,620
uh,
you know,

2837
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:48,090
super human levels of steroids,
you can process all kinds of protein.

2838
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,920
Look at them today.
So today,

2839
01:57:49,921 --> 01:57:52,770
Jamie,
yeah,

2840
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:56,030
still looking pretty good.
He's probably about 70 their yolk.

2841
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,710
60 what?
63 63 right there.

2842
01:57:58,711 --> 01:58:00,600
He's your age.
Yoked is fuck.

2843
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:04,890
Look at them.
Maybe does a little steroids too when we

2844
01:58:04,891 --> 01:58:06,990
think,
do you think could be huh?

2845
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:10,590
But a,
so people using needing protein,

2846
01:58:10,591 --> 01:58:11,011
it's,
you know,

2847
01:58:11,011 --> 01:58:15,600
maybe women probably need 50 to 75,
maybe 80 grams a day.

2848
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,100
Um,
even guys,

2849
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,810
you know,
training fairly hard,

2850
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:21,390
don't no more than 113 hundred 40 grams 
a day.

2851
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:22,313
Now what is,
what's the muscle and fitness mentality 

2852
01:58:25,471 --> 01:58:26,304
or the powerlifting mentality?
It's like there's a certain amount of 

2853
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:31,030
grams per pound of body weight.
Describe.

2854
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:32,250
Well,
you know,

2855
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:33,083
that's all over the place.
So it might've been one gram per pound 

2856
01:58:34,921 --> 01:58:37,680
of body weight at 1.5 grams per pound of
body weight.

2857
01:58:37,681 --> 01:58:39,810
Well,
it's like 200 grams a day for me or,

2858
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:40,621
yeah.
Yeah.

2859
01:58:40,621 --> 01:58:41,980
Graham,
I'm 200 pounds.

2860
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:45,130
200 grams of protein.
That's a shitload of broke.

2861
01:58:45,131 --> 01:58:47,770
How much is a steak?
Like a 12 ounce steak?

2862
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,990
50 60.
But Jesus Christ.

2863
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:50,853
Yeah.
So I'd have to four fucking stakes in a 

2864
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:52,781
day.
Yeah.

2865
01:58:52,781 --> 01:58:55,090
I mean by the time you cook that down,
yeah.

2866
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:56,080
It might be less.
Right.

2867
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:58,210
What about eggs?
How much is it an egg?

2868
01:58:58,211 --> 01:58:59,920
Seven or eight per ticket.
Yeah.

2869
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:02,110
That's why these guys would do a whole 
dozen eggs in there,

2870
01:59:02,111 --> 01:59:03,770
shake.
Um,

2871
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,770
you know,
that'd be 70 or 80,

2872
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:10,060
or 80 or 90 or whatever grams of protein
plus some powder in there.

2873
01:59:10,061 --> 01:59:10,990
And,
but you know,

2874
01:59:10,991 --> 01:59:11,824
the,
what we learned a long time ago was a 

2875
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:15,970
body really can't handle more than 30,
35 grams of protein at a sitting.

2876
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:19,020
So the rest of it turns into,
um,

2877
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,500
you know,
the farts.

2878
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,483
Yeah.

2879
01:59:23,110 --> 01:59:25,060
So if you're,
if you're eating,

2880
01:59:25,061 --> 01:59:25,894
that's one thing.
If you've ever been around people who 

2881
01:59:26,921 --> 01:59:29,770
drink a lot of protein shakes and eat 
protein bars,

2882
01:59:29,771 --> 01:59:33,280
they're farts are brutal like 
bodybuilder type dudes.

2883
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:34,990
And that's just,
they just,

2884
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:36,460
there's too much protein,
right?

2885
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,570
Yeah.
Among other things.

2886
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:38,404
Yeah.
Yeah.

2887
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,750
A lot of that is,
you know,

2888
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,690
they haven't,
um,

2889
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,840
who knows what's going on with their,
with their gut bacteria too.

2890
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:46,270
That's a lot of protein to put in there.
They're probably,

2891
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:47,133
if they're eating that much protein,
they're not eating much of the way of 

2892
01:59:48,911 --> 01:59:51,550
vegetables and those muscle milk type 
supplements,

2893
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:52,384
although there are delicious,
there's a lot of sugar in those damn 

2894
01:59:54,341 --> 01:59:55,031
thing.
Absolutely.

2895
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:56,350
Yeah.
All those bars,

2896
01:59:56,351 --> 01:59:58,240
a lot of bars have a lot of sugar in 
them.

2897
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,970
This is a giant issue.
Yup.

2898
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:01,950
Yeah.
Hmm.

2899
02:00:02,410 --> 02:00:03,450
So,
um,

2900
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:04,393
you think that these guys,
these bodybuilder guys are power 

2901
02:00:06,281 --> 02:00:07,114
powerlifter guys that are operating on 
that inefficient method of one gram per 

2902
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:13,420
pound.

2903
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:16,420
If they had reduced it,
they would still have the same amount of

2904
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:19,120
gains and maybe their body would operate
more efficiently.

2905
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:21,580
Are we talking on juice or off the 
juice?

2906
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:22,301
Oh,
okay.

2907
02:00:22,301 --> 02:00:23,350
That's a good point.
You know.

2908
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,690
Yeah.
So back to your on steroids.

2909
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:28,250
Back to your point about,
um,

2910
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:29,950
you know,
I'm a hard gainer and you know,

2911
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,390
putting on muscle is,
is,

2912
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:32,760
is difficult.
Um,

2913
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:35,080
most people are overweight,
don't want to hear this,

2914
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:38,470
but putting on muscle is much more 
difficult than losing body fat.

2915
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:43,330
You know,
you take a 165 pound guy and you say,

2916
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:44,290
oh,
he says,

2917
02:00:44,291 --> 02:00:46,870
I want to put on 20 pounds of muscle.
Ain't going to happen.

2918
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,910
You know,
might put on 10 pounds of muscle,

2919
02:00:48,911 --> 02:00:52,570
might put on seven over a very focused 
period of time.

2920
02:00:52,571 --> 02:00:55,660
It might have to work hard to keep it on
because that's the body also going.

2921
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:56,763
If you don't create on a daily basis,
my requirement to continue to maintain 

2922
02:01:00,761 --> 02:01:01,594
this muscle mass,
I'm going back down to where it was 

2923
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:03,863
right there.
It seems to me that there's a number of 

2924
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:08,793
days or years or whatever it is that you
maintain that body mass where it starts 

2925
02:01:11,261 --> 02:01:13,240
to become normal.
Then your body says,

2926
02:01:13,241 --> 02:01:14,680
well this is what we way now.
Yeah,

2927
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:16,000
and then you,
you maintain it,

2928
02:01:16,001 --> 02:01:16,834
but there's this touch and go period.
Say if you weigh one 65 and you put on 

2929
02:01:19,451 --> 02:01:20,284
that 10 pounds like,
well you got to keep pushing for a long 

2930
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:23,590
time for your body to say,
listen,

2931
02:01:23,591 --> 02:01:25,690
this is what we way we need all this 
power.

2932
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:26,553
We needed all this horsepower and we 
were going to be able to carry a lot of 

2933
02:01:28,691 --> 02:01:29,920
heavy shit all the time.
Yup,

2934
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:32,290
exactly.
Yeah.

2935
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:34,440
Bring your own honey.
Is that what's going on with no,

2936
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:34,820
no,
no.

2937
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:35,580
Jamie,
what is that?

2938
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:39,410
Oh that's you are honey.
I'm having some which just like to here.

2939
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,720
This guy's serious.
This brings his own hunting.

2940
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:43,071
No,
no,

2941
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:44,420
no,
but honey is good for you,

2942
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:45,470
isn't it now?
Raw honey.

2943
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:46,370
No.
How dare you.

2944
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:47,570
I know.
Who are you?

2945
02:01:48,930 --> 02:01:50,510
It's not.
It's not good for you.

2946
02:01:50,511 --> 02:01:51,344
It's not going to kill you.
You know any that's one of those 

2947
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:54,044
moderation foods.
If you want to use it to like in this 

2948
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:57,830
case I put a couple of drops in the,
in the tea,

2949
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:59,780
but I always hear it's really good.
Like raw honey.

2950
02:01:59,810 --> 02:02:00,740
Did you hear?
Who Do you hear it from?

2951
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:04,010
Not The vegans money that people make,
honey.

2952
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,450
Yeah.
I don't know.

2953
02:02:05,451 --> 02:02:07,540
It's just a,
it's something that I've always heard is

2954
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:10,130
it's not bad.
It's just all sugar.

2955
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,933
It's a form of sugar.
And if you overdo it then it's probably 

2956
02:02:14,511 --> 02:02:16,850
not as wise a decision as to cut it 
back.

2957
02:02:16,970 --> 02:02:17,803
So we got to your launch your launch,
which a big ass out with a small amount 

2958
02:02:20,961 --> 02:02:21,380
of protein.

2959
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:23,630
So maybe like four ounces of protein or 
something along those lines.

2960
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:24,410
Yeah.
Okay.

2961
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:26,300
What piece of chicken or a piece of fish
or something like that.

2962
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,690
And then,
um,

2963
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:29,510
what about dinner?
Um,

2964
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:31,520
dinner.
I like to have a stake.

2965
02:02:31,521 --> 02:02:34,280
I got this Wagyu short rib that I get 
you.

2966
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:37,730
Like that stuff is so good,
but it's all fatty.

2967
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,780
Yeah.
That's the point.

2968
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,980
We like that.
That's the point,

2969
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:41,120
ma'am.
Yeah.

2970
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:42,740
And uh,
cause you liked fat.

2971
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,251
Yeah,
no,

2972
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:44,084
I,
my diet is probably 55% of my calories 

2973
02:02:45,681 --> 02:02:49,970
come from fat,
but Wagyu is a lot of corn fed animal.

2974
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:50,691
All right.
So I'm,

2975
02:02:50,691 --> 02:02:52,730
so I make a little bit of an exception 
there.

2976
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:56,060
Um,
I could get a grass fed when I,

2977
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:56,840
you know,
when I,

2978
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:59,690
when I look forward at a Pc Greens where
I shop in Malibu,

2979
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,020
but um,
or at whole foods or whatever.

2980
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:04,520
But this,
this Wagyu,

2981
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:06,460
uh,
it's just such a delicious,

2982
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:09,800
you like a nice tender juicy steak.
Yup.

2983
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:13,760
Is there any benefit like what are the 
health benefits of eating grass fed meat

2984
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:16,400
and using grass fed cows?
Butter?

2985
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:17,900
Yeah,
it's really interesting because,

2986
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,440
um,
one of the things I,

2987
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:20,333
I just kind of have to raise my eyebrows
add is I hear about grass fed whey 

2988
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:25,810
protein isolate,
right?

2989
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:29,390
So you have grass fed whey protein.
It's whatever they put in the drink.

2990
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:30,224
Well,
the reason you eat grass fed cows is 

2991
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:37,190
because the fatty acid profile is more,
um,

2992
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:38,450
uh,
it's,

2993
02:03:38,451 --> 02:03:40,610
it's a more desirable fatty acid 
profile.

2994
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:41,623
The protein compliment is the exact same
in a corn fed steak or a grass fed 

2995
02:03:46,161 --> 02:03:46,994
steak.
You just can't tell the difference in 

2996
02:03:47,391 --> 02:03:48,224
the protein.
It's the fatty acid profile that's 

2997
02:03:49,251 --> 02:03:50,084
different.
The other difference might be the 

2998
02:03:51,681 --> 02:03:53,240
residual hormones and antibiotics.

2999
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,290
So when they raise corn fed beef and 
they start from an early age,

3000
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:01,250
that's not the,
the cows native diet.

3001
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:04,220
So they,
the cow tends to get sick,

3002
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:07,160
get infected and so these antibiotics 
and they have to use a in,

3003
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:09,980
sometimes he use growth hormone just to 
get them off the lot quicker.

3004
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:12,080
So,
but,

3005
02:04:12,081 --> 02:04:13,160
but the,
the,

3006
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:14,023
the reason to have grass fed beef is the
fatty acid profile is much more 

3007
02:04:17,961 --> 02:04:19,700
desirable.
Uh,

3008
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:21,590
and yet it's still,
it's still fat.

3009
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:25,390
So it's just a couple of different 
versions of stearic acid and,

3010
02:04:25,391 --> 02:04:28,720
and different versions of the saturated 
fat that you're talking about.

3011
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:32,900
So it's not even like this life or death
decision that you make.

3012
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:37,901
Like if I have a wonderful cut of corn 
fed steak,

3013
02:04:38,131 --> 02:04:40,590
I'm going to die.
If I have grass fed a live forever.

3014
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,240
These are just choices.
And if,

3015
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,133
if you,
if you can find a great tasting grass 

3016
02:04:44,611 --> 02:04:45,970
fed steak,
by all means habit.

3017
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:48,900
If you can have a great find a 
relatively inexpensive,

3018
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:51,630
you know,
lined line caught wild salmon,

3019
02:04:51,631 --> 02:04:54,750
that's a probably a better choice for 
your stated goals.

3020
02:04:54,751 --> 02:04:58,290
Then some farm raised salmon.
So yeah,

3021
02:04:58,291 --> 02:05:01,530
the farm raised salmon is a,
it's problematic because of their diet,

3022
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:02,070
right?
Yep.

3023
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,520
But so back,
but just back to the,

3024
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:04,483
the grasp of things.
So when you get to grass fed whey 

3025
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:06,804
protein isolate,
whey protein isolate is 90 to 95% 

3026
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:12,533
protein.
There's,

3027
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:15,270
they took all the fat out of it so it 
doesn't matter.

3028
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:16,553
They all the good fatty acid profile 
that was in it because it was grass fed 

3029
02:05:19,891 --> 02:05:20,724
is now gone.
So it's like a marketing strategy to 

3030
02:05:23,131 --> 02:05:26,040
call it grass fed whey protein isolate.
So it's not bad,

3031
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,290
but it's not any better.
No,

3032
02:05:28,291 --> 02:05:29,880
it's,
it's definitely not bad.

3033
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:30,783
It's,
it's not demonstrably better to have 

3034
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:34,770
grass fed whey protein isolate versus 
just regular.

3035
02:05:34,770 --> 02:05:37,620
What about grass fed butter?
Grass fed butter?

3036
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:38,700
Yeah,
yeah,

3037
02:05:38,700 --> 02:05:39,930
absolutely.
That's all fat.

3038
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:42,180
So that there's,
and there's an example of,

3039
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:43,133
that's the exact opposite.
Now they took all the protein out of it 

3040
02:05:44,401 --> 02:05:48,210
and now just giving you fat.
So grass fed butter is a great choice.

3041
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:50,430
And what is the difference in the 
profile?

3042
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:51,293
The,
the fatty profile of a grass fed butter 

3043
02:05:53,101 --> 02:05:56,130
versus same as it is with the meat.
So it w when is that difference?

3044
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,390
Um,
I can't,

3045
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,253
I can't cite the research and I can't 
cite to break down to the of the fatty 

3046
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:02,004
acids.
It's just that they're more appropriate 

3047
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,093
for a,
a cow that was raised on its native 

3048
02:06:07,411 --> 02:06:10,740
diet.
Pop was the difference between the fact,

3049
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:13,890
cause I've heard it but I can't cite it 
when somebody wants to bring it up.

3050
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:17,220
But I prefer the taste of a grass fed 
meat.

3051
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:18,630
Yeah.
Cause it's a leaner,

3052
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:22,560
like more dense meat.
It's more like wild game.

3053
02:06:22,561 --> 02:06:24,000
Right.
Then um,

3054
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:27,630
like uh,
a ribeye from a cow that's fed corn.

3055
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:28,643
Right.
But you're saying that like health wise 

3056
02:06:30,001 --> 02:06:31,860
had rib eyes pretty good.
Pretty good.

3057
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:33,750
Yeah.
It's more of a fatty cut.

3058
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:34,643
Yeah.
Um,

3059
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,633
so,
but you're saying there's not that much 

3060
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:39,930
of a difference in terms of like the 
health benefits.

3061
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,090
If you can get a,
again,

3062
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:47,120
a humanely raised a cow that was not 
given antibiotics or hormones,

3063
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:50,520
um,
you're pretty close to where you want to

3064
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:51,354
be.
And so I'm suggesting that the fatty 

3065
02:06:52,441 --> 02:06:56,250
acid profile isn't going to be hugely 
different,

3066
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,570
isn't the issue with cows that when you 
give a cow grains,

3067
02:07:00,571 --> 02:07:04,300
their body isn't designed to process it.
So they develop a lot of infections and,

3068
02:07:04,330 --> 02:07:06,090
and that's,
that's why they use the antibiotics.

3069
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:07,800
So isn't that,
I mean,

3070
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:10,680
just automatically problematic if you 
have a grain fed cow?

3071
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:13,050
Not necessarily.
So a lot of times you'll have a cow that

3072
02:07:13,051 --> 02:07:15,240
was raised on grass and then finished 
with grain.

3073
02:07:15,610 --> 02:07:18,240
Um,
and there's different types of grains.

3074
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:20,700
So some it's not automatically 
problematic.

3075
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:21,920
Um,
it,

3076
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:26,040
it could be,
but if you look for the cows that were,

3077
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:27,273
uh,
pastured up until a certain point and 

3078
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:29,461
you know,
again,

3079
02:07:29,461 --> 02:07:30,900
they might've been grass finished,
sometimes they'll,

3080
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:35,070
they'll say grass fed and they won't,
they won't tell you it was grain.

3081
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:38,440
And when they say green finished,
how much time do they spend feeding them

3082
02:07:38,441 --> 02:07:39,700
grain?
It's a couple of weeks.

3083
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,773
That's it.
Yep.

3084
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:41,673
Okay.
So they just fatten up for the last 

3085
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:43,893
couple of weeks before the end.
Yup.

3086
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:45,153
And so they don't have enough time to 
develop a lot of the massive issues of 

3087
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:48,470
they might have if they were,
uh,

3088
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:51,700
in Corinth the whole life in theory.
So,

3089
02:07:51,701 --> 02:07:52,540
um,
you'll,

3090
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:56,440
you'll lead a little bit of steak and a 
steam vegetables.

3091
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:01,270
That's what I have my big plate of 
Broccoli or Broccolini or partial spouts

3092
02:08:01,271 --> 02:08:02,370
or,
you know,

3093
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:05,080
whatever.
And what about like drinks?

3094
02:08:05,130 --> 02:08:09,880
What do you drink mostly?
So I used to drink wine at meals.

3095
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:13,720
I don't drink a lot of water.
I'm a soothing a throat today,

3096
02:08:13,721 --> 02:08:15,280
but um,
with this,

3097
02:08:15,281 --> 02:08:17,950
but normally I wouldn't drink much,
uh,

3098
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:20,560
much water during the course of the day.
I let my thirst mechanism,

3099
02:08:21,010 --> 02:08:22,960
you know,
just sort of tell me what to do.

3100
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:24,730
And I don't get thirsty that often.
I mean,

3101
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:26,860
I used to go on 50 mile bike rides and 
not get thirsty,

3102
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:27,950
so I've got a real,
yeah.

3103
02:08:27,990 --> 02:08:29,200
Yeah.
Is that just weird?

3104
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:31,270
Just you missed,
I know other people like that.

3105
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:34,390
A lot of people are of the belief that 
you should drink water all day,

3106
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:37,390
so you have to pee all the time cause 
you're flushing your body.

3107
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:39,100
I don't,
I don't buy that at all.

3108
02:08:39,130 --> 02:08:40,090
No,
I think it's unnecessary.

3109
02:08:40,091 --> 02:08:40,960
It's probably,
yeah,

3110
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,853
it's,
uh,

3111
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:44,230
I definitely don't agree with that 
concept.

3112
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:45,093
Um,
but you might want to do it once in a 

3113
02:08:46,121 --> 02:08:47,360
while just to,
you know,

3114
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:48,483
do your own little cleanse or whatever.
But I don't think as a rule of thumb 

3115
02:08:50,771 --> 02:08:51,604
that,
that there's any particular health 

3116
02:08:52,451 --> 02:08:57,240
benefit to that put about the toxins,
the toxins out.

3117
02:08:57,250 --> 02:08:58,390
Man,
I didn't pay clear.

3118
02:08:58,391 --> 02:08:59,560
I need to drink more.
Yeah,

3119
02:08:59,710 --> 02:09:00,670
that's,
that's bullshit.

3120
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:02,320
Um,
I think so.

3121
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:03,590
Yeah.
Um,

3122
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:05,620
I know a lot of people who still do it.
I know a lot of,

3123
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,830
you know,
people at the gym bring their gallon jug

3124
02:09:08,831 --> 02:09:12,330
of distilled water in or whatever the 
hell it is really bad.

3125
02:09:12,340 --> 02:09:13,031
Right.
Ros,

3126
02:09:13,031 --> 02:09:14,450
Ros water yet.
Yeah.

3127
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:17,150
Because when you drink distilled water,
there's no minerals in it.

3128
02:09:17,890 --> 02:09:19,930
It actually robs your body of minerals 
because they're like,

3129
02:09:19,931 --> 02:09:20,890
takes the minerals out.

3130
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:21,723
Right?
Yeah.

3131
02:09:22,330 --> 02:09:24,750
Um,
so don't drink unless your Thursday.

3132
02:09:24,780 --> 02:09:26,380
I mean,
that's my rule of thumb and I,

3133
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:28,480
and I don't,
so what do I drink with meals?

3134
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:29,523
Um,
until recently I was drinking wine with 

3135
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:33,940
meals.
How come he stopped?

3136
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:35,530
So,
uh,

3137
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:37,360
I'd written a lot about wines over the 
years and,

3138
02:09:37,361 --> 02:09:38,230
and how,
uh,

3139
02:09:38,231 --> 02:09:39,064
you know,
the research shows that wine drinkers 

3140
02:09:40,331 --> 02:09:42,640
live longer than teetotallers,
resveratrol,

3141
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,600
all that stuff.
And,

3142
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:44,740
uh,
there's a lot of good,

3143
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:49,120
compelling evidence to drink wine.
And yet at the root of the matter,

3144
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:52,930
wine is still a source of ethanol.
Ethanol is toxic to the body.

3145
02:09:52,931 --> 02:09:55,210
So you're putting a toxin in your body 
every time you drink wine.

3146
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:59,620
I'm starting to look at that in my own 
case and realized that I wasn't sleeping

3147
02:09:59,621 --> 02:10:01,690
as well as I want it to.
And sleep's a big thing for me.

3148
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,770
So,
um,

3149
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:07,770
but I was a two glass a night wine 
drinker for 30 years.

3150
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:10,630
I'm just,
it wasn't dinner if I didn't have wine.

3151
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:11,973
And,
um,

3152
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:13,383
so I went on a 30 day,
which I do often when a 30 day 

3153
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,050
experiment of one,
see what happened,

3154
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:18,790
it cut out the wine,
um,

3155
02:10:18,820 --> 02:10:20,100
felt great,
uh,

3156
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:22,720
slept better,
and that I was never really,

3157
02:10:22,721 --> 02:10:24,190
it never woke up hungover.
I mean,

3158
02:10:24,191 --> 02:10:25,600
I've never,
my kids have never seen me.

3159
02:10:25,630 --> 02:10:27,760
My kids are 22 and 25 they'd never seen 
me drunk.

3160
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:30,220
My wife has never seen me drunk.
It's not like I was abusing anything,

3161
02:10:30,221 --> 02:10:32,950
but I had this regular pattern of 
drinking wine.

3162
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:36,740
So I went off it and I realized that I 
was benefiting from it.

3163
02:10:37,110 --> 02:10:38,960
Uh,
so for last year and a half,

3164
02:10:38,961 --> 02:10:41,780
I really cut back on the one I still 
have a glass or two.

3165
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:43,490
What was the benefit of that?
You watched?

3166
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:46,970
I didn't wake up at three o'clock in the
morning and then not be able to get back

3167
02:10:46,971 --> 02:10:47,810
to sleep for an hour.

3168
02:10:48,020 --> 02:10:48,853
That was the big thing that I noticed 
for myself was I would fall asleep 

3169
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,753
really easily and then I would wake up 
two or three in the morning and have a 

3170
02:10:55,971 --> 02:10:56,804
tough time getting back to sleep.
And that sort of subsided when I went 

3171
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:01,040
off the wine.
So the,

3172
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:03,890
that's that's the result of the effect 
of alcohol.

3173
02:11:03,891 --> 02:11:04,724
Your body processed to the alcohol.
The alcohol is a depressant and knocks 

3174
02:11:07,221 --> 02:11:09,050
you out,
your body processes it,

3175
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:11,920
and then once it's done processing it,
then your sleep cycles disturbed.

3176
02:11:11,921 --> 02:11:12,754
So you wake up,
is that what happened in Chinese 

3177
02:11:13,611 --> 02:11:16,500
medicine says that that's when your 
liver is working at at three,

3178
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:18,830
three o'clock in the morning.
So maybe that's when the real processing

3179
02:11:18,831 --> 02:11:22,100
was starting to take take place or I 
don't know.

3180
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:25,640
You know what item,
not huge adherent of Chinese medicine.

3181
02:11:25,641 --> 02:11:28,130
I'm not suggesting that it's not an 
important thing to look at,

3182
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:30,740
but in my case the sleep benefited 
tremendously.

3183
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:33,590
So feel any better other than the sleep?
Yeah,

3184
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:34,520
I mean I think so.
I mean,

3185
02:11:34,521 --> 02:11:35,580
I didn't really notice.
Like I say,

3186
02:11:35,581 --> 02:11:39,020
I never woke up hung over and I've 
always felt refreshed waking up,

3187
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:42,270
but I didn't like not getting that sleep
and,

3188
02:11:42,271 --> 02:11:44,270
and having to,
and then in my case,

3189
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:45,104
because I'm a,
I'm not good at managing stress and I 

3190
02:11:47,811 --> 02:11:49,970
have a fair amount of stress,
just business stuff in my life.

3191
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:51,110
So that's,
you know,

3192
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:51,944
when you can't sleep at three o'clock in
the morning and that's when all the 

3193
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:56,180
business shit kind of starts to 
circulate in the brain,

3194
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:57,463
you know,
and how's this going to happen and how 

3195
02:11:58,011 --> 02:11:58,940
are we going to do that?
So,

3196
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:02,330
so I didn't like that part of it.
Um,

3197
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:06,660
so year and a half went without drinking
wine and I replaced it with,

3198
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:11,180
I used to be a prodigious beer drinker 
before I gave up the grains.

3199
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:14,360
Um,
and uh,

3200
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,970
and I started,
I found a couple of,

3201
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:20,240
um,
nonalcoholic beers that I like.

3202
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,201
And,
uh,

3203
02:12:21,201 --> 02:12:22,034
so again,
it was for me it was about the habit 

3204
02:12:23,451 --> 02:12:25,160
that the ritual of dinner.
So I needed,

3205
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:26,630
I couldn't just drink water.
I hate,

3206
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:30,590
I hate drinking water with dinner.
So I wanted to find something to replace

3207
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:31,633
the ritual part of the wine.
And I found these nonalcoholic beers 

3208
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:37,070
drink.
So I had one with dinner at night,

3209
02:12:37,071 --> 02:12:40,160
maybe one and a half.
These non grained made,

3210
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:40,640
no,
they're,

3211
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:42,170
they're made with grains,
but it's not,

3212
02:12:42,171 --> 02:12:43,880
they don't affect me,
uh,

3213
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:45,860
to an extent.
And uh,

3214
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:49,910
and so that's,
that's what I've been doing for the last

3215
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:51,170
year and a half.
And then recently,

3216
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:52,413
um,
I came across a guy who is looking at 

3217
02:12:54,081 --> 02:12:56,540
Paleo wines and,
and I,

3218
02:12:56,850 --> 02:12:58,970
I'm going to do it if you coined a new 
phrase,

3219
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:00,050
this as a marketing ploy.

3220
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:00,973
Now there's these wines are 300 wineries
in the world among the tens of 

3221
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:08,690
thousands,
uh,

3222
02:13:08,960 --> 02:13:09,793
that don't use additives or sulfites or 
colorants or formaldehyde or any of the 

3223
02:13:15,231 --> 02:13:17,180
shit that we put in wine in this 
country.

3224
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,433
So if you look at what,
how wines are made in the u s some of 

3225
02:13:20,781 --> 02:13:21,770
the more,
um,

3226
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:27,100
desirable wines from a nose perspective 
have all kinds of crap in them.

3227
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:29,413
And there's like 87 approved additives 
that the government allows us wine 

3228
02:13:32,101 --> 02:13:32,934
makers to put in their wines.
And that's the shit that causes you to 

3229
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:39,660
get the hangover and feel bad from 
drinking the wine,

3230
02:13:39,690 --> 02:13:41,550
particularly red wines,
uh,

3231
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:44,460
and wake up in the middle of the night 
and not be able to sleep.

3232
02:13:45,210 --> 02:13:46,300
So,
um,

3233
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:48,670
this guy approaches me one day actually 
I met him at,

3234
02:13:48,690 --> 02:13:51,090
um,
at a conference and uh,

3235
02:13:51,630 --> 02:13:54,630
he started telling me a story and last 
I'm not,

3236
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:55,440
I'm not buying it.

3237
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,300
You know,
you've got these wines that don't have,

3238
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:59,730
that won't cause you to fall asleep or 
don't,

3239
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:01,580
won't cause you to wake up in the middle
of the night.

3240
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,330
He goes,
I was like,

3241
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:05,130
you mark.
I gave up drinking wine and I'm a,

3242
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:06,990
I love wines,
but it gave him up because I didn't like

3243
02:14:06,991 --> 02:14:08,910
what it was doing to me.
And I found this new,

3244
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:10,163
these new wines.
So he sources wines from around the 

3245
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:16,470
world that are made in wineries that 
don't use any of these additives.

3246
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:17,363
And I,
and I,

3247
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:18,323
he gave me a case of them to try 
different brands and different things 

3248
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,043
and none of them from the u s they're 
all from Europe or South America or 

3249
02:14:24,271 --> 02:14:25,290
whatever.
Um,

3250
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:27,090
and these are wineries had been around 
for 300 years.

3251
02:14:27,091 --> 02:14:31,410
They just never bought into the concept 
of adding shit to wines.

3252
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:32,790
Right.
And,

3253
02:14:32,791 --> 02:14:34,240
you know,
I realized I,

3254
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,830
some of these wines I can drink and 
enjoy and feel a little bit of,

3255
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:38,664
uh,
taking the edge off and then go to bed 

3256
02:14:40,951 --> 02:14:41,784
and have no ill effects at all.
So I'm sort of opening my mind to the 

3257
02:14:44,761 --> 02:14:45,594
fact that there's some,
some Paleo type wines out there that 

3258
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:51,540
don't have the additives in them,
in them that,

3259
02:14:51,570 --> 02:14:52,403
um,
that consumed in moderation or probably 

3260
02:14:55,890 --> 02:14:57,870
enjoyable and potentially helpful.

3261
02:14:58,100 --> 02:14:58,933
The term Paleo seems to be a loaded term
because people connect it with the idea 

3262
02:15:02,811 --> 02:15:05,510
of the Paleolithic era and what people 
ate at that time.

3263
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:08,750
But it's not,
we're not talking about that when you're

3264
02:15:08,751 --> 02:15:11,600
talking about Paleo wine.
You know what I mean?

3265
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:13,820
Like it seems a weird,
it's a weird term.

3266
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:15,133
Yeah.
And he doesn't,

3267
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:17,670
he doesn't really use the term he uses 
natural.

3268
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,030
Yeah.
Um,

3269
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:20,690
but,
but it,

3270
02:15:20,930 --> 02:15:21,763
the market to which he was catering at 
the time itself to Paleo communicates 

3271
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,840
the Paleo community.
Yeah.

3272
02:15:26,870 --> 02:15:29,120
Yeah.
It's almost like they need a better word

3273
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:30,493
than Paleo because it's not necessarily 
even what people ate during the 

3274
02:15:33,531 --> 02:15:34,364
Paleolithic era.
You just reducing grains or eliminating 

3275
02:15:36,651 --> 02:15:39,290
them and,
and concentrating on fats.

3276
02:15:39,590 --> 02:15:41,600
That's not necessarily what people ate 
during the period.

3277
02:15:42,500 --> 02:15:43,333
I mean,
that's one of the great misnomers that 

3278
02:15:45,061 --> 02:15:47,220
general public has about the Paleo Diet.
Is it,

3279
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,230
if a caveman didn't need it,
then we should need it.

3280
02:15:49,231 --> 02:15:50,870
We'll,
none of this stuff existed in caveman.

3281
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,410
It's time.
Nothing that we'd even,

3282
02:15:52,450 --> 02:15:56,010
even the stuff we get out of the ground 
or off the trees didn't exist then.

3283
02:15:56,011 --> 02:15:59,070
It's all been manipulated by farming 
and,

3284
02:15:59,100 --> 02:15:59,791
and,
and,

3285
02:15:59,791 --> 02:16:00,720
uh,
you know,

3286
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:03,240
whether it was inserting gene,
it wasn't inserting genes,

3287
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:04,850
but we still did genetic manipulation 
of,

3288
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,060
of foods to get them

3289
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:07,323
sweeter and more protein or whatever.
Maybe it's a loaded term and we need a 

3290
02:16:10,721 --> 02:16:13,690
new term,
something like primal maybe or,

3291
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:14,521
right.
Well,

3292
02:16:14,521 --> 02:16:16,180
the primal blueprint.
Oh,

3293
02:16:16,181 --> 02:16:17,350
hey,
that's a good one.

3294
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:19,570
Maybe you should run with that.
I thought I'll try.

3295
02:16:19,571 --> 02:16:21,370
It honestly is probably better than 
Paleo,

3296
02:16:21,371 --> 02:16:21,790
right?

3297
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:23,800
I thought from the beginning,
I s I started,

3298
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:25,510
uh,
my project,

3299
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:26,403
uh,
writing the blog in 2006 and I knew 

3300
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:32,740
early on wanted a brand that was sort of
unique and separate from Paleo.

3301
02:16:32,741 --> 02:16:35,950
I thought Paleo had too much baggage 
from caveman on it.

3302
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:39,070
And primal sort of has a primary,
you know,

3303
02:16:39,071 --> 02:16:40,750
first importance kind of thing as well 
as,

3304
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:42,393
um,
as well as going back to primal times 

3305
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:45,400
and primal urge or whatever.
So,

3306
02:16:45,401 --> 02:16:46,234
um,
hence the term primal blueprint and my 

3307
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:52,150
primal fuel and my food products,
primal kitchen,

3308
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:53,073
they're all kind of based around that.
So these additives that they're putting 

3309
02:16:55,181 --> 02:16:57,330
in wine,
it's just from an economic standpoint,

3310
02:16:57,331 --> 02:16:58,164
it allows the process to want to know.
It's from a consumer demand point of 

3311
02:17:01,571 --> 02:17:03,670
view.
So you know when you get some of these,

3312
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,190
um,
I don't want to name names,

3313
02:17:06,191 --> 02:17:07,024
but some of my favorite really expensive
California wines that I used to love 

3314
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:16,171
because of the way they taste them,
a thick and rich looking and you know,

3315
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,433
Okie and all this just additives all 
crap they're putting in there because 

3316
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:25,711
that's what the consumer thinks is going
to make for a sophisticated wine.

3317
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:27,453
Wow.
And all that is chemical additives that 

3318
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:31,450
fuck with your body.
Yeah.

3319
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:34,300
Not all.
I mean it enough that they all do.

3320
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:37,000
Wow.
That's bizarre.

3321
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:39,070
I never would have thought that.
And when I think of wine,

3322
02:17:39,071 --> 02:17:39,904
I thought wines,
just fermented grapes and they go 

3323
02:17:41,441 --> 02:17:44,590
through a process and they store it and 
yeah,

3324
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:47,440
my friend Maynard makes one,
I need to contact him.

3325
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,540
You know,
you know the band tool?

3326
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:50,530
Yeah.
Maynard,

3327
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:52,590
the lead singer tool.
He has a,

3328
02:17:52,591 --> 02:17:55,330
an awesome wine company.
Could do ceus.

3329
02:17:55,331 --> 02:17:57,120
Why did they make their own wine?
Or they somebody else's,

3330
02:17:57,150 --> 02:17:58,950
somebody won.
He grows his own grease.

3331
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:00,230
Fucking crazy though.
He's,

3332
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:00,911
yeah.
I mean,

3333
02:18:00,911 --> 02:18:03,100
I don't want people to grow grapes in 
Malibu,

3334
02:18:03,101 --> 02:18:04,890
but none of them make their own wine.
They stayed,

3335
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:07,440
they truck it out to some distillery 
demand.

3336
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:08,283
When they truck it out,
this guy takes it and throws a bunch of 

3337
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:10,150
shit.

3338
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:12,330
Well,
whatever that the grower,

3339
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:14,860
the grapes who's got his own label will 
say,

3340
02:18:14,861 --> 02:18:16,480
I want it to have this,
these properties.

3341
02:18:16,481 --> 02:18:17,314
It's got to be,
you know,

3342
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:18,970
this,
this color and this thick.

3343
02:18:19,090 --> 02:18:22,010
And sometimes if the grapes don't,
you know,

3344
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:24,220
can't pr in and of themselves provide 
that.

3345
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,320
I mean,
a lot of the stuff comes from the,

3346
02:18:26,710 --> 02:18:29,470
a lot of the tannins in wine come from 
the grape skin.

3347
02:18:30,130 --> 02:18:31,630
And uh,
to get the deep,

3348
02:18:31,631 --> 02:18:32,140
deep,
deep,

3349
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,520
deep rich color,
you have to,

3350
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:37,570
you have to mash the grapes up in the 
skin up even more and more and more.

3351
02:18:37,571 --> 02:18:41,580
So more that Tannin to get the red,
the deep red colors in the wine date,

3352
02:18:41,581 --> 02:18:42,414
they have to provide more of the skin.
And that's what's causing a lot of the 

3353
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:47,340
tannins.
So for some people have issues with the,

3354
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:49,150
that you hear about the histamines and 
wine.

3355
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:50,883
Again,
that's the,

3356
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,890
that's the marketplace demanding a deep 
red wine.

3357
02:18:53,891 --> 02:18:56,180
And so it's a color issue,
part of a color.

3358
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:58,060
It could be color,
it could be,

3359
02:18:58,510 --> 02:18:59,590
again,
some of the,

3360
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:01,120
you know,
adding sugar to the wines.

3361
02:19:01,121 --> 02:19:03,070
A lot of the u s wines have a lot of 
sugar in them,

3362
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,050
like a,
like a fairly high sugar content.

3363
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:06,243
The Guy I'm talking about here who,
who led me down this this road and sort 

3364
02:19:09,991 --> 02:19:10,824
of opened my eyes to this,
he's been in Ketosis for two years and 

3365
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:18,610
he couldn't drink wine because the sugar
would take him out of Ketosis,

3366
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:20,333
the sugar and why.
So that's sort of one of the reasons he 

3367
02:19:21,431 --> 02:19:23,950
got started on that.
He was a lifetime wine drinker,

3368
02:19:23,980 --> 02:19:28,980
grew up in wine country up in Sonoma,
and I'm an adult Delton the business and

3369
02:19:29,661 --> 02:19:30,494
sort of left it because he got 
disenchanted and then came back when he 

3370
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:34,970
discovered that there were these wines 
that have no sugar,

3371
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:36,750
that have no self or,
you know,

3372
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,970
minimal sulfite to me.
And I'll,

3373
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:39,070
I'll,
uh,

3374
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:40,170
natural,
uh,

3375
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:43,460
fruits and vegetables have some amount 
of sulfites but not added,

3376
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,470
no added Sulfites,
um,

3377
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:46,921
uh,
and,

3378
02:19:46,921 --> 02:19:50,480
and none of these 80 or so approved,
uh,

3379
02:19:50,690 --> 02:19:53,450
added ingredients that can affect the 
color and the smell and the,

3380
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:54,590
and the,
and the thickness.

3381
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:57,750
That is really interesting.
That's something I never even consider.

3382
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:00,030
I never even thought there was additives
and won.

3383
02:20:00,060 --> 02:20:02,190
I just thought it was just grapes.
I thought it was pretty simple.

3384
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:03,993
Well,
these are American companies that do 

3385
02:20:05,021 --> 02:20:06,070
this.
Is there anything local?

3386
02:20:06,310 --> 02:20:07,230
I don't know.
I mean he's,

3387
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:07,720
the,
the,

3388
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:10,540
the things that he's given me are,
um,

3389
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:13,360
uh,
all from,

3390
02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:14,650
from other countries.

3391
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,553
That sounds so counter intelligent,
intuitive that we grow so much wine in 

3392
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:22,070
California.
But to get wine without any shit in it,

3393
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:25,490
you'd have to get it from Europe because
we're so concentrated right now,

3394
02:20:25,491 --> 02:20:28,220
at least this part of the country is,
uh,

3395
02:20:28,221 --> 02:20:29,001
on,
you know,

3396
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:34,001
natural foods and you know,
grass fed beef and organic vegetables.

3397
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:37,460
The fact that we would have wines that 
almost all primarily.

3398
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:39,260
Yeah,
that's nuts.

3399
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:40,183
Oh,
it is.

3400
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:42,110
Um,
and it may be that I'm,

3401
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:44,360
you know,
that he hasn't sent me any that are from

3402
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:46,420
the u s but most of these are from,
from other,

3403
02:20:46,421 --> 02:20:46,620
uh,

3404
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:48,030
and where would you order something like
that?

3405
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:50,310
I want to try that now because I like 
wine.

3406
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:53,490
I love red wine.
A dry wine farms is the guys,

3407
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:58,170
is the name of the company.
Dry wine farms dry.

3408
02:20:58,570 --> 02:21:01,510
Yup.
I always think of dry.

3409
02:21:01,511 --> 02:21:03,460
It's like a,
that's like the way that

3410
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:06,860
kind of white wine that people like a 
dry white wine.

3411
02:21:06,861 --> 02:21:07,250
Right?

3412
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:08,810
Yup.
Hmm.

3413
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:10,423
I just never would have believed that it
was the additives that are causing all 

3414
02:21:12,381 --> 02:21:13,060
that.

3415
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:14,890
Well,
so now we're back to that,

3416
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:16,840
that initial discussion we had about 
let's,

3417
02:21:16,841 --> 02:21:17,674
what you don't eat right.
That really affects you more than what 

3418
02:21:19,781 --> 02:21:20,614
you do eat.
And,

3419
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,240
and so if you're getting,
um,

3420
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:23,860
you know,
uh,

3421
02:21:23,890 --> 02:21:24,723
you're eating appropriately grown cuts 
of meat and organic vegetables and 

3422
02:21:28,601 --> 02:21:30,730
you're cutting out the,
the organic,

3423
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:31,250
I've,
excuse me,

3424
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:33,340
cutting out the industrial seed oils,
cutting out the sugar,

3425
02:21:33,341 --> 02:21:36,760
cutting out the processed grains and 
some of the other grains.

3426
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:38,830
And in their place,
you're,

3427
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:40,540
and you're cutting out,
in this case,

3428
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:42,580
crappy wine and,
and,

3429
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:46,240
and substituting fruits,
vegetables,

3430
02:21:46,241 --> 02:21:46,661
meat,
fish,

3431
02:21:46,661 --> 02:21:47,171
fowl,
eggs,

3432
02:21:47,171 --> 02:21:48,004
nuts,
seeds,

3433
02:21:48,040 --> 02:21:49,360
and hit.
Now we have,

3434
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:50,350
you know,
again,

3435
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:51,573
if we want to enjoy life,
and that's one of the things that we 

3436
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:55,910
might consider an enjoyable part of life
is,

3437
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:59,860
is partaking of a glass of red or white 
wine with dinner.

3438
02:22:00,310 --> 02:22:02,260
Now it's kind of back on the menu for 
some people.

3439
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:04,930
That's interesting.
That's really interesting.

3440
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:06,573
So,
but it's not necessarily on the menu 

3441
02:22:07,601 --> 02:22:08,740
for,
you know,

3442
02:22:08,741 --> 02:22:09,460
so,
uh,

3443
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:11,070
and having said that,
um,

3444
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:12,573
I'm not finding myself back in that 
situation where I'm drinking wine with 

3445
02:22:16,661 --> 02:22:18,610
dinner again because I've,
I've,

3446
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:23,110
I still recognize for myself that it's 
the ethanol that I'm not,

3447
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:24,513
I just intuitively,
I don't like putting that amount of 

3448
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:32,010
ethanol in my body on a regular basis.
So once in a while as a hormetic,

3449
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:32,993
you know,
uh,

3450
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:34,260
uh,
insult,

3451
02:22:34,261 --> 02:22:35,460
if you will,
that's fine.

3452
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,940
The body will adapt to it and use it as 
to its benefit.

3453
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:40,320
But on a regular basis,
probably.

3454
02:22:40,530 --> 02:22:44,940
So just the sheer alcohol content of 
wine was causing an issue.

3455
02:22:44,941 --> 02:22:47,520
It wasn't just the additives.
No.

3456
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:49,200
So,
so the,

3457
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:51,570
the additives were probably causing the 
issue because with,

3458
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,433
with these wines,
I wasn't waking up in the middle of the 

3459
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:57,090
night and it was,
so I felt as if I hadn't had the wine.

3460
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,570
So what's the ethanol ethanol is,
is that's the alcohol,

3461
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:03,220
that's the form of alcohol in the wines.
Right.

3462
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,070
But it's not the additives.
No,

3463
02:23:05,071 --> 02:23:05,530
no,
no that,

3464
02:23:05,530 --> 02:23:07,420
no,
that's what you're trying to get at is,

3465
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,570
is ethanol is the,
is the alcohol and the wine.

3466
02:23:09,610 --> 02:23:10,600
That's what gives you,
right.

3467
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:11,900
That's not what's being added.
Right.

3468
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:12,983
So,
but you had decided that it wasn't the 

3469
02:23:15,271 --> 02:23:18,420
ethanol,
but I still didn't like the idea.

3470
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:20,820
It's not about the issues as much as 
it's just,

3471
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,280
um,
it's like I can,

3472
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:24,233
I can consume a fair amount of sugar 
over the course of a day and not have 

3473
02:23:28,830 --> 02:23:31,030
not gained weight and not have it affect
my blood sugar.

3474
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:33,210
I just choose not to because I know it's
bad for me.

3475
02:23:33,290 --> 02:23:34,123
Right.
So you don't even like a glass of wine 

3476
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:38,063
once it happens,
fine.

3477
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:38,910
Yeah.
Once in a while it's fine.

3478
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:39,743
But it hasn't ever been,
has it been shown that there's some 

3479
02:23:41,791 --> 02:23:43,020
longevity?
Right.

3480
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:43,981
That's,
yeah.

3481
02:23:43,981 --> 02:23:46,860
So do you think that's the Rivera trial,
which is an antioxidant?

3482
02:23:46,861 --> 02:23:47,730
I don't,
I think,

3483
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:48,593
I think I could be wrong,
but my interpretation of some of these 

3484
02:23:50,711 --> 02:23:51,544
studies is that you take two cohorts of 
people who have each of whom have a 

3485
02:23:56,241 --> 02:24:00,800
shitty diet and are going to die of 
heart disease in large numbers.

3486
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:05,420
And you give one with the cohorts,
two glasses of wine a night and you give

3487
02:24:05,421 --> 02:24:07,970
the other glass or the other cohort 
none.

3488
02:24:08,390 --> 02:24:09,223
And over time you look at the two groups
and you realize that the group that had 

3489
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:17,080
two glasses of wine tonight didn't have 
as many cardiac events as probably cause

3490
02:24:17,121 --> 02:24:20,060
their blood was thin from it,
from the wine or something.

3491
02:24:20,061 --> 02:24:20,894
You know,
it's like,

3492
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:24,170
it's not that it's bestowing longevity 
on these people,

3493
02:24:24,171 --> 02:24:27,860
it's that they're not dying at the same 
rate from their shitty diet.

3494
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:29,173
Because some,
my guess is it's probably some 

3495
02:24:30,891 --> 02:24:33,470
artificial blood thinning that's 
happening or something like that.

3496
02:24:33,610 --> 02:24:35,720
Huh.
But why is it a,

3497
02:24:35,721 --> 02:24:38,270
it's sort of conventional wisdom that 
it's resveratrol.

3498
02:24:38,300 --> 02:24:41,220
Well,
fair one of the components of why,

3499
02:24:41,221 --> 02:24:42,054
but,
but you,

3500
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:44,640
you would have to drink,
you know,

3501
02:24:44,641 --> 02:24:45,474
750 glasses of wine to get the amount of
resveratrol that you can get in a 

3502
02:24:49,121 --> 02:24:49,954
resveratrol capsule.
There's not a lot of resveratrol in 

3503
02:24:53,071 --> 02:24:54,300
wine.
There is some,

3504
02:24:54,301 --> 02:24:55,134
and it's,
it's a,

3505
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,090
it's a well studied,
um,

3506
02:24:58,130 --> 02:24:59,330
you know,
component of,

3507
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:00,900
of wine.
Uh,

3508
02:25:00,910 --> 02:25:01,743
in fact,
there've been companies founded on just 

3509
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:06,810
providing resveratrol as an anti aging,
uh,

3510
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:09,360
nutrient,
but it's not,

3511
02:25:09,361 --> 02:25:11,070
there's not a lot of risk virtual and 
wine.

3512
02:25:11,071 --> 02:25:11,904
And I'm not,
and I don't think any of these studies 

3513
02:25:13,081 --> 02:25:13,914
have ever pointed to the fact that it's 
the resveratrol in the wine that you're 

3514
02:25:16,201 --> 02:25:17,034
drinking,
that's conferring longevity on this 

3515
02:25:18,211 --> 02:25:19,044
group versus that group.
Do you think there's any benefit and 

3516
02:25:21,071 --> 02:25:23,770
consuming exogenous ketones?
Okay.

3517
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,080
Uh,
no,

3518
02:25:26,110 --> 02:25:26,943
not on balance.
I think if you're an athlete and you're 

3519
02:25:28,271 --> 02:25:29,560
looking to,
um,

3520
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:35,070
to maximize performance,
there might be places in which you could

3521
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:37,810
consume exogenous ketones.
First of all,

3522
02:25:37,811 --> 02:25:40,210
if you haven't,
if you're not keto adapted,

3523
02:25:40,211 --> 02:25:41,150
it's,
it's a joke.

3524
02:25:41,151 --> 02:25:43,640
There's no reason to take exogenous 
ketones if,

3525
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,540
if you're fat adapted in Quito adapted,
um,

3526
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:49,650
there may be a reason to take exogenous 
ketones in,

3527
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,470
in an event,
um,

3528
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,810
instead of sugar.
But

3529
02:25:53,010 --> 02:25:54,570
like,
say if you're going to run,

3530
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:55,590
do some

3531
02:25:57,060 --> 02:26:00,430
amen.
And yet to my knowledge,

3532
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:01,990
there aren't many great tasting

3533
02:26:02,210 --> 02:26:03,043
tone salts.
So now you've got a palatability issue 

3534
02:26:06,260 --> 02:26:08,780
as well with a lot of these things.
Have you tried them?

3535
02:26:09,140 --> 02:26:09,973
No,
I haven't,

3536
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:13,280
but I've been fascinated by ketogenic 
diets over the last couple months.

3537
02:26:13,281 --> 02:26:15,790
I've been really considering trying.
Yeah.

3538
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:16,833
I mean there's,
there's some potentially good science 

3539
02:26:18,621 --> 02:26:19,454
there,
but I can't give you a practical 

3540
02:26:20,091 --> 02:26:21,950
application right now,
uh,

3541
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:22,813
where it would,
where it would work other than in some 

3542
02:26:25,161 --> 02:26:27,380
elite event where,
where somebody was,

3543
02:26:27,381 --> 02:26:28,400
uh,
you know,

3544
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:29,503
racing all out for hours and was 
completely keto adapted prior to the 

3545
02:26:34,011 --> 02:26:34,844
event.
And,

3546
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:36,021
you know,
was,

3547
02:26:36,021 --> 02:26:37,970
was so good at,
um,

3548
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:38,571
at,
uh,

3549
02:26:38,571 --> 02:26:41,030
using ketones in the brain that they 
could,

3550
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:43,970
they could hold off bonking for another 
hour or two.

3551
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:44,833
So they would take a,
some sort of a ketogenic supplement in 

3552
02:26:47,151 --> 02:26:48,590
their water or something along those 
lines.

3553
02:26:48,591 --> 02:26:49,424
Yeah,
yeah.

3554
02:26:50,030 --> 02:26:51,530
Or not,
not necessarily on water,

3555
02:26:51,531 --> 02:26:52,181
but some,
yes,

3556
02:26:52,181 --> 02:26:54,740
some drink would probably be the easiest
way to do it.

3557
02:26:54,741 --> 02:26:55,574
So if you were going to recommend to 
someone to try to make your body more 

3558
02:26:58,341 --> 02:26:59,390
fat,
adaptive,

3559
02:26:59,630 --> 02:27:01,670
um,
what would be the first step?

3560
02:27:01,671 --> 02:27:03,920
Just just to radically cut back on 
sugar?

3561
02:27:03,921 --> 02:27:05,720
Should you do it slowly?
She to taper off.

3562
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:06,531
Oh,
she just,

3563
02:27:06,531 --> 02:27:07,364
just give him up.

3564
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:09,361
Um,
either way.

3565
02:27:09,361 --> 02:27:09,991
I mean,
it's easier.

3566
02:27:09,991 --> 02:27:11,610
I think if you,
if you just give it up,

3567
02:27:11,611 --> 02:27:12,240
he just,
you know,

3568
02:27:12,240 --> 02:27:13,630
go all in.
Um,

3569
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:17,190
if you're somebody who's been depending 
on sugar your whole life and you're,

3570
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:18,960
you know,
you're doing four or 500,

3571
02:27:18,961 --> 02:27:21,960
600 grams a day of carbohydrate,
uh,

3572
02:27:22,050 --> 02:27:23,220
then,
um,

3573
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,713
you know,
going down to a hundred or 120 is going 

3574
02:27:26,191 --> 02:27:28,140
to be painful for the first couple of 
weeks.

3575
02:27:28,141 --> 02:27:28,974
Now I say painful.
We have this thing called the low carb 

3576
02:27:30,541 --> 02:27:33,000
flu.
So you go from your body,

3577
02:27:33,001 --> 02:27:33,834
your brain,
expecting to have you refuel every meal 

3578
02:27:36,241 --> 02:27:40,770
for every couple of hours every day with
carbohydrate to then,

3579
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:42,650
um,
uh,

3580
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:45,480
reducing it down to 120,
150 grams a day.

3581
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:46,800
The brain starts to go,
what?

3582
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:48,690
What's going on here?
I mean,

3583
02:27:49,700 --> 02:27:52,800
the muscles haven't yet built the 
metabolic machinery to burn fat.

3584
02:27:52,801 --> 02:27:55,320
They're working on it and they're 
upregulating the,

3585
02:27:55,370 --> 02:27:57,600
the genes are turning on to create the 
enzymes,

3586
02:27:57,601 --> 02:28:00,090
but they're not there yet.
It takes about 21 days to do this.

3587
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:04,410
So in the process,
the body's expecting sugar,

3588
02:28:04,411 --> 02:28:06,450
and if you're trying to work out at the 
same time,

3589
02:28:06,451 --> 02:28:07,284
you're going to be screwed because now 
you have your sugar depleted and you 

3590
02:28:09,751 --> 02:28:12,270
haven't learned how to burn fat yet and 
the brain is depleted.

3591
02:28:12,271 --> 02:28:13,500
And so the brain goes,
fuck it.

3592
02:28:14,110 --> 02:28:15,570
I'm foggy.
I can't thank,

3593
02:28:15,571 --> 02:28:16,860
I've got a headache.
I'm dizzy.

3594
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:18,650
This sucks.
I'm going to get a Bagel though.

3595
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:21,030
It's a lot happened to me when I did the
Atkins Diet for,

3596
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,160
yeah,
many,

3597
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:22,993
many years ago.
A lot of people get derailed first or 

3598
02:28:24,771 --> 02:28:25,740
second week.
Yeah.

3599
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:26,603
Yeah.
So you have to not train during that 

3600
02:28:28,431 --> 02:28:29,264
time or at least cut it way back.
Don't do any good look glycolytic 

3601
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:34,430
training.
So just ride the bike easy,

3602
02:28:34,431 --> 02:28:36,740
go for a hike or do some stuff like 
that.

3603
02:28:36,741 --> 02:28:37,574
But you can't really train,
train hard when you're doing that 

3604
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:42,470
because how long does it take to adapt?
So f one or two weeks,

3605
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,473
um,
people get through that fog and then 

3606
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:46,070
they'll,
they'll be good.

3607
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,313
Um,
I have a book called the 21 day total 

3608
02:28:48,771 --> 02:28:49,604
body transformation.
It's the 21 days is about how long it 

3609
02:28:51,141 --> 02:28:51,974
takes to get 80% of the benefits of 
becoming a fat burning beast is what we 

3610
02:28:56,031 --> 02:28:57,780
call it.
A fat burning piece that,

3611
02:28:57,800 --> 02:28:58,660
I like that.
Yeah.

3612
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:01,183
So you got to commit to it and you've 
got to assume there's going to be an 

3613
02:29:04,971 --> 02:29:05,810
adjustment period.

3614
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:07,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

3615
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:08,690
And,
and in that adjustment period,

3616
02:29:08,691 --> 02:29:09,560
it's not going to be,
I mean,

3617
02:29:09,561 --> 02:29:10,394
for some people it's minimal,
is that they just feel a little bit low 

3618
02:29:13,851 --> 02:29:14,684
energy or whatever.
Other people get headaches and woozy 

3619
02:29:16,551 --> 02:29:17,930
because that's the brain,
again,

3620
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:18,883
recognizing that there's no glucose and 
it hasn't yet built the metabolic 

3621
02:29:21,531 --> 02:29:24,020
machinery to burn ketones.
Um,

3622
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:26,660
even though the body may be producing 
ketones and,

3623
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:29,910
and when the body produces ketones,
um,

3624
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:31,543
you can either burn them as fuel or you 
can spill them out in the urine and the 

3625
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:35,174
breath.
And so a lot of people who have not yet 

3626
02:29:36,831 --> 02:29:41,831
become keto adapted like a sugar burner.
Carbohydrate dependent person will still

3627
02:29:42,621 --> 02:29:44,570
produce ketones.
If you skip two meals,

3628
02:29:44,571 --> 02:29:45,770
you know,
you wake up in the morning,

3629
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:46,693
you're basically fast and if you're a 
sugar burner and you wake up and if you 

3630
02:29:49,161 --> 02:29:52,880
don't eat breakfast,
you might smell ketones on that person's

3631
02:29:52,881 --> 02:29:53,240
breath.

3632
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:54,073
Or they might,
you know,

3633
02:29:54,470 --> 02:29:57,110
pee on a strip and it shows a certain 
amount of ketones in the blood,

3634
02:29:57,140 --> 02:29:57,950
in the,
in the,

3635
02:29:57,950 --> 02:29:58,783
in the urine because,
because the body's just getting rid of 

3636
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:03,290
the ketones because you can't burn them.
It doesn't have burn him yet.

3637
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:08,710
So to consuming exonerations ketones 
doesn't accentuate a ketogenic diet.

3638
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:11,330
So I don't accelerate it.
I don't know.

3639
02:30:11,420 --> 02:30:15,170
I don't know enough about the clinical 
trials are going on right now.

3640
02:30:15,171 --> 02:30:16,004
But my assumption would be that if you 
take exogenous ketones and you're not 

3641
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:22,310
fat adapted to Quito adapted it,
it's not going to necessarily prompt you

3642
02:30:22,311 --> 02:30:23,144
to,
to become that unless you've done the 

3643
02:30:25,581 --> 02:30:27,350
dietary manipulation as well.
Okay.

3644
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:31,820
So there's no shortcuts to that 
transitionary period between,

3645
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:32,913
uh,
a glucose based diet and a of fat based 

3646
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:36,133
Diet.
There's just going to have to be a 

3647
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:38,840
transitionary period?
I think so.

3648
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:39,680
Cause like I say,
I think,

3649
02:30:39,681 --> 02:30:41,810
I think if you skip a meal,
you're producing ketones.

3650
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,700
So just,
and you're pissing them out.

3651
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:44,534
So adding more ketones,
it's just going to piss out more 

3652
02:30:45,861 --> 02:30:47,030
ketones.
So you've got to show,

3653
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,740
by the way,
going to be a superstar when you piss on

3654
02:30:48,741 --> 02:30:52,340
the Strip because you got your ketones 
plus the exogenous ketones.

3655
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:55,460
But this all starts in great.
But this also,

3656
02:30:55,490 --> 02:30:59,060
but I feel like shit I'm doing,
but the Strip says I'm doing great.

3657
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:00,170
Right?
Yeah.

3658
02:31:00,171 --> 02:31:01,004
Okay.
So this trip's not nearly as important 

3659
02:31:01,971 --> 02:31:04,040
as the actual physical performance and 
where you feel.

3660
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:05,173
So no matter what,
you're going to have to go through a 

3661
02:31:06,281 --> 02:31:07,114
tree.
So if you like they say it looks just 

3662
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:10,400
me,
Gal like me.

3663
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:12,050
If you,
if I had a shitty diet,

3664
02:31:12,051 --> 02:31:13,860
I mean spaghetti all day,
um,

3665
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:16,940
you would recommend that for a couple of
weeks.

3666
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:17,803
I just take it real light and make this,
make a commitment to making the 

3667
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:21,534
adjustment and the Diet,
doing a fat based diet with very low 

3668
02:31:24,091 --> 02:31:25,800
sugar,
very low carbohydrates,

3669
02:31:25,801 --> 02:31:26,634
cut out the grains entirely.
You get all your carbohydrates from 

3670
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:30,114
celery and lettuce and vegetables and 
some fruits and just make a commitment 

3671
02:31:34,531 --> 02:31:35,364
to it.
Yeah.

3672
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,513
And part of that commitment is,
I'm not going to train like a banshee 

3673
02:31:39,721 --> 02:31:41,640
for the first two weeks.
I'm just gonna I'll train,

3674
02:31:41,641 --> 02:31:42,474
but I'll do easy stuff.
And that's why the first chapter in our 

3675
02:31:45,421 --> 02:31:47,430
book,
which should be about diet,

3676
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:50,400
is about training and about low level 
training.

3677
02:31:50,470 --> 02:31:51,303
And which book,
which the primal endurance book that 

3678
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:56,400
just came out a few weeks ago.
Um,

3679
02:31:56,430 --> 02:31:57,263
the first chapter should be about die 
because that's clearly one of the most 

3680
02:31:59,221 --> 02:32:01,140
important parts.
But we talk about training first because

3681
02:32:01,141 --> 02:32:01,974
we figured enough endurance athletes 
would read the book that if they read 

3682
02:32:04,771 --> 02:32:07,500
the diet part first,
they would continue training at the high

3683
02:32:07,501 --> 02:32:08,334
level and,
and,

3684
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:10,830
and embrace the Diet and then fall 
apart.

3685
02:32:11,370 --> 02:32:14,250
So we got to get the training dialed in 
first for those people and say,

3686
02:32:14,251 --> 02:32:16,110
you've got to,
here's why you have to cut back.

3687
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:20,220
Um,
here's why you can't exceed a heart rate

3688
02:32:20,221 --> 02:32:22,620
of one 80 minus your age for the first 
couple of weeks,

3689
02:32:22,650 --> 02:32:23,400
uh,
training.

3690
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:24,233
Uh,
when you're doing long distance stuff 

3691
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:28,740
and at that rate you'll be burning 
mostly fat.

3692
02:32:28,741 --> 02:32:32,040
So you'll be accentuating what's going 
on on the dietary side,

3693
02:32:32,041 --> 02:32:35,190
which is restricting carbohydrates and 
providing more fat and more healthy fats

3694
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:36,024
for your body and creating more 
mitochondrial biogenesis upregulating 

3695
02:32:39,751 --> 02:32:42,990
those mitochondria to become efficient 
at burning fat.

3696
02:32:43,350 --> 02:32:44,183
How long does it take before your body 
reaches the optimum level of 

3697
02:32:46,321 --> 02:32:47,850
Mitochondria?
I mean,

3698
02:32:47,851 --> 02:32:48,684
um,
we,

3699
02:32:48,690 --> 02:32:50,660
we see,
um,

3700
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:52,490
athletes who are still,
uh,

3701
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:53,393
who get 80% of their benefit the first 
three weeks and then s and then another 

3702
02:32:56,521 --> 02:32:59,040
10% over the next six months.

3703
02:32:59,430 --> 02:33:00,263
And then the final,
the final benefits kick in the last six 

3704
02:33:03,091 --> 02:33:05,700
months because it sometimes you lose 
your,

3705
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:06,653
your,
your top end power diminishes as you 

3706
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:11,310
become fat adapted,
you got to get that top end power back.

3707
02:33:11,311 --> 02:33:13,210
But that's what we build in the gym.
Um,

3708
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:16,290
so it's a,
it's a longer process,

3709
02:33:16,291 --> 02:33:17,124
but once it happens,
so it's like 80% and then six weeks 

3710
02:33:19,201 --> 02:33:20,920
later,
another 10% and then six weeks later,

3711
02:33:20,970 --> 02:33:22,740
six could be six months later,
another,

3712
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:26,190
another 10%.
So in the course of a full year,

3713
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:30,510
you're still slowly adapting I think.
I think within a year,

3714
02:33:30,570 --> 02:33:31,890
maybe a little bit more than a year,
you can,

3715
02:33:31,891 --> 02:33:32,724
if you do everything right,
you can be this completely rebuilt 

3716
02:33:35,701 --> 02:33:37,110
engine.
That's amazing.

3717
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:38,123
So,
and then there's gotta be some benefits 

3718
02:33:39,121 --> 02:33:43,470
in terms of longevity,
in terms of your ability to do work over

3719
02:33:43,471 --> 02:33:44,910
long periods of time,
like,

3720
02:33:45,210 --> 02:33:46,043
well,
one of the things that that's most 

3721
02:33:47,371 --> 02:33:49,290
compelling is a,
again,

3722
02:33:49,291 --> 02:33:50,124
coming from an endurance community where
marriages fall apart because the guy 

3723
02:33:54,121 --> 02:33:54,954
would rather go for a 100 mile ride on 
Sunday morning and then stay in bed and 

3724
02:33:57,721 --> 02:33:59,580
cuddle with a wife,
you know,

3725
02:33:59,581 --> 02:34:01,830
or would would rather Ameritas fall 
class?

3726
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:04,170
One of the reasons,
but I thought it was money.

3727
02:34:05,050 --> 02:34:06,180
Yeah.
Well it is money,

3728
02:34:06,181 --> 02:34:08,250
the $8,000 bike,
uh,

3729
02:34:08,251 --> 02:34:09,540
to go on the,
on the ride.

3730
02:34:09,930 --> 02:34:11,220
Um,
so,

3731
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,740
um,
where are we going with that?

3732
02:34:14,210 --> 02:34:15,150
Uh,
longevity.

3733
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:16,920
Yeah.
Marriages fall apart.

3734
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,710
Yeah.
So,

3735
02:34:17,710 --> 02:34:19,210
so the longevity part,
um,

3736
02:34:19,930 --> 02:34:22,150
one of the things that happens is you,
you train less,

3737
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:22,984
there's less total training time to get 
the results that you wanted because 

3738
02:34:26,171 --> 02:34:27,004
you're doing it methodically and you're 
not just putting it all out there every 

3739
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:32,400
day and crossing your fingers and 
saying,

3740
02:34:32,401 --> 02:34:33,520
well,
I'm training as much as this guy,

3741
02:34:33,521 --> 02:34:34,354
so I must,
I better be as fast or faster than he 

3742
02:34:35,831 --> 02:34:36,490
is.
Right.

3743
02:34:36,490 --> 02:34:39,970
You're doing a,
an approach that's very scripted,

3744
02:34:39,971 --> 02:34:44,971
a detailed and methodical at one on one 
end of the spectrum on the other end.

3745
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:46,683
It's also sporadic and fractal.
It's like a wake up today and I don't 

3746
02:34:49,211 --> 02:34:50,650
feel like doing what I had in my plan.

3747
02:34:51,070 --> 02:34:52,920
Take the day off.
Because if you've got,

3748
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:55,150
if today's the day you're going to go 
hard and you feel like shit,

3749
02:34:55,210 --> 02:34:57,580
do not go hard,
there's no magic,

3750
02:34:57,581 --> 02:34:58,870
there's no benefit.
There's no,

3751
02:34:59,410 --> 02:35:02,500
there's no points that you gain from 
doing it.

3752
02:35:02,501 --> 02:35:03,190
In fact,
it'll,

3753
02:35:03,190 --> 02:35:05,590
it'll take you down the toilet.
So you,

3754
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:09,420
you learn to become intuitive about your
training and period.

3755
02:35:09,421 --> 02:35:11,910
This city is one of the words we talk 
about where you paradise,

3756
02:35:11,940 --> 02:35:12,773
you,
there's,

3757
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:13,953
there's moments where you're,
there's times when you're going very 

3758
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:17,073
make your longer workouts longer and 
slower and you're a hard workouts 

3759
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:22,570
shorter and harder.
Um,

3760
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:23,160
and,
and,

3761
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:25,750
and in the B in the middle of these,
um,

3762
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:26,890
you know,
be intuitive about,

3763
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,720
about how you feel,
how much sleep did you get?

3764
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:32,080
Are you fueled appropriately for today's
event?

3765
02:35:32,110 --> 02:35:33,550
Are you,
do you have,

3766
02:35:33,551 --> 02:35:34,330
uh,
uh,

3767
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:37,780
is there a purpose to today's workout 
other than just go accumulate miles?

3768
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:41,860
Because I'll feel like shit,
I'll feel like a slob if I don't.

3769
02:35:42,430 --> 02:35:43,000
Uh,
and,

3770
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,620
and if you could get around all that,
you can,

3771
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:45,993
you can start to see some amazing 
benefits with less pain and suffering 

3772
02:35:50,021 --> 02:35:52,660
and sacrifice less being beat up,
less burnout,

3773
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:57,160
less time.
And presumably if you do it right,

3774
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,650
better results anyway than the old,
than the old paradigm.

3775
02:35:59,830 --> 02:36:00,663
So that's going to cause a real dilemma 
with people that are obsessed with the 

3776
02:36:04,691 --> 02:36:05,660
work rate.
Uh,

3777
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:08,530
obsessed with just doing more than 
anybody else,

3778
02:36:08,570 --> 02:36:11,710
obsessed with proving to themselves.
They push themselves,

3779
02:36:11,711 --> 02:36:14,050
they put in all those hours and 
accumulate and looking at it.

3780
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:15,160
They look at their,
you know,

3781
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:16,730
a lot of people have apps on their 
phone.

3782
02:36:16,731 --> 02:36:18,160
Yeah.
Measure how many I know.

3783
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:20,050
Oh Shit,
it's nine o'clock at night.

3784
02:36:20,051 --> 02:36:21,220
We just finished dinner.
Honey,

3785
02:36:21,221 --> 02:36:23,410
I only have 16,000 steps.
I got to,

3786
02:36:23,411 --> 02:36:26,890
I'm going to walk back to the hotel or 
the house cause I gotta get to 20.

3787
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:29,590
It's bullshit.
That stuff is so ridiculous.

3788
02:36:29,890 --> 02:36:30,940
And yet,
you know,

3789
02:36:30,941 --> 02:36:32,770
I was there,
I was one of those people who,

3790
02:36:32,771 --> 02:36:33,790
um,
you know,

3791
02:36:33,791 --> 02:36:34,624
I lived my life based on the amount of 
miles I accumulated and measured myself 

3792
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:44,080
worth a on whether or not it could hang 
with everybody I ever raced or race with

3793
02:36:44,081 --> 02:36:45,070
in a workout,
you know,

3794
02:36:45,130 --> 02:36:48,340
and never let anybody half wheel me on a
bike ride,

3795
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:49,390
uh,
in,

3796
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:50,620
in any workout.
And it was,

3797
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:54,820
it was fun I guess,
and it was part of my lifestyle,

3798
02:36:54,821 --> 02:36:56,920
but it's not,
you got to go back to the,

3799
02:36:57,130 --> 02:36:59,020
to the essence of why are you doing 
this?

3800
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:01,780
If you're doing it just to hang out.
People used to say,

3801
02:37:01,781 --> 02:37:02,980
hey mark,
you so disciplined,

3802
02:37:02,981 --> 02:37:03,760
man,
you're,

3803
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:06,250
you're out there and you're riding 60 
miles a hundred miles.

3804
02:37:06,251 --> 02:37:09,340
Some days you're running 10,
you are so disciplined and might,

3805
02:37:09,341 --> 02:37:10,690
the joke is,
I'm thinking to myself,

3806
02:37:10,691 --> 02:37:11,530
are you fucking kidding me?

3807
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:15,470
I'm not disciplined.
Discipline is going to work and,

3808
02:37:15,471 --> 02:37:16,790
and you know,
putting in a full,

3809
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:17,863
productive eight hours and then finding 
a little bit of time to work out or 

3810
02:37:20,211 --> 02:37:21,950
maybe hang out with a family.
It is,

3811
02:37:21,980 --> 02:37:26,660
it was so easy for me to get on a bike 
and go put some miles in or go for a run

3812
02:37:27,320 --> 02:37:29,720
and shrug every other duty off.
Mm.

3813
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:30,733
You know?
And that's the one of the dangers of 

3814
02:37:31,551 --> 02:37:33,080
being an endurance athlete.
It's addictive.

3815
02:37:33,081 --> 02:37:33,914
It's a,
it's a,

3816
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:36,980
it's a very addictive pursuit you are 
creating,

3817
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:38,710
especially if you're beating yourself up
every day.

3818
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:42,620
You're creating endorphins,
endogenous morphine,

3819
02:37:42,621 --> 02:37:46,250
like substances that sit on those same 
receptor sites,

3820
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:47,353
the painkilling site and the pleasure 
giving sites that you would inject 

3821
02:37:49,761 --> 02:37:50,594
heroin to achieve.
Now you just doing it naturally and 

3822
02:37:53,511 --> 02:37:55,400
you're doing it every single day and you
crave it every day.

3823
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:56,683
And if you take five days off,
you feel like shit you go with through 

3824
02:37:58,401 --> 02:37:59,234
withdrawal.
So there's that part of it as well that 

3825
02:38:00,951 --> 02:38:02,870
we have to look at.
Why do people do this?

3826
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:04,850
Yeah.
I'm the obsessive aspect of it,

3827
02:38:05,250 --> 02:38:08,100
the obsessive aspect of it and the 
addictive aspect of it.

3828
02:38:08,101 --> 02:38:08,910
Yeah.
Hmm.

3829
02:38:08,910 --> 02:38:10,740
That's interesting man.
Well,

3830
02:38:10,741 --> 02:38:11,574
listen man,
this has been probably one of the most 

3831
02:38:13,291 --> 02:38:15,360
informative and interesting podcast I've
ever done.

3832
02:38:15,361 --> 02:38:17,070
I really,
really appreciate you taking your time.

3833
02:38:17,071 --> 02:38:19,140
And coming here and sharing all this 
information.

3834
02:38:19,141 --> 02:38:19,974
I'm going to have to listen to this 
fucking thing three or four times to 

3835
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:24,120
work to get all of it and,
and your book.

3836
02:38:24,150 --> 02:38:26,760
So please tell us the book again,
the name and how we get,

3837
02:38:26,761 --> 02:38:27,594
is it Amazon?

3838
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:30,230
It's primal endurance.
It's on Amazon.

3839
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:32,930
Uh,
my website is mark's daily apple.com.

3840
02:38:33,770 --> 02:38:36,380
So a lot of the stuff we talk about here
has been broken down into blogs,

3841
02:38:36,381 --> 02:38:39,470
was 4,000 posts over the last 10 years.
Um,

3842
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:40,400
yeah.
And um,

3843
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:42,530
encourage anybody to,
to give it a go.

3844
02:38:42,730 --> 02:38:43,600
Well,
I'm giving it a go,

3845
02:38:43,601 --> 02:38:44,140
man.
I'm,

3846
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:46,060
you've really convinced me.
I'm sold.

3847
02:38:46,061 --> 02:38:48,100
I'm,
I'm gonna radically reduced sugar.

3848
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:49,830
I'm going to cut out all my grains and 
a,

3849
02:38:49,831 --> 02:38:51,340
I'll keep everybody posted.
Cool.

3850
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:52,270
I'll hold you to it,
man.

3851
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:53,320
Please do.
Please do.

3852
02:38:53,321 --> 02:38:54,400
I really,
really appreciate it.

3853
02:38:54,401 --> 02:38:55,300
Thank you very much,
mark.

3854
02:38:55,710 --> 02:38:56,543
All right folks.
We'll be back tomorrow with a Hannibal 

3855
02:38:58,421 --> 02:38:59,410
burress.
See you then.

3856
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:00,273
Bye.
Bye.

3857
02:39:10,530 --> 02:39:11,363
I do.
