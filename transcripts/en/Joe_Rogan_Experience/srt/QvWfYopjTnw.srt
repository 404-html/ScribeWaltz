1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,780
Does that ever came up twice?
It's very.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,810
I'll do it.
Just things very clunky.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,030
It's ustream thing.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,820
thank you very much for tuning in my 
guest this week,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,540
the lovely and talented Mr Doug Benson,
Benson,

6
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,250
everybody.
Before we get started,

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,010
we have to mention that the show is 
being sponsored by the fleshlight.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Doug Benson.
Have you ever fucked one of these 

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,040
things?
I have not.

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,080
I heard you and Dane Cook talking about 
it last week.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,950
There were awesome and it's really like 
takes masturbation to a whole new level.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,110
It seems,
you know,

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,160
it's a very embarrassing thing to 
purchase.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,870
It seems like that.
Has that one been used or is that just.

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,590
Would never do that to.
Is that just the recent.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Well,
not that you would necessarily mess it 

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,141
up just by holding it or whatever 
because you don't have to touch 

18
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:45,141
anything.
I mean,

19
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:48,711
no one's fucked.
It wouldn't give you one at someone's 

20
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:48,711
thoughts.
Good.

21
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:48,711
Yeah.
Yeah,

22
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:48,711
that's wrong.
Right.

23
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:51,180
Have you ever fucked a nine tastes 
flashlight one?

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,980
No.
Like I just fucked one of the other day.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,260
Completely different.
It fucks it.

26
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,680
It doesn't feel anything like better or 
worse.

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,360
Way Worse.
Way Worse.

28
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,390
Yeah.
Somebody else told me,

29
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,380
I think it was half ron so that he 
fucked a,

30
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,960
a knockoff for a fake flashlight.
You said it wasn't working,

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,440
but these are outstanding research and 
it'd be awesome.

32
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:14,441
But now I totally get what you were 
saying last week about how it just 

33
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,401
doesn't,
it just doesn't feel right in terms of 

34
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:18,401
you feel bad about yourself or 
embarrassing.

35
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,260
Yeah.
Because it's fun.

36
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,910
That's one thing.
Like I guess he'd get a little bit of A.

37
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,870
I've had other light arm workout,
but take it back.

38
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,950
Right.
Turn my volume up.

39
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,940
I've had other people,
um,

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,890
um,
uh,

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,460
talk to me about this thing and it's a,
it's an embarrassing thing.

42
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:40,461
They're like,
why would you want to be represented by 

43
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,520
this rubber vagina?
Like he keeps coming up.

44
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,190
It came up with like another person that
was thinking about sponsoring the show.

45
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,230
They don't want to be connected with the
flashlight.

46
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,730
Really?
That's so weird.

47
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,020
To me.
It's childish.

48
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,200
It really childish.
Now you just get that,

49
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,120
that company and fleshlight to outbid 
each other until

50
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,170
like that.
But then you would never know.

51
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:58,890
I mean,
you know,

52
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:03,891
then you show no loyalty to something 
that you actually believe if you don't 

53
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:07,401
believe there's anything wrong with 
fucking this thing and you want to 

54
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,651
protect.
It's like one of those things where 

55
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,941
people don't want to talk about sexual 
things because somehow or another 

56
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:11,820
talking about sexual things and it makes
people uncomfortable.

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,160
It's creepy,
but it's a natural part of life and like

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,150
most rational people at a certain point 
in time,

59
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,770
just to kind of accept that and then you
can joke about it and go,

60
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,930
hey,
I fucked this rubber pussy.

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,350
Ha Ha.
Is it good?

62
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:23,980
Yeah,
that's great.

63
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,660
You should try it.
And then everything's good.

64
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,910
But for some people it never gets to 
that place.

65
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Nevertheless,
I think it depends on how comfortable 

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,270
you are with like other men like who you
kind of came up with and if you all talk

67
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:36,760
to each other that way or not,
you know,

68
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:39,460
like I had a lot of fairly prudish 
friends,

69
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:44,461
like we'd say dirty things,
but we wouldn't admit to any of our own 

70
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,410
personal activities the way that I've 
seen other groups of friends do it,

71
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,530
you know,
like you see these packs of people that 

72
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,080
all just have a different code about,
you know,

73
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,080
whether they fucked a prostitute or not.
It's going to come up and one group,

74
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,670
but it's not going to come up and into 
the whole.

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,050
Totally.
That's so important.

76
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,400
So important.

77
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,550
Hanging around with the dudes are going 
to tell you everything that's so huge.

78
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,990
Embarrassing,
ridiculous,

79
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:06,040
retarded,
all of it.

80
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,150
I want to hear it.
Come on,

81
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,240
give me a little.

82
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Well that's.
You must get some good stuff from 

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,280
everyone I know from.
Yeah,

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,290
but also like there's like really kind 
of almost a code of standup these days 

85
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,810
is to just be super honest and it ends 
up just to be original.

86
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:25,811
You kind of have to talk about some 
stuff that's pretty brutal and out 

87
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:25,811
there,
you know?

88
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,270
Yeah.
You can't really do.

89
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:31,271
I mean,
it's almost like the Jerry Seinfeld 

90
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,660
route has been said so many times and 
gone down so many roads.

91
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:34,790
It's like I don't see anything there.
It's like,

92
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,250
if you want to do standup today,
it's like,

93
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,200
you know,
Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld,

94
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,000
you know,
that style is hilarious at it,

95
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,100
but I don't want to see a new one of 
those will also.

96
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,530
He sort of teach,
sort of turned it into another thing.

97
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:50,531
Like he made it popular.
It's more fun now to watch actors on a 

98
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,140
show like the office recreating awkward 
situations that happen every day than it

99
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:54,410
is here.

100
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,960
One guy just describing it.
Yeah,

101
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,700
no,
he's the Seinfeld show.

102
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:03,701
Just sort of brought to life his comedy 
and that made him a funnier guy to me 

103
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,871
because prior to that he was a pack of 
part of a pack of guys that all just did

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,360
clean cut observational humor.
Uh,

105
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,430
and I love them all.
I thought they were really funny.

106
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,670
Like guys like him and Larry Miller and,
and you know,

107
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,690
there's a bunch of them.
Yeah.

108
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,550
I was a fan of the evening at the 
Improv.

109
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

110
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:25,301
And those guys were on those things all 
the time that I totally grew up on 

111
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:30,250
watching that stuff.
But then immediately embraced stuff 

112
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,190
that's more,
you know,

113
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,710
like you can,
you don't have to just observe things.

114
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:36,080
You can experience them.
Yeah.

115
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:36,830
I want to hear it.

116
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,010
Like really tell me what you did.
Not what everybody does.

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,900
I want to hear a dangerous thought to 
admit.

118
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,240
I want to hear,
you know,

119
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,650
I want to hear some,
some truth that we can all agree with.

120
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,710
I want to hear something fucked up to.
I don't want to hear the regular shit.

121
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,450
I'll get bored with it.
I'm tired of it.

122
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,890
I want to hear something.
You know,

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,770
I look forward to Joey Diaz sets more 
than anybody.

124
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,080
I like strong joke writing though,
you know

125
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,340
that that can get me through.
But.

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,170
But you're right.
It's like as soon as he starts to be too

127
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,700
much about,
like best as both,

128
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:05,750
right?
Yeah,

129
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,700
of course.
Yeah.

130
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:12,701
I love anyone who,
a great joke writer and a good 

131
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:12,701
performer.
That's,

132
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,680
that's unbeatable.
That's like a Louis Ck.

133
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,670
Yeah,
but you're right about Seinfeld,

134
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:18,600
like he was,
uh,

135
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,780
he was such a brilliant joke writer and 
deliver like in his style and then to 

136
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:27,390
have that show and then you really see 
where,

137
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,560
you know,
curby enthusiasm.

138
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:33,561
Really good to see where Larry David had
a big hand in it too because once I 

139
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:33,561
started started seeing that show,
it was like,

140
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,860
oh,
okay,

141
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:39,861
this guy is like the king of creating 
like really awkward situations that 

142
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:44,390
like,
literally you watch some of his shows 

143
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,390
and you find yourself contorting because
you're like,

144
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,420
what you fucking saying?
You know,

145
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,770
it's so good.
It's,

146
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,960
he does such a good job of weaving that 
Web.

147
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
He's one of my masters.
Izzy.

148
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

149
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,860
It makes it up a notch to that.
It's like on Hbo so that the language in

150
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,730
those situations can,
like that's part of it.

151
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,970
As he often says,
you know,

152
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,990
he often says some,
he swears inappropriately in front of 

153
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,111
people sometimes that in subject can't 
do that shit on Seinfeld because it had 

154
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,250
to be all t view appropriate.

155
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,470
You remember when there was the water 
bottle in his pants and there was a 

156
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,991
little girl and you know,
there was some implication like people 

157
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,210
thought that he had a hard on because 
the little girl was there.

158
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,650
I forget how he set it up,
but I was like,

159
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,840
wow.
Yeah,

160
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,860
if you listed everything that he was 
guilty of in the seven seasons of that 

161
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,580
show,
he's done some pretty horrible things,

162
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:32,581
you know,
like just the worst thing in every 

163
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:32,581
situation.
You know,

164
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:35,521
like,
I forget what he did to some Holocaust 

165
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:35,521
survivors,
but it was,

166
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:35,521
I'm sure it was awful.

167
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,900
Shows like that are so important.
Show you that there's like another level

168
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,160
out there,
you know,

169
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,240
like I think that's important for stand 
ups though,

170
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,900
don't you think it's good sometimes to 
watch somebody else you know,

171
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,200
and somebody really good,
you know,

172
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,880
watch like a bill cosby and his prime or
something like that.

173
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:56,960
Just to really get inspired or you know,
just really kick it up to another,

174
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,860
another gear.

175
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah.
It's always good to.

176
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,070
I think that's a huge part of.
I hate to give advice to people starting

177
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,230
out,
but one of the things I say to them,

178
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,231
if they insist on having some his watch 
as much standup comedy as you can and 

179
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:16,391
unfortunately we get kinda tired of 
watching it is after we've done it for 

180
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:16,400
years and years,
but it's still important to,

181
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,910
to kind of check into it every once in a
while because it just ups your game when

182
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,590
you know what,
what everybody else is doing.

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:21,870
Yeah.

184
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,180
Buyers,
you know,

185
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:28,181
it does something to you makes you 
excited about performing that I'm most 

186
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,030
excited about writing after I see like,
you know,

187
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,970
I'll see chappelle perform.
I go,

188
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,910
fuck,
I just want to go.

189
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,560
Right.
You know,

190
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,520
it just makes me want to create

191
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,590
shit,
you know?

192
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Well that's the other great thing about 
being a standup is when you have that 

193
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,511
impulse,
you could just come up with one great 

194
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:44,431
joe could be satisfied.
Like I hate it when I see a great movie 

195
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,761
and I'm driving home like I'm going to 
write a goddamn screenplay and that 

196
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,950
that's just too big of a task to really 
commit to in that moment of excitement.

197
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,130
But writing a joke,
well you know,

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,350
you're excited about writing jokes and 
you write a good ones.

199
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,100
Like,
okay,

200
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,370
I did that 10,
20 minutes work and then you're in and 

201
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,830
sometimes they come in full form,
you know,

202
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:05,170
they'll just come to you out of the air.
It's like a little gift.

203
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,230
It's amazing.
You were talking about that with Dane 

204
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,660
Cook about say something on when the 
crowd is so great.

205
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,370
The next sentence after the joke is 
probably going to get a laugh anyway,

206
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,580
but when it gets a huge laugh then 
you've suddenly got a new end of the 

207
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:20,580
job.

208
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,070
I right out of the ether.
And that's how most of my I,

209
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,160
you know,
I do most of my writing on stage just in

210
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,140
the sense that I,
you know,

211
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,260
sometimes I have a joke that's worked 
out perfectly beginning,

212
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,300
middle and end.
But for the most part it's more like,

213
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:39,301
this is sort of something I want to try 
to address and then just see where it 

214
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,710
goes and have have a,
have a good joke ready to go right after

215
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:44,920
it if it ends up not,
not ending up getting anywhere.

216
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah,
I agree with you.

217
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,050
I do.
I do both.

218
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,170
How high you get before you go onstage.
I'm well now people think I'm high 

219
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,710
whether I'm high or I'm not like they 
just accused me of it regardless.

220
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,180
So you know,
it,

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,260
it can be as high as I want to be,
which is just,

222
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,180
you know,
it's just all comes down to timing.

223
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,620
You know,
if you have to race from the airport,

224
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,600
if you have to raise it from the airport
to the Gig,

225
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:08,260
you might not be very high.
But if you're,

226
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,940
if you're chilling that day and you've 
got to show at 8:00

227
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,950
and not much to do in the afternoon,
other than,

228
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,590
you know,
work on your computer and interviews and

229
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:21,591
stuff like that.
Like I get really high for interviews 

230
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:21,591
now.
Like foreigners.

231
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:21,591
Yeah,
me too.

232
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,250
I love that.
I love being super big because then when

233
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,470
they do throw to you,
you,

234
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:29,471
you will talk until they,
until they stop you and sometimes 

235
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:30,440
sometimes they don't jump in so you can 
really get a lot of stuff in.

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I know I find myself like almost like 
feeling bad for what I'm subjecting the 

237
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,861
interviewer too sometimes because it'll 
start on some like really innocent 

238
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:40,040
question and I'll just start going on 
about,

239
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,540
you know,
the,

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,080
what is the cause of humanity,
what are we here for?

241
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,810
Like this totally nothing to do with 
anything we're talking about,

242
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,850
but in my mind what I'm thinking about 
is,

243
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:52,851
you know,
the whole vision of the world and where 

244
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:55,011
it's headed and you know,
it might've been a really simple 

245
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,011
question.
Yeah.

246
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,470
They need you to wrap it up so they 
could play some more Kesha.

247
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Yeah.
And I'm just super bank going on about 

248
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,811
the universe.
It's like it's all coming to me and 

249
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:02,811
these big waves.
I just need to get it out,

250
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,640
you know,
it is fun to get high and then write,

251
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:06,200
you know,
or,

252
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,860
or sometimes.
Have you ever done this?

253
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,120
Have you ever gotten high?
And they went,

254
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,150
Oh crap,
now I'm starting to have ideas and I'm 

255
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,431
not in the mood to like,
I'm not ready to write down ideas right 

256
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:17,130
now.
I wanted to just get high and watch TV.

257
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,450
It's like,
now I've got it.

258
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,510
Now I've actually got to go to work for 
a little bit because the ideas are too 

259
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,361
good to ignore.
I got way too high the other day and 

260
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:26,361
went on stage and went to the,
uh,

261
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:30,890
I was at the John Lovitz comedy club.
So you think this dude was on a plane 

262
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,930
with Lovitz the other day?
Hey,

263
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:37,230
I got in his eye line a couple times to 
see if he knew who I was and he had,

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,200
he had no idea.
But if it was like,

265
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:40,980
Holy Shit,
you,

266
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,590
Doug Benson,
would that give you,

267
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,110
am I,

268
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,610
uh,
well,

269
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:44,360
no,
I wouldn't want,

270
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:44,900
I,
I,

271
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,930
well,
I mean he has been in a lot of great 

272
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,540
things and he and I,
I've always thought he was funny

273
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,690
guy,
but um,

274
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,130
he,
he was so sad sack acting that it would 

275
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,140
be hard to be excited about it.
He's a nice guy,

276
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,200
he's a real nice guy,
but he was kind of like traveling by 

277
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,200
himself.
You know,

278
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,561
how that is.
You're just like humping through the 

279
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:06,561
airport,
like,

280
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:06,561
you know,
just want to get it over with.

281
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,370
Just don't want too many people to,
you know,

282
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:13,371
I'm sure like he must have gone through 
a period of time where there's some 

283
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:13,371
catchphrases that people yell at them or
they,

284
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,870
they'd say you're a liar all the time.
Yeah.

285
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah.
He must,

286
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,560
he must have used to.
Got that a lot.

287
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,960
But now I'm sure he doesn't get it so 
much.

288
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:22,170
But

289
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,920
why don't you use technology to help 
with your ideas though,

290
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,030
because I know that you,
uh,

291
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,150
instead of writing it down,
just like talk,

292
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,280
make a movie,
do the audio because that's right there.

293
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:35,281
And you're starting to get there.
Like I finally got the most recent 

294
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:35,281
iphone.
Oh,

295
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:39,540
he did?
I made the first video that I ever like 

296
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,660
a uploaded on the Internet where I just 
filmed myself doing something and then,

297
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,030
and then send it out there.
And uh,

298
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm definitely going to do more of that.
It's

299
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,030
smart way to go.
It's super fast.

300
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,180
It's super smart and fast and it's,
you know,

301
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,800
people love content.
They want you to keep doing stuff.

302
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:54,490
But what were you saying about being at 
the love it's club comedy club.

303
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,740
Oh,
I got way too baked.

304
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,900
This guy gave me a cookie in between the
stage Joey.

305
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,570
There were like these little,
um,

306
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,880
what are those little long banana shaped
things called know I'm talking about the

307
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,620
Scotty.
Scotty.

308
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:15,070
Not really banana.
That's the closest thing I could see.

309
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:21,271
The banana.
How do you describe that shape already 

310
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:21,271
shaped cookie.

311
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,480
Cookie cookie.
Cookie canoe.

312
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,240
This guy,
I didn't even eat a quarter of one man I

313
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,350
didn't need.
He goes,

314
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,630
they're really strong.
Okay.

315
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,960
Just,
I took a bite.

316
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,020
One bite 45 minutes later.
I was onstage and I was a board and 

317
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,830
alien space craft while I was talking to
these people.

318
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:44,130
I mean I was barely.
They're barely there enough to 

319
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:44,950
communicate.
I was so high.

320
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,290
There's no way I should have been 
talking in public.

321
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,800
That's a surreal space when you're 
onstage there too,

322
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,300
because of the way they have that,
those,

323
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,450
those balconies,
balconies or rather close to you,

324
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,840
but just up high,
very shallow but high and it's uh,

325
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,700
it's,
it's kind of exciting,

326
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,610
but also a,
it's different than what we're used to.

327
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,750
Yeah.
It's cool.

328
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:09,751
I mean it was a fun club.
Weird about that club is how the bars 

329
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,840
open and so halfway through the show 
you're just hearing clicking and 

330
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,810
clunking and people that have a lot of 
put a curtain right?

331
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,760
Could,
but you know what,

332
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:20,761
it ain't that bad.
Like San Francisco Punch line doesn't 

333
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:20,761
have a career yet and that works out 
okay.

334
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:21,010
Yeah,
that's far.

335
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,070
Somehow it adds to the ambiance stuff.
As long as people aren't Douchey,

336
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,800
it doesn't matter,
but you are right.

337
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:29,230
It does give an opportunity for things 
to get annoying.

338
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,620
Anytime you have a bar where people can 
stand in order a drink,

339
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:37,450
you're fucked or divert attention from 
the crowd quietly because people,

340
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,300
people start hitting on people and 
talking.

341
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,570
The last show I did,
like where it was a standing room show,

342
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,200
me and Joey did this show in Memphis and
was like this last minute booking and it

343
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:47,910
was a,
um,

344
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,550
a rock club and so we're like,
all right.

345
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:51,490
Yeah,
they have bands there.

346
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:51,940
Fuck it.
Well,

347
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,740
you know,
I'm sure it will be set up fine.

348
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,570
And the guy's like,
he wants to do standing room.

349
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,590
I usually don't.
I said,

350
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:57,670
okay,
fine,

351
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,070
fuck it.
The whole half the room was standing,

352
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,410
half the room was seated and was really 
strange.

353
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,260
It was like you're standing on stage and
to your right,

354
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,050
everyone seated and to your left is a 
bar.

355
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,390
So literally like everything to your 
left is like,

356
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,600
there's like 200 people just standing 
and talking.

357
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,690
Yeah,
of course you're doing standup in a bar 

358
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:18,690
and the bear,
they're barely paying attention.

359
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,360
They're acting like a band is onstage.
I used to do that,

360
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,380
the house of Blues too,
but now after we went to see stan hope 

361
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,810
and we had a stand and it was horrible.
It was like after an hour,

362
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,510
like your fucking back hurts your neck 
starts to kink up,

363
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,770
and so I said,
I'm not going to subject anybody this 

364
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:36,770
anymore.
It is.

365
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,560
I feel bad for people when they're 
standing during the show.

366
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,280
Do you ever say no that you won't do 
those shows and just haven't.

367
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,500
Uh,
I haven't really gotten to that position

368
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,460
where like,
you know,

369
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:48,760
if that's an option and that's going to 
get more bodies in the venue,

370
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,230
gets less bodies in the venue,
you lose money.

371
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,410
But it's,
to me it's better to let him sit.

372
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,830
You mean to let them sit?
Yeah,

373
00:14:55,831 --> 00:14:56,250
yeah,
yeah.

374
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:58,490
That's the thing.
It's so I am not as big a deal.

375
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,860
I'm not such a draw that they're like 
coming to me begging me to let everybody

376
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,030
stand.
You know,

377
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:04,960
I've been on Comedians of comedy tours 
with,

378
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,550
with patent oswell where everybody's 
standing and it's,

379
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:13,551
uh,
it's amazing how much they'll put up 

380
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,711
with David Cross standing shows all the 
time and his shows go on forever and he 

381
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,500
has bands come out and that crowd is,
is okay with it,

382
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:24,501
but I don't think my crowd,
I think stoners would rather sit down 

383
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,360
finding okay with it.

384
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I would.
I mean if there was an only an 

385
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360
opportunity to go see a great comic,
you know,

386
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,360
someone,
you know,

387
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,280
even if I wasn't even doing standup,
it was Chappelle or someone like that,

388
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:34,840
I would stand.
I'll stand for two hours.

389
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,220
I mean,
how often is this guy come to town?

390
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,130
Once a year should I can stand for two 
hours once a year,

391
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:42,940
but it's not the best feeling.
The best way is to sit down and chill.

392
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,240
He sit down and chill and then you could
really enjoy the jokes when you're 

393
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,240
sitting down,
relaxing,

394
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,500
everything's more fun.
It's what's the worst is when they have 

395
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,530
couches in a comedy club like,
Oh,

396
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,570
here's the VIP seats.
And it's like a couch in the back where 

397
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,620
they not only can get loud,
but they also just are lounging around.

398
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:04,621
It's not the right to.
It's not the right posture to watch 

399
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,170
comedy unless you're like stoned or 
something.

400
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,460
Yeah,
you're totally right.

401
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,550
I like it when the seats are fixed,
fixed seats into the so they can't even 

402
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,550
move.
I'm like at the comedy works in Denver.

403
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,380
I was just going to say that that place 
is crazy.

404
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,530
They got those little tiny trays that 
are smaller than a school desk or we're 

405
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,850
an airline tray and you just put.
They just put their Nachos and their 

406
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,910
drinks on it and the people are in there
so tight and it's underground.

407
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,030
It's really.
That place is almost perfect.

408
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,240
The only thing I'd say that I don't like
about it is just a,

409
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,330
you know,
it gets a little rowdy sometimes it gets

410
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,900
routed to the crowd.
Noise is like,

411
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,940
it's so it's a win win.
They're cheering for you and applauding 

412
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,671
because it's so loud.
But then when they're talking amongst 

413
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:45,671
themselves,
when they're like,

414
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,160
you know,
losing focus,

415
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,520
that's really loud to Denver's pretty 
wild man.

416
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,620
Colorado people get wild.
Yeah.

417
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,621
It's a lot of wild cowboy in Colorado.
I think the alcohol and the weed both 

418
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,900
hit you harder because of the altitude.
Fuck yeah,

419
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:02,090
it does.
You're a mile up in the air man.

420
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,830
Yeah.
So if we try working out up there.

421
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,990
Yeah,
I've tried,

422
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,450
tried doing a lot of things there that I
regretted.

423
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,050
I went to an amusement park there one 
day.

424
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,340
Oh my God.
And uh,

425
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,060
yeah.
And it's just like it,

426
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:17,061
it was fun,
but much more exhausting than going to 

427
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:17,061
an amusement park should be.
Yeah.

428
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:18,650
I can only imagine.
Yeah.

429
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:23,651
Walking up hills is tough up there.
I went hiking once and it was like a 

430
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:26,831
full on workout.
Like I was breathing heavy and sweating 

431
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:26,831
and it's like,
this is crazy.

432
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:31,720
This is not where you want them outline 
to catch you while he's out of breath 

433
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,330
and shit can even make it up the hill.

434
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,380
That's the way Joe Rogan thinks that 
there might be a mountain lion.

435
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,490
My dog.
Oh God,

436
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,520
I lived when I lived in Colorado.
My dog had eaten by crap.

437
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,920
Yeah,
we saw the mountain lion.

438
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,520
I've had weed in Colorado.
You've hidden it at a comedy club and 

439
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,370
I've been waiting for the day to go back
to this comedy club to see if it's still

440
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,330
there.
It gets kind of like.

441
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,900
I mean already we're talking about the 
other day we started hiding.

442
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:59,901
We'd at comedy clubs throwing it away 
and stuff because we'd never go back to 

443
00:17:59,901 --> 00:17:59,901
smart.
No,

444
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:00,240
it doesn't.
I mean,

445
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,270
and it loses its potency a little bit,
but you're talking about six months to a

446
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,110
year.
It's fine.

447
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,760
It's gonna be dry and you're going to 
hit you harder.

448
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,470
You're going to get stoned.
Really?

449
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,800
Yeah.
Joey likes drawing is weed out.

450
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,740
He takes us like a radiator to shut up.

451
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,890
I used to keep it in the freezer.
Really?

452
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,830
Yeah.
I used to do that to bay.

453
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,200
It gets moisture in it that way.
I like it dry.

454
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,170
I like it to burn and make it a point.
The freezer.

455
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,720
It's supposedly you put anything in the 
freezer at last longer be like 

456
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,170
batteries.
I'm asking you that,

457
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,760
but we want to put my coffee in the 
freezer.

458
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:30,660
I don't know why I do that.
Yeah,

459
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,070
exactly.
There's a weird thing.

460
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I just did it because people suggested 
it or somebody said it somewhere and 

461
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,370
then after awhile I was like,
why am I doing this?

462
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,920
Get into this.
We'd fast enough that I don't need those

463
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,760
for another generation.
Right.

464
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,800
This edible thing taught me a lesson 
amount.

465
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,590
I will not eat anybody else's shit and 
then go on stage.

466
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,060
It was known and he's one of those 
professionals.

467
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,700
Don't ever know the store.
You're buying it from somebody you don't

468
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,360
know.
Oh No.

469
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,740
Totally.
Totally true.

470
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,280
To me is always like,
just eat half of this and every time I 

471
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,521
take them up on it,
it's either much stronger than that 

472
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,970
implied or weaker than that implied like
people are never really that.

473
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,180
That's what I like about smoking.
The people behind the counter and the 

474
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,980
dispensary can give you a little bit 
more specific guidance than you can.

475
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,390
With edibles.
It's always just like,

476
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,290
yeah,
that'll do it in about an hour.

477
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,760
Some of these assholes put too much in.
They need to get Amazon reviews.

478
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,010
You're right.
They need Amazon reviews.

479
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:31,950
Every time you take a purple rec from 
this store,

480
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,720
this is what happened,
this is how much,

481
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,660
you know,
and there was a job in Colorado,

482
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:40,140
one of the local newspapers to be a 
marijuana critic.

483
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,680
And I got the job.
I signed up for it and they were like,

484
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,370
are you serious?
I'm like,

485
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:44,940
fuck,
yeah,

486
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,920
I want to write.
It was right before we had to move.

487
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,790
But,
uh,

488
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,660
when I was there I was going to go to 
different stores and great them.

489
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,460
Somebody else is doing that.
Now they should think they gave that job

490
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:01,461
to somebody.
I remember reading about it somewhere 

491
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:01,461
that,
that yeah,

492
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:01,461
that's something they wanted to do.
I,

493
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:05,960
you know,
I read it on some slab stone or 

494
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:05,960
something,
some website was,

495
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,450
uh,
was talking about it.

496
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,970
I thought of earlier when you mentioned 
Doug Stan Hope.

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Uh,
it was funny a couple of days ago I 

498
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,250
worked at a club and the guy wrote me a 
check and I went home.

499
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:18,360
I didn't really look at it and I went 
home and the next morning I looked at it

500
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:20,080
and he'd written a check out to doug,
Stan,

501
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:23,070
hope like it was late and he was tired.
And,

502
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,810
and,
uh,

503
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Doug plays that club too.
So it was funny that he wrote down the 

504
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,910
wrong name,
like degenerate number two,

505
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,840
forgotten.
No,

506
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,850
you've never gotten a check.
Says Joe Piscopo on Tony Danza Junior.

507
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,270
Um,
I signed credit card.

508
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,840
It's just a flag that like anytime I 
sign a credit card,

509
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,090
any kind of credit card slip,
I always write something like,

510
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:46,440
tacos.
Let me ask you this.

511
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,360
Are you free to change the way you sign 
your kids?

512
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,390
You can't say that your t's not a dot.
What I'm saying,

513
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,430
like say if you have a signature,
write your signature.

514
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,210
So it's supposed to represent how you 
write it.

515
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,270
Write your own very unique way of doing 
it.

516
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,670
Is it?
Can you just decide I don't like it that

517
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:08,671
way.
Now I'm going to do this with a star in 

518
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:08,671
the middle of it.
And you're just helping them out because

519
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:12,961
then you could get every letter of the 
alphabet so they know exactly what your 

520
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:13,780
handwriting style looks like.
Your signature.

521
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,370
You still writing the same word every 
time.

522
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,500
What I'm saying is could you just 
totally change it up?

523
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,250
Yeah.
That's what I do.

524
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,140
Every time I changed my sign a credit 
card,

525
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,990
I do Brad Pitt or I hate tacos.
What's the point?

526
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,240
If you're totally changing it up and if 
that's cool,

527
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:30,241
if you're allowed to do that,
what's the point in having a signature 

528
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:30,241
that.

529
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:32,730
Because you have to say,
did you sign this is it's your 

530
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:32,730
signature.
Yes,

531
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:32,730
I did sign that.
That's it.

532
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,680
But then they say where it's a,
where you're signing that screen thing.

533
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,710
It isn't that kind of a.
At least capturing the image and 

534
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:41,710
checking to see if it matches how you.
No,

535
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:41,710
no,
no,

536
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,210
no,
no.

537
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,060
It's just printing it on printing it.
So you could just on those things,

538
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:49,150
you could just type stars in anything.
Well,

539
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:54,151
when I was a kid,
I could imitate gene Simmons's 

540
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:56,690
signature.
I could imitate freely because I copied 

541
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,181
over their signatures.
I was like a huge kiss fan and you 

542
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:00,280
could,
someone could do that with you easy,

543
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,430
especially in those little stupid things
that the credit card while you're 

544
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,430
signing your name doesn't look like how 
you write your name.

545
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,460
It's not even close.
Who Cares?

546
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,860
You know how I learned it because I'm a 
girl.

547
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:13,861
I used to date type her name in cursive 
letters and it took fucking like an 

548
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:15,160
extra minute and I'm just like,
that's it.

549
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,080
You're not doing this anymore at this 
drives me crazy.

550
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,850
It's the extra minute at the cash 
register.

551
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,480
I just started signing up for her and I 
started saying like farts and face and 

552
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,681
talk.
I usually just do tacos and stuff with 

553
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,720
Brad,
but I'm interested in obsessions.

554
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,040
They've got the new taco shaped a Brad 
Pitt fleshlight if you'd like to try it.

555
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,860
Yup.
Uh,

556
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,390
what that reminded me of something.
Oh,

557
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,740
what I do is I have a signature that I 
signed for stuff with.

558
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,350
And then when people ask me to sign 
stuff,

559
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:52,351
I just print my name,
but I always try to say something nice 

560
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:53,330
to them.
So it's at least personalized,

561
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,420
but they're not really getting my 
signature there.

562
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,090
Just getting my name written out.
That church.

563
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,230
How do you use.
I'm just paranoid about this whole 

564
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,271
identity theft.
So you won't sign things because of 

565
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:06,271
that?
Yeah.

566
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:06,271
Wow.
That's weird.

567
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:11,130
I mean why?
Why let someone like a gene Simmons 

568
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,600
wouldn't want somebody to be able to do 
a great job with his signature,

569
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,840
I would imagine.
Yeah.

570
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:18,841
Well you know,
you should definitely be paranoid about 

571
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:18,841
identity theft when it comes to you

572
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:21,900
credit cards,
but I don't really think you should 

573
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:21,900
worry about your signature.
It's too easy to duplicate.

574
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Just carry around a stamp.

575
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,770
I have to.
I don't think.

576
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,210
I mean who,
who has the kind of technology is there 

577
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,711
today so you can't read my signature and
I think when you're signing something 

578
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:31,870
for somebody,
when they show it to people,

579
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,520
you know,
if it has your name on it,

580
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,800
that's one thing.
But if you're just signing anything,

581
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,530
then when somebody looks at it,
I think it's nice to go,

582
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,850
oh,
that Doug Benson wrote that.

583
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,880
My signature.
You can't read his handwriting.

584
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,980
I don't think it's that they're that 
good at that,

585
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,580
at recognizing,
you know,

586
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,770
shit,
I don't think there's,

587
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I think you could imitate it.
You could figure out how to write so 

588
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,840
many signature and you could probably 
pull it off close enough.

589
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,380
Yeah,
you just have to find it somewhere.

590
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,500
So if you watch them,
if you film them,

591
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,350
do it and you saw like how they do it,
he could just imitate it.

592
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,760
Well that's where my paranoia sets in is
when I'm at the ATM,

593
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,820
the beeping noises that the numbers make
that takes the privacy out of the 

594
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,020
number.
If someone was just watching the site

595
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,390
and,
and recording it,

596
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:18,391
right,
they could figure out the numbers easy 

597
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:18,391
and then like,
you know,

598
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,661
Jack,
you up around the corner and then use 

599
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:21,661
your card and take out whatever the 
maximum is.

600
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:21,661
What did you see?
The new thing,

601
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:26,611
there's a new app for chase bank that 
you can actually scan a check front and 

602
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:31,081
back and with your iphone and send it 
and it deposits the check and then you 

603
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:31,081
just rip up the check.

604
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,820
Well that's too,
that's too easy.

605
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,160
What about the,
uh,

606
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,200
using your iphone to check in on the 
plane,

607
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:40,890
like the Barcode ticket can be on your 
iphone and just run that.

608
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,150
Yeah.
My fear is,

609
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,090
you know what your iphone is dead then 
you don't have a ticket.

610
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,680
Yeah.
And you're actually,

611
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:50,190
I phones die man.
Especially if you fuck around and die so

612
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,070
fast,
you know,

613
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,400
you make a video and it's.
Your power is half gone.

614
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,580
You got to think about that if you're 
using the camera for sure.

616
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,970
But it came,
it's such a great thing to have a good 

617
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,921
camera.
The other day we were in San Francisco 

618
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:03,921
and we ate some Chinese food after the 
show.

619
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,760
It was like 2:00
in the morning we were outside and I saw

620
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:06,960
it.
I watched the whole truck.

621
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,150
You tweeted it,
I watched it and I was like,

622
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:14,151
he must be so high because you kept 
saying is the craziest shit you ever 

623
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:17,451
saw.
And I know you're a UFC fights every 

624
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:21,021
other week,
so I know you've seen some crazier shit 

625
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:21,840
than a bunch of strippers in the back of
a sort of weird plastic.

626
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,120
Probably have seen some crazy shit,
definitely,

627
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,220
but it was crazy and I was so high.
Yeah,

628
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,560
yeah.
I was just like,

629
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,380
you can't believe it and now to be able 
to just share it with everybody.

630
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,360
You were like double rainbow,
but with a van full of strippers.

631
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,830
Excited about it.
It was so ridiculous to me.

632
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:45,831
It was such a sign of the times.
To me it was like a scene in a movie 

633
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:49,281
right before the meteor hit,
right before the aliens landed on 

634
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,450
today's show is video audio,
timss video.

635
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:56,451
There's this big idea,
this big clear box that pulls up and 

636
00:25:56,451 --> 00:26:01,281
there's girls dancing.
It's a fish tank of skanks and they're 

637
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:04,311
dancing.
I mean it was the most ridiculous thing 

638
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:04,311
I've ever seen in my life.
It's for the Hustler Club.

639
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,620
We had a rewind the video to find out 
what the comparable jump over because 

640
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,420
they should be sitting while it's in 
motion,

641
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,290
can be dancing while we're driving.
You got to sit your little quick.

642
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,610
They didn't really like because that was
what I was waiting for.

643
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,290
His like them having to get out and get 
coffee.

644
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,750
We thought that might have happened to 
be going to jail,

645
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:25,260
like maybe it's illegal to do that 
because it seems so ridiculous,

646
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,310
but apparently it's not.

647
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,490
One of the things it was funny is when 
we were filming the girl and I didn't 

648
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,490
film their faces.
I wouldn't.

649
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,480
I did specifically did it say it in a 
plastic card.

650
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,640
If I'm going to put it online,
you don't need to see your face on it 

651
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,690
for a week.
All that shit on the Internet forever.

652
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:44,820
So I use their face,
but anyway,

653
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,410
while I'm filming it,
the girl goes,

654
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,370
no filming.
Like we're in the club like bitch,

655
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,590
you're in front of a Chinese restaurant.
Okay.

656
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:57,591
You're not at the club.
If we're at the club and I'm filming 

657
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:57,591
you,
yeah,

658
00:26:57,591 --> 00:27:00,531
that's a dick move,
but you just can't come out into the 

659
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:01,230
real world in your underwear and I can't
take a picture of that.

660
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,190
That's crazy.
Well,

661
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:05,460
that's like the a sexy top and the,
you know,

662
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:06,690
keep your eyes up here,
Mr.

663
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,320
it's like,
well,

664
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,750
come on Jesus Christ.

665
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,390
No,
you know what you're doing right?

666
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,700
You know how the game works.
They only want you to look,

667
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,740
I want you to look,
but you know it's there for everybody 

668
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:17,740
because my eyes are here.
God it.

669
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,570
Yeah,
let's do this.

670
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,500
Popo beale for strippers and you don't 
want us to look at you.

671
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,240
It's awesome though.
It was awesome.

672
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,600
It was just like such a.
Such A.

673
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:27,860
Just A.
First of all,

674
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,260
just a perfect representation of how 
nutty San Francisco is.

675
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,610
I wonder if that Cisco's such a,
but it's just that.

676
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,240
Yeah,
that probably no one will complain about

677
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:36,860
that.
No one.

678
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:38,820
No one going.
I'm sure some kids saw it.

679
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,010
Oh,
a lot there.

680
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:42,750
It's just so liberal.
They're so open minded.

681
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,250
It's a weird town,
man.

682
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,580
I wonder if that law with sitting down 
while you turning the corner,

683
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:52,581
if it came from like back in the old 
days where it's like a pickup truck and 

684
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:52,581
girls would just fly off the site.

685
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:54,300
I think you have to have your seatbelt 
on.

686
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,940
I think if you're in a car,
you have to wear a seatbelt.

687
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Right?
I mean,

688
00:27:57,601 --> 00:27:59,700
that's a lot.
You get pulled over for something else I

689
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:00,800
think.
I don't know.

690
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,230
No,
no,

691
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:01,890
no,
no.

692
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,220
They can pull you up.
I have no idea.

693
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:10,221
I thought it was illegal.
I was in a cab in San Francisco and the 

694
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,010
crusty older lady cab driver told me,
she goes,

695
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,010
if you ever want to drive around without
a seatbelt on,

696
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,940
because she goes,
I don't like how seatbelts feel.

697
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:20,520
I don't like to have it on.
Especially if you've got big boobs,

698
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:22,860
it must be an annoying thing.
So uh,

699
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:28,070
she fastens it behind her back so that 
it is because the cops look for is the 

700
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:33,780
glint of the buckle because you haven't 
got it pulled down.

701
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,920
You have,
you don't have the buckle.

702
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,060
So they see that and then they put,
they can pull you over for that and then

703
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,600
get you on for other shit,
for glint dude over for that.

704
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,140
And then they go,
oh,

705
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:44,880
we thought you had your seatbelt off.
And then they can,

706
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,540
you know,
oh,

707
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,870
we smell marijuana or whatever.
If you get pulled over for not wearing a

708
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,130
seatbelt,
you're a Douche.

709
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,370
Any cop just pulls you in.
This is going to pull this person over.

710
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,290
Forest.
I like wearing it,

711
00:28:55,291 --> 00:29:00,291
to be honest with you.
I've been pulled over for that guy told 

712
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:00,291
me to do it really?
And he said,

713
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:00,530
he said you were driving.
