1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,670
While the results,
five,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,200
four,
three,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,580
two,
one,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,360
boom.
And we're live ladies and gentlemen to

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,500
fight companion.
It's me.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,800
Brian counts on the way,
but it's his birthday and uh,

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,600
he's old as fuck and sometimes you get
older,

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,200
you lose your keys and you don't know
what time it is.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,000
Chip [inaudible] mother fucking Bra.
Um,

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,630
and Brendan job is up in this bitch.
Shut up and we're watching beltre hope

11
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:31,140
no one at the UFC gets mad,
but it's a big fight.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,390
This is an important one.
What we are,

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,290
um,
right now this is the heavyweight finals

14
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,600
is going to be fade or versus Ryan
Bader.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
I'm excited for that.
I am excited about that.

16
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,530
I'm very,
so I like Ryan Bader at heavyweight.

17
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,260
He looks fucking fantastic.
He's bigger than me right now.

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,250
How many of these guys just should have
done that a long time ago when to stop

19
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:50,800
cutting weight?

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,640
Went to heavyweight,
could just crucifying their body.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,940
Chris Weidman I think is kind of one of
the main ones.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,440
Do you think so?
I think he's going to excel at light

23
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,870
heavyweight.
He's got a disc replaced in his neck.

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,550
He's fucked up,
but I'll figure it out.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,450
The worst nightmare though,
for a fighter in wrestling or MMA is

26
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:08,580
just being overpowered by somebody.
Right.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,950
That's why they're killing themselves.
They just want to,

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,900
they would rather go in there,
uh,

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
depleted then get thrown around.
It's so old school.

30
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:19,260
It's such an old school way of thinking.
I feel like it makes sense though,

31
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,690
a little bit.
I mean to be that one in wrestling it's,

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,220
but look,
I was looking at Tj dillashaw,

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,150
Tj dillashaw.
Oh yeah,

34
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,520
but that's hard to say.
Let's go.

35
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,070
Let's talk about that fight because I
watched that fight several times.

36
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,080
I am of the opinion that was a quick
stoppage.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,410
Early startups for sure.
Here's my,

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,230
here's my other point with that.
When there are 125 pounds,

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,190
you can let it go on a little longer
than if they were heavyweights.

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,120
I'd heard more on the side of let it go
long to 125 days.

41
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,220
It could be a thousand pounds each and
that fight got stopped quick.

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,480
Let that's fucking fine.
Especially when talking about a legacy

43
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,870
that was spending 69 bucks.
How about Tj?

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,980
Tj,
Nike.

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,150
See fight,
that guy drained his body to get down to

46
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,500
125 pounds.
Hey,

47
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,640
don't get me wrong though,
Henry.

48
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:09,240
To who knows a bad motherfucker.
He probably have beat him anyway.

49
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,330
But for people that are paying for the,
the event,

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,540
we want to see some highlight shit.
Definite knock out.

51
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,990
We don't want to,
you know,

52
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,180
I thought I thought the ref,
whoever he was,

53
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,990
he was just in the beginning.
You could tell he wanted to stop it.

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,580
Or like there's guides that they just,
they just want to get in there and like

55
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,490
saved her life.
He's a really good of anybody's life.

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,450
Made a mistake.
Look,

57
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,610
it's fucking hard to do.
It's a hard job.

58
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,060
I am so glad I'm not a referee because
when they make a mistake,

59
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,900
they can't say,
oh,

60
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,340
I fucked up.
Let's do it again.

61
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,310
You remember they used to be able to,
do you remember when big John McCarthy

62
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,950
stopped the fight between Marilla
Bustamante and uh,

63
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,360
Matt,
uh,

64
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,130
Fuck Matt Lindland,
Matt Lindland.

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,720
Matt Lindland tapped and said he didn't
tap and Big John McCarthy let the fight

66
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,700
continue.
Matt and he got him in an arm bar.

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,220
Oh Damn.
We missed an arm bar.

68
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,870
That was some serious Jujitsu.
Right.

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,950
Well,
we'll see it in the highlights.

70
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,020
Where was Jesus Christ talk.
Yeah,

71
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,980
let's get those nice.
Hey Bella towards got some fucking high

72
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,930
level fights now man.
They are like,

73
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,681
uh,
on,

74
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,130
on the way up there as close to the UFC.
You can get right.

75
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,800
They have the biggest prospect in the
sport and Pico.

76
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,870
Yeah,
it's by far.

77
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,200
Take it back a little bit.
What about Conan Sylvia era versus

78
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:24,490
soccer?
Fucking rob.

79
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,810
I remember that Shit,
man.

80
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Same Shit.
He redid the fight.

81
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,410
The whole fight got re did old school.
They got stopped during John too and

82
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,390
then they decided,
you know what,

83
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,040
let them fight again.
Big John.

84
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,100
He got he eight or Conan hit,
um,

85
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,370
Sakharova soccer but dropped and went
down for a single and they stopped the

86
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,930
fight and he's like,
what the fuck you doing?

87
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:45,040
But it was in Japan.

88
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,560
They pulled him aside in Japan.
It's like wild west,

89
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,180
Bro.
You know,

90
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,013
like,
no,

91
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,510
I don't know why they don't let big
John's score the rounds.

92
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,260
That's tight.
I don't know why they don't let them

93
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,710
chime in on officially with a scorecard
until everyone else gets going.

94
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,240
The problem with that doesn't want to do
it.

95
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,710
The problem with that is who does what.
When I did it,

96
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:07,711
the problem was when they announced the
unofficial scorecard and if I was right

97
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,160
and you know the general consensus was
on my side and they flash it.

98
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,350
If,
if the,

99
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,660
if the other fighter wins,
do those judges get trash

100
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,960
responsible show.
But this is this.

101
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,230
No,
this is what it was though.

102
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,990
You know,
in the beginning the UFC was,

103
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,630
you know,
bending over backwards for the

104
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:29,950
commission.
Just,

105
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,730
you know,
just,

106
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,320
you know,
cause I had to,

107
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,770
well they still want the cat too,
but boxing's boxing doesn't have to do

108
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:36,130
that.

109
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,500
Boxing doesn't have to bend over
backwards for the commission.

110
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,020
Boxing was around before the commission,
so boxes,

111
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,900
because I have to kiss ass to the
commission.

112
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,710
The UFC had to because they were a new
sport and the commission could have

113
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,290
easily just shut it down.
So it was a different dynamic.

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,550
But the difference is you were doing it
as an independent,

115
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,090
meaning you weren't doing commentary.
So we were doing commentary and you were

116
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,790
coming in in between rounds.
It was very educational.

117
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,340
If big John was doing it,
the problem would be that he's actually

118
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,400
doing commentary while he's doing it.
That's very hard to do.

119
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,340
I'm not a fan of doing that because when
I'm doing commentary,

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm telling you what's happening,
but really what I'm trying to do is be

121
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,250
entertaining.
I'm trying to give some life to it.

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm trying to like put some emotion to
it,

123
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,470
but I'm not really scoring.

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,780
No,
I'm not saying that,

125
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,950
but I'm,
I'm not saying have like say you score

126
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:28,070
it and then also do the fight.
I'm saying maybe have him outside of it

127
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:32,350
because they have 17 commentators will
jump in there.

128
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,350
Big Guy though.
Now it's Goldie and big John.

129
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,771
Well,
yeah,

130
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:37,960
frank,
Mary of Chill Sonin you got to college,

131
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,530
but while the fights are happening with
the voice you're hearing on television

132
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,780
is big John,
there's no way he can do that.

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,170
In my opinion.
I don't feel like that would be a big

134
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Jimmy Smith.
I'm not saying you can't do it.

135
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,140
Jimmy Smith used to do scoring in
between and it was good.

136
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,180
It was good.
Jimmy is very good at what's it going to

137
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:55,950
do now?
Oh,

138
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,760
I don't know,
man.

139
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,130
I I'm not happy.
I'm not.

140
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,990
I'm not happy that the UFC got rid of
him.

141
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,790
I think he's really good.
I get it.

142
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,730
I understand it.
They have a lot of other pieces on bad

143
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,140
terms are the terms I do not know.
I think they were cutting the money.

144
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,820
It was a financial thing.
You left.

145
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,610
He's still on good terms.
He,

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,290
but they offer them less money because
of these other dudes,

147
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,821
so he's like,
Oh,

148
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,510
I'm a doc is off,
see their dream job.

149
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,950
But they signed a one year contract.
Did you ask anybody why they let him go?

150
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,810
They want to use fighters so it wasn't a
fit.

151
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,780
They decided to fight.
See fighters,

152
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,470
UFC fighters.
You know what?

153
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,860
That's how the NFL is.
Yeah.

154
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,490
Nfl,
you know that the color commentator

155
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,150
tater is always a former chief Tony
Romo.

156
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,820
Tony Romo was the commentators.
He got back.

157
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,890
I already best he calls exactly what's
gonna happen before it even happens.

158
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,581
He goes,
all right,

159
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,020
this is,
people kind of dislike it.

160
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,770
I love it.
He goes,

161
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,740
this can be a run to the right.
Get ready and then that sure enough,

162
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,630
that's what they do.
He reads it before it all happens.

163
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,890
Then they even check,
he goes,

164
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,680
he's going to throw up a slant in the
top left higher.

165
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,670
That fucking dude and hire the Pluto
event at a store.

166
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,260
Last night they were talking to how
insane is comically album?

167
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,850
Best adjacent Teebo was saying it's best
commentator,

168
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,110
an office worker.
They commentate a,

169
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,030
he did the,
uh,

170
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,600
I think,
oh,

171
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,350
he did the,
uh,

172
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,950
Brady game,
the patient.

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,040
It's cheese.
That game.

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,450
I noticed about mma,
but fuck Daddy,

175
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,730
talk us through this.
By the way,

176
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,050
here.
Here's the,

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,010
he's going for it,
but why this is happening?

178
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,920
Well,
what's called this guy's name out too,

179
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,290
because we didn't give this guy's name
or what he was,

180
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,150
um,
to counter the take down.

181
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,100
He goes for Kamora and he just,
he rides that Kamora all the way to an

182
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,590
armbar and then he kind of swims with
the,

183
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,790
with the Camorra is still intact.
The arm pops and bill fucking beautiful.

184
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,800
Huh?
That's tight ass submission.

185
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,770
He looks strong.
Super Powerful.

186
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,710
Kamora it's kind of amazing,
amazing,

187
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,740
powerful,
bearded Camorra's aren't just for

188
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,950
Camorra's.
Camorra's are for back takes and for

189
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,840
straight armbar setups.
You know what I mean?

190
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,900
So,
um,

191
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,380
the traditional Komora is probably the
heart.

192
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:06,981
You know,
when you,

193
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,050
you take the army and you crank it
behind his back,

194
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,330
that's probably the hardest of the
three.

195
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,250
You know,
it's probably easier just to use the

196
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:16,900
Camorra grip to take the back or to turn
it into a spiderweb.

197
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,210
Armbar at Dell to me,
Mimi,

198
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,900
Adele Al-timimi Aka Chris Pratt,
friend

199
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,100
Chris France in there with them.
It's Chris Pratt,

200
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,410
a comedian.
No.

201
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,870
How [inaudible] he's the guy who
controls the philosopher,

202
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:33,531
raptors,
Bro.

203
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,200
Fucking guy from Jurassic Park.
Dude,

204
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,400
I don't watch tress.
Guardians of the galaxy is the Gal.

205
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,580
God,
I walked out of that as soon as I fuck a

206
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,440
little wood.
The animal thing.

207
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,551
What's,
what do they call it?

208
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:46,880
What is a big diesel voice?
Oh my God.

209
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh dairy was Chris Pratt right there
with the guy the whole way.

210
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,510
What is happening now?
This is a little go overboard.

211
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,610
Nice Chris.
So intense.

212
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,980
I love you buddy.
But get

213
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,740
the fuck out of the picture of this.
Trying to make any sense and that shirt

214
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,530
is way too tight and that's coming from
a guy like me.

215
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,320
That's how I like to wear mine.
No,

216
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,090
you don't say no.
You don't.

217
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,841
Fuck.
Yeah.

218
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:09,500
Especially for my TV is a midriff.
Not only I,

219
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm doing pushups before I get up there.
Well

220
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,210
I'm going to do some fucking some dips
on some chairs.

221
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,480
Um,
that's a beautiful arm bar though.

222
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,070
Let's hear Chris Pratt get on the mic
shadow.

223
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,430
We don't have to turn it up.
It's okay.

224
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,510
Cause I,
I I don't one.

225
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh,
we should tell people what the time code

226
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,700
is.
Do we have a time code?

227
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,670
It was so quick at and then that took it
off around.

228
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,310
I took it off.
It will let you guys know the tours

229
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,270
idea.
Maybe they think,

230
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,300
well,
how about we,

231
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,990
we have the celebrities walk out with
these fighters.

232
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll try anything,
bro.

233
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:47,470
They'll try porn because porn fighter
porn,

234
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,060
Isabella,
towards the mantra kind of blowing up

235
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,510
though,
right?

236
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,760
Fighters Bang each other.
They're doing well.

237
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,150
I mean it's just paramount.
No,

238
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,711
no,
no,

239
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,310
no,
no.

240
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,350
That's was a disaster.
They've done paper view.

241
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,570
It was a disaster.
He's Gracie won.

242
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,650
They made money on that.
They didn't think that was paper view,

243
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:04,680
was it?
These do.

244
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,510
Well,
I like the paramount's do well.

245
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,950
They get good ratings.
Am I wrong?

246
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,900
I think the hoists,
Gracie one was not paper view.

247
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,880
Tracy,
Ken shamrock.

248
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,260
That's not paper.
That wasn't [inaudible] in 1996 it was.

249
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,094
They can't do a paper.

250
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,850
Did you watch it?
I watch it,

251
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,140
but all I was excited.
I was excited.

252
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,130
I watch them all and I have a problem.
Chocolate,

253
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:31,131
Dell and Tito Ortiz did 25,000 buys.
No Way.

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,140
Dude,
that's so fucked up,

255
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,580
dude.
You could do 25,000 buys.

256
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,590
I could piss into this beer.
Can he get 25 five signs?

257
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,730
You could show a funny,
you do a seminar on flat earth and you'd

258
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
get 25
that's true.

259
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,940
A lot of dumb motherfuckers.
I mean it is.

260
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,150
It is fucking crazy that that's only got
25,000 sorry.

261
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,390
No,
the card was so poorly done.

262
00:10:56,391 --> 00:11:00,180
So bad.
The undercard was so fucking terrible.

263
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:04,320
The production was awful.
Their anchos where ethically bad,

264
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,980
ethically fucking bed.
It was kind of a shit show to watch.

265
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,170
I enjoyed it because it was such a shit
show.

266
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,090
It was just a decent products.
Not as far as the Oscar de la Hoya.

267
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,000
I look like it's so bad,
dude.

268
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,370
If I look like a thumb does,
Jay Glazer was like a big toe.

269
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,480
Big Toe.
Her Dick head.

270
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,910
Yeah.
Almost shaved my head.

271
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,130
How much shaved my head?
Completely complete freedom,

272
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,250
man.
Dude,

273
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,190
I'm losing it.
I've read it all.

274
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,910
Eventually going to have to shed.
You know

275
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,120
guy here.
Calen needs to fucking let it go.

276
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,300
Let's be real.
His share is going well.

277
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,660
I showed up with a bald head promise.
Don't do that to me,

278
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:46,031
dude.
Yeah,

279
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,560
get here.
Get the same issue.

280
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,530
Counted hair,
hair transplant too,

281
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,780
so he's got a scar back there as well.
So like didn't tell the world.

282
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,000
That's

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,110
fucking Rad.
He's talked about it before.

284
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,600
I know.
I would never say it if he did know.

285
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,110
I'll tell you as the fest,
you know who has the best fucking hair

286
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,530
piece is a pivot.
That shit I had no idea.

287
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,860
Do you know he used to play Georgia
stands on Seinfeld because he had the

288
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,810
same fucking birds nest thing.
Well,

289
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,120
he had a bunch of surgeries I think.
Oh No.

290
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,190
That thing is dead meat up there.
It's fucking thing is sewn into a skull.

291
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,860
I have no idea.
How dare you.

292
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,170
This is live.
Oh,

293
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,420
why people are listening.
I'm just saying he has fucking,

294
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,080
it's got great.
No,

295
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,090
I'm saying good friends.
Good,

296
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,260
good fake hair.
Yes.

297
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,130
There's no prompt.
You know,

298
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,530
it's no issues.
I'll probably do the same shit.

299
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,620
You know
it's not the eighties though,

300
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,440
because in the eighties man,
if you had long hair and you were losing

301
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,900
your hair,
it was basically a death sentence.

302
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,800
Like
I had knew I had a senior,

303
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,801
no one can have a shaved head back then.
What was the only guy we allowed him to

304
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,970
shave his head because he could sing so
great.

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,670
We just said,
okay,

306
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,060
well he was also allowed dressing really
weird.

307
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,270
You know what,
this fucking biker leather shoes.

308
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,940
He dressed like a people in the gay
community just came out with the leather

309
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,370
and the motorcycles and all that shit
and all the kids,

310
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,180
all the kids thought that was heavy
metal.

311
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,590
So I wore all that shit and I always
thought in the back of my head,

312
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:14,050
I thought it was weird that gay people
were the same shit dudes too.

313
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,850
He must be a coincidence.
We've talked about that on the podcast

314
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:22,870
before that Rob Halford con to whole
group of people and addressing gay.

315
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,340
How bout,
how bout um,

316
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,610
freddy mercury was telling everybody he
was super gay,

317
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,040
was not trying to hide it from anybody,
but I thought,

318
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,180
oh,
he's just a rock star.

319
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,820
His style.
His band,

320
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,950
his name was queen,
but no one thought he was gay who just,

321
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,010
no one thought he was getting some
people,

322
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,470
but not the match.
Took a while.

323
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah.
If you watch the movie,

324
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,750
the documentary.
Yeah.

325
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
Everyone was like,
whoa.

326
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,990
Now we look back and I'm like,
he fucking joke.

327
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Everybody.
Elton John.

328
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,830
Well forget all of them.
Have a rock.

329
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,790
She's the craziest one.
Liberace.

330
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,310
They were like liberace.
When are you going to find a nice woman

331
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:00,680
and settled on that?
I keep luck and I can't find them.

332
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,980
I think Freddie Mercury is a little,
but it was a little crazier than no

333
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,490
liberace problem.
Name of his band was queen.

334
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,650
It's true.
It's true,

335
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,400
but he's a Rockstar rockstar.
Liberace played a piano and came out and

336
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:19,750
no fucking gold royals Royce and had
fucking pigeons coming out of his

337
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:20,650
asshole and we're like,
no.

338
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,040
Even though our mall did we talk about
this with girls La,

339
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,290
why there's such a disproportionate
amount of gay singers?

340
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,183
No.
Why?

341
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,790
Because who's dude who's running the
music business?

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,070
A lot of gay dudes and who's going to
amaze me?

343
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,750
Is that true?
I don't know anything about that.

344
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,220
It's true.
It's no big deal.

345
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,690
Did you know that?
You didn't know that?

346
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,990
No.
I I know who's,

347
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,843
who's,
who's,

348
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,730
who's,
who's down to suck Dick.

349
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh,
is that what quicker than a gay singer?

350
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,440
Wait a minute.
So you think the reason why there's so

351
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,950
many gay seniors,
they're the ones that you talked to the

352
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,190
decks

353
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,980
to make it to the top because there's
guys who are just the there isn't it

354
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,090
possible to just hold on,
but let me,

355
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,650
let me,
let me offer you an alternative

356
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,950
explanation straight.
Here's the Oct.

357
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,380
Hold on.
Here's the alternative explanation.

358
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,540
Gay People,
uh,

359
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,650
feel maligned.
They feel like they're left out.

360
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,570
They are sad because of this.
They live hard lives.

361
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,620
They maintain all of this emotion inside
of them and they want to express it some

362
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,660
way.
And so they figured out a way to sing

363
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,670
and to entertain.
And goddammit,

364
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,350
Jamie,
just me,

365
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,290
a picture behind the candelabra is the
best movie.

366
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,640
That's what I think.
I think,

367
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:35,240
you know they're bullied and you know
they're depressed and the people that

368
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:40,040
are the most like pushed out in society,
those are the ones who become comedians.

369
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,220
Those are the ones that become singers.
Those are the ones they become actors

370
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,530
even cause they ready shit.

371
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
I miss something.
And outlet gay Comedians,

372
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:51,430
there ain't that many gang of them.
It was a gang of it.

373
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:53,150
There's a couple now.
There's a gang of them.

374
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,010
There's a lot.
I know,

375
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,020
I know quite a few.
I'd say there's more gay actors or

376
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,520
singers sang for seniors names named
some few singers,

377
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,780
the four or five,
but we tapped our dad to three a rob

378
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:11,950
Halford still kickin.
Liberace died of everything too.

379
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,730
He had the full comprehensive running
around.

380
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,221
It's,
I don't know,

381
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,400
just everything.
Yeah,

382
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,170
right here.
That Dick and plan all the dude's Joey

383
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,870
Diaz used to have a fucking bit and we
played a little bit of it one time on

384
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,610
the podcast,
but it's not the best version of it,

385
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,810
of beyond the candelabra the fucking hbo
movie with Matt Damon.

386
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,680
I love that.
And Michael Douglas Dude had chuck.

387
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,010
Do you remember?
Joey Diaz has bit,

388
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,200
yeah,
I taught in San Jose.

389
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,100
Probably one of the best sets I've ever
seen him do.

390
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,090
A in San Jose.
He had that whole bit down San Jose

391
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,530
Improv.
Joey was,

392
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,200
he got crushed in monster,
but he's still a monster.

393
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:48,590
But I mean that bit was just so funny.
It's such a funny bit,

394
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,720
man.
To comb comrade.

395
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,801

He should have weighed on shaving it.

429
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,230
Listen to these gummies losing it.
Yeah.

430
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,150
There's going to be a point where I'm
going to have to shave my phone.

431
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,830
Do you have a beautiful head of hair?

432
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,980

Right.
So I mean if scale of one to 10 we're

440
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,990
going to lose your hair.
I get to about running in my eyebrows.

441
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,510
Yeah,

442
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,813
surgery.

443
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,650
I got the Rogan route.
You got beautiful shiny hair.

444
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,900
Imagine if that was a problem.
Like some dudes.

445
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,110
You know what I mean?
I know a couple of Brazilian guys rush

446
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,550
up their hair light right above the
eyebrow.

447
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,860
Like they might have to like shave in a
hairline.

448
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
Oh,
Khabib has to for sure.

His shit is very short forehead.
How about her Natto and not the mock?

No,

451
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,710
That guy,

I love him.

453
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,420

456
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,600
You know Jonah Hill is trained Jujitsu
with lag.

457
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,010
Jonah fucking hell.
He's pretty skinny and shit.

458
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,880
He's getting scared so much weight.
Got Skinny and then he felt like his

459
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:37,800
head was too big.
He started gaining weight back.

460
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,750
Now he's skinny again.
He's in great shape.

461
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,500
We realized that happens to people
sometimes because you know when you get

462
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,990
like 400 pounds,
your fucking head gets big.

463
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,680

Taste when you're 20,

464
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,650
when you're role with somebody,
he'd go make his face nice clean,

465
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,730
beautiful.

well,
you know,

468
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,760
if his head's bigger and his body's too
skinny,

469
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,980
just going to build your body up.

511
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,210
Filthy does what a good kid.

How much they hate acting now.

525
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,300

that was hilarious.

528
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,350
That's my new dance.
We should all do it together,

529
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,330
but take it seriously.

three would do that.

533
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:41,290
They'll be,

You're going to be rocking it back.

543
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,140
No,
you're going to be a the Butler's name.

544
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,360
What's the Butler that takes care of
Bruce?

545
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,660
I bet you are older than Alfred was
show.

546
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,750
How old was John Candy when he died?
This phrase?

547
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,670
1,000.
How old was John Canning?

548
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,360
40 40 40 43 years old.
She was 700 Chris Farley's.

549
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:26,410
John Belushi started before these guys
died from drugs.

550
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,500
John Candy just died from obesity.
Right,

551
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,520
but they seem much older and now I'm 10
years old.

552
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,100
Kurt cobain 27 how about the 27 Kurtz?
Amy winehouse?

553
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,180
27 or excuse me,
Hendrix.

554
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,970
Jim Morrison,
27 Janice Joplin,

555
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:41,410
26 what's your point,
bro?

556
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,660
You're healthy.
52 I'm not going to die.

557
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,501
That's the point.
No,

558
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,190
you're not.
You're going to outlive me for

559
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,023
sure.
Wow.

560
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,320
Yeah.
I don't know.

561
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,510
What is this is Monday's.
While is this the wild whites of West

562
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,500
Virginia?
It's a tops baby.

563
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,350
Cops is still running strong and
killing.

564
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,320
It might be the most successful show in
the history of television.

565
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,370
That and simpsons.
Right.

566
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,930
I think cops might be more successful
now either remind the people that you're

567
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,300
not going to get away with shit.
They need to see the cause.

568
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,760
As you grow up thinking you never get
away with anything.

569
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,640
The cops,
that's not why it's successful.

570
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:15,380
It's successful because it costs zero
money.

571
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,100
Correct to zeal.
There's no actors.

572
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,540
A new main guys.
Sorry,

573
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,890
let her watch wwe wrestler Duke.
It was second in the nation and some of

574
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:28,610
the ways a hell of a wrestler.
He's fights to 35 usually.

575
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:32,000
I think this might be 35 an outstanding
fighter.

576
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,040
No Shit,
and I think he's undefeated.

577
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,630
Well,
this is a good fight them because

578
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,440
bandanas is a nasty striker.
He's putting you on your back no matter

579
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,890
what one our celebrity,
he's based one of the best wrestlers in

580
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,260
the country.
Two solid fights tonight.

581
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,340
Yeah,
super solid.

582
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,270
Yeah.
This is good.

583
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,250
You need to,
of course,

584
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,380
that's your sweet ass.
He's planning his toughest test and once

585
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:55,190
he,
if he,

586
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,810
I think he will,
if he beats this guy.

587
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:59,660
I bet you seem to be a title shot next.
Did you find out a one yet?

588
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,771
No.
Oh,

589
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:03,050
here's the thing about Pico to listen.
This Rogan,

590
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,750
I sat with a Freddie Roach.
I did an interview with Freddie Roach.

592
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,190
You got it back on it.
This is the gallagher knockout.

593
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,270
He caught that kick and he boom.
That's the name of the bed.

594
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:17,840
Not yet.
Yeah.

595
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,820
Well that's the beginning.
Yeah,

596
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,061
but he,
he,

597
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:21,460
that was,
that was his move.

598
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,170
That Irish kid who was,
yeah,

599
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,060
very kind of like flamboyant grill grate
on the grid.

600
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,230
Very good on the ground.
He's,

601
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,730
he just,
you know,

602
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,610
Irish and he loses.
The problem is he talked so much shit

603
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,740
when he gets fucked up like he did in
this fight.

604
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,480
So he gave me,
he was in the guy's face,

605
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,690
hands up in the air in this kid,
beat the shit

606
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,360
shit to the face,
Bang.

607
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,450
And he put him out here too.
Don't,

608
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,280
don't,
don't,

609
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,700
don't filthy.
Yeah.

610
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,280
And he screamed in his face.
Fall.

611
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,110
You,
I was saying is Freddie Roach said this

612
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:54,650
about Aaron Peko said he could be a
world champion right now in boxing.

613
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,150
If he goes,
I want him to do boxing.

614
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:56,841
I go,
why?

615
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,760
He goes,
he's one of the best I've seen.

616
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,460
And he goes for Miguel cotto camp when
he was a kid,

617
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,440
even younger,
like four or five years ago,

618
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,690
he would beat Miguel cotto and rounds.
He goes,

619
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,360
Miguel's not give him shit.
He'd beat him in round sparring.

620
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,830
He's so good.
He's just kid man.

621
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,840
He's very ferocious.
Was the number one high school wrestling

622
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,260
world lab with cal Lavita as well?
And Tj?

623
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,550
Yeah.
Teacher's main training.

624
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,310
Yeah.
Fuck it.

625
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,930
And when Freddy told me that when he
could,

626
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,820
he could compete in boxing,
it was compete.

627
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,520
He'd be world champion right now.
He was,

628
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,510
if he let me take them right now the
box,

629
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,940
it'd be a world champion.
But why doesn't he do that?

630
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:30,500
Because it isn't there.
Way more money in boxing.

631
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,280
No,
isn't there zero money in boxing?

632
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Only certain times get paid.
Did the top besides pack Yap Floyd

633
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,620
Mayweather [inaudible] 90 too.
So that Loma chank was like,

634
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:43,950
dude,
yeah.

635
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
You want to do with the champ of who can
survive another generation?

636
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,160
Fuck.
There's no better than the boxing.

637
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,461
No,
no,

638
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,780
no.
This is true in the ghetto.

639
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,860
You just live in a nice community.
Correct.

640
00:26:56,861 --> 00:26:59,590
The son of a bitch.
You got your Mexican privilege show

641
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,830
alive and well in Russia and Mexico.
They got some sponsors all the time,

642
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,930
Bro.
When are we getting hammered here?

643
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,770
One bottle at a time,
bro.

644
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,340
What are you an alcoholic?
Let it breathe.

645
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,200
Let it breathe.
One at a time.

646
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,090
Hey,
don't be snitching on an empty bottle of

647
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,560
90 or that I've got poured down the
sink.

648
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,260
Now we'll go through this.
It looks on this guy.

649
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,360
It's his birthday drink.
Miller light,

650
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,620
bro.
Like a God damn.

651
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,040
It's Eddie Bravo.
No one could ever accuse you of white

652
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,950
privilege.
They try.

653
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,820
They try 100% how can you show me 23 in
me?

654
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,170
Said what?
Bitch?

655
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,300
What'd your 23 and meets 100% Mexican.
Wow.

656
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,010
Is that true?
Oh Man,

657
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:42,000
I need to do it,
man.

658
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,530
Aw,
I did 51% southern Italian,

659
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,030
the rest,
uh,

660
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,960
western European and actually I got
Iberia and I got some North African,

661
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,990
I got 1.1% Asian.
Oh Shit.

662
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,920
I wonder if that is bullshit now.
At 1.1 just collected one a,

663
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,731
you know,
here's the thing.

664
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:02,760
It changes as the DNA testing gets
better,

665
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,490
you get different results in the mail
like every few months.

666
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,990
Like a I've found,
yeah,

667
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:10,430
I found out that I'm a little bit Greek.
There was no Greek in there before and

668
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,150
now it's showing a small amount of proof
of them just making shit up.

669
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:15,390
No,
no,

670
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,230
no.
They got no,

671
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,064
no,
no.

672
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,350
They told when the data base expands,
when the database with a genome expands

673
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:24,420
and they know the ancestry of these
different people,

674
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,380
it's very precise in the fact that it's
only like percentage points,

675
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,030
but it's,
they're pretty fucking act.

676
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:32,950
Did you guys all do the same one or is
it like drug testing in the UFC where

677
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:35,900
you sought to fund that and like I did
25 million,

678
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,980
but there's ancestry.
There's several different ones.

679
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,770
I did 23 and me too.
Two 23 yeah.

680
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,730
Yeah.
They told me I had my lote.

681
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,320
What my ear lobes look like?
How long my ring finger was weird shit.

682
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,970
I can tell you how big your Dick is.
Imagine that.

683
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,930
They can tell you
the truth.

684
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,640
Most of your Dick,
where are the charts?

685
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,580
Charts.
I need to get on these charts.

686
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:00,870
You've seen him at ease.
You'd never seen him.

687
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,380
10 Hug.
He's hey,

688
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,470
happy birthday brother knows this counts
be day.

689
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:07,670
Yes.
Happy Birthday.

690
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,480
29 to 60 70 years old.
35 to 52 area.

691
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,070
Here you go buddy.
Do you feel older?

692
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:17,790
Be Thank you so I don't get any drunk
cause becomes like a Gremlin when you

693
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:20,370
get water.
Go wrong.

694
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:24,970
I love any brown Thomas and he's a truly
good human beings.

695
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,520
I don't give a fuck and my friend
forever.

696
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,383
No,
we all love.

697
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,293
Yeah.

698
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,260
I like it here a little buzzed.
Jamie.

699
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,160
Fight up this flatter most ladder if the
k zero bro.

700
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,800
Dude,
how about mlk conspiracies though,

701
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,390
didn't mean to go down this road.
The Mike Baker Dude,

702
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,530
did you hear that?
I was humble.

703
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,390
I watched my bakers and then I went down
a rabbit hole on youtube on mlk.

704
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,930
Conspiracy from the CIA's convinced that
someone helped James Earl Ray to

705
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,330
convince guys legit as fuck.
So when he,

706
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,820
when he said,
all right,

707
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,810
let me look into that.
Here's the thing,

708
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:03,230
although I like Mike Baker's gray guy.
When when I brought up JFK,

709
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:07,640
he did the CIA killed jfk is like,
you know with Mlk,

710
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,100
Martin Luther King junior thing.
What about no,

711
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,690
but he calls him the bullet.
I'm like,

712
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,950
I know,
I know.

713
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,300
You see no,
let's hit things.

714
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,160
Lost credibility with that.
He goes,

715
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,920
yeah,
I do believe he was able to pull that

716
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,270
off and if you get up there,
you can actually pull that out.

717
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,680
Any hundred could do that were wrong.
No,

718
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:24,851
no,
no.

719
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:26,770
That's not exactly true.
You could do it.

720
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
It's not that far.
It's less than a hundred yards.

721
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,140
Dan,
you haven't.

722
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,450
It's a little shaky and the,
and the bullet,

723
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,660
the way the bullet came in telling you
the PR,

724
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,230
the only problem is the magic bullet
theory.

725
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,920
Okay,
here's the risk.

726
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,850
Here's the fight.
Here's a fight.

727
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,470
What is like a very thoughtful,
what does the gentleman in the white,

728
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,780
Arcola is that bald head and he's a
wrestler.

729
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,460
High levels 21 and one real pedigree and
I think Ben Day has Zia Saxxon got,

730
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,120
oh look at that.
Take down now once he's on you,

731
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:53,320
you're not getting them off.
Watch this.

732
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,390
Oh Geez.
Swam.

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Brian.
Count dropping knowledge.

734
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,420
Well he was on warrior,
so I spent a lot of time with them on

735
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:03,460
sac.
Did he throw you around me?

736
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,520
There was a guy in the last few seen
really hard guy to throw around.

737
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,730
Dude.
Oh,

738
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,340
shut the fuck up.
Who's the guy who's the guy bought in

739
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,810
the last UFC fights?
Just like could be.

740
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,490
He's a baller.
He's got tattoos.

741
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:20,170
He's from the east coast.
Gillespies Gregor Gillespies just be

742
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,700
mother,
father.

743
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,790
He is all fucking go rainy.
Defeat that man.

744
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,540
He fought Khabib.
They have the exact same style.

745
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,620
He's a very good fighter,
man.

746
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,480
It'd be very,
very interested in talking about him and

747
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:34,740
Kevin Lien.
That's fine.

748
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,830
You had hit him up though.
Is Fishing?

749
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,390
He goes away.
He doesn't do interviews.

750
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,580
Shit.
He's fishing.

751
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,920
Doing a Shisha.
Yeah.

752
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,970
Grows his hair out and,
and shaves it right before the fight.

753
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,080
He's a savage.
Yeah.

754
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,660
I'd love that to me too.
He's a motherfucker is a beast.

755
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,850
It how about MVP versus Davey coming up
in Connecticut?

756
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,700
How dare you Scott.
Cause that fights in Connecticut.

757
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,320
Why not do that in England?

758
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,060
Everyone fucking loves those two in
England.

759
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,980
I don't know.
That doesn't make any sense.

760
00:32:02,981 --> 00:32:05,470
The problem,
they knew that it's such a big fight.

761
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,810
You do it in England.
The time zones are all fucked up.

762
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
No,
the problem is the problem is riots.

763
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,250
Those fucking soccer hooligans.
They're going to go crazy brush this

764
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,270
time zone.
Look at this.

765
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,310
Watch
the UFC.

766
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,430
Some of the lowest rated.
It's true.

767
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:26,910
They kill it in England.
Like Joshua site.

768
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,370
They'll do well,
but it's just tagged your boy with a

769
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:31,360
right hand.
Not True.

770
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,330
Yes he did.
We just clipped him as he's trying to

771
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,950
close the disc confirmation bias.
I'm not,

772
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,500
how dare you?
I don't have no confirmation bias.

773
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,540
I'm not attached to this guy other than
the fact that he had friends on

774
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:46,440
instagram
and I

775
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,410
sent him once and there was a great
fight.

776
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,273
Oh,
nice.

777
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,620
Jumping front kick.
So they know him once and no matter

778
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,454
what,
I'm rooting.

779
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,820
I mean instagram friends with the mortal
technique now.

780
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,840
I love that too.

781
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,850
I'm like fanboying out.
He's a good guy,

782
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:08,810
man.
You never met him.

783
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,720
Never met.
Oh,

784
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,250
I'll introduce you next time he's in La.
I'll try to get a school portal

785
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:14,660
technique.
Who's that?

786
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,730
He's a rapper.
Bad mother fucker.

787
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:17,470
Very,
very good.

788
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,980
We're talking about doing a song.
What's his,

789
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,930
what's his real name?
What's his rap name?

790
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,290
Moral tests called memorial technique.
I've never conspiracy story rapper he

791
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:27,381
slept at,
oh,

792
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,090
let's tell everybody what time it is on
the clock.

793
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:34,091
It's 203-TWO-OH-TWO-201 to two minutes
and this is the first round.

794
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,280
If you want to sync it up,
but you probably can't drop in level.

795
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,080
Come on.
I liked that beard though.

796
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,570
Me To moving around like the waste
movement.

797
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,020
Oh,
he said he's going wild.

798
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,910
Like he's very kinetic.
Like he's,

799
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,400
he's,
he's making these big leaping movements

800
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,750
and he's doing it in the first round.

801
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,180
If he tries to shit in the second or
third,

802
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,210
like he's going to get tired.
The movements are slower and more

803
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,560
pronounced.
So start wrestling.

804
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,290
Yeah.
He's going to have to because he's not

805
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,230
that good at closing the distance with a
striking as striking as these big

806
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:05,570
movements.
See that these are these big movements

807
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,270
and had been day has
facebook.

808
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,330
I can time these big movements and
pause.

809
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,520
He's hurt.
He's hurt bad.

810
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,920
He got her,
he got hurt earlier to you.

811
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,480
I clipped with a right hand.
There's a takedown.

812
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,390
So Guillotine stuffed.
Stop.

813
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,050
Push that left hand off.
Tie or yeah.

814
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,300
You see that's what he's saying.
I know.

815
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,970
He's like,
he's losing his hair.

816
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,490
He's very,
he's already lost his hair,

817
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:32,480
but he's still in the fight.
Clipped him with the left hand there to

818
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,160
Ben.
Dance is no joke man.

819
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:39,930
Get Fred's guy
once I shaved is planning turtle right

820
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,490
now and he's just decline.

821
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,610
Right?
Like I said it,

822
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,920
I'm thinking about growing a beard.
Once I shaved my head,

823
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,710
fucking city.
Great head of hair.

824
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,490
Just crow.
Eddie.

825
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,350
Break it down to the hair thing,
man.

826
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:55,580
You got great hair.
Stop.

827
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,990
Let them shave it.
No,

828
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,740
the keep trying to get everybody on my
side.

829
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,650
Joe wants everybody to be hairless.
Hairless misery called.

830
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:04,610
Let me tell you something,
man.

831
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,620
This is why,
because I think people that take

832
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,960
propecia and stuff like,
I think you're fucking your body if I

833
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:11,270
take it.
I think that stuff's terrible.

834
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,290
I stopped like
he loves it.

835
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,620
Cause depression already already had
depression.

836
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,201
I no,
no,

837
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:19,531
no,
no,

838
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:19,881
no,
no,

839
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:20,714
no.
He did not.

840
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,900
He did not think it was just from
propecia.

841
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,220
Nice takedown.
Shut up to his feet and he was

842
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,350
exhausted.
Now he's an effort

843
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,640
to go.
Joe Benevidez did like two or three

844
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:38,730
times and his last fight sticks that
that is super legit.

845
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,000
Hendo does that a lot.
Yes,

846
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,230
that's Enzo did that in his last time.
I may fight.

847
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,023
God.
I'm sick of this

848
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,720
commercial.
Alicia,

849
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,910
that's not writing.
She just was same movie every time.

850
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,400
What's her name?
I forget something like Amy Schumer.

851
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,020
Nice be nice.
I am,

852
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:59,430
dude.
She's well,

853
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,600
no,
she's a good actress.

854
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,320
What's going on here?
She's filthy,

855
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:05,400
Bro.
Um,

856
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,890
what were you stocking but oh,
propecia and argo.

857
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,220
You don't think he,
you,

858
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,420
you don't think that he already kind of
had a touch of the dog?

859
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,440
No,
he didn't.

860
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,180
You think it was all you just shouldn't
chocolate.

861
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,610
I know.
It's one of the side effects.

862
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,640
One of the side effects of severe
depression from have peace.

863
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,780
You have really two d Brian's propecia.
Is It d h t inhibitor.

864
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,130
The reason why it works to keep your
body from losing his hair is because

865
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:32,100
dihydrotestosterone,
which is a derivative testosterone is

866
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,390
suppressed by propecia.

867
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,200
Propecia was originally proskauer and
proskauer was something they use for

868
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:40,860
people with a prostate enlargement.
So you get on that stuff.

869
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:44,640
It inhibits dht so your hair stops
falling out and grows back a little bit,

870
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,370
but it also fucks with your body,
your energy levels.

871
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,110
Dude for me,
this is what,

872
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,371
yes,
for me.

873
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,320
For me it wasn't very good for my
boners.

874
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,110
I still got them,
but this is what,

875
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,790
what happened?
I stopped taking it because I ran out of

876
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,050
it and I forgot to get a new
prescription.

877
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,920
How that goes in.
My Dick was hard.

878
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,400
It was just like this hen hunt and I was
like,

879
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,890
what is happening with my Dick?
And then I realized,

880
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,330
Oh my God,
I'm not on the appropriate [inaudible]

881
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,150
dude.
And I realized propecia was fucking up

882
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:11,590
my boners a cat could not,
it would blend.

883
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:12,360
I mean,
sorry,

884
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,490
keep going,
keep going right now and he can look.

885
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,790
So then I got off of it and the first
thing I noticed is how much more energy

886
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,030
I had.
Yes.

887
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,820
Like more energy,
like lifting.

888
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,090
I could lift more.
I had more energy to roll forever and

889
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:28,480
then obviously counts and my brother to
Jay's like fuck,

890
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:33,160
just fucking full set of hair now.
He was losing it and you got a back.

891
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,961
He was losing it.
Yeah.

892
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,970
And it's fair to shit and cause a huge
Dick.

893
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,930
He's got a kid has got his take ruined
my day.

894
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,180
It tastes like it's my brother.
I'm going to sneak in there.

895
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,340
I saw his face cream.
I mean,

896
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,650
shout out to Jay,
his dick.

897
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,130
Your voice hasn't fucked up,
right?

898
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,620
He's this time.
Although I am worried about the knee.

899
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:53,360
He's,
he's kind of,

900
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,193
he's,
he's,

901
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,680
he's leading with his chin.
Well,

902
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,121
no,
he's just,

903
00:37:56,121 --> 00:37:57,750
he's coming in with his head and,
well,

904
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,030
he's tired because he's making these big
movements.

905
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,180
He has to make big moves to get him
because he's not a kicker and because

906
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,150
he's not a really good striker,
so he's far on the outside,

907
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,410
so he's got to close 1820 inches before
he makes his run.

908
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,500
But he got poked in the eye.
He got,

909
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,850
oh,
now he's really fucked.

910
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,700
Yeah,
he's fun one.

911
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,260
I callen tired.
Can't sand.

912
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,460
Oh,
that kick.

913
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,020
Oh No,
you've got to rap on it is why he's on

914
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:21,540
the outside.
He got ragdoll to the ground.

915
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,403
No,
that's not true.

916
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,800
They'll never throw that cake again.
That'll be in the back of his head for

917
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,810
the rest of his life.
Every time he throws that Bitch Ass Co.

918
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,770
Oh Dude.
He's just setting him art.

919
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,780
There you go.
What happened now joe would haven't

920
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,170
seen?
Do you know of this?

921
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,780
Time is going to get tired.
I take a shit in the first round.

922
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
He's tired.
It's time to take a seat.

923
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,800
Why would you want to bet on this fight?
Yeah,

924
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:41,321
I do.
Okay.

925
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,660
How much?
I'll bet you a $1 fucking million

926
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,570
dollars.
Wow.

927
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,080
You actually have $1 million now,
so that's interesting.

928
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,720
I do see how the Internet,
if you look at my,

929
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,780
my net worth,
it's I think it says I'm worth 200 grand

930
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,490
and has a picture of British show.
Interesting.

931
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,070
I really did for me too.
My,

932
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,960
my network.
It was a picture of Brendan Schaub was

933
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,320
one.
He's fun.

934
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,290
Well,
it said Brian and I were brothers or I'm

935
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,180
on Wikipedia for like 10 years ago.
Everybody would say that pauly shore

936
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,960
thought you would have brothers.
Everybody did.

937
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:13,390
Well,
it makes sense to that picture that

938
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:16,570
Brian post of you guys in the early
nineties hilarious dude.

939
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,880
You had some swag,
dude.

940
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,460
Good luck.
Rip Right Jamie.

941
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,480
I was like,
I did.

942
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,830
That's the first thing I noticed.
Look,

943
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,860
your bro gets fucking fashion,
by the way.

944
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,280
You guys both shiny clothes back then.
That was like 95 this is why you and I

945
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,270
get along.
He was a kid.

946
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,690
He was a good look at who's cutie pie
guys.

947
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,880
Girls liked him.
That shit,

948
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,560
that liberace front with the fucking
leather jacket.

949
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,980
Those biker jackets are still in.
I still have that jacket and I'm not

950
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,640
lying.
Fairly muscular.

951
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,840
You guys just got busted Gerkin no,
no.

952
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,690
Like just pull their dick out.
And by the way,

953
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,850
you had never smoked weed.
You had never done any drugs.

954
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:55,361
People are like,
oh,

955
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:57,670
well the cocaine now we didn't do,
I'd never done blah.

956
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,970
We had a little bit of booze or drug of
choice was,

957
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,830
was it Brian?

958
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,990
I was 20 I was editing.
I was 28 29 yeah.

959
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,960
We were like,
I think it was 27 they're doing,

960
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,980
yeah.
Yeah.

961
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,550
I was 27 you were 28 if I had a time,
if your boy just cracked my day,

962
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:16,900
I was with the right hands,
right dude,

963
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,240
don't ever,
I'm losing my dog.

964
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,710
He throws that bitch ass kick again.
He gets taken down.

965
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,870
That's just a dude.
He's just buttering them up.

966
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,500
Ooh,
Mitchell and riskier tonto because

967
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,430
someone needs to take that guy to duke.
Roufus his place.

968
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,030
Teach him how to throw a kick dude.
Belters John that back the the lights

969
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:31,864
again.
Huh?

970
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,350
You got Mitch,
your own killed.

971
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:39,010
10 is February 15th the next night's MVP
versus daily.

972
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,240
Hey,
it must be working.

973
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,750
Do you guys want to go to Phoenix to see
cain fight in Ghana?

974
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,950
You want to just fucking get on with.
Is that it's like s it's a Sunday.

975
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,690
It's a Sunday.
I could do it.

976
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,180
I'm thinking about just fucking flying
to Phoenix.

977
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,620
I never go to a live USC as a fan,
but I want to see cain versus in Ghana.

978
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,130
The arena though,
100%

979
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,050
going to snipe me out.
It was going to stab you owe

980
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,480
me.
The four of us is the go live.

981
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,840
We'll put fucking snapchat cameras on
our eyeglasses.

982
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,180
What?
What is the day?

983
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,900
It's a Sunday night.
It's the 17th.

984
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,880
We check every free coun.
Yep.

985
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,160
What'd you want to do?
I do it.

986
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,550
Take a private jet as long as it's not
this weekend.

987
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,670
Sounds like we're talking Eddie or fun
man.

988
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,250
Was that seems stressed about it.
Oh look at this boy.

989
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,480
Your boy got good.
Uh,

990
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,270
you're,
you're a DM buddy has got good takedown

991
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,790
beef.
Yes.

992
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,820
And it does cause he knew he was
fighting a wrestler Bro.

993
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,820
Oh,
blocked second round.

994
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:50,720
Two rounds in the book for the,
for [inaudible] they had to Francis

995
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,560
Keynesian epic fights an epic fight.
Not really.

996
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,420
How about this?
Not even at the most,

997
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,550
not even a little bit epic.
Here's why.

998
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,650
Why?
Because Mr and Ghana,

999
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,030
all due respect,
great athlete came to two.

1000
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,210
Okay.
Once again,

1001
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,730
Keynes had 150 surgeries.
How it goes.

1002
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,520
He's 37 years old.
He a fake skull.

1003
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,320
You want an how it goes.
Ready?

1004
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,130
Okay.
Is it lowers can text him down and then

1005
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,000
punches in the face until it's over.
I don't think so.

1006
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:24,170
It might not to be like jds I think
can't get to a hundred I hate to agree

1007
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,004
with Brian,
but

1008
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:30,010
yeah,
agreed on anything.

1009
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,790
It's true.
Guess that wrestling you went to knock

1010
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,470
them out.

1011
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,570
JDS Did.
Cain wins,

1012
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,910
but I don't think he gets a single leg
and just take some,

1013
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,460
Jesus
puts his head in his chest and his bank.

1014
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,220
JDS for sure in Ghana is fucking
dangerous unless you,

1015
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,190
unless you have cardio,
he's showing something to fight.

1016
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:52,750
He didn't know what the fuck he was
doing.

1017
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,460
He thought,
well the Steve Bay fight,

1018
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:56,040
he thought he was going to win that
fight by Kao.

1019
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,610
You thought it was just going to go out
there and Kale.

1020
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,780
He did land good shots on curtis plates
and that second fight and curse plays a

1021
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:05,240
good wrestler in Carlos too.
What would it be,

1022
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,380
Mark Curtis plates in that second fight?
You got to remember he just fucked up.

1023
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:10,690
Curtis bleeds.
I totally forgot about that and forgot

1024
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:12,640
about it.
That's why I work for the FCA and you're

1025
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:13,900
going to have a hard time getting in the
arena.

1026
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,340
Hey guys,
there's a fight.

1027
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,960
Might be funny to do a fight companion,
but all free travel.

1028
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,290
I always travel so,
but I was thinking like if you're going

1029
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,120
to be taking [inaudible] leaves

1030
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,320
a party,
have a good time.

1031
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,090
Oh,
goodbye.

1032
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,190
We're all married.
No,

1033
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,980
your boy is not going to take him down.
He hasn't taken them down yet.

1034
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,930
This is the third round,
dude.

1035
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,090
It's not happening.
He needs to let that go and learn how to

1036
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:44,290
kick with that left.
Oh boy.

1037
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,623
Yeah.
Oh boy.

1038
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,770
He's got a pummel under with that left
hand.

1039
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,840
He's going to get it and when he gets
it,

1040
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:51,610
he's gonna Circle off and we circles
off.

1041
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:55,090
Your boy's going to be more tired.
I am a commentator,

1042
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,220
Tj and yours looks like actor.
Oh your boy.

1043
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,930
Got You.
Gotta Watch that knee.

1044
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,050
The right hand and he's fucked up and he
was what?

1045
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,590
His right leg.
Just do their archeletta was a wrestler.

1046
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:09,251
He's fine.
Oh,

1047
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:10,840
he's a no,
he's in a world of shit.

1048
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,140
Wrestle the shit your boys.
And a lot of trouble,

1049
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:14,540
dude.

1050
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,590
Be Honest.
Be Honest,

1051
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,790
be honest.
Want to,

1052
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:17,771
nope.
Not even gonna.

1053
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:20,990
I'm not as a turtle.
Tried something and bailed on it halfway

1054
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,810
in better.
You know your boys losing the fight.

1055
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,160
You know that.
We understand that.

1056
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,320
He might have said,
oh,

1057
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:27,154
look at it.
Wait a minute.

1058
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,400
Oh,
I was going to be for,

1059
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,070
he gets back to his feet.
That doesn't even count.

1060
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:34,980
Djs right there.
T has given him Joe Daddy there talking

1061
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:35,610
to him.
Yeah.

1062
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,150
What are they saying as well as dark
corner of the house?

1063
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,630
I'll text both of them.
Right?

1064
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,700
You're saying you need to stop him?
Nope,

1065
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,530
they're gone yet.
We got cub,

1066
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,390
Swanson,
Tj dillashaw and Joe Daddy seems in his

1067
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,250
on a corner the best efforts corner.
Pretty God damn good corner.

1068
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,650
You boys aggressive.
I'll tell you that.

1069
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,030
Hey,
it's not letting go.

1070
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,931
No,
dude,

1071
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:58,860
I told you I think Ben Davis is winning
though and days he's losing his land to

1072
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,170
collect on a dollar at the end of this
fight.

1073
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,510
Off a shot.
Look at this start capping.

1074
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,270
Probably win the fight.
Joe.

1075
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,170
Just from control.
That's controlling.

1076
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:12,180
I'm sensing Idm,
this guy,

1077
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,050
you guys are out of your mind.

1078
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,440
It's my birthday.
I get what I want would be kind of fun

1079
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,390
to do a flight companion that might be
better.

1080
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,630
I think that is test and we never get to
really do them for big.

1081
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,390
We don't have to go anywhere.
We don't get it fucked up.

1082
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,370
Legit.
Once I quit the UFC,

1083
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,430
like we should travel like one or two in
Vegas and do live companions

1084
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,700
from money from,
well I don't know if they'll let me but

1085
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:44,620
from like a dope fucking sweet.
Ooh,

1086
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,560
but you want to be on the floor,
man.

1087
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,070
I like your food truck thing.
It's pretty,

1088
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,100
pretty good.
Thank you sir.

1089
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,740
With better.
I got so hungry looking at those steak

1090
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,574
and cheese,
a text.

1091
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,820
I texted Brendan immediately.
They were so good dude.

1092
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,530
And I'm doing a lobster roll one.
Ooh is a place called fuck.

1093
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:02,800
I think it's Maine lobster.

1094
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,340
They are not the best.
I had cousins,

1095
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,070
cousins I've had that they are talent.
I bought you one.

1096
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,290
Remember that Alicia's role,
the best lots role in the world.

1097
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:13,801
Like,
it's like,

1098
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,290
it's like $15 and then you don't care.
I don't give a fuck.

1099
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:17,700
So good.
I buy four of them.

1100
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,740
Brian,
you're worth $200,000 a quarter to a

1101
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:20,760
celebrity net worth.
I know.

1102
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:22,050
So what's that?
Oh,

1103
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,310
come on.
Your boys getting fucked up.

1104
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,220
Fucked up.
Snatches ankle disaster.

1105
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,320
Watch this.
Just keep your hand up.

1106
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:29,310
Look at him.
Toying with him.

1107
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:34,311
Twine like a cat and a mouse.
It in their fucking your dms.

1108
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,400
Me Nothing to,
you know what else we should do?

1109
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,190
Campaign as for big ass box and flex to
yes,

1110
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,120
like cheery to them too.
Siri wild or too,

1111
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,410
whatever.
You're not working.

1112
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:48,450
Lets you do one and my tv show guys.

1113
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,420
Oh that'd be so much fun.
No,

1114
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:55,200
we're not doing that.
You see broner versus packout and then

1115
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,190
broner afterwards saying that he beat
that guy up.

1116
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,000
Well we watched it in the back of my
taping.

1117
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,650
What the fuck?
I watched the whole fight out.

1118
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,140
Me Too.
Like what the fuck is wrong with him?

1119
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,170
Do we beat the shit out of him?
No,

1120
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,490
he just beat him.
What's that movie?

1121
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,301
Oh,
you got it.

1122
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,720
I downloaded it a long time ago.
Oh that roar,

1123
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,760
that crazy movie with the fucking lions
man.

1124
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,680
It's a guy who trained lines and did a
whole movie with real lions where they

1125
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:22,740
wrestled him and shit and they had the
lions like played actors in the movie

1126
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,110
that someone died.
Two people got fucked up making the

1127
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:26,040
movie.
Oh really?

1128
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,990
Yeah.
Well they're giant cats.

1129
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,980
This is the movie of all time.

1130
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,100
It's pretty bad movie.
But it's like super dangerous cause

1131
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,230
they,
they taunted the lions to get them to do

1132
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:36,720
shit and the scenes.
Why?

1133
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:37,630
Exactly.
Yeah,

1134
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,670
definitely.
During the making of that movie,

1135
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,170
17
people actually died.

1136
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,520
You boy got side kicked in the body.
You see that pride.

1137
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,970
He was winning this cat.
What?

1138
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,130
What did,
what are you talking about?

1139
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,420
You Bro.
Whoa,

1140
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,810
look at this.
That's it.

1141
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,090
That's the third round or just a lot of
problems.

1142
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,050
Although she's side,
that guy's a stud and his debut took

1143
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,370
some harsh 21 and one is that his debut
though?

1144
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:09,730
He's 21 and one night.
Probably his first fight bell towards

1145
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:11,420
the big four.
What's he been fighting saying?

1146
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,250
I don't know.
He wasn't fighting in bell to her for,

1147
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,550
I think this is one of us.
What's he been fighting and Jamie,

1148
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,340
I mean 21 and one get in there,
bro.

1149
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:26,740
You see zero fighting the fourth,
fourth fight in bellator.

1150
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:32,180
Goddammit private Ryan
trying to hype the guy throwing shit

1151
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,480
out.
Just let me throw some stuff on the

1152
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:36,310
wall.
You were friends with him.

1153
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,860
He's my buddy.
One time

1154
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:43,560
I did a bunch of episodes of kingdoms.
Anybody who wants to ski,

1155
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,820
I'm thinking warrior.
Does anybody else want any of this

1156
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,380
whiskey?
I don't do well in whiskey.

1157
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:49,730
Think he turns it into whiskey and then
we'll come out.

1158
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,840
I'll shit my pants.
What is our rating of this wine?

1159
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:55,150
Is it just okay?
He's tried it.

1160
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,080
Is it okay to mix it?
I'm more than happy with it.

1161
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,990
Almost corked.
Yeah,

1162
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:00,910
let's try the other bottle.
I'm not too happy with this.

1163
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,110
Those fuckers.
This cost me to,

1164
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,820
you know,
to be great with this cheese.

1165
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,820
Be Cheese fucked up.
I got some old cheese in the fridge.

1166
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:09,750
Pastors,
I forgot the cheese.

1167
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,150
It's a little less attractive than old
cheese cheese.

1168
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,740
Old Cheese actually holds.
If there is,

1169
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,210
it'll be fine,
dude.

1170
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:20,920
The fuck out of here?
My refrigerator,

1171
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,500
she's sitting next to a block of elk.
I would fuck up

1172
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,770
government cheese.
What the fuck was up with that school at

1173
00:49:28,771 --> 00:49:30,410
school?
They give you the real cheese.

1174
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,420
Whoa.
Boom.

1175
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,430
Government cheese.
Would you,

1176
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,580
were you ever on food stamps?
They put in that cheese.

1177
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,040
Well,
it's just shitty cheese.

1178
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,031
They're like,
here,

1179
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:45,070
I just want it back.
You ever on,

1180
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,160
did you ever get food stamps when your
kid,

1181
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:52,080
believe it or not,
my mom qualified for one month.

1182
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,690
She made too much money.
She made like 200 bucks,

1183
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,330
150 bucks a week,
but we did get it.

1184
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:59,430
I'll never forget.
We got one for one month.

1185
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,700
We got food stamps and we went to the
supermarket.

1186
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:05,500
We went on to vons on,
on Bristol.

1187
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:09,510
I'll never forget this because my mom
said get anything you fucking want

1188
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,300
because she knew it was going to be her
last one.

1189
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,170
So we just went straight to the cereal
aisle and generally my mom would get us

1190
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:19,170
like toasty outs,
like a big sack because she knew if she

1191
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:22,770
bought like cocoa pebbles of Shit will
be gone in like 15 minutes.

1192
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,200
She would always get us like the worst
serial.

1193
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,030
Just silicon last,
you know?

1194
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,980
But that time

1195
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,761
sheet,
what'd you get?

1196
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:33,180
Lucky charms.
What do kids do before there was slew

1197
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:36,510
capillary cookie crisp.
I honey cow.

1198
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,010
My chef made me a mom.
Man Count.

1199
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,970
Chocula.
All right.

1200
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,804
Who won?
Who won?

1201
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,930
Let's say yes off course.
Dot.

1202
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,980
Already you have a doll ready for me?
Yeah,

1203
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,820
dude,
there's no shot.

1204
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:49,230
Your boy one he got,
he got taken down over and over.

1205
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,560
Not really.
He didn't get back up to his feet,

1206
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:55,290
but I think he controlled enough.
You boy landed better shots there.

1207
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,110
You win,
got damaged.

1208
00:50:57,111 --> 00:50:58,160
What was the score?
Do we know?

1209
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,280
Does it matter?
Was like a hundred to zero.

1210
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,140
Here's a dollar.
Here you go.

1211
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,590
That's a better,
that's a better fucking dude.

1212
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,270
Look at frank trigg was the ref.
Did you notice that?

1213
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,410
No,
I try not to

1214
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,880
dude,
and I don't want to do it though.

1215
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,660
What were you going to do?
You get caught myself better.

1216
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,740
I'm getting better.
Getting better at this.

1217
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:32,000
Like a demon inside of me.
Blurted out.

1218
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,420
17 if there's fight win streak dude.
That's awesome.

1219
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:40,190
Wrestlers man was out 35 or 45 handsome
young feller.

1220
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,400
That's a good question.
I think he's 45 I might be wrong though.

1221
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,200
Yeah.
45 right?

1222
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,490
Cause uh,
I don't know.

1223
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,730
45 pretty sure.
It's hard to tell.

1224
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,810
I'll tell you what though.
Your boy is game and hell of a fighter.

1225
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,930
I'm a fighter.
You know what man,

1226
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,140
if there's one school,
that nice head kick right there that he

1227
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:03,500
ate.
If there's one skill that a fighter

1228
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,800
should have for it is wrestling,
right?

1229
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,930
It means God damn.
If you could dictate where the fight

1230
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:11,260
takes place,
everything that is so giant,

1231
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,150
they keep showing him getting lit up.
Brendan,

1232
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:17,810
I know you're against stuck kicking to
the knee to the foot,

1233
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,490
foot stomps or you just kind of,
it's just,

1234
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,280
it's a bitch move.
I remember when guides,

1235
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,380
if you don't like you to just be like,
come on.

1236
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:24,080
What?
It's like a,

1237
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,010
it's like bro Code.
You like,

1238
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:26,390
what the fuck you doing?
Cisco?

1239
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,510
We're stopping really feet.
We kind of bit stumps a foot.

1240
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:32,180
What are you doing bro?
It's obviously not going to affect the

1241
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,350
fight.
Just a bitch move.

1242
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,700
It doesn't affect them.
Not really.

1243
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,080
Can't feel it.
You're so amped up.

1244
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,430
No.
Afterwards your foot,

1245
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,750
your foot.
Fuck.

1246
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,940
But during the fight like what are you
doing dude?

1247
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,750
What do you think?
You could break a foot maybe if you're

1248
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,750
fucking bigfoot Silva and he stomped.

1249
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,920
Mark used to do that shit.
Yeah,

1250
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,710
he was so hard.
I'm sure if you are a real bitch,

1251
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:55,580
he could do it for real bitch ass bitch.
What if you broke someone's foot?

1252
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:57,790
If we stomped down their foot and snap
their medicar.

1253
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,660
Okay,
you went by foot stomp.

1254
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,030
Congrats.
Wow.

1255
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,820
Damn.
Yeah,

1256
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,350
he knows a lot of time.
I know exactly what you're talking

1257
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,090
about.
Fucking ever stomped feet when I fight.

1258
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,720
Notice most people don't.
Most guys don't.

1259
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,770
John Wick used it in the bath house
scene.

1260
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,890
Ooh,
stomp the dude's footage shot on the

1261
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:18,120
chest.
When is that going to happen?

1262
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,240
That's for the title.
That's how quick fitch gets a shot at

1263
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,480
the title.
Well it's cause it's the welterweight

1264
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,311
tournament.
So anyway,

1265
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:25,010
having fights.
Roy can kids a shot at the,

1266
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,093
it's pretty dope.

1267
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,851
Yeah.
He wrestled.

1268
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,940
Fuck Paul daily and then he's
immediately getting a shot at the title.

1269
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,320
That's a good site.
It is a shot.

1270
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:31,800
Great.
Ross.

1271
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,360
It is an interesting fight and
especially if I like it and beltre cause

1272
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:38,730
they're a little more lenient in their
substance.

1273
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,320
Oh,
don't get protection,

1274
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,600
sir.
Yes sir.

1275
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,490
Yes.
We trying to lenient.

1276
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,680
Well,
Fitch said tested positive before.

1277
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,940
No one gives a fuck about Roy McDonald.
How he works at Google right there.

1278
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,640
Holy Fuck.
He works in a murdering department.

1279
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,580
He's there.
Somebody like leaks out some trade

1280
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:05,120
secrets.
I know you guys because it shows up at

1281
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,890
your house.
Why the best I can imagine a pencil.

1282
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:11,610
He shoves it through your forehead.
He looks like he's in shape and he

1283
00:54:11,611 --> 00:54:15,360
works.
He's the guy who plays the riddler and

1284
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:16,780
got them.
Exactly.

1285
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,820
He's the Canadian site.
Seen that exact day about worry.

1286
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,990
As much as you see his glasses is preppy
shirts.

1287
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,220
You look in his eyes and you go,

1288
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,890
yeah,
I'm all set.

1289
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,470
I'm all set with this done.
It's going to go over here.

1290
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,380
I'm not,
I'm not going to argue with him about

1291
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:36,150
that on the podcast a long time ago.
You,

1292
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,210
you,
oh yeah.

1293
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,340
Oh come on God.
That's good.

1294
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,430
Good call.
Wow,

1295
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,780
that's crazy.
Every angle.

1296
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:52,950
It's not just certain angles.

1297
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,640
That's crazy.
Look at him on TV and look at Rory.

1298
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,330
Wow is crazy.
He hates this shit cause I told me

1299
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,940
should go by Canadian psycho and he
didn't know that right there.

1300
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,580
That's right.
That crazy

1301
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,600
fish is a stud.
Fish is a fucking savage.

1302
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:16,980
But been in the game.
A La dude heat loans at welterweight

1303
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:19,190
dish argument and he's one of the top,
I mean,

1304
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,090
top six.
And you look at it,

1305
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:26,220
he didn't do is he looks like
he fucked him up.

1306
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,870
John.
I mean a Hendrix.

1307
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:32,871
Johny Hendricks fucked him up.
He's a very straight for a long time.

1308
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,420
No doubt about it.
Animal Go Jake Hagar,

1309
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,220
also known as Jack Swagger.
Y'All.

1310
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,780
He beat Eric Silva when Eric's hill was
a not under the care of Usada.

1311
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,730
How big is that guy?
He's he bending.

1312
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:46,270
Is He,
is he not able to he to be.

1313
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,203
He's taller than me.

1314
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,580
He's probably,
they say six seven that's full shit guy.

1315
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:55,150
He's six five and he wrestled at
Oklahoma and he became twila allison

1316
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,020
one.
Over time they're getting him to fight a

1317
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,830
guy who makes me ball subs for a living
meatballs,

1318
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:02,640
so,
oh my God,

1319
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,470
boy.
I liked that right hand

1320
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,440
shoulder.
It's like the chicken and waffles.

1321
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:13,260
Roscoe's in the background representing
dude,

1322
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:17,160
that guy's about to get was the last
time he ate at Roscoe's doing a hot mic.

1323
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:22,161
When I was in Vegas for fight week,
when Tony fought anthony,

1324
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,220
they got this chicken and waffle place.
I forget what it's called,

1325
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,700
but it's a chain.
Did I eat chicken and waffles every

1326
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:33,250
fucking day?
It's delicious.

1327
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:34,240
Calm.
Jesus Christ.

1328
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,520
I forget the name of it,
but it's a change in good way to get

1329
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:39,140
fat.
It's always in Dublin right now.

1330
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,760
It was hilarious.
He was Haitian and did a whole thing up,

1331
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:46,180
a series of posts for from a whiskey
place talking about,

1332
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:47,910
great,
this whiskey is the best whiskey in

1333
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,550
Ireland.

1334
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,790
And people like he's throwing shade,
he's throwing shade.

1335
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,410
Like how's he throwing shade?
They're paid him.

1336
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,530
They paid him to go off and he's the
fucking featherweight champion of the

1337
00:56:56,531 --> 00:56:59,410
planet or star just because they paid
him,

1338
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,730
but they paid them to go to Dublin.
Whoever made up

1339
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,400
the whiskey company forum.
Jamison all to what?

1340
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:13,630
A classic movies.
Classic move.

1341
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,190
Proper checks.
Wow.

1342
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,180
Yeah.
Oh,

1343
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:19,841
champ.
Champ.

1344
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:20,710
What?
And I'm a,

1345
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,530
I'm a fan of proper whiskey,
however tried it.

1346
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,200
I'm not a whiskey guy.
How should I try some buffalo trace

1347
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,180
motherfuckers?
I don't know.

1348
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,710
Good whisky that could be pissed.
Is that a good whiskey?

1349
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:30,603
Oh,
it's very good.

1350
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,593
I'll try it.
Yeah.

1351
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:33,731
Hold up.
Hold up.

1352
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:38,410
You ready for this?
This company was established in 1773

1353
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,620
it's not an ad right now.
It isn't that,

1354
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,890
oh,
it is at the beginning of the podcast

1355
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:47,891
and that this is a legitimate
17 hundreds really?

1356
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,810
Where's your fucking glass?
I don't have one.

1357
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:50,890
Apparently.

00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,430
I got my wrap party later.
Wrap these nuts in your mouth.

1361
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:01,080
Why and where did the wrap party?
This is the rock party.

1362
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,610
My TV show.
I'll just have a sip of his.

1363
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,880
I'll have a sip of Brian.
Do you don't want to

1364
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,070
tell me what's up?
What's up?

1365
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,000
What's up?
What's up?

1366
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,920
Yeah.
That's beautiful.

1367
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,260
That's beautiful.
That's a beautiful way.

1368
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:14,740
It's real.
What does that call shit?

1369
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,910
Buffalo Trace.
That's a beautiful no bullshit.

1370
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,580
This shit.
This shit is really been around since

1371
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:23,320
the 17 hundreds really isn't smooth.
When I say the oldest running whiskey in

1372
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:26,680
the in the country,
oldest running distillery on the planet

1373
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:30,160
as a smooth whiskey.
Bourbon whiskey as real shit.

1374
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,750
I like Blanton's.
I like that.

1375
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,890
I like Nikka coffee grain oof.

1376
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,450
Little [inaudible] I don't like with
this is this.

1377
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,980
I don't like whiskey and that is smooth
as fun.

1378
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,820
Kara Melanin.
Beautiful earthy Carmel,

1379
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,720
correct,
sir?

1380
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,600
Earthy.
You got some earth and some caravans.

1381
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,500
Where would people would they get with
wines?

1382
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,280
It's gets tenants that her counselor
left there.

1383
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,660
How about this Earth Chalk case?
I don't know what earth taste because

1384
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,200
I'm with my buddy.
It's nice.

1385
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,480
Made a lot of money,
a lot of money,

1386
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,810
hold on conversations.
I got to my buddy and went by by made a

1387
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:03,040
lot of money.
Whatever you think is a lot.

1388
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,850
He made more when you go to the fault of
the way and we and the somebody is there

1389
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,700
and he's looking at wines that are $700
something crazy.

1390
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,280
So we're going to get a crazy wine,
drink beer,

1391
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,030
eat a bunch of caviar.
And he goes,

1392
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:13,840
uh,
and she said,

1393
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,710
how would you describe this?

1394
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,260
I'd never had this,
but I've had the sister wine and she

1395
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:21,500
said,
it's like getting roundhouse kicked in

1396
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:25,810
the face by a ballerina and I have the
chicks at this.

1397
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,350
That's really how you're going to
describe this wine.

1398
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,470
It tells me nothing.
Was it nice that makes me think you're

1399
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,210
an asshole dude.
I don't have a dream.

1400
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,030
This might be my fucking through
Ballerina roundhouse kicks me in the

1401
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:35,541
face.
I'm like,

1402
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:38,260
I'm hanging around with the wrong girl.
I hated the fucking on me.

1403
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,490
I think he's filthy.
Kicked me in the face,

1404
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:41,690
filthy,
filthy.

1405
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,350
Go home.
TMZ.

1406
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:48,380
You ever had a girl hit you plc?
I don't know if swing at me once back

1407
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:51,980
when I was fighting and I saw her hand
come up and I saw her,

1408
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:55,430
her shoulder go back and I saw her right
hand come my way and I'm like,

1409
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:57,200
I don't believe this is even happening.

1410
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:00,740
Doubling garbage.
I ducked under and I just grabbed her.

1411
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,020
I had a girl reached out to the right
hand and grabbed her.

1412
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,270
I even think about hitting her cause it
was so ridiculous.

1413
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,940
I had to go reach down and grab a boot.
I said,

1414
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,190
you're being dumb.
I didn't say you're just

1415
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,250
trying to hit you.
Uh,

1416
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,650
she didn't just try to hit me.
She reached down.

1417
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,910
She goes,
I'm dumb.

1418
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,990
She didn't say,
I said,

1419
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:18,671
you're being done.
It's,

1420
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:19,101
hey,
you're Tom.

1421
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:20,240
She goes,
I'm dumb.

1422
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,500
And I went and before I could get out,
she fucking,

1423
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,680
she was athletic.
She reached down and grabbed my boot.

1424
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,330
She grabbed my boot by the,
you know,

1425
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:31,670
and,
and swung so hard.

1426
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:35,090
And I remember I ducked.
I just saw it coming and I just went,

1427
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,660
I ducked and it made a crashed into my
closet,

1428
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:42,640
you know,
and just meant a huge hole was not just

1429
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:43,483
what you do.

1430
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:45,260
That's true,
sir.

1431
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,580
That was the house.
Yes.

1432
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,760
Brian's house.
He has no door knob.

1433
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,040
Yup.
There's a whole,

1434
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:55,550
he was pushed his door and I go,
Bro,

1435
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,600
you don't have a door.
It's like,

1436
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,650
ah,
I gotta get it fixed.

1437
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,500
So one day I'll,
a homeless lady walked into his house

1438
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,890
and started making breakfast.
I had two pit bulls too.

1439
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,490
He was asleep.
Oh,

1440
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:06,620
homeless lady was making breakfast in
his kitchen.

1441
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:06,941
She's was like,
yeah,

1442
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,040
I had a really nice house.
It was,

1443
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:12,230
it wasn't sleep.
I came home and the neighbors were

1444
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:13,550
freaking out.
They had called the costs come in and

1445
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:15,350
she goes,
and I'm in there and she's making me a

1446
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:19,370
whole meal.
And I came in and my dogs were there and

1447
01:01:19,371 --> 01:01:19,941
she's like,
honey,

1448
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:22,740
you got it going on.
You got it going on the house.

1449
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,230
And the cops came,
you want to,

1450
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:24,711
I was like,
no,

1451
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:25,400
no,
it's fine.

1452
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:25,980
I go,
thank you.

1453
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,070
So [inaudible] called the cops though.
No door knob.

1454
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,570
She was making me a full meal.
It was fantastic.

1455
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:38,180
I was going to say two things,
not terrible really back then I was like

1456
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,820
roll the dice.
I mean if you had a little less crack a

1457
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,460
year before the crack epidemic,
maybe,

1458
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:48,500
dude,
when I first started training the girls

1459
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,040
I would date because I was training all
the time.

1460
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,550
Whenever we get all you did hit me in
the face,

1461
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:56,330
they'd always punched me or pushed me.
Cause you're so big,

1462
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,520
I hate it.
They can get away with it.

1463
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,290
Correct.
Because it's like hitting a punching

1464
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:01,124
bag.
Not Cool.

1465
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,250
Look,
it's going to come their way.

1466
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,090
Correct.
And then I remember I was living in this

1467
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:08,720
basement with all these roommates and me
and my girl at the time were fighting

1468
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,650
and I was like lifting a lot of spite to
65 at the time.

1469
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,770
And uh,
she did something that horrible.

1470
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:18,740
I forget what,
but it pissed me off and there's a couch

1471
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,310
and I wanted to leave.
And I remember I was like,

1472
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:24,270
just fucking do it.
I lifted up the couch and to me,

1473
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,150
I thought it was a heavy couch,
but it was like one of those Ikea

1474
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:30,990
couches.
This thing went and fucking hit the

1475
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:32,550
ceiling land on the wall.
And she's like,

1476
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,610
oh my God.
Like oh shit,

1477
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:35,970
it's fucking,
she got hot.

1478
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,830
No,
she wanted to call the cops.

1479
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:42,050
I'm like for throwing us so far,
I didn't mean to launch this Shitty Sofa

1480
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,400
over throwing us sofa.
I don't think you can.

1481
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:46,200
I don't think so.
If the cops came and you'd be like,

1482
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,680
I didn't throw it,
don't have to arrest someone or if it's

1483
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,580
a domestic violence call.
So even if it's not true,

1484
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,780
they got to take me away.
Yeah.

1485
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:54,290
But if it's not violence,
if the cops come hashtag no,

1486
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,970
Greg Hardy.
But if the cops come and you say,

1487
01:02:56,971 --> 01:02:59,610
I didn't do anything violent to her,
I just got mad.

1488
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:01,320
I threw the sofa over there.
Yeah.

1489
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,820
But then crazy bitches go.
Yeah.

1490
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,590
Doosh doosh doosh doosh doosh doosh I
know a guy did that with a girl.

1491
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,230
He started clawing his own arms.
Yeah.

1492
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,240
These kind of a pussy justice honor bit.
Yeah.

1493
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,370
That's my joke where I talk about
sometimes you get so mad at to grow that

1494
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,820
you want to kill yourself.
I don't think that's what happened.

1495
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:24,540
I think he did that because he thought
that she was going to fucking do it to

1496
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:25,780
him.
Oh,

1497
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,830
she was gonna call the cops and like
they were screaming at each other and

1498
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:30,330
they probably thought the neighbors
heard.

1499
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,300
Yeah.
Why?

1500
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,810
Like I'm gonna just fucking around.
He just started clawing themselves.

1501
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,260
But I told you,
I told you this story.

1502
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,350
I was breaking up with the girl.
I told her foot stumps.

1503
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,260
You remember that story I told you that
I was breaking up with the girl.

1504
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:45,990
She was moving out of my house.
She started opening my windows going

1505
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:47,460
stop heading,
man.

1506
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,640
Oh yeah.
And I was like closed in the winter.

1507
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,820
You don't hit him.
Look at this fight they're setting.

1508
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,460
Do you look at the genes?
He looks like the guy from Orange County

1509
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,260
choppers.
He's going to find those genes just so

1510
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:00,570
he can get dressed quick on the way out.
What?

1511
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,530
I'm paste.
Yeah.

1512
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:02,820
This is a cell.
Here's the fight.

1513
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:03,654
Ready,
takedown,

1514
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:06,060
grounded,
pound stoppage in a minute.

1515
01:04:06,061 --> 01:04:06,894
Quickly.
Yes.

1516
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,340
Yeah.
This is a setup.

1517
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,830
I don't like that.
What was that?

1518
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:11,720
His debut?
It's a,

1519
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,120
he's never fought before,
so having fight in a smaller

1520
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:17,670
organization and not just feed them to
these fucking,

1521
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,970
he shouldn't be,
he shouldn't be in jeans.

1522
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,780
It's not disrespectful to him and it's
not disrespectful to the sport,

1523
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:29,640
but it's disrespectful to a large scale
organization to have a guy who's a guy

1524
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:32,910
who's coming in from pro wrestling's,
got a big fan base,

1525
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:36,370
do it the right way and then eventually
make your way into a big organization.

1526
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,440
What are you talking about?

1527
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,510
He's like homemade event on espn.
Well,

1528
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:40,860
how'd that go?
How'd that work?

1529
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:42,210
Awful.
We watch it together.

1530
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,570
It was a joke.
Why knew that guy was,

1531
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:46,860
uh,
was fading quick.

1532
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,510
We were talking about it and your green
room.

1533
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,680
I was like,
he's fading.

1534
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,990
I don't like the way he's stepping.
He looks exhausted.

1535
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,970
He tired out quick and then he hit that
too.

1536
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:55,950
With the illegal knee.
Do you think he's still going to be in

1537
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:59,110
the UFC after that?
100% they've invested too much in I'm

1538
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,510
Dana said he's,
and you have another fight.

1539
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,840
Wow.
Interesting interest.

1540
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,440
It's a bummer.
But that's the life we live.

1541
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,520
And what do you do with them?
What I do with them,

1542
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:10,740
I did give him Derek Lewis and give him
the fuck out and I go,

1543
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,930
oh,
he liked to hit women Lewis who came

1544
01:05:12,931 --> 01:05:14,410
from a domestic violence home.
Yeah,

1545
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,180
he's pretty good.

1546
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,800
Enjoy this.
I want to be a fighter.

1547
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,160
Here's Lewis,
Derek,

1548
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,670
Derek,
but too,

1549
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,060
now I know he asked mad how many fights
is greg hardy had was as,

1550
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,550
that'd be his fourth.
He had three on the whatever and white

1551
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,220
guy like that.
It was a pro bowler.

1552
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,310
Really Athletic.
Wouldn't his learning curve be very,

1553
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:34,370
very steep?
I would.

1554
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:35,270
Oh quick,
wouldn't he?

1555
01:05:35,271 --> 01:05:37,340
Wouldn't he?
He he just too much.

1556
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,520
There's too much.
There's too much to download.

1557
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:42,460
Especially at his age.
He's 30 so you got to download a lot of

1558
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:44,740
information.
So maybe he's working a lot on striking,

1559
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:47,770
but you can't cover Jiu Jitsu,
kickboxing,

1560
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,340
wrestling,
bottom at all.

1561
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,320
No matter who you are now it doesn't
matter you to take Herschel Walker.

1562
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:54,940
It doesn't matter if they're that great
of an athlete.

1563
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,600
It takes a fucking wild to learn the
skill.

1564
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,530
Well,
Herschel Walker was a world class

1565
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,770
athlete and a lifelong martial artists,
different animals,

1566
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,720
different,
but I'm saying even if you take an

1567
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:07,060
athletic like Lebron James would
struggle,

1568
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,320
did you throw it to the UFC?

1569
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,680
Firmly believed that Hershel Walker
would have given a lot of dudes a hard

1570
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:15,100
fucking time at his age or if you
started early in his forties even his

1571
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,730
forties I think he was such a fucking
freak stud of an athlete.

1572
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:22,770
He's such an outlier.
I'm going to give it a lot of speed.

1573
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,840
Heading to 35 he was running,
he was running Olympic speed.

1574
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,840
He's in the Olympics.
He was such a freak.

1575
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:32,350
It's just unbelievable and a real
martial artist,

1576
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,240
but you really had skills.
Like when,

1577
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,040
when I first saw him fight in the UFC I
was like,

1578
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,450
or it strikeforce rather.
I was like,

1579
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,640
oh my God.
Like he can actually fight.

1580
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,800
Like dudes are scared of him.
Like he was.

1581
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,040
He was moving in the right way.
It wasn't doing anything wrong.

1582
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,170
Who's taking guys down?
Smashing them.

1583
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,110
And the physical power that he had was
just scares body.

1584
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,610
So stupid.
Ridiculous.

1585
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:54,090
And also the team he trained with AK,
he was ready,

1586
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,800
he did it the right place and they gave
him the right fights.

1587
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,730
It was good.
Yeah.

1588
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,170
But if you started younger,
you dove real prominent hands,

1589
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,150
real problems.
If you wanted to be an actual,

1590
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,740
it's interesting because you know when
you get like elite athletes,

1591
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:13,360
how many of them actually want to fight?
Who's the most elite athlete in the UFC?

1592
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,190
I think Yoel Romero?
Yes,

1593
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:18,310
100% and he's a wrestler.
Cuba.

1594
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,860
Cuba.
It's either boxing or wrestling.

1595
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:26,410
Remember ul Romero is a freak and so
amazing because he came to mma at what?

1596
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,150
35 30 Oh,
with the Astros and to be 62 years old,

1597
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:34,450
walking on the beach with a Dick,
like a fucking quicker oats box.

1598
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:38,080
Hey,
between his leg direct dude,

1599
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:41,640
he's fighting fucking homeboy.
The other dining.

1600
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,570
Yes.
Paul Acosta.

1601
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,680
Eddie Bravo.
That's fucking tweet that day.

1602
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,830
What did he say?
He just said it to us,

1603
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,180
but it's a lesson of some private shit.

1604
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,480
I didn't make that,
but until we got a little grin to Jamie

1605
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:01,930
right now.
It's fucking great.

1606
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,050
Who is this guy?
You can ever take that JW Kaiser.

1607
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:09,660
I don't do means he,
some guy's about to get fucked up.

1608
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:13,240
I don't need to download his information
coming up.

1609
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:15,040
Jack Swagger's the guy should probably
take notice.

1610
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,130
Okay.
I'm not,

1611
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,650
I'm not mad at the bell.
Two are girls not mad at all.

1612
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:21,410
Dude.
Mercies mattered at all.

1613
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,940
My wow.
Paula Costa and Yoel Romero for sure

1614
01:08:25,941 --> 01:08:29,030
have the best board.
100% 100%

1615
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,560
pound.
Yeah,

1616
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,690
but Luke rockhold is longer and thinner.
He's beautiful model.

1617
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,970
Beautiful.
But there's a big difference.

1618
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,800
He doesn't want to be a gorilla.
Look at this.

1619
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,960
Yo Mirror was,
Eddie said that just today we're fucking

1620
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,330
house.
How

1621
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,120
he sent it,
not make that didn't make it.

1622
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,930
I agree with it.
I sent it to the UFC

1623
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:06,170
prior to agree with it.
I don't even want to know what to say

1624
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:07,004
right now.

1625
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,810
Let me say that Shit.
You stay up the,

1626
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,600
I'm trying to get fired.
They call me in this week to do fucking

1627
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:19,250
the breakdowns.
Shit.

1628
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,850
Fight breakdowns.
I think you shouted test two more.

1629
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:25,190
I think it just got a bell toward tattoo
on his back.

1630
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:28,530
Oh shit he does.
It's like slash bell towards slash

1631
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,500
Caribbean slash 300 movies slash
[inaudible] has health.

1632
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,810
Imagine if a guy had all giant depths
tattoos.

1633
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:39,140
That'd be sick.
Now the other guy's a pro wrestler.

1634
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,440
I don't know anything about them.
Yeah,

1635
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:42,710
in Wf for lunch,
you can go ask.

1636
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:46,550
Is anyone want to bet?

01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:06,890

1693
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,740
I like the red jeans about,
I don't like the white shoes with Eddie.

1694
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:08,140
Let me ask you this.
Do you ever to fashion or are you just

1695
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:09,700
like me?
You know what?

1696
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,280
If I was single,
I'd be all up in fashion.

1697
01:12:12,281 --> 01:12:13,710
I've been hanging out with Brendan.
Dude,

1698
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:16,510
you liked fashion in the day.
Back in the day when you're talking

1699
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:20,650
about that vintage Modo jacket,
you saw how bad my style was.

1700
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,610
You just,
what I would wear,

1701
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:24,460
I would wear like bowling shirts that
were very flashy.

1702
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,620
I would find them and they were shining
or wear them on stage.

1703
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:29,920
We're probably headed to a show.
Brian and I were probably our way out to

1704
01:12:29,921 --> 01:12:32,380
a show.
You have any idea where we were going

1705
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,540
and that photo,
but we were 12 I know exactly where we

1706
01:12:35,541 --> 01:12:36,390
were.
Where were we going there?

1707
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,890
You had performed at the Gox in a comedy
club.

1708
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:40,910
Oh,
we ran out of your facility,

1709
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:41,823
dude.
Big Ones.

1710
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,730
And you crushed and we were with Patty
Jenkins in fact.

1711
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:49,840
And you crushed the room.
I remember you crushed it.

1712
01:12:49,841 --> 01:12:51,940
And then we,
I'm going to be honest with my friend

1713
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,873
Maria.

1714
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:58,900
What do you mean you weren't used to use
to crush room?

1715
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:04,540
What you oh it in 90 I remember him at
98 99 he would do fucking,

1716
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,640
you would crush rooms.
I still have.

1717
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:11,680
They still play my sense on serious.
I've never seen anybody who maybe never

1718
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:14,830
seen anybody crush room the way you,
when you would do that shit when you

1719
01:13:14,831 --> 01:13:15,970
were younger.
It was nuts.

1720
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,830
You'd come off completely drenched in
sweat.

1721
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,330
The one,
I'll look it up.

1722
01:13:19,331 --> 01:13:22,000
Shout out to baby slice.
Kimbo slice his son.

1723
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,920

What time does it start?

1734
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,610
It starts at seven but I mean I got

1735
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,360

1737
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:46,940
bro.
Bro.

1738
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,490
Imagine if you get there and there's no
one there.

1739
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,870
If you go there now you're going to be
met with the extras who have scripts for

1740
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:53,890
you.
Yeah.

1741
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:56,350
Hey Brian,
I want to talk to you about this

1742
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,110
independent film.
Dude,

1743
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,700
let me on your podcast podcast.
Do you have it?

1744
01:14:00,701 --> 01:14:04,210
People tried to get on your podcast,
don't want on your podcast.

1745
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:04,961
What do you do?
Oh,

1746
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:07,480
that we had some issues and we blame
each other.

1747
01:14:07,481 --> 01:14:09,490
I go,
you got to talk to Brian to read books.

1748
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,130
All of it.
That's what Brian Blades,

1749
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,830
migos yet tuck shop.
He books it.

1750
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,530
I just say this.
I say the truth.

1751
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:19,210
I say we have sponsors and there's that.
They don't let you called them.

1752
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:21,310
They sent her about it.
We hear about it from our sponsors and

1753
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,170
also Brendan doesn't like you.
I say those things.

1754
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:28,510
So your homeboys 36 hagers 36 he
wrestled for 12 years out of collect

1755
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,650
cow.
He's going with his real name.

1756
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:31,270
He wrestled.
He has to like,

1757
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:33,490
you know the rock can't go as the rocky
movies anymore.

1758
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:37,510
Otherwise wwe gets a percentage of it
because they own the name the rock.

1759
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:38,801
Yeah.
Oh,

1760
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:43,240
so he's a legit professional wrestler as
in wwe for 12 years.

1761
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:44,450
But before that,
Russell,

1762
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:47,570
that Oklahoma like legit restaurant,
oh,

1763
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:49,090
I ain't got to hold up.
First of all,

1764
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,360
this muscle of athlete,
he is got a scholarship to play football

1765
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:54,430
at Oklahoma.
And then when I was like,

1766
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,660
Eh,
I don't know about this,

1767
01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:59,680
when and when it did wrestling instead
cheese freak freak.

1768
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,880
Oklahoma's as big as they get.
He was at the same time I was there and

1769
01:15:02,881 --> 01:15:03,940
they were gone.

1770
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,060
Was he a walk on a I'm not.
I think they gave him a scholarship.

1771
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:07,960
I think it was all,
yeah,

1772
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:09,910
he's a monster.
So the wrestle in high school as well.

1773
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,320
This guy looks,
I'm sorry.

1774
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:13,130
I'll do respect that guy.
Looks like a regular guy.

1775
01:15:13,131 --> 01:15:16,000
Does he sells cheese stick?
He sells tires.

1776
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:16,990
Is that true?
Yes.

1777
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,520
Discount tires.
All right,

1778
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:19,810
well,
so this is his first.

1779
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,330
If there's a guy's listening at one
point in his life,

1780
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,690
no disrespect bro.
No,

1781
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:26,080
no tires are fucking tongue.
He's in there.

1782
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,300
He might win by knockout.
He's in.

1783
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:29,440
He's in there.
You've got to respect that.

1784
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:32,020
Imagine if that tire salesman just
fucking hits it with a hammer.

1785
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,480
It's Tony Buck got himself in there.
Yeah,

1786
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:36,790
he's a professional fighters.
It'll beat the shit out of me.

1787
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,680
I could.
Mike Beltrani beat him up.

1788
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,360
Yes.
Well Mike beltron would kill him with

1789
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:41,194
his mustache.

1790
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,020
He's got that shit ready cause a mother
fuckers slips.

1791
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:46,540
He's a good man.
Mike Bell trend is a brown belt in

1792
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:49,120
Jujitsu.
He's a little cheer for you to also one

1793
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:52,420
of the best reps and legit person.
Really good guy.

1794
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:55,990
Super Smart.
He always gives you a real warm hug and

1795
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:57,580
he's a very,
very good referee.

1796
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:58,920
And his beer,
I like olives.

1797
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,680
I say top three referee in the planet
and stuff.

1798
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,690
100% a great guy.
You know there's a few,

1799
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,720
well I want to,
I don't know.

1800
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,950
I don't even want to put them in order
because I have to.

1801
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,690
Here's one.
It doesn't get enough love.

1802
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:13,960
Josh Rosenthal.
Oh boy.

1803
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,290
Well guess what was the wrestling?
Rosenthal don't get left cause he was

1804
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,690
gone for eight years.
No,

1805
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:18,851
no,
no.

1806
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:21,840
He wasn't gone.
He went away for,

1807
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,590
no,
I don't even think it was three.

1808
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,453
He went away.

1809
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:27,490
He got six years,
right?

1810
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:31,970
I think I dunno over some shit that he,
he wouldn't get thrown in jail.

1811
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,130
La.
I love Josh.

1812
01:16:35,131 --> 01:16:37,900
He's cost,
but I'm just saying he went away for a

1813
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,220
hot minute there.
There was also,

1814
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,550
I think you have guns and it's not just
pot.

1815
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,680
You get caught with guns and even if you
have the guns legally,

1816
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,330
I think there's a lot of sugar.
What are your boy,

1817
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:53,830
your boy swaggers about to submit him
while he's in half guard.

1818
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,410
The power,
the Bron Waterman.

1819
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:58,180
Fucking can we go with that?
With the old UK law.

1820
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:01,370
You can win a camera from half cluck.
You definitely can get up there.

1821
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,890
He's got it.
He just needs to sit back.

1822
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:05,020
Yeah.
Well don't do the straight arm.

1823
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,770
He's not sure how to do it though,
is he?

1824
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,481
No,
he does.

1825
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:08,860
He's treading the powers we do.
Matt.

1826
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:09,620
Matt Hughes taps.

1827
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,900
I always do this straight.
More from half guard drill rigs.

1828
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,540
Matt Hughes Tap Joe rigs with the
Camorra from half court.

1829
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,620
Oh,
that was a big elbow that just missed.

1830
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,990
Had an arm.
Get that head and arm once wrestlers

1831
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:24,380
like a real wrestler gets a hold of you
like a Matt Hughes or this character.

1832
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,560
Oh Jesus.
Shit.

1833
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,290
Gorillas.
Gorilla stole Bo's.

1834
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:33,280
You know who's one of the strongest
people I've ever football.

1835
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,340
NFL,
UFC.

1836
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,380
Bobby Lashley.
Oh Geez.

1837
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:40,560
That mother fucker is Hashtag no racist.
Go real strong.

1838
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,640
Fucking belly will squeeze your Dick
off.

1839
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,940
He's so iteration for him.
Such a good wrestler.

1840
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,260
Yeah,
so jacked.

1841
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:50,080
I mean he might like have like the most
moms,

1842
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,870
she's going to smash these,
push it up.

1843
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,950
He's still trapped in habits over it.
Depends on how tough this guy is.

1844
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,320
It doesn't matter.
I don't know man.

1845
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:05,150
Oh,
same that he brought actually jagger

1846
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:05,570
baby.

1847
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:07,820
Congrats.
That's why any proper teaches you just

1848
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:10,430
to look at them.
It looks good man.

1849
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,960
Well now,
but huge guy make guy.

1850
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,120
He's Christ and a competitor.
Yeah,

1851
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,680
I mean he has some work to do obviously,
but he looks great for sure.

1852
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:19,180
He does.
And he's,

1853
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,740
he got on the mic and rip a great promo.
Yeah,

1854
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:22,820
that's what he does.
He doubt.

1855
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,510
Let's hear the Promo.
We'll definitely hit the program.

1856
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,230
He's a heel so you know he's going to
listen and that guy's fucking tough.

1857
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:31,610
That guy fought that guy.
He mean he got it out for as long as you

1858
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:32,281
can.
Don't look at me.

1859
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:34,740
What I'm saying.
I get bread in soft Claire.

1860
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,650
He said,
Brett is giving you the soft,

1861
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:39,410
that's what we call that.
The software might not be the most

1862
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:43,220
skillful and he definitely couldn't
handle this huge top flight.

1863
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:47,000
Probably didn't button,
probably doesn't belong in there with a

1864
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:48,440
guy that athletic and strong.

1865
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:49,460
And Brandon,
let me ask you this.

1866
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:50,870
How many guys you know that have fucked
up?

1867
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:53,900
Chipped up elbows.
That's a super common thing right here.

1868
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,610
Ships floating around in heel,
bone chips and shit and I was in a big

1869
01:18:58,611 --> 01:18:59,810
elbow guy,
just life.

1870
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,230
Did you ever see that picture of
[inaudible] Jack Harry went to the

1871
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:05,930
hospital and get bone chips.
He has no fucking,

1872
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,960
it was like no.
Like you know they took a table.

1873
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,620
They put like a little cup of nuts on
your table when you go to a nice

1874
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:13,880
restaurant.
That's where when you're on the

1875
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,440
airplane,
Macadamia nuts.

1876
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,150
That's what it looked like.
Airplane here.

1877
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:20,810
Airplane that they dropped the nuts off.
That's what it looked was in his elbow.

1878
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:23,090
Why put just macadamia?
That's it right there.

1879
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,520
Oh No.
That's all the shift from [inaudible]

1880
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:27,020
elbow.
What the fuck?

1881
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:30,650
Yeah Bro.
Listen when you just won't tap like Jack

1882
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:31,130
Ira.

1883
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,620
Did you ever see that was it?
It wasn't Abu Dhabi.

1884
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:34,740
What was it?
Was it the moon?

1885
01:19:34,741 --> 01:19:38,240
Dealz when he got arm barred by Hodgkin
and he wouldn't tap and hard.

1886
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:42,110
You're broke his arm and he tucked his
arm and his jacket and wanted decision

1887
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,180
rice.
Do you remember that?

1888
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,970
God Elba.
Elbows tucked his arm.

1889
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,250
Was it hot?
You're tucked his arm again.

1890
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:49,990
Oh,
I'm wrong.

1891
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,430
Yeah.
Who tapped him though wasn't it wasn't

1892
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:53,850
joc array was it?
No,

1893
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:58,020
it was it a Boucher.
You have a role with Patricia will

1894
01:19:58,021 --> 01:20:02,750
somebody did Jacques Arrayed though?
I feel like [inaudible] got his arm

1895
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:05,810
broken.
He would not tap and he wound up winning

1896
01:20:05,811 --> 01:20:07,830
the fight.
I know

1897
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,870
Roger with what happened with Vinnie
Maga last and Fabi silver doom.

1898
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:16,650
That's true.
That happened to families who had a big

1899
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:17,401
shocker.
Rey's arm.

1900
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:18,640
Yes.
Thank you Jesus Christ.

1901
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,430
I'll never question my fucking Koofie
memory.

1902
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,410
That memory.
That makes no sense to draw.

1903
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:27,411
So tuck this away too when aren't fully
snapped and just would not fucking

1904
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:30,241
shocker,
right?

1905
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:30,691
By the way.
Well,

1906
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:32,530
how could this hodges hodges breaking
his arm?

1907
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:36,180
How the best Andrea,
he almost tapped there.

1908
01:20:36,181 --> 01:20:39,320
It looks like you almost tapped.
So he gets out and when he gets out of

1909
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:42,340
his arm,
his fucks Ville so they stay in the back

1910
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,400
up again.
Now watch when he's standing back up

1911
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:46,590
again.
He realizes his arm is fucked and so he

1912
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:48,990
can't use it.
So check this.

1913
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,940
He talks it in his fucking belt,
dude.

1914
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:58,260
What a tough Savic wouldn't tap one.
The decision to chuck race such an

1915
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:02,130
animal animal,
but today it gives them a fight.

1916
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:05,530
I think JOC rates fighting soon.
I think he's got a good fight.

1917
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,331
The good fight,
right?

1918
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:07,260
Who is it?
Who is?

1919
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,480
Oh,
Jesus said he's going to just,

1920
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,550
you might as well.
I'm not drinking this.

1921
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:12,031
Okay.
Okay.

1922
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:12,864
Okay.
Okay.

1923
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,740
Who is my birthday man?
Can't have a couple of glasses of wine

1924
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:21,330
to talk conspiracy with the fuck is this
chem trails.

1925
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:22,860
It is his birthday.
I'll fuck.

1926
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:24,580
He already believes that the moon
landing is real.

1927
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,020
So it is a good point that,
yeah,

1928
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,340
we did it.
I just want to tell you a little

1929
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:30,720
conservative with the mlk thing.
You,

1930
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:33,740
what do you think of that be?
Cause you're kind of a government and a

1931
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,471
half.
The Mike Baker,

1932
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:36,870
I liked Mike Baker.
I didn't hear anything about that.

1933
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,550
That's later.
It's towards the end.

1934
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,950
And I was one of the last things I
wanted to ask him in the last half hour

1935
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:42,930
of the show.
There's a lot of youtube videos on that

1936
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,430
by the way.
Ellen Mlk,

1937
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,410
I went down that ramp.
Hold on.

1938
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,330
That being a um,
you know,

1939
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,180
conspiracy theory it,
that's,

1940
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:54,090
that's just one of the conspiracy theory
I think most like there's the John

1941
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:57,360
Lennon one too,
but just mlk for sure.

1942
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,730
He was disrupting this.
Uh,

1943
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,070
he was bringing people together in a way
that could disrupt power masses,

1944
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:07,500
different body types.
This is a before and after

1945
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:14,430
went to was just a shill.
There's one of those where they,

1946
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:18,080
there's pictures of him and the
rothschilds and the rockerfeller's were

1947
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:20,290
hanging out.
He said he used to have parties and fuck

1948
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,650
just white girls.
But I would too if I was him.

1949
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,290
That's the way it is when it really
counts.

1950
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:29,680
But that conspiracy theory for sure,
he probably met those people cause they

1951
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:31,140
for sure they probably wanted to meet
him.

1952
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,770
It's not like you're either in or you're
out with a group like that.

1953
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,270
Right.
Those two pictures.

1954
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:41,060
I mentioned youtube videos on mls.
Given the Promo being,

1955
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:42,450
um,
let me hear this.

1956
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:46,560
Let me hear this.
See screaming.

1957
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,500
What did he say?
Something that Oklahoma stand up but

1958
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:51,240
there's no one in their threaten la,
so it's tough.

1959
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,940
Oklahoma stand up.
You got like two dudes in the audience

1960
01:22:53,941 --> 01:22:56,280
and the lion and lion that they're from
Oklahoma.

1961
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,570
We need oxygen.
Drove through.

1962
01:22:57,571 --> 01:23:02,571
Once I drove through one
big John McCarthy

1963
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:09,510
drives that elbow is what's set
everything up for you to hit it with a

1964
01:23:09,511 --> 01:23:11,310
huge strike.
What were you thinking when you were on

1965
01:23:11,311 --> 01:23:14,220
the ground with them?
I was trying to slow everything down in

1966
01:23:14,221 --> 01:23:15,630
my mind.
Keeping me

1967
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:16,650
sure.
Good answers.

1968
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,870
Trying to slow everything down his mind.

1969
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,230
I know going to get that big elbow in
there.

1970
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,433
It's just a matter of,

1971
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,050
you know what a guy like this,
you almost wishing he got in a 10 years

1972
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,100
ago.
You know,

1973
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:29,650
he can do some work at bellator
heavyweight though.

1974
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:35,740
He probably when the whole thing,
if he can figure out a way to not get

1975
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:37,750
hit,
you know,

1976
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,990
he's huge dry and viking.
What does he weigh?

1977
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:46,820
Dude,
I'm high as fuck.

1978
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:51,620
I was looking at two 45.
How should I listen to 45 I think they

1979
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:53,170
said it.
I used to 40 something.

1980
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,850
He's a big fuck.
Yeah Dude.

1981
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,010
Do you think there's a point of uh,
like where you're too big,

1982
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:01,130
do you think like for some people think
to 65 is like too big,

1983
01:24:01,131 --> 01:24:02,540
too big,
really to 40.

1984
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:07,541
Look at lead all the champions bay to 40
came to 40 jds two 40 to 45 pens on how

1985
01:24:08,391 --> 01:24:09,520
you fade or two 30

1986
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:14,320
you could be 300 pounds.
If you say guys,

1987
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:16,210
you can't talk over each other to mom
bro,

1988
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,840
you have to be 300 pounds and athletic
and tr.

1989
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,030
The problem is,
in my opinion,

1990
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,740
as far as a Jujitsu goes,
the bigger the guy,

1991
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,200
the less training partners,
the has to really get real roles and so

1992
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,960
they end up like not really training.
Right,

1993
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:42,400
right.
And that's why generally speaking,

1994
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,880
the bigger the guy in Jiu Jitsu,
the last technique he has,

1995
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:50,260
because he's used to roll in day after
day just using his weight and his power.

1996
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,300
It's not his fault.
You know what I mean?

1997
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:57,301
But if you get,
if you got to do this 285 pounds and

1998
01:24:57,341 --> 01:25:01,720
somehow he had like a billion
billionaire backer and he just got all

1999
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:05,920
these big guys like every day he had
1520 big eyes.

2000
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:10,921
The role with the old thoughts,
that's an example of Bouchet is a big

2001
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:16,441
motherfucker and he super technical,
super technical moves like a cat.

2002
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,420
So um,
it just,

2003
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,490
it's just the bigger the guy,
the,

2004
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,170
the,
the Shittier the training.

2005
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,380
Nobody wants to roll with the big dudes
to put together a super camp.

2006
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:31,600
Big,
big guys come through and they quit

2007
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:34,000
Jujitsu often because no one will roll
with them.

2008
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:37,860
I think that's a big reason why DC's as
good as he is in cains,

2009
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:41,920
as good as he is hunter,
those two fucking superhero smashing

2010
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:45,060
into each other every day.
Fuck yes you are correct sir.

2011
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,010
I called,
told me that,

2012
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:48,970
that when Kane was healthy without
question,

2013
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,210
baddest guy on the planet and gave all
of them,

2014
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:55,380
all of them there,
he was a nightmare for all to dc.

2015
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:57,490
Said CDC says healthy.
He goes,

2016
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:59,860
brother beats off of them and this is
off my everything.

2017
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:00,221
He goes,
dude,

2018
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:02,170
I'm telling you what,
we've never seen anything like healthy

2019
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:03,850
cane would,
can't fuck with them.

2020
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:04,160
No

2021
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,030
one DC DC said to me that he goes,
if that guy was healthy,

2022
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:10,670
he goes,
I really watched Kane and I trained with

2023
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,920
Cain and I can't beat that dude.
He said,

2024
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:16,670
I can't beat that guy,
and DC was saying it just with a hundred

2025
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:18,890
percent humility and just saying,
look,

2026
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:23,210
the guy was the best meat death wish.
I wish there was a way to find out who

2027
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,930
really was the best.
The most accomplished is steep bay and

2028
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:28,840
he doesn't get into the picture a
dolphin.

2029
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,900
It's not his fault.
Oh,

2030
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:33,860
air pecos fight next fuck ass because
with Steve Pay,

2031
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,260
Steve Pay Look,
he did what he had to do.

2032
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:38,990
He won the title,
but the guys that he fought in that time

2033
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:42,590
period would not the best of the best.
It wasn't like he fought cain when cain

2034
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:47,591
fought jds to like fucking fight and was
prime.

2035
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,730
Jade jds was a motherfucker,
motherfucker,

2036
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:52,850
but also the argument to that to favor
and went undefeated for what,

2037
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:53,960
seven years?

2038
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:56,300
That is a good argument Mr Pico.
Yeah.

2039
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,190
You know what I'm saying?
Like they did all the Pico,

2040
01:26:58,191 --> 01:27:00,620
so yeah,
everything be everything and he went on

2041
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,420
to feed.
They don't know what fade door did,

2042
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:04,790
but we know that they definitely let
people do things.

2043
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,740
So whether or not he did anything or
didn't do anything,

2044
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:09,080
it's just purely speculation.
I leave that up to you.

2045
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:11,060
I mean I bet my life on it but not a big
deal.

2046
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,380
But some people over there were
definitely doing stuff and they were

2047
01:27:15,381 --> 01:27:18,020
encouraging all this stuff and we know
people that went over there where they

2048
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:22,130
encourage these people to take stuff.
So whether he did or was undefeated for

2049
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:27,140
stats was that take everything aside,
leave all that co would fade or has that

2050
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:31,550
none of them have is that motherfucker
will catch armbars off his back like a

2051
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:32,180
lightweight.

2052
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,980
Yup.
That's the one thing that separates him

2053
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:34,970
from everybody.
Hey,

2054
01:27:34,971 --> 01:27:38,630
people would throw him through the air,
he would hit the ground and five seconds

2055
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:40,530
later he'd have you in something.
But also his,

2056
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:43,820
his technique was so unconventional.
It's not,

2057
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,120
you can't train that.
Like with his hands down at his hips and

2058
01:27:47,121 --> 01:27:50,000
shit.
It's time winging punches at you.

2059
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:52,970
He could take a shot.
I mean the Fujita fight memory went on

2060
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:55,480
rubbery legs.
He got fucking rock.

2061
01:27:55,481 --> 01:27:57,740
Matt.
Not to mention the biggest thing,

2062
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:02,090
dude had dad bod during all it.
All of it didn't give a fuck run to the

2063
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:07,091
mountains with fucking trees.
All the gun drawing weird shit on the

2064
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:08,720
side.
Oh here's something bout fade or the

2065
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,420
people told me,
you know his favorite restaurant.

2066
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:13,100
What?
Red lobster.

2067
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,670
That motherfucker loves red lobster.
No,

2068
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,840
it's,
you know his favorite clothing store.

2069
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:18,320
What?

2070
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,600
Abercrombie and Fitch.
Well it smells good in there.

2071
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,260
What's up now?
The whole town

2072
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,200
red lobster motherfucker can't get
enough.

2073
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,670
The shrimp Scampi I guess.
I guess if you're from another country,

2074
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:30,670
you don't know any better will you don't
think so.

2075
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:35,671
I was like Brah displaces all.
I'm just not bad.

2076
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:39,470
Like if we were all on the road,
if we were in Kentucky and we're just

2077
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:42,080
driving through some weird fucking
trucks to and there's a red stop.

2078
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,560
Red Lobster,
red lobster.

2079
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,910
It's pretty tasty.
Crab legs.

2080
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:50,790
Fuck up lobster boil it.
Too much water and lots.

2081
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:54,890
It's expensive in Russia.
Absolutely not the shit.

2082
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,180
But I didn't.
Exotic cuisine.

2083
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,210
Gangsters get it.
We get

2084
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,280
a hard to get.
Is it really expensive

2085
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,460
or it gets up there in the dark
dark.

2086
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,910
See there's got to be lobster,
blacks,

2087
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:19,340
blacks.
Where?

2088
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:23,200
Where I will officers to know.
No,

2089
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:28,300
you sure
cause there's so much salt.

2090
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:31,230
Salt lakes can show some organisms.
Correct.

2091
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,210
Salt Lake in Utah,
some organisms,

2092
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:38,250
I don't know.
I don't think it has fish nuts and fade

2093
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:42,600
arcade and salt flats public.
It's salt lake city's try.

2094
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:43,840
It's actually bryce.
Yeah,

2095
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:46,160
but there is a lot of water there and
Salt Lake.

2096
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:49,970
Can you imagine if you ever fly over it
when you go do wise guys,

2097
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:52,540
you have to do that.
You do wiseguy parents retired and

2098
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,810
it's the greatest,
greatest clubs the wise guys.

2099
01:29:57,811 --> 01:29:59,100
I'll be there.
March one and two.

2100
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,460
I love seat and the owners.
My favorite owner out of all the clubs

2101
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,220
keeps Keith.
Keith.

2102
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,840
Keith is a great guy.
Last time he was there,

2103
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:10,900
I was hanging out talking to them after
the show or the staff's all super cool.

2104
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:16,190
No sports like a motherfucker rather was
an offense coordinator at Alabama Lake.

2105
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,870
Great.
Salt Lake is too céline to support fish

2106
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:22,320
and most of the aquatic species,
several types of algae live in the lake.

2107
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,570
Okay.
Brian Chain shrimp and Brian flies can

2108
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:28,980
also tolerate the hostess keys though
Brian Trippe eggs are harvested

2109
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,780
commercially and are sold overseas is
prawn food.

2110
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:32,611
Okay.
Damn Dude.

2111
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:35,850
Can you imagine fate or comes here and
meets some hot girl and takes it a red

2112
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:37,710
lobster and Abercrombie and Fitch.
She's like,

2113
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:42,830
what are the goat goat took me to read
Joe's goofy sweater of honor on that

2114
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:46,860
sweater.
A victory,

2115
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,140
but he thinks it's just a ball or move.
Yeah.

2116
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,100
Yeah,
but bulletproof cars pull up to drop

2117
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:54,560
them off there.
You're still eating.

2118
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:58,440
Should get to these bulletproof
suburbans with solid rubber wheels and

2119
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:01,930
shit and arm.
He just smells like fucking Cologne from

2120
01:31:01,931 --> 01:31:03,730
Ab return car.
Smells like your car.

2121
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:07,610
This Craig Glazer,
did he play football?

2122
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:08,490
Laser,
laser?

2123
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:10,740
Did he play football or train MMA or
anything?

2124
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:14,940
But he's a colored tricky standing.
I think he is a coach

2125
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:18,960
sometimes people because they can,
well it's,

2126
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:19,813
yeah.

2127
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:20,723
Yeah.

2128
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:24,160
Josh and frank twig.
Oh Shit.

2129
01:31:24,161 --> 01:31:28,480
Pico as a prospect and over again dude.
Oof.

2130
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:31,930
Look at that shit.
He throws a nancy left hook man.

2131
01:31:31,931 --> 01:31:35,770
He's a bad motherfucker.
Number one amateur wrestler in the

2132
01:31:35,771 --> 01:31:37,960
nation when it came out of high school
and he's so young.

2133
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:39,540
Fought Internet.
What is he now?

2134
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:44,550
23 2122 that's so Freddie Roach is that
he's the only guy.

2135
01:31:44,561 --> 01:31:45,910
Freddie Roach.
Co-Signs signs like this.

2136
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,190
He came to 10th planet.
Right?

2137
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,550
Remember I talked,
dammit.

2138
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,440
I was trying to,
I was trying to convince them.

2139
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:57,400
I had no idea what his,
his background,

2140
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:00,380
his know his strategy.
Uh,

2141
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,860
for his MMA career.
I had no idea.

2142
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:07,150
All I knew was he came to me and he was
just fucking monster.

2143
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:12,240
Ralph Torres is a debut debut.
Aaron,

2144
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,110
come on Bro.
Did you roll with them?

2145
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,960
Let me tell you this.
Let me tell you the story.

2146
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:22,360
So he shows,
actually,

2147
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,730
uh,
Joe texted me to go,

2148
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:27,430
hey dude,
there's this fucking beast named Aaron

2149
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,620
Peko new dude coming up.
He wants to train with you.

2150
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:32,800
Like they were like looking for my
contact info.

2151
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:33,741
And I said,
yeah,

2152
01:32:33,741 --> 01:32:34,060
yeah,
yeah.

2153
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,970
Have him have him texted me.
And then he texted me.

2154
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:39,070
And to be honest,
seriously,

2155
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:41,500
when people come through and they tell
me they're going to be a fighter and

2156
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:44,650
they going to be a champion and they
wrestled 12 years seriously,

2157
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,660
but herein Pinto,
I didn't,

2158
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,700
I didn't know who he was at the this
point.

2159
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:51,100
I didn't know it was,
he just told me he's just stepping aside

2160
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:51,970
from Rogan though.

2161
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,070
I'm just being honest.
I've ever sent you how many guys?

2162
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,930
Uh,
shit,

2163
01:32:58,931 --> 01:33:00,250
I don't know.
Not a ton,

2164
01:33:00,251 --> 01:33:00,791
right?
Not,

2165
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:01,221
it's,
I don't,

2166
01:33:01,221 --> 01:33:03,670
and I don't know where a guy's like
super legit.

2167
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:04,504
And I'm like,
dude,

2168
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:06,350
yeah.
So he texts me and,

2169
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:08,650
and to be honest,
like that doesn't,

2170
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,680
I just go to,
I just go to my class every night and I

2171
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:14,680
teach my heart out.
If you want to join in on the class,

2172
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:15,880
ah,
come on down.

2173
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,830
If you,
you know,

2174
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,960
I don't want to hear what the attitude
is,

2175
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:20,880
why you're so fucking,
yeah,

2176
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,903
I don't want it.

2177
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:29,350
So I didn't get too excited.
You would treat a high school kid the

2178
01:33:29,351 --> 01:33:32,200
same way you would treat a college.
I just wasn't excited.

2179
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:32,801
I'm like,
okay.

2180
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:34,300
I got,
I got a bunch of motherfuckers I'm

2181
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:36,460
training right now.
I got a lot of shit that I'm,

2182
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,740
that I'm working on right now.
There's so much shit.

2183
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,480
So he texts me,
he goes,

2184
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,830
Hey,
Joe gave me your number.

2185
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:42,840
Let's,
you know,

2186
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,810
I want to come down.
I said,

2187
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:44,201
yeah,
sure.

2188
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:45,034
Come down.
And then,

2189
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,920
then I just kind of like flaked on some
texts or something.

2190
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:51,910
And then he finally just showed up and
he showed up and then I looked him up

2191
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:52,960
and like,
Oh shit.

2192
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:53,920
Okay.
Okay.

2193
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:59,160
So I had no idea that he's been working,
um,

2194
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:03,910
to on being the ultimate like version
of,

2195
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:07,810
he's our little brown,
like strategically as a fighter.

2196
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:11,740
Got Chocolate Dell like chuck the bell
in his prime.

2197
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,010
He wrestled.
So it's very hard to take them down in

2198
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,380
there and if you did,
very hard to keep them down and that's

2199
01:34:17,381 --> 01:34:19,930
what he uses wrestling for.
But chocolate Dell was going to come out

2200
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,510
and take heads off.
I had no idea.

2201
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:27,100
That's what Aaron Picos strategy was.
So when I heard about them,

2202
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:29,980
I like,
I pulled him to the side and I told him,

2203
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:30,963
I said,
listen,

2204
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,350
don't listen to anybody trying to tell
you that you can be like the best

2205
01:34:35,351 --> 01:34:37,270
striker in the world.
They're not people out.

2206
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:41,260
This is what I was telling him.
I had no idea that he was trying to be

2207
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:43,600
chucked without.
All I knew was that he was a stud

2208
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:44,880
wrestler.
So I was like on,

2209
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,670
this is the best advice.
If I was on my deathbed,

2210
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:53,080
this is what I would tell you.
I would say fucking wrestle.

2211
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,350
Take dudes down.
Pass the guard,

2212
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,460
mount them them,
choke them.

2213
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:03,530
That should be your number one strategy.
You're such an amazing wrestler.

2214
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,320
Don't let anybody cause be sitting there
listening to me.

2215
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:09,200
Meanwhile he's gone.
What the fuck is he talking about?

2216
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:11,960
Cause I'm going to do the opposite of
what you're saying.

2217
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:13,850
But he didn't say anything.
He didn't say anything.

2218
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:17,990
So I kept reminding him this.
Every time he gets high,

2219
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:22,370
he was just wanting to learn.
Jujitsu was a nice case he ever got

2220
01:35:22,371 --> 01:35:24,020
taken down and it ended up on the
ground.

2221
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:29,060
He had no intentions of using his
wrestling to take people down and win

2222
01:35:29,061 --> 01:35:31,670
the fight on the ground.
He didn't know what to but every time

2223
01:35:31,671 --> 01:35:35,120
and remind him,
I'm saying the same shit over and over.

2224
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,100
You know the guys he trains with,
they say them,

2225
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:39,170
I fucker,
you know the guys who trained with the

2226
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:42,080
best of the best,
he does not lose the last town.

2227
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,210
I said,
cause you know,

2228
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:48,230
then he fought his,
in his first fight he got caught with an

2229
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:51,340
upper cut.
He got staggered and then he got

2230
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:53,820
guillotine correct.
He bought a bigger guy first.

2231
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:58,700
You can toot youtube wrestling
international guys like from Turkey,

2232
01:35:58,701 --> 01:36:02,120
Iran,
whatever when he was 16 but my church,

2233
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,890
check this out.
So I'll tell you the story.

2234
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:06,230
So I'm just,
let me just finish this story.

2235
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:12,070
So even up to that point,
right after that loss,

2236
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:18,110
I still didn't know that was his
ultimate strategy.

2237
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,650
I didn't know.
So after that fight,

2238
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,750
what I said was like,
you know what,

2239
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,850
it was almost like a,
I told him,

2240
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,370
let's turn your ass into that Khabib,
that GSP,

2241
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:36,260
that unstoppable take down machine where
you smashed when the fuckers on the

2242
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:39,020
ground and you fucking choke them out.
Let's do this shit.

2243
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:42,620
This was after that first loss and then
I didn't hear from him after that.

2244
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,300
I was over,
it was done.

2245
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:47,600
So I guess this cat first kick,
because when he got clipped and he got

2246
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:50,780
hurt and he got submitted,
I have you for me,

2247
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:52,190
I was like say we should,
we should have,

2248
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,610
you should have just washed all his
fights.

2249
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:55,723
Yes.
Yes.

2250
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:58,520
Smile issue with them.
Cause because he trains with a

2251
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:01,220
worldclass guys and like I said,
doesn't ever lose rounds.

2252
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:02,510
He's so company,
he's like,

2253
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:04,910
dude this isn't Tj dillashaw this isn't
this guy.

2254
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:06,260
He goes,
I'm gonna smoke this guy.

2255
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:10,550
So his respect isn't there yet.
And he just comes in cause he's knocked

2256
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,610
down Miguel cotto so he comes in and it
got clipped him.

2257
01:37:13,611 --> 01:37:15,790
He just doesn't give us funding sources
though.

2258
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,230
Before I forget,
let me just finish this.

2259
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:22,760
So now,
once I realized that I was giving him

2260
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,270
advice,
that was the complete opposite of this

2261
01:37:26,271 --> 01:37:28,430
whole training.
It all his coaches,

2262
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:32,780
all his coaches were wanting to use the
wrestling to keep the fight standing so

2263
01:37:32,781 --> 01:37:34,250
he could use his,
it's a striking,

2264
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,870
you know what I mean?
So,

2265
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:38,900
um,
I then I finally realized that then he

2266
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:42,590
went his own way and then you know,
it took me a couple,

2267
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:46,190
two or three fights to realize the dam
never write shit.

2268
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,640
This motherfucker can let me get too
excited.

2269
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:54,350
I was wrong.
It's this mucky son that he's finding

2270
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,651
no,
no,

2271
01:37:55,651 --> 01:37:56,040
this is

2272
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,420
the top featherweight.
Oh,

2273
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:58,000
okay,
cool.

2274
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,450
When this want to get a title shot.
Do you guys understand what I'm saying?

2275
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:03,210
I understand now.
First some guys,

2276
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:03,720
guys,
guys,

2277
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,330
now at this point,
I just want to make this clear now at

2278
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:09,360
this point I realized,
Damn Holy Shit,

2279
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:12,120
they did have the right strategy.
He is an amazing striker.

2280
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,830
I just went,
I was just going by,

2281
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:16,650
that's your thing like no,
no,

2282
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:18,390
just like the odds.
What are the odds?

2283
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:18,930
I'm like,
dude,

2284
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:21,600
we already know you're one of the best
wrestlers in the game.

2285
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:24,030
We already know that.
That stick to that,

2286
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,470
but you know what?
I had no idea.

2287
01:38:25,471 --> 01:38:28,620
That is striking is extraordinary.
So tough fight for him.

2288
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:32,700
This is,
why do you say headed cross is a very

2289
01:38:32,701 --> 01:38:34,320
good fighter.
This is tough site by far,

2290
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,330
but like I was talking to the belt
toward guys today,

2291
01:38:36,331 --> 01:38:39,480
the insiders that like it's not,
don't expect them to smoke them the

2292
01:38:39,481 --> 01:38:40,650
first round,
which I always think,

2293
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,610
I think he finished them under four
minutes but like,

2294
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:42,910
no,
no,

2295
01:38:42,910 --> 01:38:43,290
no,
no.

2296
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:46,380
This is a tough one I find that I think
is critical for a young fighter that's

2297
01:38:46,381 --> 01:38:48,840
coming up is to not rely on any one
thing.

2298
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:51,240
Now,
if you're talking about a guy who

2299
01:38:51,241 --> 01:38:54,210
doesn't have to rely on any one thing
you're talking about Aaron Peko,

2300
01:38:54,211 --> 01:38:57,030
you're talking about a legit worldclass
wrestler,

2301
01:38:57,270 --> 01:39:02,270
but if people know that you want to
stand and they know that you,

2302
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:03,720
uh,
even though you're one of the best

2303
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:05,610
wrestlers in the world,
you're not going to threaten them with

2304
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:08,160
the take down.
That becomes an issue because there's

2305
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:11,400
certain guys like gas on Bolanos or
there's certain,

2306
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:14,790
there's certain boxers are strikers.
They got some nasty shit for your ass

2307
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:15,690
and you,
you,

2308
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:17,940
if you,
if they know for a fact you're not going

2309
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:20,430
to take them down.
If you're standing up with Paul Daley,

2310
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:23,310
okay,
and he knows for a fact you're not going

2311
01:39:23,311 --> 01:39:23,880
to take him down.

2312
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,950
He's going to launch a left hook from
the moon.

2313
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:27,550
He's going to hit you on your fucking
head,

2314
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:34,650
but let me probably their plan B,
the plan b would be gone would be,

2315
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,500
that's what I'm saying,
but it's not going to be good on the

2316
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:37,570
fee.
Please let me finish.

2317
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:42,630
The most important thing if you can do
all those things is that the other guy

2318
01:39:42,631 --> 01:39:45,840
has to not know what you're doing.
That was George Saint Pierre as greatest

2319
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:46,591
trends.
Correct.

2320
01:39:46,591 --> 01:39:49,890
He never knew when he was punching you
or he's taking you down and you were

2321
01:39:49,891 --> 01:39:52,530
always,
you were always behind Koscheck fundings

2322
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:53,790
jab,
double it.

2323
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:57,270
So fucking good at that here and that.
And he's not the best wrestler and he's

2324
01:39:57,271 --> 01:40:00,600
not the best striker,
but he was the best at figuring out how

2325
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:02,730
to do things.
You didn't know what was coming next.

2326
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:06,420
Where are you rolling loaded for Rasa,
hobby and him or a phenomenal

2327
01:40:06,421 --> 01:40:10,260
combination cause for Ross is so
intellectually so smart and he's

2328
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:11,310
thinking rationally.

2329
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:12,600
He's not like,
you're going to go in there and you're

2330
01:40:12,601 --> 01:40:14,110
gonna fuck him up.
None of that.

2331
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:17,100
Some of the problems,
it's all about overloading his mind.

2332
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:20,040
It was all very rational,
very technique based,

2333
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:23,280
very psychology based.
But the reason that meant what made that

2334
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:25,860
GSP so good also is,
um,

2335
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:26,790
he,
you,

2336
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:29,310
you didn't know what he was doing,
but he was facing that high level

2337
01:40:29,311 --> 01:40:31,140
competition construct.
Matt Hughes,

2338
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:33,420
Pico,
all these guys,

2339
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:34,321
he goes,
oh,

2340
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:36,050
I don't need to use my rescue.
So and knock them out of the bottom.

2341
01:40:36,051 --> 01:40:38,760
Shot this guy with him and crowds.
You're going to see the best version of

2342
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:42,060
in Pico cause he can't just sit there
and fucking box with them.

2343
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,490
You can see his wrestling.
I bet you're gonna see some different,

2344
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:45,200
mix it up.
Do you have,

2345
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,070
because he's never been pushed.
He's dominate to you.

2346
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:52,071
Remember what John Danner told us the
secret to GSPS do you remember was that

2347
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:54,940
when we're eating at that restaurant in
the head hair,

2348
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:55,320
John did.

2349
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,710
He goes,
he said,

2350
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,180
the secret to his success is it's super
simple.

2351
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,660
He's gonna either faint,
he's either going to faint jab or he's

2352
01:41:07,361 --> 01:41:11,890
going to actually really jab you or
faint takedown or actually take take you

2353
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:13,600
down.
So that was always a faint before

2354
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:14,860
everything he goes,
he's just,

2355
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:18,460
he's always so,
you never know when that shot's coming.

2356
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,650
Sharma,
my Pico GSP was the whole thing for asa

2357
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,510
hobbies,
just so they're,

2358
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:28,510
the two of them together worked so well
because they both have a great check of

2359
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:31,630
their ego and an understanding of the
consequences and you rarely do right

2360
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:35,680
hand and
they're both really,

2361
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:37,790
really smart.
Told me cause he's trying with them all

2362
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,640
the time.
Said that he's an amazing chess player.

2363
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:41,290
Uh,
George.

2364
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:45,250
So George is an amazing,
so he's really strategic and I feel like

2365
01:41:45,251 --> 01:41:49,150
he could always find
empty where,

2366
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:49,720
where are you?

2367
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:52,510
Where are you had a weakness near them
and that's where he was.

2368
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:57,600
Well he was super open minded to men.
I mean they need like learn back kicked

2369
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:00,670
from you are like yes,
like he just fed Eddie's place.

2370
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:04,450
I felt so embarrassed that I'm uh,
I'm like,

2371
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:08,170
I just felt like it was ridiculous that
I'm going to show him anything.

2372
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:12,520
Do,
there's video on youtube of Joe Rogan,

2373
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:15,440
Kevin Gsp,
but you know what,

2374
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:20,450
fucking kicking lesson your back.
I knew I wouldn't ever have tried to

2375
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:23,860
sell it to him if I didn't have
anything.

2376
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:26,590
But when that came out of that same
meeting with dawn her when we were in

2377
01:42:26,591 --> 01:42:29,050
the restaurant donaher set it up cause
he goes,

2378
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,270
I'm looking for,
and he told me afterwards that he set me

2379
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:32,830
up.
He kinda had heard.

2380
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,380
So He's like,
I'm looking for someone to teach gsp how

2381
01:42:35,381 --> 01:42:36,830
to throw a tuning sidekick.

2382
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:39,700
His technique is off.
It's like we're going to fucking James

2383
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,430
Bond movie or something.
It's funny with his accent.

2384
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:46,570
So Carlos is 10 years older.
He's no Parkinson.

2385
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:48,340
Yeah,
it's a tough fight for Pico,

2386
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:54,100
but we still thinks pico gets it done.
But it's all about where's Pico at right

2387
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:55,810
now?
It's all about where's he at right now

2388
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,490
because one day he's going to be
unbeatable,

2389
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,600
right?
Yes.

2390
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:02,590
It's like he's 22 what is your 540540540
five yeah.

2391
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:06,400
He's on this streak that if he can keep
up this intensity and he keep up this

2392
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:08,740
mindset,
he's going to be a world champion.

2393
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:11,470
The only thing that they could stop them
as a grave injury,

2394
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:16,950
a grave injury or some sort of a mistake
in his thinking where he starts taking

2395
01:43:17,231 --> 01:43:20,780
things for granted or find some won't.
Fuck yeah,

2396
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:24,610
we'll do a hot girl.
Crazy.

2397
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,320
Crazy.
Now he's on a pass or nice.

2398
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,870
He's what he's good at though.
The one thing that he got out of a

2399
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:35,100
training at Hbcu is he's pretty God damn
good at twisters

2400
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:40,150
standing like a fucking,
he lives for this shit dude.

2401
01:43:40,151 --> 01:43:42,970
He lives for this shit.
The thing is how long can he keep this

2402
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:45,100
up right now?
He's doing it right now.

2403
01:43:45,101 --> 01:43:47,920
He's 22 he's making money.
He's a fucking savage.

2404
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:50,560
Come on.
He started specials where he belongs

2405
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:51,394
right here.
Look,

2406
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:51,980
I mean,

2407
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,050
he's just,
he does everything so well.

2408
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,440
Everything from his de France two is
striking me.

2409
01:43:57,441 --> 01:44:00,260
I mean did he looks like a world
champion boxer when he's got his hands

2410
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:01,730
up.
It doesn't mean he can't get caught.

2411
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:05,240
Doesn't mean he can't get finished.
He can get a little reckless.

2412
01:44:05,241 --> 01:44:07,340
This mother got to keep your hands
getting,

2413
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:10,310
he's going to be so good.
He hits so fucking hard,

2414
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:13,010
dude.
That body shots his left took one of the

2415
01:44:13,011 --> 01:44:14,630
best law there.
Oh,

2416
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:18,970
so kids,
when would the Duchy Oh shit.

2417
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:22,460
Elbow got caught with a rabbit a little
bit.

2418
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,860
We definitely got hit and rounds.
This is a real fight.

2419
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:30,160
Morales hand corrals are tough.
Pico also has a crazy six pack to

2420
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:37,580
what I telling you under four bro.
Oh,

2421
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:40,020
the left hooks coming.
There's 1000 cuts coming.

2422
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:41,510
Signs a little.
He's a little concussed.

2423
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:44,760
Crosses.
Little concussed paralysis.

2424
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:45,650
Morales.
Okay.

2425
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,090
Paralysis.
Cream and corrals.

2426
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:49,620
He's not totally needed.
The body shots too bad.

2427
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,493
Be Smart.

2428
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:58,520
Oh Shit.
Oh No.

2429
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:02,200
Oh No.
Oh No.

2430
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,370
Brendan just fell out of his fucking
chair.

2431
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:06,320
Oh my.
Oh No.

2432
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:10,250
That's what happens in firing.
That's what happens in fighting.

2433
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:15,320
That's what happens.
That's what happens in fighty.

2434
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:19,430
Holy Shit speech.
I don't like seeing a young man get hit

2435
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:22,280
like that.
That was crazy.

2436
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,540
Warm.
Brennan punched us this.

2437
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:27,780
Watch this again.
Why?

2438
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:31,340
Why is he
so reckless?

2439
01:45:31,341 --> 01:45:32,870
The savage,
but

2440
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,930
look,
he's 22 he'll learn,

2441
01:45:35,931 --> 01:45:36,711
but what?
Watch this,

2442
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:38,690
John Joseph and do this.
So he just,

2443
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:43,370
he just wades in and you could tell the
corrals had recovered.

2444
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,790
Look at this body shot.
Body shot hurts him there.

2445
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,540
Hello?
Hello.

2446
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:52,550
No snaps back out.
Cold out cold.

2447
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:55,460
Two big bumps.
Look at this one more time.

2448
01:45:56,060 --> 01:46:00,140
Boom.
That's all she wrote,

2449
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:01,520
Dude.
Everything goes down.

2450
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:05,840
The drake of two on the way to,
on the way down his head is not,

2451
01:46:05,841 --> 01:46:06,770
that's not going to see again.

2452
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:08,750
Look at this.
Boom,

2453
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:11,300
perfect shot.
The lights go out in Georgia.

2454
01:46:11,301 --> 01:46:15,380
One too on the way down and then a third
one when he's already out cold.

2455
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:18,530
Holy Shit.
That's some killer instinct right there

2456
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,890
that could stop you.
You know you're talking about hubs

2457
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,650
progression.
Well,

2458
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,260
yeah,
the first look at him.

2459
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,930
He doesn't know what happened.
He's,

2460
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:28,340
he's,
he's trying to figure out what happened

2461
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:28,641
now.
I mean,

2462
01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:31,310
he was comprende he's going,
fuck this mma stuff.

2463
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:33,350
I understand my deathbed confessional
now.

2464
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,300
Yes,
astral traveling,

2465
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:37,400
but your,
your deathbed confessional.

2466
01:46:37,401 --> 01:46:39,980
You're correct.
He could have taken him down.

2467
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:42,770
Who's going to stop Aaron Peko from
taking the cup.

2468
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,990
He could beat him.
Here's the thing,

2469
01:46:44,991 --> 01:46:47,120
why not to do too,
but here's the thing.

2470
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,590
You can do all things.
You can do all things,

2471
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:50,280
but if you're standing

2472
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:53,220
in front of a guy all the time,
if you get that guy hurt the way he got

2473
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,180
done,
heart deck,

2474
01:46:54,181 --> 01:46:55,620
I hurt.
If your objective,

2475
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,970
okay,
it's easy to be Monday,

2476
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:58,500
Monday morning quarterback,
right?

2477
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:02,070
But objective looking at right now,
I would say take him down,

2478
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,420
take him down,
smash them up,

2479
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:07,740
and then you take no damage,
no chances.

2480
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:11,400
It's all variables.
It's all about mitigating variables.

2481
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:14,610
You close all the variables down.
When you take God down a mountain and

2482
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:17,250
start dropping elbows on his head,
you close all the variables.

2483
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:20,580
If you can maintain the mount position
and keep trenching and you already know

2484
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:23,070
he's fucked up,
it's all it's about of whether he's

2485
01:47:23,071 --> 01:47:25,080
going to tap the strikes or you're going
to get a choke.

2486
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:27,810
I don't like seeing that.
Such a bummer.

2487
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:29,190
It's a bummer.
It's a bummer,

2488
01:47:29,191 --> 01:47:30,810
but it's also not a bumper for Corolla.

2489
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:35,870
It's like this game.
It's heartbreak and everybody needs to

2490
01:47:35,971 --> 01:47:38,070
see that.
Young guys coming up need to see that as

2491
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:40,140
good as you are.
You've got to understand the mind.

2492
01:47:40,350 --> 01:47:45,000
You can't let yourself get sucked into
this path for glory where you're wild

2493
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:48,960
and reckless and you're not keeping your
hands up and you're not respecting the

2494
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:51,330
power of the guys.
Especially when you have the technique

2495
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:54,420
though there's no reason to play that
game state that he may think he's a

2496
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:57,210
fucking killer man.
He had the guy heard him and then just

2497
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,920
all blood and was like,
fuck it.

2498
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:03,980
It doesn't have the experience.
And then just came in and he's 22 and he

2499
01:48:04,051 --> 01:48:06,390
thought he could just smash that guy and
he hurts you.

2500
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:09,050
It looked like he was going to think he
was going and he probably would have if

2501
01:48:09,051 --> 01:48:10,670
he fought technical,
but he,

2502
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:15,760
he abandoned ship experience is he got
caught on a clench and this kid had him

2503
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:18,970
here and he was hitting him with the
kingdom to the body twice and cross and

2504
01:48:18,971 --> 01:48:21,060
he clipped him on the chin with a
perfect punch.

2505
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,880
Perfect right hand.
I mean his neck snapped,

2506
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:26,580
his fucking head spun around and it was
perfect.

2507
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:29,670
He was out cold before he went down and
on the way down he clipped him two more

2508
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:30,960
times.
One more time.

2509
01:48:30,961 --> 01:48:32,750
When he was down.
I gotta buy a duplex.

2510
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,380
Listen,
all three of you,

2511
01:48:34,381 --> 01:48:36,910
I've got to go to my wrap party.
I love all of them.

2512
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:43,320
Come see me and Austin and miss the face
faders niche.

2513
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,590
I got to go January 31 in fight.
Sure you don't wanna just stay for the

2514
01:48:46,591 --> 01:48:49,530
first round caspase.
It's definitely not going to go more

2515
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:50,490
than one round.
Nope,

2516
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,980
we're fine.
And Joe are going to open for me,

2517
01:48:52,981 --> 01:48:54,090
right?
I am out before you,

2518
01:48:54,091 --> 01:48:57,330
but you got to want to stay here.
Jamie's going to be there to recording.

2519
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:00,090
It doesn't record.
He has a filling in.

2520
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:02,190
It's two that hurts when you record
things due to enter peaker.

2521
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:05,220
Right now it's going to,
what did her hand man don't.

2522
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,340
I don't think he totally understands
even what happened because he still

2523
01:49:08,350 --> 01:49:10,590
thinks he's going to be world champ.
I still think you'll figure it out.

2524
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:15,120
He certainly could.
Anything can happen.

2525
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:19,170
He has all,
he just needs to fucking fight you.

2526
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,910
Gotta fight technically.
Always.

2527
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:23,310
And there's,
there's moments where you have to open

2528
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:25,770
yourself up.
But the guys who do it correctly,

2529
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:28,680
I'm gonna give you a perfect example,
style bender,

2530
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,120
that motherfucker,
when he gets you heard he,

2531
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:34,050
he goes after you correctly.
He does that run a Shin,

2532
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:39,290
keeps control him down.
Defense a fucking push them down.

2533
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,920
Yeah,
it was good.

2534
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:45,180
He knows how to pass since there's no
way you're going to get knocked out from

2535
01:49:45,181 --> 01:49:48,010
the mouth.
You can knock a guy out from the mouth,

2536
01:49:48,011 --> 01:49:52,090
but he cannot even talk about great all
time mma strikers.

2537
01:49:52,090 --> 01:49:54,310
Let's talk about Anderson Silva.
Anderson Silva,

2538
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,440
when he would hurt you,
he would take his time.

2539
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,080
He would take his time and he would stay
focused.

2540
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:01,840
And if he knew you were fucked up and he
knew he could just walk in and smash

2541
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:03,220
you,
then he would take advantage of that.

2542
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:04,510
Let's see this and watch this.
So,

2543
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:08,080
so now he opera ca,
perfect upper cut.

2544
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:11,330
He gets the guy hurt,
falls back and,

2545
01:50:11,331 --> 01:50:14,670
but look at this,
he moves towards him like,

2546
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,860
like he can't hit him like he's can't
hurt them and look at him.

2547
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:21,490
He just stays in that clinch and Pecos
right there when the right hand hits,

2548
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:23,830
boom.
I see cause he stood right in front of

2549
01:50:23,831 --> 01:50:26,050
the guy.
He even when he was getting hit with

2550
01:50:26,051 --> 01:50:27,310
shots,
he never adjusted.

2551
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:31,000
He just was bullying his way forward.
See He's bullying is way forward.

2552
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:33,520
I mean look,
he got clipped and the guy who launched

2553
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:37,390
a perfect right hand,
but my thing is pico really shouldn't be

2554
01:50:37,391 --> 01:50:40,000
standing in front of them right here
flipping a coin.

2555
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,650
Okay.
Because maybe it's heads,

2556
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:46,020
maybe its tail straight
upstairs to to the body and what

2557
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:48,970
upstairs.
But my thing is if you're Aaron Peko one

2558
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:52,300
of the best wrestlers to ever do mma,
why wouldn't you shoot right there?

2559
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:55,420
You've got that guy in a position where
he's thrown wild shots that he wants to

2560
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:57,730
knock out that gsps looking for that
dunk under,

2561
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,300
right?
Yeah.

2562
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,860
GSP is going to duck under shot,
take you down and then you fuck.

2563
01:51:00,861 --> 01:51:02,260
He's going to beat you up.
When you stand back up,

2564
01:51:02,261 --> 01:51:03,790
you're going to be bewildered and
exhausted.

2565
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:06,430
He's going to hit you again.
He's a young guy,

2566
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:08,740
man.
He's a young guy with flying phenomenal

2567
01:51:08,741 --> 01:51:11,020
talent.
But this is a lesson.

2568
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:16,300
Take Ego and take your personality and
take your personal identity out of this

2569
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,590
and look at this as this is these little
pieces that are moving around a on a

2570
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:24,280
board and these pieces have properties,
they have values and they have,

2571
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,170
they have powers and they have
weaknesses.

2572
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,530
And if you watch these pieces play out,
like you're looking at a mathematical

2573
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:31,540
algorithm,
you realize when there's flaw,

2574
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:34,300
when can it go wrong?
Here's when it could go wrong.

2575
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:36,160
We stand in front of each other and just
do this.

2576
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:37,550
It can go wrong for everybody,
right?

2577
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,250
Everybody that's ever lived,
go con.

2578
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,760
Saki got knocked out by a Kaleel
roundtree with a perfect left hand,

2579
01:51:42,761 --> 01:51:43,361
right?
Go Con.

2580
01:51:43,361 --> 01:51:45,250
Slack is one of the greatest kickboxers
of all time.

2581
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:46,720
It doesn't mean Cleo was not a great
fighter.

2582
01:51:46,721 --> 01:51:49,090
He's been very,
very high level fighter.

2583
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,640
It's just anybody can get caught if
you're standing in front of city hall

2584
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:54,250
can only take so much,
especially with those little gloves.

2585
01:51:55,060 --> 01:52:00,060
Think about all the fighters in MMA
history that have been known to have

2586
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:05,950
rock solid Chin's.
All of them have one thing in common for

2587
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:07,540
a while.
Then I never got hurt.

2588
01:52:07,630 --> 01:52:09,310
They never got rocked.
Right.

2589
01:52:09,311 --> 01:52:10,330
For Alaska,
like Dan,

2590
01:52:10,331 --> 01:52:12,610
he's got a great chin.
He does.

2591
01:52:12,611 --> 01:52:14,440
He's never been rocked and he's been hit
solid.

2592
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:18,580
Right.
So we know that guy has a solid shin.

2593
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:23,360
It's probably going to fall apart later.
You only get so many of those know

2594
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:27,090
already with Pico.
He got rocked in his first fight and

2595
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,420
this fight,
he got rocked.

2596
01:52:28,421 --> 01:52:29,280
Obviously.
You guys fight.

2597
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,610
He got flour.
We know now,

2598
01:52:30,611 --> 01:52:33,520
so we know now that damn,
you know he's not,

2599
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:37,090
he's not going to be known.
He's more to have the ultimate Chin for

2600
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:39,040
sure.
I think he was hurt already.

2601
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,830
I think it was hurt and even though he's
moving in for the kill,

2602
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:46,831
I think he'd been tagged a few times in
the mix there and Pico.

2603
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:47,841
Oh really?
Yeah.

2604
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:50,390
I think there was a,
there was punches that landed and maybe

2605
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:53,360
they didn't take him out and maybe they
didn't even make them buckle.

2606
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,160
But all those,
when you get clipped,

2607
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:58,190
have you ever walked into a door and
people don't know you walked in the door

2608
01:52:58,191 --> 01:52:59,900
and you can just keep walking,
but your head's like,

2609
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:02,210
fuck.
Now imagine if you're in the middle of a

2610
01:53:02,211 --> 01:53:04,380
fight with the earphone.
I just bumped in your head.

2611
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,910
The things shoved right into my ear lobe
or my,

2612
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,390
um,
ah,

2613
01:53:09,740 --> 01:53:11,090
like a bitch.
Um,

2614
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:14,930
but if,
if you get that many Kaos that early in

2615
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:16,580
your career,
it's not a good sign.

2616
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:17,930
I'm a pink.
Yes.

2617
01:53:17,931 --> 01:53:20,780
It's dangerous.
Maybe so as hard as fuck too.

2618
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:22,560
That doesn't help either.
Boxing,

2619
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:25,100
sparring gets Codo at his age.
It could be.

2620
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:25,701
Yeah.
I mean,

2621
01:53:25,701 --> 01:53:27,410
those,
those things are luck.

2622
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:32,150
Cumulus for Pico.
He's such an amazing wrestler that he

2623
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:34,280
can actually,
he has the choice to go,

2624
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:38,580
you know what?
I could go to go to my next fight and

2625
01:53:38,581 --> 01:53:40,760
the next fight after that and just,
you know,

2626
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,710
uh,
trade fucking blows.

2627
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:45,350
And it's like Russian roulette.
You could do that.

2628
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,990
You can keep doing that.
Or You could just play it safe and go,

2629
01:53:47,991 --> 01:53:50,330
you know what?
I'm going to use my wrestling to take

2630
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:53,150
this motherfucker down,
mountain his ass and could be these

2631
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:55,410
motherfuckers,
this rule or by Brian.

2632
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,080
One round dude.
One route.

2633
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,210
It's going to happen.
It's your birthday.

2634
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:01,520
One and maybe 10 minutes.
Maybe it'd be safe for 10 more minutes.

2635
01:54:01,521 --> 01:54:05,960
Do you tell them you're the life of the
party when you get there anyway,

2636
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:07,880
this part is going to go on forever.
I bet.

2637
01:54:07,881 --> 01:54:10,010
Most of the cool there yet,
dude.

2638
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:12,740
The main stars on fade.
Oh my God.

2639
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:13,700
Come on.
What's his last fight?

2640
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:15,740
The last fight ever.
It's fighting.

2641
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:16,521
Writing better.
No,

2642
01:54:16,521 --> 01:54:17,740
you gotta stay dude.
Alright.

2643
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,700
We love you man.
Happy Birthday.

2644
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:21,320
Happy Birthday Dude.
Happy Birthday.

2645
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:25,510
52 hong kids.
Here's the Haiti.

2646
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:26,450
Two more.
Eddie,

2647
01:54:26,451 --> 01:54:28,130
I think what you just said is very
important.

2648
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:31,820
We said it's very important and this was
a really interesting thing that has two

2649
01:54:31,821 --> 01:54:33,860
choices.
Keep doing what you're doing or go

2650
01:54:33,861 --> 01:54:35,570
Khabib style,
but this is really interesting.

2651
01:54:35,571 --> 01:54:36,740
What happened?
What just happened?

2652
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:37,640
Well,
there's three choices.

2653
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:40,100
One is mixed,
both of them up like GSP.

2654
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,070
The thing about GSP that's so
interesting is it wasn't just Khabib

2655
01:54:43,071 --> 01:54:44,870
style.
It was who knows what's going to happen,

2656
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:46,250
who knows if he's jabbing.

2657
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:51,680
The reason,
the only reason he was striking is cause

2658
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:54,440
you just can't go in there at the bell
and take a guy down.

2659
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:58,520
You got to set it all up.
He was always just setting it all up.

2660
01:54:58,521 --> 01:55:00,500
He was throwing jabs,
setting shit up.

2661
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:05,501
But the number one mission in his mind
was to take his opponent down and play

2662
01:55:05,691 --> 01:55:10,691
it safe and mount him and pound them.
If you find the guy that you could take

2663
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,480
that wasn't the blueprint with Josh
Koscheck.

2664
01:55:14,481 --> 01:55:16,370
Yeah,
well that was a blueprint with Johny

2665
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:16,580
Hendricks.
He,

2666
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,550
Josh Koscheck,
he jabbed the shit out of them.

2667
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:24,230
I take,
everybody tries to take every fucking

2668
01:55:24,231 --> 01:55:25,610
body down.
GSP,

2669
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:29,240
he didn't take his exam,
not because he didn't try.

2670
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,810
It's hard to take down.
He tried a few times,

2671
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:35,870
but he wasn't success to Josh Koscheck.
The game plan was literally to get them

2672
01:55:35,871 --> 01:55:37,130
to move forward.
So your number logo.

2673
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:42,400
I remember when he was holding on to 99%
GSPS fights are designed to take the

2674
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:44,274
fight to the ground.

2675
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,080
They got real boring to,
let's be honest,

2676
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:49,820
fellows,
an intelligent way.

2677
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,400
I'm not saying it's not intelligent as
far as entertainment.

2678
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:59,340
When he's saying that
that was fun.

2679
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:04,400
He'll blow up a paper view for sure.
Cause you look great.

2680
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:06,900
Phenomenal.
He's hands in La Right now.

2681
01:56:06,901 --> 01:56:09,930
Training with Freddy isn't,
they said he's real thin to looking at a

2682
01:56:09,931 --> 01:56:11,520
55 fight.
Wow.

2683
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:16,290
And even though even though it could be,
does stand a lot and and play on his

2684
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:17,670
feet a lot,
his,

2685
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:20,210
his main objective is to take them on
the top and down.

2686
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:22,280
That's the main,
that's number one.

2687
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:25,650
But don't fuck around and throw some
strikes.

2688
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:28,200
Why are they still talking about a floyd
mayweather fight?

2689
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:30,930
It's embarrassing.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing

2690
01:56:30,931 --> 01:56:32,550
is just talking about,
I know he goes,

2691
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,650
I like three fights left.
If it's up to me,

2692
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:39,510
it's Tony Gsp,
GSP and floyd mayweather.

2693
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,960
When I hear that I want to throw up,
but what do you think?

2694
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:45,510
He just wants money and get the fuck
out.

2695
01:56:45,511 --> 01:56:47,580
Do you think he thinks he can beat him
cause he's such a savage.

2696
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:49,240
Yeah they do.
You can't beat him.

2697
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:52,560
Like they don't think floyd can knock
him out there in for a rude awakening.

2698
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:55,470
Well he certainly bad.
Are you?

2699
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,060
I mean maybe he lasts all 12 but they
get battered to fuck up will be awful.

2700
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:03,900
But I mean,
you know what's going to be paid if

2701
01:57:03,901 --> 01:57:05,470
that's what you wanna do you get paid?
Do I?

2702
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:08,340
I'd much rather see him fighting GSP.
Yeah,

2703
01:57:08,341 --> 01:57:09,960
me too.
But I don't think,

2704
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,960
I don't think it's,
I mean it's a terrible move for him to

2705
01:57:12,961 --> 01:57:15,300
fight.
Floyd Floyd would just look,

2706
01:57:15,301 --> 01:57:20,040
floyd is the best box or maybe of our
era maybe of all time.

2707
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,570
He's,
he's undefeated.

2708
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:24,780
Here's the problem.
The UFC let connor do that once.

2709
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:26,880
Now he's Kinda,
we can barely get him to fight is worth

2710
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:28,860
$100 million.
And they're like,

2711
01:57:28,861 --> 01:57:29,660
do please fights.
Like,

2712
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:30,710
Nah,
I make so much money,

2713
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:33,180
whiskey and this,
I'll fight when I'm ready.

2714
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,340
They're not gonna let that ever,
you're never gonna see that again.

2715
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:37,470
I don't think you ever,
you see that crazy.

2716
01:57:37,471 --> 01:57:39,800
They may
disagree,

2717
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:44,910
which is it can't happen now.
Now that the fertittas don't own the UFC

2718
01:57:45,421 --> 01:57:47,880
and now like this corporation owns it
now.

2719
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:50,550
Everyone is not one day days is up the
hill.

2720
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:51,140
No Way.
Wait,

2721
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:54,540
what are you saying?
I'm saying that connor has so much

2722
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:59,541
leverage now where it's not a good thing
to make someone a giant star who could

2723
01:57:59,791 --> 01:58:02,520
be a giant star because they're worried
that person's going to have leverage.

2724
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:04,140
No,
they'll make them a giant star in the

2725
01:58:04,141 --> 01:58:04,530
UFC.

2726
01:58:04,530 --> 01:58:07,590
They're not going to let him jump over
and do a code promotion with floyd

2727
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:10,530
mayweather again,
maybe put that and listen to keep doing

2728
01:58:10,531 --> 01:58:12,330
it.
Who else would they do it with theirs?

2729
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:14,280
That's the better question.
Here's the thing.

2730
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,800
If they had another connor,
they do it the same way.

2731
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:19,110
It's a way to make money.
It's a smart way to make money.

2732
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:20,580
It was a fun fight.
We watched it.

2733
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:22,020
We got to seat.
You can sit education.

2734
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:25,080
It's an education for people that
appreciate martial arts because you

2735
01:58:25,081 --> 01:58:28,740
really got to understand what a world
class top of the food chain,

2736
01:58:28,741 --> 01:58:32,070
maybe the best of all time box or does
to an MMA fighter and you think we're

2737
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:34,140
going to pay for it.
The general audience,

2738
01:58:34,141 --> 01:58:35,850
he keeps saying for that.
I'm not what I'm saying.

2739
01:58:35,851 --> 01:58:37,890
What I'm saying is is it was getting us
up.

2740
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:40,440
It was good for the,
it was good for the sport and if someone

2741
01:58:40,441 --> 01:58:42,100
comes along different,
someone

2742
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,410
comes along,
it's not floyd did someone else and the

2743
01:58:44,411 --> 01:58:47,720
same situation arises again and there's
another opportunity to make a shitload

2744
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:48,760
of money.
They're going to do it again.

2745
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,150
How many titles do they do?
See Floyd Floyd is 40 years old.

2746
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:54,070
He probably doesn't want to do it that
many more times.

2747
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,850
The only thing that would fuck floyd up
is that his extravagant spending isn't a

2748
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:01,750
bad look for MMA too.
So let's say Floyd's 27 at this point

2749
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:04,660
and he's one of the greatest and we go,
here's connor smokes him.

2750
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:07,000
Here's can be smoked him.
Here's style.

2751
01:59:07,001 --> 01:59:09,850
Bench smokes him.
At what point is you have to be like,

2752
01:59:09,851 --> 01:59:12,890
this is a bad look man.
Like guys can fucking torched with.

2753
01:59:12,891 --> 01:59:17,891
Depends on whether or not it's obvious
that they had no chance.

2754
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:20,260
Like with Connor,
the,

2755
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:23,230
the interesting thing is like he landed
a couple of shots,

2756
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:24,490
get up and you go,
okay,

2757
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:28,060
if this guy could take this guy down or
even just kick his legs,

2758
01:59:28,330 --> 01:59:30,430
if Kinda could just kick his legs,
it would be a wash.

2759
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:35,470
And it's interesting to watch someone
even fail against someone who's way

2760
01:59:35,471 --> 01:59:37,870
better at their sport.
The real question is,

2761
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,620
you're ever,
are you ever going to see a worldclass

2762
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:42,640
boxer?
By time we saw James Tony,

2763
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:47,200
he had been like really late in the game
when Vince Phillips Fought Masato and k

2764
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:49,180
one,
he was way late in the game.

2765
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,800
They were on their way out looking for
money,

2766
01:59:50,810 --> 01:59:54,580
right after thoughts,
afterthoughts for the most part,

2767
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:57,460
for the most part.
Do you ever think you're gonna see like

2768
01:59:57,461 --> 01:59:58,294
a,
uh,

2769
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:04,160
a Crawford step into MMA aloma Chanko
step into MMA in their prime?

2770
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:07,390
I don't think so.
Why wouldn't you do make so much money?

2771
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:09,700
I know they need to make it so because
if they're at that level,

2772
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:14,380
they're making so much money and you,
why would you risk going to the UFC in

2773
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:16,980
50 years?
How awesome that put a poster is going

2774
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:21,990
to be at conor and Floyd fucking
frame that she loves going to be 90 and

2775
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:24,670
it's gonna be framed and I have that
shit.

2776
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:29,280
I have the official one,
Joe Louis Max schmeling Dalia Gnocchi,

2777
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:33,410
that poster in your living room.
You see?

2778
02:00:33,790 --> 02:00:34,960
See,
I'm all good on that.

2779
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:35,681
See,
I saw that.

2780
02:00:35,681 --> 02:00:38,530
It was a great spectacle.
I love being part of watching.

2781
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:41,440
I'm glad killed the paper views.
I'm outman.

2782
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:43,930
If someone else does it,
it's not as fun I don't think talking

2783
02:00:43,931 --> 02:00:46,000
about,
so if someone else comes along,

2784
02:00:46,001 --> 02:00:48,130
so you're telling me you same person
would and connor,

2785
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,350
I'm saying it could be even floyd,
you'd be like,

2786
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,560
well you're talking to degenerate.
I watch,

2787
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:56,250
I watch women fuck in their underwear
beetle.

2788
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:57,623
Okay,
me too.

2789
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:59,360
Yeah,
I'm saying the masses.

2790
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,850
I don't think,
God don't worry about the mat.

2791
02:01:00,851 --> 02:01:02,260
I don't think.
I don't think you're right.

2792
02:01:02,290 --> 02:01:04,360
Well,
that's what the UFC where think many

2793
02:01:04,361 --> 02:01:06,610
more.
If it could be stepped in and tried to

2794
02:01:06,611 --> 02:01:08,410
fight floyd right now.
Right now,

2795
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,760
if they set it up in two months,
I guarantee you it would sell at least a

2796
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:12,840
million.

2797
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:16,480
It does better than conor.
You would want to say you think it does?

2798
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,580
No,
I don't think those clubs at a million.

2799
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:21,990
I said it does a million.
It could be boy Jamie for him.

2800
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,720
Do you think you would do a million pay
per views or more or more something

2801
02:01:25,721 --> 02:01:26,041
like,
well,

2802
02:01:26,041 --> 02:01:27,460
here's the thing,
you do a million.

2803
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,780
It's floyd.
He doesn't miss.

2804
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:30,940
When uh,
who was um,

2805
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,950
who was a floyd's last fall was it
Pacquiao and then Tim Bradley,

2806
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,270
if I pack out then Tim Bradley never
tired.

2807
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:39,220
Right.
And the pack,

2808
02:01:39,221 --> 02:01:41,840
you've got the giant,
the most paper view numbers ever.

2809
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:44,030
But then Tim Bradley,
if I'm correct,

2810
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:48,440
only got a few hundred thousand,
like 300,000 isn't that right?

2811
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:49,061
Yeah,
that's right.

2812
02:01:49,061 --> 02:01:52,250
So then he fights connor and he gets
like 2 million,

2813
02:01:52,251 --> 02:01:54,020
whatever the fuck it was.
So giant paper.

2814
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:55,550
You say Andre Berto,
Andre,

2815
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:56,710
Bert and Jay Baer.
Thanks.

2816
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:57,980
Right,
so he fought.

2817
02:01:58,430 --> 02:02:00,470
My apologies.
Tim Bradley.

2818
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:04,280
So then he fights Andre Berto that only
gets 350,000 or something like that.

2819
02:02:04,281 --> 02:02:06,010
Pay per view buys.
Then he flights.

2820
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:09,200
Conor fights connor and it's millions of
paper views.

2821
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:11,450
If he fucked could be,
it would still be better than fighting

2822
02:02:11,451 --> 02:02:12,620
any of those other guys.
Agree.

2823
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:15,480
100% Bradley like safe.
He had a fight with Bradley or saved.

2824
02:02:15,481 --> 02:02:16,510
No one's tuna.
No.

2825
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:19,520
That's going to be that many pack.
Elvish fully male is probably,

2826
02:02:19,521 --> 02:02:21,380
you didn't get that against a big one.
That's a big one.

2827
02:02:21,381 --> 02:02:24,590
Especially bandy pack.
Hell now after we be broner,

2828
02:02:24,591 --> 02:02:26,690
after he got out that Australian dude
look good.

2829
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:28,670
He looked very jeff [inaudible]
Australian guy.

2830
02:02:28,671 --> 02:02:30,880
He lost his power beats right.
TC,

2831
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:36,210
Matisse and then knocked out my teeth
for 40 okay.

2832
02:02:36,441 --> 02:02:37,470
He's still good.
Yeah.

2833
02:02:38,250 --> 02:02:40,000
Yeah.
Prime.

2834
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,810
But yeah.
No disrespect to Jeff Horn either.

2835
02:02:41,811 --> 02:02:43,370
I fucked that one up.
He's a math teacher.

2836
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:46,010
He is a math teacher.
Do you see when Crawford fought him,

2837
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:48,080
whoo.
That's when we realized how good

2838
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:49,760
terrence can you realize he was the math
teacher?

2839
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:53,210
Well,
Crawford is if he's not the best in the

2840
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:55,550
world,
he's top two or three already said that.

2841
02:02:55,551 --> 02:02:56,031
I asked her,
I said,

2842
02:02:56,031 --> 02:02:56,571
who's the best?
He goes,

2843
02:02:56,571 --> 02:02:58,370
dad,
it'd be tough to go against Crawford

2844
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:00,350
right now.
Notice nobody calls Crawford.

2845
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:04,330
So to up to everyone challenged them.
No one really fucks with you about so

2846
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:07,680
good at switching to switching stances
such a,

2847
02:03:07,690 --> 02:03:10,090
I think these fights,
you don't have a good win.

2848
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:12,110
Well because of this promotion.
It's a fucking,

2849
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:13,910
that's what's wrong with Buxton.
Joshua.

2850
02:03:13,911 --> 02:03:14,480
Eddie,
Huh?

2851
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,860
Yeah.
Interesting.

2852
02:03:15,861 --> 02:03:17,630
Baiters going to take fade around.
You think so?

2853
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:18,680
I agree.
And take them out.

2854
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:22,850
I hope you door.
It's shown massive signs of Chin.

2855
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,110
Uh,
dictation.

2856
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,570
Well baiters in his prime.

2857
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:29,210
I really fully believe that.
I mean when I saw him beat the shit out

2858
02:03:29,211 --> 02:03:30,950
of Montreal and take them down at will,
I was like,

2859
02:03:30,951 --> 02:03:33,590
I am so impressed too.
How about any starch King Moan?

2860
02:03:33,591 --> 02:03:35,000
Like 30 seconds,
dude,

2861
02:03:35,001 --> 02:03:38,270
he's a different guy.
When he moved over to bell tore two,

2862
02:03:38,271 --> 02:03:41,120
something happened.
And I mean it was almost like you

2863
02:03:41,121 --> 02:03:42,200
realize like,
Holy Shit,

2864
02:03:42,201 --> 02:03:45,110
I'm not even in the UFC anymore.
I got to really make something here.

2865
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:47,600
When he built beat Phil,
you know,

2866
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:49,430
he's,
he's beaten some really good guys.

2867
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:51,380
Man.
He's really good guys.

2868
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,100
When you look at them like everything
about him,

2869
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:56,120
like technically the way he's moving,
the way he fights,

2870
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,310
and he's a good example of what we were
talking about earlier.

2871
02:03:58,311 --> 02:04:00,170
You don't know what he's gonna do.
He's gonna take you down.

2872
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:03,680
He's going to strike with you.
He's doing everything and he's mixing

2873
02:04:03,681 --> 02:04:05,360
everything up and his mentality.

2874
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,440
Yes,
he's a fucking end.

2875
02:04:06,450 --> 02:04:08,900
His mentality.
The other thing he was telling me is,

2876
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:12,290
uh,
so he was trying to negotiate with Bell

2877
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:14,130
Torres contract.
This is his last fight,

2878
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,440
his contract.
So hold up,

2879
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:18,020
you're going to be a free agent and be a
double champ champ,

2880
02:04:18,021 --> 02:04:18,900
because that's,
yeah,

2881
02:04:18,901 --> 02:04:21,350
we're risking that.
Like holy fuck if you own the light

2882
02:04:21,351 --> 02:04:24,320
heavyweight title and heavy,
we tell you about to get paid.

2883
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:25,341
And I said,
well,

2884
02:04:25,341 --> 02:04:27,830
how about a super fight with DC?
Whoa.

2885
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:28,940
Double Champ.
Double Champ.

2886
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:29,990
Well,
the thing is,

2887
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:33,600
although he's famous in,
you know,

2888
02:04:33,650 --> 02:04:37,740
the Bella tour circle,
how many people know who we is of Bella

2889
02:04:37,741 --> 02:04:41,910
tour?
I mean UFC ultimate fighter winner,

2890
02:04:41,911 --> 02:04:44,460
bro.
Forget in terms of pay per view buys.

2891
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:46,590
People forget they need to see you
there.

2892
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:48,810
If they don't see you there they go.
Where's he been?

2893
02:04:48,811 --> 02:04:51,270
You don't think you can sell double
chamfers double champ.

2894
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:54,930
You can sell it if you're willing to
acknowledge Palatar they never have.

2895
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:58,620
They never acknowledged fade or they
never acknowledged when he was fighting

2896
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:00,270
in pride,
like they never thought.

2897
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,850
They literally didn't even want me to
say pride.

2898
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:05,070
They don't want to acknowledge other
organizations,

2899
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,740
especially back then because pride
fucked them over.

2900
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:11,790
Remember they had that whole sneaky deal
like they gave him chocolate dao and

2901
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:14,190
vandelay is supposed to come over here.
Then they reneged.

2902
02:05:14,191 --> 02:05:16,380
It was a disaster,
shady shit and I was still,

2903
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:19,380
as a person who's a martial arts
commentator,

2904
02:05:19,381 --> 02:05:21,750
you have to bring up fade or you had to
bring up [inaudible].

2905
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,000
You had to bring it up.
A lot of the people that were making big

2906
02:05:24,001 --> 02:05:26,730
noise over in Japan and he was one of
them.

2907
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:32,430
He didn't cool if they had opened it up
to so we could see who's the absolute

2908
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:35,190
best in the world.
Beta is really good.

2909
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:37,050
He's really good.
And I really would,

2910
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:39,990
I would be very curious to see how much
better he's gotten because sometimes

2911
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:42,860
guys turned a corner and then all of a
sudden they just become the best.

2912
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,650
We tough to tell again.
That is his opposition right now because

2913
02:05:46,670 --> 02:05:49,050
Michio and right,
he was in him and he was never a world

2914
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:51,420
beater in the UFC.
I mean he was at a top five guy.

2915
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:53,590
You know what I'm saying?
Like he's never contender really good.

2916
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:55,970
Um,
but then still Phil Davis,

2917
02:05:55,971 --> 02:05:57,990
no field.
Dale says guys beat a lot of fucking

2918
02:05:57,991 --> 02:06:01,500
good people and fills another one who
looked better once he got to bell tour,

2919
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:03,090
he looked better.
Like he like hit,

2920
02:06:03,091 --> 02:06:04,170
he turned a corner as well.

2921
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:07,290
And then when you're,
is a new chapter in your life like that,

2922
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:11,050
you've got to rise to the occasion.
And the Chemo Chemo off see older and

2923
02:06:11,060 --> 02:06:14,070
his career and it fade or oldest shit in
his career.

2924
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:15,930
So it's like we,
I don't know what Beta is that.

2925
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:17,430
There are great wins though.
Yeah.

2926
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,980
And at light heavyweight,
he would kill right now in the UFC,

2927
02:06:19,981 --> 02:06:22,220
there's no button.
Anyway,

2928
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:27,420
once Bella Tor stars started signing
with the UFC,

2929
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:30,780
like with Chandler and Alvarez and I
champs Alvarez,

2930
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:34,780
Albert's
channel in that way and now ben ass

2931
02:06:34,781 --> 02:06:35,614
grin.
Yeah,

2932
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:37,850
you can't,
you can't say shit about Bella tour no

2933
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:38,640
more.
No,

2934
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:40,740
no.
Exactly.

2935
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,140
You're trying to take,
when Bella tour fighters are being

2936
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:45,330
signed to the UFC based on their
stardom.

2937
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,940
Bella Tours legit as fuck.
Oh,

2938
02:06:47,941 --> 02:06:52,500
super legit.
Especi a certain weight classes for

2939
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:54,120
sure.
One of the best on the planet.

2940
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,440
You know,
people would lit.

2941
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,880
Yeah,
he'd be Woodley.

2942
02:06:56,910 --> 02:07:00,240
I mean [inaudible] Musashi is absolutely
one of the best in the planet.

2943
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:02,970
Hand Chandler has beaten Alvarez,
Alvarez,

2944
02:07:02,971 --> 02:07:05,850
one of the best on planet challenge ones
live or go to the UFC.

2945
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:10,260
He just see style.
He likes being over there.

2946
02:07:10,410 --> 02:07:15,410
Here's the argument to Ben Henderson,
UFC worldclass comes the Bella tour.

2947
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:17,680
It's been a struggle.
It's been struggles,

2948
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:19,500
cynical.
He fought course club,

2949
02:07:19,501 --> 02:07:23,190
which I don't think was the right move,
that terrible idea to whereby this is

2950
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:25,290
not his weight class.
He's just say five pounder.

2951
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:28,560
And I love Ben Friend of mine,
but he hasn't looked like the same ben

2952
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:30,720
that you know,
compete against Frankie Edgar.

2953
02:07:30,721 --> 02:07:33,480
And that's true.
But you have to remember that he's been

2954
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:36,910
fighting world class competition for
ever.

2955
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:39,040
So as the Debbie and bees,
yes.

2956
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:41,500
Rice rest true.
And you cannot stop it.

2957
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:44,320
Yes.
But Eddie Alvarez was later,

2958
02:07:44,410 --> 02:07:46,870
he came along,
his career was hard and rough,

2959
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:49,270
but it was later in in the,
in the time period.

2960
02:07:49,420 --> 02:07:51,090
Then ben underground kitten.
Yeah.

2961
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:53,290
Yeah.
Henderson was like WC,

2962
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:55,060
right to showtime.
Showtime.

2963
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:58,420
You got to remember he was the champ.
So pet is,

2964
02:07:58,421 --> 02:08:02,290
takes his title with that crazy kick to
close out WEC.

2965
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:03,590
They go over to the UFC.
He,

2966
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:05,470
he beats every,
I mean fights.

2967
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:08,110
Everybody.
He fought so many fucking tough guys.

2968
02:08:08,140 --> 02:08:09,430
So many guys,
you know.

2969
02:08:09,431 --> 02:08:13,330
And then didn't he fight?
He got stopped by dos Anjos when dos

2970
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:15,130
Anjos was one is up.
Come on.

2971
02:08:15,131 --> 02:08:18,400
Dos Anjos is on the way to the title.
That was the big fight was him and

2972
02:08:18,401 --> 02:08:19,950
Henderson needs Cko dumb.
Yup.

2973
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:24,220
He was a motherfucker back then.
Dos Anjos for that time period.

2974
02:08:24,221 --> 02:08:27,220
There was a time period of like two
years where I think dosantos was just a

2975
02:08:27,221 --> 02:08:30,730
fucking berzerker like one of the best
lightweights of all time and then,

2976
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:31,900
and it's not,
I don't know.

2977
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:32,890
It could be a coincidence.

2978
02:08:32,910 --> 02:08:35,280
The new side of came,
he went on to lose weight.

2979
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:36,373
I'm just,
I don't know.

2980
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:40,780
That will never go into 70 he's a
fucking monster has 70 he's not as good

2981
02:08:40,781 --> 02:08:45,781
at 70 as it is is 55 fucking good at 70
now the guys like Camaros Uzman it's

2982
02:08:46,070 --> 02:08:48,030
going to be a problem for the guys like
Colby Covington,

2983
02:08:48,031 --> 02:08:50,890
undersize,
big strong wrestlers.

2984
02:08:50,891 --> 02:08:54,000
It could become a hard time to find
fighters.

2985
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:58,660
Go from Bella Tor to the UFC or you have
seen a bell tour no matter what in that

2986
02:08:58,661 --> 02:08:59,460
debate,
the one,

2987
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:03,730
the cream of the crop or change is the
level of prestige and the belt,

2988
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:06,190
the UFC belt,
the UFC.

2989
02:09:06,191 --> 02:09:07,024
It's king.

2990
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:12,010
No matter what it will be because you
have to go through a tougher road to get

2991
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:13,270
that,
but it's also,

2992
02:09:13,271 --> 02:09:17,650
it's not even like saying a and B,
it's like saying a and f.

2993
02:09:18,070 --> 02:09:20,260
There's so many separations between the
Bella,

2994
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:22,330
our belt in the UFC talking about the
prestige,

2995
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,360
prestige,
but when you're talking about town,

2996
02:09:25,630 --> 02:09:29,600
Douglas Lema in my opinion,
is one of the best welterweights on

2997
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,710
planet earth.
Rory Macdonald who beat him in a very

2998
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:34,690
close decision,
one of the best welterweights on earth.

2999
02:09:34,980 --> 02:09:37,150
[inaudible].
He's one of the best middleweights on

3000
02:09:37,151 --> 02:09:38,890
the fucking planet.
These are,

3001
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:41,620
these are all realities mad for anybody
who understands mma,

3002
02:09:41,860 --> 02:09:45,520
but yet the belts just different cause
you don't crawl through the same shit

3003
02:09:45,521 --> 02:09:47,050
that you'd have to.
If you're in the UFC,

3004
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:49,270
UFC champ,
dude,

3005
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:51,570
you better be you're,
you're the best.

3006
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:53,090
Your hands down the best.
Yeah.

3007
02:09:53,091 --> 02:09:56,590
If you bought 55 you walk away,
you know chocolate.

3008
02:09:56,590 --> 02:10:00,790
Dell is always going to be a former UFC
champion hoists crazy UFC champion,

3009
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:02,650
beat three champions,
all these cha,

3010
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:05,140
you fc,
it means more.

3011
02:10:05,141 --> 02:10:06,910
It's always going to me more.
It's like q tips,

3012
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:09,820
cotton swabs,
q tips.

3013
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:14,050
It's easy to get signed to the UFC and
fighting the prelims.

3014
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:17,470
Then to go from the prelims to the main
card,

3015
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:21,010
that's for sure.
Harder to get in there.

3016
02:10:21,390 --> 02:10:22,840
Get on the other road ahead.
Lord.

3017
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:27,670
You know a hardy at 145 pound woman,
then they'll let you right in.

3018
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,580
Yeah,
exactly.

3019
02:10:29,390 --> 02:10:33,040
Fight for a title fight.
But you WWII superstar.

3020
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:34,190
Who Do they,
what do they have?

3021
02:10:34,191 --> 02:10:37,250
Cyborg fight.
Now if Amanda Nunez decides to take time

3022
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:39,470
off of fighting at featherweight,
I've shunock's outside board.

3023
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:41,990
Who Do they have cyborg fight again?
Megan.

3024
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:45,590
She won her fight.
But how crazy is the way she won a deal?

3025
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:46,433
What are you going to do?

3026
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,770
What are you going to do?
Fight,

3027
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:51,860
fight,
fight again.

3028
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:54,130
You've got to do a read.
That's what I read.

3029
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,390
That's what I,
and then just leave Cyborg on the

3030
02:10:56,391 --> 02:10:58,610
sidelines and not hide her enough.
She gets pissed.

3031
02:10:58,611 --> 02:11:03,611
Think you need to have like a,
a technical foul and accidental foul and

3032
02:11:04,731 --> 02:11:06,210
that's the end of the fight.
Cause if it's,

3033
02:11:06,330 --> 02:11:07,520
if it's,
it's a foul.

3034
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:09,530
If you poke someone,
how the fuck is it?

3035
02:11:09,531 --> 02:11:14,050
Not if a foul if your toes,
and he seemed to fix that.

3036
02:11:15,230 --> 02:11:16,790
No one.
If you just throw a punch,

3037
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:19,550
if you throw a punch and as you're
throwing your ride hook,

3038
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:22,130
your thumb goes in someone's eye and
they stopped the fight.

3039
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:24,080
They look at the replay,
they say it's an eye poked.

3040
02:11:24,081 --> 02:11:26,420
The referee says it's an I poke.
You get disqualified.

3041
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:29,870
How is that any different than you
throwing a round kick and the the,

3042
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:31,880
the toe inadvertently goes in your arm.

3043
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:34,040
It's just snap.
It's not meagan's fault.

3044
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,690
I mean,
she did what she was supposed to do.

3045
02:11:35,691 --> 02:11:39,050
She's tracking her down using a range.
Lands a nice kick butt.

3046
02:11:39,051 --> 02:11:40,970
She caught her at the toe,
toe in the eyeball,

3047
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,520
but also cat turned her back and wave
like it's over.

3048
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:47,360
But she has to say it's over.
Sheriff fucking eyeballs popped.

3049
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:51,910
Whatever it happened.
It cut right here.

3050
02:11:52,490 --> 02:11:56,630
How weird is it that there's a shortage
of big women?

3051
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:00,480
You think they would be an abundant?
Really,

3052
02:12:00,481 --> 02:12:03,160
really?
You can't blame Julie Girls who are all

3053
02:12:03,161 --> 02:12:05,040
in the wwe,
NBA all.

3054
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:07,400
No one wants to punch in the face.
Think about it.

3055
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:11,870
There should be a shortage of 150 115
pound girls.

3056
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:13,830
There's no,
there's a ton of them.

3057
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:17,030
It if you get like a vow,
this frank [inaudible] shout out to

3058
02:12:17,031 --> 02:12:20,260
Frank Trigg,
you get Valentine is shifts waco get a

3059
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:24,710
Valentina Eddie.
If you get a a shift Shankar and Amanda

3060
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:28,010
Nunez or Rhonda Rousey,
this is like a hundred of those on the

3061
02:12:28,011 --> 02:12:28,844
earth.

3062
02:12:28,910 --> 02:12:31,010
You know the ones who can read,
there's no,

3063
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:34,940
the ones who could really transition
from kilcoy Christian or kickboxing.

3064
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:39,480
There's some bad ass Moy Thai girls,
but they might be wrapped up in Moitai.

3065
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:41,570
They might be Miriam Nakamoto or
something like that.

3066
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:43,580
They really ever going to go back to
mma.

3067
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:45,440
She's trying to just get some injuries,
man,

3068
02:12:45,441 --> 02:12:47,680
she's like 41 I think,
you know,

3069
02:12:47,681 --> 02:12:51,950
and she's working her way.
Hobby where came out way back to you and

3070
02:12:51,951 --> 02:12:53,900
bang.
She's um,

3071
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:57,620
she's a beast and as a Meu tie fighter,
she's a monster and there's a few of

3072
02:12:57,621 --> 02:13:00,680
those girls that are that way with mma
or that way.

3073
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:01,800
What you Jitsu.
It's,

3074
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:04,580
it's finding them all in mma.
You're,

3075
02:13:04,581 --> 02:13:07,430
it's less than 102 but girls under this,
uh,

3076
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:08,570
what's,
uh,

3077
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:11,930
the weight class?
Fucking rose fights in Tatiana Suarez.

3078
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:16,790
The motherfucker.
Tatiana swartz fights 25 and 15.

3079
02:13:16,791 --> 02:13:19,810
She fucked 25 and lost to Valentina and
good fight.

3080
02:13:19,811 --> 02:13:22,460
He fight.
But Valentino just seems to be stronger.

3081
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:25,400
More physically powerful.
Logist a little sharper.

3082
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,000
A little more suited to 25.
She's almost like a tweener.

3083
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:33,930
It's like Yolanda is like not quite one
15 knocked one 25 cash in a weird,

3084
02:13:34,130 --> 02:13:37,830
well you were that little man.
Five pounds means a lot more than 10

3085
02:13:37,831 --> 02:13:40,840
pounds.
One 85 dude faders,

3086
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:41,700
walkouts or,
oh,

3087
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:43,050
he's epic.
Yeah.

3088
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:45,630
Like look at his sneakers.
Like you just found those somewhere.

3089
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:53,310
Somebody's going,
he says put these on and can't go

3090
02:13:53,311 --> 02:13:54,780
barefoot.
Definitely not Reebok's.

3091
02:13:54,781 --> 02:13:56,340
We know that.
What do you think they are?

3092
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:59,690
Sauconys new balance.
New Balance.

3093
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:02,070
Tsa.
Yeah.

3094
02:14:02,071 --> 02:14:04,890
Probably not even the TSA.
New Balances we can always get that

3095
02:14:04,891 --> 02:14:08,880
wouldn't cross man kisses.
It goes through the whole deal.

3096
02:14:08,930 --> 02:14:10,270
I,
there's someone in the media asks him if

3097
02:14:10,271 --> 02:14:12,930
he Christ and he said once,
wow.

3098
02:14:13,010 --> 02:14:14,760
Yeah,
once I did chopping onions.

3099
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:17,910
That's it.
Fuck man.

3100
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,450
What do you think he loses?
Probably last time for him.

3101
02:14:21,451 --> 02:14:22,500
Huh?
Um,

3102
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:23,820
you never know man.
I mean,

3103
02:14:23,821 --> 02:14:27,240
he might just be like,
be really bored with everything else in

3104
02:14:27,241 --> 02:14:29,970
his life and willing to take the
punishment.

3105
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:31,670
This is the real question.
When,

3106
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:35,820
when a guy's his greatest fade or it has
had a career that fader has had and

3107
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:38,040
still wins every now and then,
like knocked out frank,

3108
02:14:39,150 --> 02:14:42,540
Frank Mir,
he soda and chill son and he still can

3109
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:42,960
win.

3110
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,880
Right?
He's still can beat good guys.

3111
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:46,380
And B,
you know,

3112
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:51,090
real quality UFC fighters that have
transitioned over both those guys,

3113
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:53,310
you know,
chill son and was a quality fighter.

3114
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,410
Frank Mir is quality fighters.
The heavyweight champion.

3115
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:58,350
It was to tell him,
you can't keep doing this.

3116
02:14:58,351 --> 02:15:00,840
This is probably the most funny ever has
ever all day.

3117
02:15:00,841 --> 02:15:02,130
What does he do?
He doesn't say anything.

3118
02:15:02,131 --> 02:15:03,690
And he eats ice cream.
He draws pictures,

3119
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:08,520
give him a chance.
He gets into that cage and he,

3120
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:12,690
so he reignites the fuel inside of him
that led him to be,

3121
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:15,780
if not the greatest of all time in my
eyes,

3122
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:17,100
top three,
top three.

3123
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:20,130
She,
the thing is all about time period.

3124
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:23,580
It is about time period.
But it's also about what happened when

3125
02:15:23,581 --> 02:15:25,860
they fought for a preschool for dooms
gotta be in the argument

3126
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:29,350
but then Solos.
So to steep it,

3127
02:15:29,351 --> 02:15:32,150
you gotta do for you had to do cane can.

3128
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:34,620
Yes.
Yeah.

3129
02:15:34,650 --> 02:15:36,360
I think those are the guys in particular
order.

3130
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:39,710
You don't need just the format that's
Mount Rushmore of heavyweights.

3131
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:41,090
The argument for,
for ratio,

3132
02:15:41,091 --> 02:15:44,880
for doom is very strong because he beat
him off to a great aussie pay out him in

3133
02:15:44,881 --> 02:15:46,650
the first round.
He got reckless,

3134
02:15:46,670 --> 02:15:48,720
the street bay,
Cayo de and then uh,

3135
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:50,810
uh,
Volkov k owed him to,

3136
02:15:50,811 --> 02:15:52,220
to your,
to your point with fader and you're

3137
02:15:52,221 --> 02:15:52,441
like,
Yo,

3138
02:15:52,441 --> 02:15:53,251
it's cool.
He gets up there.

3139
02:15:53,251 --> 02:15:54,030
He gets,
sorry.

3140
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:56,460
You're cool with Liddell and Tito.
Keep doing it.

3141
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:58,920
But this is a difference between them,
first of all,

3142
02:15:58,921 --> 02:16:01,500
because fate or stayed active.
And I was cool with Tito.

3143
02:16:01,501 --> 02:16:04,800
What I was when it was not cool with was
chuck didn't look right.

3144
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:06,970
He didn't look like he was prepared,
even though,

3145
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:09,390
I don't know,
he didn't look like he was prepared on

3146
02:16:09,391 --> 02:16:11,010
the meds.
I don't know where he's at.

3147
02:16:11,011 --> 02:16:13,620
I don't know where he's at physically.
I don't know what damage he sustained.

3148
02:16:13,950 --> 02:16:17,800
When I see fade or fight,
he wins or he loses like Montreal and

3149
02:16:17,801 --> 02:16:19,470
chaotic.
But I think that shaft fight though,

3150
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:21,620
it wasn't good fight.
And I think that shot that Michio on

3151
02:16:21,621 --> 02:16:23,520
Keto road with,
he does chaos.

3152
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:26,500
A lot of people touches anywhere on the
chin.

3153
02:16:26,501 --> 02:16:30,100
You're going to sleep.
He fucking sofar athlete freak

3154
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,950
in the NFL for six years and he's so
light on his feet and he's fast as like

3155
02:16:33,951 --> 02:16:34,784
a tank.
Yeah.

3156
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:39,670
So did he knocked out Derrick Lewis and
like 15 seconds to still took it to

3157
02:16:39,671 --> 02:16:40,300
them?
Yeah.

3158
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:44,710
I don't think it's indicative of fate or
being done.

3159
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:47,150
You see the model.
So yes,

3160
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:50,920
it's as resilient as it used to be.
Maldon owls and underrated boxer.

3161
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:55,090
Maldonado touched him up and he's a
Brazilian Zombie,

3162
02:16:55,091 --> 02:16:55,600
but he,
yeah,

3163
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:59,230
he's really should be fighting at one 70
if he didn't eat all the assets in the

3164
02:16:59,231 --> 02:17:03,410
world and he gave fucking feed or it
everything it had done,

3165
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:07,680
both won that fight.
He tried to fucking reverse it in

3166
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:08,381
Russia.
They're like,

3167
02:17:08,381 --> 02:17:10,270
what are you at your fucking mind?
It's Russia.

3168
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:14,590
He would get the fuck out of here.
He's trying to like get them to do a,

3169
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:19,320
yeah.
In Russia or best friends with hooten

3170
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,410
for fuck sakes.

3171
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:22,150
Yeah.
I can't shit reverse there.

3172
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:24,490
Why?
Why are these marines coming in?

3173
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:27,290
They come in for [inaudible] was in the
middle.

3174
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:28,720
They're doing a national anthem.
I don't know why.

3175
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:30,670
Oh,
they're doing a Russian national anthem.

3176
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,710
Oh my.
Just scare and fate or with guns.

3177
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:34,400
They brought a gun in the oxygen for
your fate.

3178
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:36,680
You're a fuck about it,
but I wanted to eat that.

3179
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:39,670
They bring guns into the octagon.
That is odd,

3180
02:17:39,671 --> 02:17:40,780
right?
It's a ritual.

3181
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:41,930
I understand.
Ritual,

3182
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:43,570
not a ritual.
I got shoes on too.

3183
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:45,940
Right?
They got shoes on both those things.

3184
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:47,430
A lot of shoes in that.
It's not about that.

3185
02:17:47,431 --> 02:17:50,340
When I say what is happening,
are they going to shoot those guys with

3186
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:53,020
a medicine for the troops shot holes
through the ceiling?

3187
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:58,290
I would celebrate that,
but they do a whole thing where like

3188
02:17:59,441 --> 02:18:01,690
giving back to troops and shit.
Is that what they're doing here?

3189
02:18:01,691 --> 02:18:02,441
Yeah.
Okay.

3190
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:03,520
So he's saying,
Oh shit.

3191
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:05,950
Check out this guest Craig Morgan genes.
Who's that guy?

3192
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:08,080
Is he singing America?
America?

3193
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:11,980
When we hear this shit,
will they faders right?

3194
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,170
Yeah.
Well this guy is going to sync both of

3195
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:15,370
them,
but it's going to seem to rush one all

3196
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:16,730
fucked up.
Don't get

3197
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:19,113
defeated.

3198
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:23,680
Okay.

3199
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:26,410
Oh shout out to black rifle coffee.
Leejay Jeremy.

3200
02:18:26,460 --> 02:18:26,830
Okay.

3201
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:27,970
It's gotta be all the way up.
Sorry.

3202
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,330
They guy like Siki came out.
Stand up.

3203
02:18:31,331 --> 02:18:32,164
Hot Topic.

3204
02:18:35,090 --> 02:18:36,830
We can only hear it if you'd take your
earphones off,

3205
02:18:36,831 --> 02:18:37,670
Jamie.
I know,

3206
02:18:37,730 --> 02:18:38,421
I know.
I don't have it.

3207
02:18:38,421 --> 02:18:41,870
I can't tell you doing that on purpose.
It's not fed into the show.

3208
02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:43,280
Right,
but can you make it a little louder?

3209
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:47,420
Barely keep going.
There you go to down.

3210
02:18:47,421 --> 02:18:52,100
We have to sit through.
The [inaudible] going to get recorded

3211
02:18:52,101 --> 02:18:52,880
and there's a lot.
Oh,

3212
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:53,713
okay.
Okay.

3213
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:54,450
All right.
You can kill.

3214
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:58,190
Did you seem to do the Russia one too?
That's a such a or it takes too long.

3215
02:18:58,290 --> 02:18:59,660
Well,
we were talking to your showtime buddy

3216
02:18:59,661 --> 02:19:01,770
about that.
Like why do do this with the fights?

3217
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:04,820
When is your owner and pack you
[inaudible] they had to do both.

3218
02:19:04,821 --> 02:19:05,654
Anthems.
Yeah.

3219
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:07,580
It takes forever.
It's like 10 more minutes.

3220
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:09,340
Oh,
look at that.

3221
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:12,200
That star spangled banner.
You mother Fucker,

3222
02:19:12,201 --> 02:19:14,510
look at that flag flying in the
background.

3223
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:18,380
Do you know who this gentleman is?
Craig Morgan is just a country apple

3224
02:19:18,381 --> 02:19:20,020
watch on how dairy.
That's race.

3225
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:21,990
He's a veteran as a country duty at
apple.

3226
02:19:21,991 --> 02:19:22,491
Watch on.
Yeah.

3227
02:19:22,491 --> 02:19:25,280
That seems like I'm not buying in.
You're not buying it.

3228
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:26,510
I'm not buying it,
but you're faking,

3229
02:19:26,511 --> 02:19:27,110
bro.
Yeah.

3230
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:28,910
Is that an apple watch?
That's an apple watch.

3231
02:19:28,911 --> 02:19:32,400
Do you also those how those fucking
Chris daughtry wristbands,

3232
02:19:32,401 --> 02:19:34,610
he's winning.
That ain't fucking very country either.

3233
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:38,420
Countries at different things now.
It's all the same core to Georgia line.

3234
02:19:38,510 --> 02:19:39,980
Yeah,
a little bit country.

3235
02:19:39,981 --> 02:19:41,450
A little bit.
21 forever.

3236
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:45,860
Yeah,
forever 21 and I dig it and I take it.

3237
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:49,220
He liked those kinds of pants,
not his pants.

3238
02:19:49,221 --> 02:19:51,080
This boot cuts or give me some
predictions.

3239
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:56,290
I'm a Ryan Bader,
a Tko second round grandpa first radio,

3240
02:19:56,490 --> 02:19:58,070
first round.
And Jesus said he keeps showing me

3241
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,090
respect or knock him out in the first
round.

3242
02:20:00,450 --> 02:20:02,390
Ryan Bader.
Oh really?

3243
02:20:02,480 --> 02:20:04,610
Wow.
Eddie's been on one tonight though.

3244
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:06,120
Yeah,
that'd be right.

3245
02:20:06,121 --> 02:20:07,240
I hate to ruin it for you.

3246
02:20:10,730 --> 02:20:14,510
I think if Ryan doesn't respect for it
fade or he can get cracked.

3247
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:19,310
Well here's the thing about bait or to
as much as we love Bait Beta,

3248
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:21,170
I'm high,
I'm so hot.

3249
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:24,890
Remember when he and his big fights,
like he lost a rumble Johnson.

3250
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:27,110
John Jones,
like a lot of the big moments,

3251
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:31,970
he gets caught up sometimes Johnson shot
a bad shot and fucking he bounces head

3252
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:33,950
to the moon.
So this is the finals of their

3253
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:38,450
heavyweight tournament tournament.
That would make Ryan Bader be the

3254
02:20:38,451 --> 02:20:41,000
heavyweight champ champ champ.
Champ.

3255
02:20:41,010 --> 02:20:42,750
Channy owns the light heavyweight one
right now too.

3256
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:44,600
Yeah.
What's up?

3257
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:46,070
John Jones trying to run it back,
Bro,

3258
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:48,050
those years ago.
Are you bringing up old shit?

3259
02:20:48,051 --> 02:20:49,640
Is that he says,
well you bring up old shit.

3260
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:52,070
It's run it back.
Is that what he said?

3261
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:53,210
Nope.
That's what I'm saying.

3262
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:55,450
Terrible,
terrible champ shit.

3263
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:56,293
Right?
Yeah.

3264
02:20:57,050 --> 02:20:59,960
Hey Bro.
[inaudible] started it and now fucking

3265
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:01,520
everyone wants to do it.
Well,

3266
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:03,470
there's a few guys.
I like that.

3267
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:06,380
I love it.
It ties up the division so it gets a

3268
02:21:06,381 --> 02:21:07,250
little messy,
but

3269
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:09,890
I'd love to see,
could be,

3270
02:21:09,891 --> 02:21:14,891
but 70 and would at least go to 85 is
the belt and 45 there are 35 pound belt.

3271
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:19,250
He goes going to go out there.
Here's the thing,

3272
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:21,350
I really believe this.
I think if some,

3273
02:21:21,380 --> 02:21:24,680
this is an egregious error and there's a
fight that stopped prematurely.

3274
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:27,470
I think you should almost put it up to
the vote of the Internet.

3275
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:30,740
I really do it all at you.
At your God damn mind

3276
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:34,110
vote.
Yes.

3277
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:38,150
Popular vote.
Didn't you say most people like 70% of

3278
02:21:38,151 --> 02:21:40,120
the punctuation of dummies?
No,

3279
02:21:40,650 --> 02:21:45,650
it's like 80 it's about the popular
vote,

3280
02:21:45,651 --> 02:21:46,460
amy.
Okay,

3281
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:48,950
but let's say,
how about we have and say,

3282
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:53,510
how about we have an organization of
esteemed ladies and gentlemen,

3283
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:58,610
an organization of maybe 200 excepted
martial artists,

3284
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:02,600
worldclass martial artists,
people that a committee of a hundred

3285
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:06,350
people is what the fuck they're doing.
You're going to get the decision,

3286
02:22:06,351 --> 02:22:08,120
right?
That's a great idea.

3287
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:11,630
If you have it so much better than the
Internet trolls voting John Hackleman

3288
02:22:11,631 --> 02:22:15,500
ends and John Donna,
hers and for Rasa hobbies and duke roof,

3289
02:22:15,501 --> 02:22:18,650
Greg Jackson,
Mike Winkeljohn,

3290
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,320
Trevor Whitman is,
and you got a committee of the whole

3291
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:24,750
eastern
friends.

3292
02:22:24,930 --> 02:22:25,763
You

3293
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:29,240
believe you do have something like that
Duane lushy fear.

3294
02:22:29,370 --> 02:22:34,370
If you have those Tom's girl,
if you had all those people in like a

3295
02:22:35,551 --> 02:22:38,340
database and they all put in their
opinion,

3296
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:41,640
you would be 100% probably in agreement,
especially if the experts,

3297
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:42,630
yeah.
All right,

3298
02:22:42,631 --> 02:22:44,050
here we go.
Fade or looking,

3299
02:22:44,220 --> 02:22:45,390
stoic,
kind of nervous.

3300
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:47,320
I'm kind of nervous for Ryan.
Well,

3301
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,360
it's scary,
man.

3302
02:22:48,361 --> 02:22:50,850
He's fighting to fade or bro and he
comes out.

3303
02:22:50,851 --> 02:22:51,600
They get,
you know,

3304
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:53,460
as he's older,
he definitely didn't give a fuck

3305
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:55,080
anymore.
He just wants to take your head off.

3306
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:57,310
He's a second round hammer on my watch,
bro.

3307
02:22:57,570 --> 02:23:00,420
He's looking for that hammer.
Could that right hand feed or it's just

3308
02:23:00,421 --> 02:23:04,890
got that left hand loose and that right
hand balled the few fucking Pico is ever

3309
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:05,960
going to lose again.
So I have,

3310
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:07,740
I don't know what's going to happen.
Hey man,

3311
02:23:07,741 --> 02:23:10,530
anything could happen.
It's still one of the greatest

3312
02:23:10,531 --> 02:23:14,250
heavyweights of all time.
And Ryan Bader is a better fighter than

3313
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:17,370
he's ever been and and really slick man.
He's smart.

3314
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:18,990
He's smart and his approach.

3315
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:25,320
Oh.
Oh,

3316
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:29,210
what's up bro?
What's up?

3317
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:35,930
I told you to holy shit is Lucky Eddie,
but call it dude.

3318
02:23:36,031 --> 02:23:37,660
He's got a sneaky left.
Took the term,

3319
02:23:38,670 --> 02:23:40,290
done this,
this fucking tournament.

3320
02:23:42,430 --> 02:23:44,870
Beat mitre.
Own Fuck.

3321
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:49,860
Did I just starch fucking fade or two?
No one starts his fate or luck

3322
02:23:51,450 --> 02:23:53,760
and it was a weird left.
Took like it was almost like it looked

3323
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:56,730
like it start out as a jab and then
we'll turn it over at the,

3324
02:23:56,731 --> 02:24:00,600
at Arizona state left hook,
like how rose knocked out.

3325
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:02,700
You are a racks.
So yes,

3326
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:05,370
I want to see that.
Holy Shit.

3327
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:07,870
Call it the top shelf gods were
grabbing.

3328
02:24:07,871 --> 02:24:09,740
It keeps the cookies trying to tell you
guys,

3329
02:24:09,741 --> 02:24:12,810
you guys the listen top shell.
Damn.

3330
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:14,520
Look at this.
Watch this.

3331
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:19,110
Watch this left hand.
It's almost like a jab he draws,

3332
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:22,350
which she was going to fake the single.
Oh Yeah,

3333
02:24:22,351 --> 02:24:23,184
look at that again.

3334
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:30,110
So crazy good for him.
Was that's a good stop.

3335
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:32,101
Stop.
Stop.

3336
02:24:32,101 --> 02:24:34,260
There's two shots.
Gosh,

3337
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:40,240
that was almost like that Dan Henderson.
Bisbing shot that extra shot.

3338
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:42,050
Do you think that's bad?
That's evident.

3339
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:43,480
Watch this again.
Is that evidence of fader?

3340
02:24:43,481 --> 02:24:46,230
We just can't take a shot or is it a
perfect punch or is it both?

3341
02:24:46,231 --> 02:24:47,280
Hey,
there has heavy fuck.

3342
02:24:47,310 --> 02:24:49,370
I think it's both.
I think it's,

3343
02:24:49,371 --> 02:24:52,530
he's getting forward a little bit of
that.

3344
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:53,880
It's a little bit of both,
but damn,

3345
02:24:53,881 --> 02:24:55,420
it's a perfect punch.
He,

3346
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:58,320
he dropped his shoulder down like you
almost like he's going to jab to the

3347
02:24:58,321 --> 02:24:59,430
body,
right?

3348
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:00,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

3349
02:25:00,451 --> 02:25:03,660
It looked like almost a shot.
Jack Damn Dude Five.

3350
02:25:03,661 --> 02:25:06,630
I was about to get paid.
So what happens now?

3351
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:08,640
He's a free agent.
They've got to pay the cow.

3352
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,530
Look at the heavyweight Kaos light
heavyweight champ.

3353
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,420
Kale.
Shout out to be a left.

3354
02:25:12,421 --> 02:25:14,130
Right.
Shout out to Ryan Bader

3355
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:17,600
man.
It's party.

3356
02:25:17,610 --> 02:25:19,530
You sad to watch fate or get cracked
like that.

3357
02:25:19,531 --> 02:25:21,360
Oh Wow.
Interesting.

3358
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:22,950
Well just cause I'm up.
They just my

3359
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:27,170
who wouldn't listen,
you did call it dude and he's texting,

3360
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,220
he's texting.
Everybody told you bitch told you

3361
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:34,360
motherfuckers I see his car.
At a certain point you just can't take

3362
02:25:34,361 --> 02:25:36,880
shots and just can you get hit.
That wasn't a,

3363
02:25:37,330 --> 02:25:39,820
that was a nice shot,
but it didn't appear to me.

3364
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:42,460
You know that it was the heaviest shot
ever.

3365
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:47,650
I hate to say I told you so to anybody,
but to young fighters,

3366
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:50,350
this kind of shit is what I'm always
trying to point out.

3367
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:55,000
Don't get caught up in the moment.
Don't get caught up in wars because

3368
02:25:55,001 --> 02:25:58,420
every one of those bull,
eventually there's gonna come a time

3369
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:01,900
when that credit card bill is going to
come and you got all these charges and

3370
02:26:01,901 --> 02:26:03,810
it just,
you don't have the money you're going to

3371
02:26:03,811 --> 02:26:05,020
have to pay,
but it's going to have to pay.

3372
02:26:05,490 --> 02:26:09,550
There's no way around it and if you
fight a smart calculated fight,

3373
02:26:09,551 --> 02:26:12,340
like,
like who the fuck gets hit the least in

3374
02:26:12,341 --> 02:26:13,174
mma?

3375
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,670
You can definitely say ask boy's style
bender.

3376
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,490
Well wonder boy,
it's been dropped

3377
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:21,190
Levodopa for a long time.
He saw a lot of time.

3378
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:23,260
I think aspirin is probably the number
one,

3379
02:26:23,261 --> 02:26:26,590
but he's never fought anybody at the
caliber of the UFC.

3380
02:26:26,591 --> 02:26:28,180
Like in their prime.
He's gonna,

3381
02:26:28,181 --> 02:26:31,150
he's gonna now we're going to find out,
but just avoid it.

3382
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:32,610
Whatever.
You can do it.

3383
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:34,810
Again,
John Jones really doesn't take damage

3384
02:26:34,811 --> 02:26:36,970
either.
They sell calculate and just such a

3385
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:39,520
fucking beast.
The for the young fighters too.

3386
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:41,630
The other thing is,
is you train,

3387
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:44,080
you do all that work in the gym,
all that work,

3388
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:46,780
and then you're,
and you have these advantages,

3389
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:49,750
those even out when you're playing rock
'em sock 'em then all that work,

3390
02:26:49,751 --> 02:26:51,340
you all have that game plan.
You're coaches,

3391
02:26:51,341 --> 02:26:53,710
you're disrespecting them.
Cause now it's level playing field.

3392
02:26:53,711 --> 02:26:56,860
Whoever lands first,
it's fucking [inaudible] Nunez.

3393
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,480
Yes.
There you go.

3394
02:26:58,510 --> 02:27:00,100
Same thing.
Didn't respect the game.

3395
02:27:00,130 --> 02:27:03,210
Thought she could just steamroller
walked towards her solution was going to

3396
02:27:03,220 --> 02:27:06,160
blow her out of the water,
pinned her up against the cage and Nunez

3397
02:27:06,161 --> 02:27:08,180
cock cock cow.
Ractor correct.

3398
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:10,450
And that's what happens.
This is,

3399
02:27:10,451 --> 02:27:15,451
this is one person fighting on a
narrative and fighting on emotions and

3400
02:27:15,941 --> 02:27:19,780
trying to just overwhelm someone in Pico
and the other person responding and

3401
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:21,730
catching someone,
whether it's these openings,

3402
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:25,290
Aaron Peko same thing.
I mean he was pressing forward,

3403
02:27:25,291 --> 02:27:29,380
pressing forward and he gets,
it gets hit with that fucking haymaker

3404
02:27:29,381 --> 02:27:33,100
of a right hand.
Do you think that fate or side piece or

3405
02:27:33,101 --> 02:27:34,420
is that as translator?
She's with him.

3406
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:36,310
Every translator.
She's the translator.

3407
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:38,840
Um,
I'm uh,

3408
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:43,220
know I'm very impressed.
How can you not be impressed next for

3409
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,900
Beta though?
I'm a bait.

3410
02:27:44,950 --> 02:27:47,320
Should they wait for this fight to 40 to
40?

3411
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:48,850
Was he two 40?
I don't know.

3412
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,750
I think two 30 what's find out.
So you've uh,

3413
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:54,880
Jamie get the way it looks good.
It looks like Tiki.

3414
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:56,110
Like dude,
he's solid.

3415
02:27:56,111 --> 02:27:57,610
Fucking two 30.
I'll tell you that.

3416
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:00,610
That's a legit heavyweight.
I mean he can definitely make two oh

3417
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:01,513
five.

3418
02:28:03,140 --> 02:28:04,170
Oh no,
that's wrong.

3419
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:07,900
She cuts the official Bella tore a
Wayans.

3420
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:12,640
See if they have it.
There's this wifey is super pumped man.

3421
02:28:12,641 --> 02:28:15,550
He's a champ champ now.
Scott Cole and he's a free agent.

3422
02:28:15,551 --> 02:28:16,840
Bet on himself.
What does that,

3423
02:28:16,841 --> 02:28:21,841
he's the heavyweight Grand Prix chip.
Yeah.

3424
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:25,250
10 Line 7.8 to 27.
Okay,

3425
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:28,610
so kind of a light heavyweight kind of
light.

3426
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:30,380
Yeah.
Oh,

3427
02:28:30,381 --> 02:28:31,790
he's got three belts.
What happened there?

3428
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:33,200
I don't know.
You give him another one.

3429
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:34,670
Have another one bro.
Cause that was awesome.

3430
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:37,310
Oh that one has jewels on it.
That one's better than the UFC belt.

3431
02:28:37,311 --> 02:28:40,390
The new UFC belt.
Doodoo yeah.

3432
02:28:40,810 --> 02:28:43,520
Um,
I wonder why they changed it just to mix

3433
02:28:43,521 --> 02:28:44,570
it up.
But why?

3434
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:47,780
I don't know why now here,
and here's the thing.

3435
02:28:47,781 --> 02:28:49,820
Now if you're a champ,
so uh,

3436
02:28:49,880 --> 02:28:51,710
let's see.
Tony becomes champ and he hits that

3437
02:28:51,711 --> 02:28:53,300
belt.
They don't give you another belt.

3438
02:28:53,301 --> 02:28:58,280
They just added another stone to it.
Budget cuts was a real eye.

3439
02:28:58,300 --> 02:28:59,450
That's,
that's the word.

3440
02:28:59,451 --> 02:29:00,710
That's the rumor that you don't get new
belt.

3441
02:29:00,711 --> 02:29:02,360
They just add stones to you.
Swear to God.

3442
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:05,200
I would negotiate that in my contract.
I like you gotta give me another fucking

3443
02:29:05,210 --> 02:29:05,510
belt.

3444
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:08,450
I want the old bell.
I want a legacy about those old belts

3445
02:29:08,451 --> 02:29:10,520
are so sick.
That spelled of all time.

3446
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:13,840
Maybe I just don't like change my look
at him like got that looks like uh,

3447
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:16,220
we went to step back.
It's like when portion went from the

3448
02:29:16,221 --> 02:29:18,590
nine nine three to the nine,
nine,

3449
02:29:18,591 --> 02:29:21,170
six,
those goofy lights,

3450
02:29:21,171 --> 02:29:25,100
they'll never
understand what the hell that and then

3451
02:29:25,150 --> 02:29:29,140
fortunately the unfortunate was 100.
But you know what's great about Porsche

3452
02:29:29,141 --> 02:29:31,130
went five apps and my bat,
let's round them up again.

3453
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:33,140
You guys like those will run them.
Get UFC goes,

3454
02:29:33,141 --> 02:29:34,900
fuck that.
You guys are going to take this shit.

3455
02:29:34,930 --> 02:29:37,750
We gotta occupy them down the fucker.
I love the UFC.

3456
02:29:37,970 --> 02:29:38,840
Love the EOC.
Yeah.

3457
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:41,720
Not the belt though.
How can you not love the UFC?

3458
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,990
Um,
our belts necessary.

3459
02:29:45,170 --> 02:29:46,070
I like them.
Right?

3460
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:47,640
Of course.
Rings.

3461
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:49,730
When can we did that?

3462
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:51,790
Look how he did that.
Very interested.

3463
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:54,100
How about fate or dink?
Throw one punch.

3464
02:29:54,101 --> 02:29:55,520
And I caught him.
Perfect man.

3465
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:57,920
I want to see that Walmart.
Watch how he does this.

3466
02:29:57,950 --> 02:30:01,760
I really liked this.
Dips his left shoulder and loops it in a

3467
02:30:01,761 --> 02:30:03,080
weird arc,
man.

3468
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:04,730
Watch this.
Ooh.

3469
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:07,700
Like half a jab.
Half a hook.

3470
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:08,900
It was like this,
right?

3471
02:30:09,210 --> 02:30:12,740
What's it like this so low?
It's like this long.

3472
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:14,810
And he caught them at the very end one
here.

3473
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,310
Would he say?
Yeah.

3474
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:18,050
I don't think they'll let us.
If he gets on that,

3475
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:22,730
he's like d you fucking Pussy
Pico.

3476
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:26,960
Come judge
just drops the ultimate fucking,

3477
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:28,560
yeah.
Um,

3478
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:30,260
I think he's probably,
if I was him,

3479
02:30:30,261 --> 02:30:33,470
he's real humble.
I think I'd probably say I'm super

3480
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:35,840
thankful and thank my team and,
uh,

3481
02:30:35,841 --> 02:30:37,820
it was an honor to fight,
fade or thanks a lot.

3482
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:40,870
Not Pay me.
Not Smart,

3483
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:41,800
amy.
No,

3484
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:44,810
he's too smart and look good looking
guy.

3485
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,140
Articulate as he's knocking
motherfuckers out like fade or,

3486
02:30:48,141 --> 02:30:49,730
I mean that's a real heavyweight
champion.

3487
02:30:49,731 --> 02:30:52,670
You want that guy as your champ do.
He has so many belts on him right now.

3488
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:55,430
And that one has diamonds and I want to
put those down so you could use your

3489
02:30:55,431 --> 02:30:56,061
hands.
No,

3490
02:30:56,061 --> 02:30:58,430
don't dude.
I'd wrap them around my neck so I can't

3491
02:30:58,431 --> 02:31:00,590
see.
Put One on your head.

3492
02:31:00,591 --> 02:31:01,810
Like a turban.
Yeah.

3493
02:31:01,910 --> 02:31:03,640
And then put the oil on my face and talk
to them like,

3494
02:31:03,860 --> 02:31:04,790
Hey,
you guys want to go?

3495
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:08,030
You guys want to go see her doing versus
Gordon Ryan.

3496
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:10,220
I can't,
I can't go to Mexico.

3497
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:11,240
No,
it's had in Mexico.

3498
02:31:11,241 --> 02:31:12,460
It's an la.
We might use it

3499
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:15,950
when,
that'd be Friday,

3500
02:31:15,951 --> 02:31:20,130
February 22nd it's going to be on fight
pass and a great fucking

3501
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:21,520
flag.
And Josh Barn,

3502
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:23,520
it's a four man tournament.
Josh Barnett,

3503
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,560
uh,
Rustam Chizzy IV.

3504
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,400
Who?
Who,

3505
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,670
who fought Gordon Ryan in the finals of
the bi six.

3506
02:31:29,671 --> 02:31:31,380
That's where Eba,
that's where Rob Gordon,

3507
02:31:31,381 --> 02:31:35,250
Ryan was born,
that he won the absolute of Ebi Ebi,

3508
02:31:35,251 --> 02:31:38,670
six hours his first tournament.
This is combat [inaudible] badge meant

3509
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:41,300
to slab.
So it's barn and not do companies just

3510
02:31:41,310 --> 02:31:46,310
don't get to Gordon Fabrice format
attorneys combat Barnett be sick.

3511
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:49,590
It's going to be fucking crazy.
It's an amazing tournament.

3512
02:31:49,620 --> 02:31:51,120
Yeah,
it's going to be crazy dude.

3513
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:53,740
Cause Josh Barnett just got beat by
Gordon Ryan too.

3514
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:59,180
He got to know it could be a rematch
there and Rustam thou he was in the

3515
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:02,700
finals and Gordon beat him in the finals
of the absolute Ebi six.

3516
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:05,820
So there's two re potential rematches
alone.

3517
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:09,600
But then on top of that you got fuck
buddies over doom versus Gordon Ryan in

3518
02:32:09,601 --> 02:32:10,470
round one I think.

3519
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:11,820
I think dawn Gordon,
Ryan,

3520
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:14,970
I think Gordon Ryan is obviously,
he's the best thing in Jujitsu,

3521
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:17,550
but he wants to mma too with his
personality,

3522
02:32:17,551 --> 02:32:19,760
his skillset.
I think he's gonna take over him and may

3523
02:32:19,761 --> 02:32:21,350
too.
He's a motherfuck.

3524
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:23,360
Well he's,
it seems like Donna,

3525
02:32:23,361 --> 02:32:26,100
hers is a personality to right way to
Donna.

3526
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:28,230
Her is telling him like,
you're going to learn how to strike

3527
02:32:28,231 --> 02:32:29,700
first.
You're not going to go in there without

3528
02:32:29,701 --> 02:32:34,701
any skills and joy attack his Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is going to be,

3529
02:32:35,491 --> 02:32:36,990
you know,
to be good for him.

3530
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:37,861
It's going to,
you know what?

3531
02:32:37,861 --> 02:32:40,710
He'll do fine because if you watch his
last few fights,

3532
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:43,230
he likes to mount.
He's not like this big leg locker,

3533
02:32:43,290 --> 02:32:44,970
leg locker.
He's an expert at leg locks.

3534
02:32:44,971 --> 02:32:48,990
He's got that whole system down,
but he likes to mount under Jack and get

3535
02:32:48,991 --> 02:32:53,130
arm triangles and that's perfect for mms
aren't triangles in mma.

3536
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:56,670
That's one of the,
that you have to be a savage with arm

3537
02:32:56,671 --> 02:32:59,220
triangles.
If you're fighting MMA plus this person,

3538
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:01,790
how you cause a star is a star.
Yeah.

3539
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:06,840
Well it was a handsome kid.
He's got a 28 pack tattoo on his chest,

3540
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:09,870
on his chest,
might have the most ridiculous six pack

3541
02:33:09,871 --> 02:33:12,360
of all time.
His him and Wiz Khalifa should have a

3542
02:33:12,361 --> 02:33:15,180
six pack off.
Wiz Khalifa is the size of this.

3543
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:17,360
My,
he doesn't count,

3544
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:19,860
but he's got a ridiculous,
it's like saying that it's starving kids

3545
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:20,920
in Africa shredded.
Oh,

3546
02:33:20,921 --> 02:33:23,470
you guys going to be in town February
22nd?

3547
02:33:23,490 --> 02:33:24,480
I think I'm in town.
I,

3548
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:27,030
if I'm in a crowd of 100%,
they're going to be there.

3549
02:33:27,140 --> 02:33:27,690
You know,
he's,

3550
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:31,260
he's parked sponsor like ranch.
Uh,

3551
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:36,290
well the guy that's uh,
his partner in that owns Copper Gel.

3552
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:37,771
Uh,
yeah,

3553
02:33:37,771 --> 02:33:39,510
they gave me some of that.
So Copper Jealous,

3554
02:33:39,511 --> 02:33:42,270
sponsoring legitimate look at him.
Look at it.

3555
02:33:42,930 --> 02:33:45,150
That's what I'm saying.
I'm not lying.

3556
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:46,380
No,
I know he's shredded,

3557
02:33:46,381 --> 02:33:47,740
but you,
you compare her Wiz Khalifa,

3558
02:33:47,741 --> 02:33:49,810
these guys,
but you don't count.

3559
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,070
Stop.
Stop and give the man his propers.

3560
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:53,933
Let's see.
Wiz,

3561
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:55,180
Wiz Khalifa.
Show me that.

3562
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:56,940
Super.
No,

3563
02:33:56,941 --> 02:33:57,361
no,
no,

3564
02:33:57,361 --> 02:34:00,920
not like Wiz.
No wiz has muscles like thick ass on

3565
02:34:00,930 --> 02:34:03,540
that TV program.
I don't know.

3566
02:34:09,230 --> 02:34:10,210
Look it up.
Seriously.

3567
02:34:12,670 --> 02:34:16,080
Dow three pack,
but they're like jumbo,

3568
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:18,040
but they don't

3569
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,020
separate in the middle.
There's a solid,

3570
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:20,893
it's just,
um,

3571
02:34:20,970 --> 02:34:22,360
they just,
they're so dense.

3572
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:25,120
All he's doing is Moy Tai.
He does Moitai like crazy.

3573
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:28,780
Put on 30 pounds of weight.
Moitai do that to you.

3574
02:34:28,810 --> 02:34:30,370
Yeah.
You've got to go to the right Taco shop.

3575
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:33,980
He can to get them.
Fuck.

3576
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:38,080
Yeah,
but Gordon rides more impressive and

3577
02:34:38,081 --> 02:34:41,530
also Gorg Ryan is 200 and it doesn't
have to go chocolate body.

3578
02:34:41,650 --> 02:34:42,970
You can consider that.
That's true.

3579
02:34:43,380 --> 02:34:44,710
What does he weigh now?
Uh,

3580
02:34:44,711 --> 02:34:49,711
he's probably to 25 do you need do
something crazy and get two one 70 like

3581
02:34:50,980 --> 02:34:53,120
within a year or two ago?
Well,

3582
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:54,460
yeah,
he used to be.

3583
02:34:54,461 --> 02:34:56,680
He used to fight at one 70 that's
credentials.

3584
02:34:57,430 --> 02:35:01,480
He decided to bulk up how many picos all
of them.

3585
02:35:01,481 --> 02:35:02,800
It no killing it.
Who's testing?

3586
02:35:03,130 --> 02:35:06,960
Nobody's testing.
If we got Picos and your Usada,

3587
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:07,870
you're good.
Here's the thing.

3588
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:11,950
If you are a young guy and you're
indulging in various ways to enhance

3589
02:35:11,951 --> 02:35:15,490
your physical recovery and then you get
off of that stuff,

3590
02:35:15,491 --> 02:35:16,990
you're going to have an adaptation
period.

3591
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:21,340
And that adaptation period,
I mean this is an issue.

3592
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,690
It's,
hold on.

3593
02:35:22,691 --> 02:35:23,500
Why is it an issue,
Joe?

3594
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:24,790
It's not an issue.
Well,

3595
02:35:24,791 --> 02:35:26,920
the issue is your performance is going
to suffer.

3596
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:31,630
You're saying if you're getting off it,
if you're on it and you get off of it,

3597
02:35:31,890 --> 02:35:33,730
he's a young guy.
If he's on it,

3598
02:35:33,731 --> 02:35:35,500
we're assuming he's on,
which we don't know.

3599
02:35:35,530 --> 02:35:36,370
Gordon.
Yeah.

3600
02:35:36,550 --> 02:35:37,280
Oh,
I don't know.

3601
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,940
What would you say?
Just have phenomenal genetics.

3602
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:42,190
Okay.
All jokes aside,

3603
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:43,780
if you do find someone,
no,

3604
02:35:43,810 --> 02:35:45,100
not him.
Let's say someone else.

3605
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:48,280
Let's say he just has taken Jeanette,
someone else that does it.

3606
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:51,030
If they do do it and they're doing it in
an untested forum,

3607
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:52,780
like like submission,
grappling,

3608
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:53,110
correct.

3609
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:55,990
Which most you can get away with
whatever you want.

3610
02:35:55,991 --> 02:35:56,970
Correct.
Eddie Meyers,

3611
02:35:57,050 --> 02:36:01,060
speech outline,
generalists tests like in the speaking

3612
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:01,990
completely.
Honestly,

3613
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:05,590
we know for a fact that some competitors
are indulging.

3614
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:08,350
I don't know that.
Okay.

3615
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:08,911
Awesome.
Well,

3616
02:36:08,911 --> 02:36:12,320
all I'll say from I would say yes.
Okay.

3617
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:13,930
I'm sure some are.
Okay,

3618
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:16,460
well,
I'll just shoot it to,

3619
02:36:16,660 --> 02:36:18,830
we know for sure some are,
you know what?

3620
02:36:19,090 --> 02:36:23,830
Not accuse any individuals,
but we know for sure summer when when

3621
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:27,650
you do have that situation where someone
is on something and then they get off of

3622
02:36:27,651 --> 02:36:30,460
something,
then you have this adaptation period

3623
02:36:30,461 --> 02:36:32,500
where they're,
their body's not producing testosterone

3624
02:36:32,501 --> 02:36:33,760
as much anymore.
They're going to have to get on

3625
02:36:33,761 --> 02:36:35,500
something else in order to kickstart it
back up.

3626
02:36:35,770 --> 02:36:37,720
But you can do that.
He can do that.

3627
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:41,240
But here's the thing too,
you know with this John Jones thinking

3628
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:44,020
the Pico granting and he did test
positive now with Vata,

3629
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:44,560
right?

3630
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:47,740
And they still allow him to fight.
Well now let's say you are a Jujitsu guy

3631
02:36:47,741 --> 02:36:51,430
who comes to the UFC and you did do
stuff prior and those Pico,

3632
02:36:51,910 --> 02:36:54,250
Pico Graham's get flagged,
right?

3633
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,410
What'd he intends entirely on what
you're,

3634
02:36:56,470 --> 02:36:58,660
what you're doing,
it depends in tyler who you are.

3635
02:36:58,661 --> 02:36:59,740
Joe.
Well,

3636
02:36:59,741 --> 02:37:01,540
no,
with Usada it does not.

3637
02:37:01,690 --> 02:37:04,120
It depends entirely on what you're doing
now,

3638
02:37:04,121 --> 02:37:08,350
general terms here in terms of whether
or not you get punished twice for the

3639
02:37:08,351 --> 02:37:12,100
same crime.
So if they can prove exactly the same

3640
02:37:12,101 --> 02:37:14,170
way they approve with John the fuel,
one of the things is happening.

3641
02:37:14,171 --> 02:37:15,920
He said the testing is getting far
better

3642
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,970
so they can test you for stuff now that
a year ago was absolutely impossible for

3643
02:37:19,971 --> 02:37:22,770
sure.
So the threshold right now that they

3644
02:37:22,771 --> 02:37:24,440
were saying this is where it's confusing
to me.

3645
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:29,480
The threshold that they tested,
John was supposed to be more stringent

3646
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:31,370
than Vada.
Yes.

3647
02:37:31,371 --> 02:37:33,050
And then the,
the night of the fight,

3648
02:37:33,051 --> 02:37:36,410
this is where it gets weird to me.
The night of the fight to commission

3649
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:40,250
tested them all the same period,
same pice commission you,

3650
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:42,440
Sada and Vada all test them.
St Piss.

3651
02:37:42,770 --> 02:37:46,040
You soughted didn't report anything.
Commissioned report anything,

3652
02:37:46,070 --> 02:37:46,770
right?
Andy Foster,

3653
02:37:46,770 --> 02:37:48,980
you clear them to fight.
But then Vada did,

3654
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:51,350
does he found to have better testing?
Now it's all the same.

3655
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:55,330
So how's that possible?
So you think shenanigans with you side

3656
02:37:55,331 --> 02:37:56,920
of yes,
I think he's shiniest.

3657
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:58,040
Here's the other thing,
Joe.

3658
02:37:58,110 --> 02:38:03,110
Here's what no one talks about with you
Sada in the rule book,

3659
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,170
no matter if it's Picos,
whatever is,

3660
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:09,320
if you get flagged,
it doesn't matter if it's from residue,

3661
02:38:09,321 --> 02:38:11,960
whatever it is,
you cannot compete until that is out of

3662
02:38:11,961 --> 02:38:12,620
your body.

3663
02:38:12,620 --> 02:38:14,720
That's the rule book,
black and white.

3664
02:38:14,990 --> 02:38:16,270
It doesn't say,
well if it's Pico Graham,

3665
02:38:16,271 --> 02:38:17,990
just still good.
It doesn't matter.

3666
02:38:18,010 --> 02:38:19,340
Right?
But do you understand that he's not

3667
02:38:19,341 --> 02:38:21,400
testing positive for the actual
steroids?

3668
02:38:21,410 --> 02:38:22,243
Again,
that doesn't matter.

3669
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:24,620
That tablet in the rule book,
it doesn't say that.

3670
02:38:25,210 --> 02:38:28,800
It says if you test pop regardless,
what is your weekend?

3671
02:38:28,801 --> 02:38:31,700
I for the metastasis,
we cannot grant you the license to

3672
02:38:31,701 --> 02:38:33,770
compete.
Interesting.

3673
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:36,560
Which is interesting to me.
Well now I'm not saying they should.

3674
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,420
This is why they don't suspect this.
Why?

3675
02:38:38,421 --> 02:38:42,440
I honestly think why they're doing this,
because they don't know exactly how this

3676
02:38:42,441 --> 02:38:43,970
is happening.
I think they have their,

3677
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,950
their theories,
which you know,

3678
02:38:45,951 --> 02:38:48,890
it works right now,
but ultimately they don't really know

3679
02:38:48,891 --> 02:38:51,620
what's going on.
So if they were to suspend John and he's

3680
02:38:51,621 --> 02:38:53,480
really not taking shit,
he can sue the fuck out of him.

3681
02:38:53,660 --> 02:38:55,400
So I think that's what's going well.
There's that.

3682
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:57,830
And then there's also this concept of
double jeopardy that they've already

3683
02:38:57,831 --> 02:39:01,460
punished him for having this stuff in a
system is no indication that he has

3684
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:03,860
recently taken it.
But that's not the only hat,

3685
02:39:03,861 --> 02:39:04,580
Joe,
I understand.

3686
02:39:04,580 --> 02:39:06,170
But they're making the rules up as they
go along,

3687
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:08,900
which is an issue because if this was
corey Anderson,

3688
02:39:08,930 --> 02:39:11,660
phenomenal fighter,
not the same drawing powers.

3689
02:39:11,661 --> 02:39:13,030
John,
what happens at Galileo?

3690
02:39:13,130 --> 02:39:14,210
The words word,
the argument,

3691
02:39:14,230 --> 02:39:16,250
the evening,
if they're making it up as they go

3692
02:39:16,251 --> 02:39:17,870
along,
the parameters are changing.

3693
02:39:17,900 --> 02:39:20,330
So the ability to test things is
changing.

3694
02:39:20,331 --> 02:39:24,080
So if someone takes,
say you take creatine,

3695
02:39:24,110 --> 02:39:28,040
creatine is tainted and you'd have some
forbidden substance in your system and

3696
02:39:28,041 --> 02:39:31,370
it's supposed to only stay in your
system for six months if it's this

3697
02:39:31,371 --> 02:39:34,820
certain stuff,
but now the testing gets better and so

3698
02:39:34,821 --> 02:39:39,821
now instead of punishing you for
something that you accidentally took and

3699
02:39:40,371 --> 02:39:41,840
then they test you and they say,
oh,

3700
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:43,850
we can prove that you accidentally took
it,

3701
02:39:43,910 --> 02:39:45,710
so we'll only going to give you a six on
suspension,

3702
02:39:45,711 --> 02:39:48,140
but then after the six months is over,
they could still test it in you.

3703
02:39:48,410 --> 02:39:50,090
Why?
Because the testing has gotten better.

3704
02:39:50,250 --> 02:39:53,060
What do they do now?
Because in the past they would've said,

3705
02:39:53,061 --> 02:39:53,360
well,
you've,

3706
02:39:53,360 --> 02:39:54,680
you've,
it's time served.

3707
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:58,400
This is the only argument for the,
the John Jones thing that makes sense is

3708
02:39:58,401 --> 02:39:59,810
that you don't want,
you want,

3709
02:39:59,811 --> 02:40:02,870
you don't want to punish a guy for
something you've already punished him

3710
02:40:02,871 --> 02:40:05,180
for.
If you proven that it's,

3711
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:08,420
this is what he took with the,
but the at the rule book is it's you can

3712
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:12,130
only compete when you pass the tab.
You read this rule.

3713
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:13,230
Yes.
Yes.

3714
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:14,040
Um,

3715
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,750
yeah.
I did discussion this morning with me

3716
02:40:15,751 --> 02:40:18,600
and channel went back forth on texts.
How does shale feel about this?

3717
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:21,900
What does he think he shouldn't be
allowed to compete because his

3718
02:40:21,901 --> 02:40:24,150
understanding,
because still show no matter what you

3719
02:40:24,151 --> 02:40:25,310
meant to take it or not,
right,

3720
02:40:25,311 --> 02:40:25,700
right,
right.

3721
02:40:25,700 --> 02:40:30,150
The rule is if you do not pass the test,
we can't grant you're licensed to fight.

3722
02:40:30,270 --> 02:40:33,560
That is the rules as explained to most
all the fighters separate job.

3723
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:37,230
The real problem would be is what if
it's proven at some point in time,

3724
02:40:37,231 --> 02:40:40,080
let's just say a big for riff.
What if rather,

3725
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:43,770
what if it's proven one time that they
can tell if you've ever taken anything

3726
02:40:43,830 --> 02:40:47,670
ever your whole life and they just
disqualify anyone forever.

3727
02:40:47,671 --> 02:40:50,250
Even if he'd snatch bullshit task.
But if that happened,

3728
02:40:50,251 --> 02:40:51,990
I know it's a problem.
You won't have a sport.

3729
02:40:51,991 --> 02:40:53,160
This thing is a weird thing.

3730
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,660
This pulse,
here's the weird thing of the

3731
02:40:54,661 --> 02:40:56,090
metabolite.
They don't really understand.

3732
02:40:56,091 --> 02:40:57,480
Here's where it's weird.
It makes no sense.

3733
02:40:57,481 --> 02:41:00,240
With our youth thought of testing,
the Usada testing,

3734
02:41:00,241 --> 02:41:02,610
their parameters are based off a Olympic
testing,

3735
02:41:02,611 --> 02:41:04,950
right?
Based off suspending guys two to four

3736
02:41:04,951 --> 02:41:07,170
years.
You know how fucked up that is to do a

3737
02:41:07,171 --> 02:41:10,260
fighter like Josh Barnett that,
so how small is your window?

3738
02:41:10,261 --> 02:41:10,771
It's not,
we're not,

3739
02:41:10,771 --> 02:41:12,450
the Olympics doesn't come every four
years,

3740
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:13,590
right?
It's such a small window.

3741
02:41:13,591 --> 02:41:16,050
You suspend these guys for two to four
years,

3742
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:18,930
right?
It's fucking silly question.

3743
02:41:20,190 --> 02:41:24,150
But if a guy does juice and he hurts
someone and gets away with it and then

3744
02:41:24,151 --> 02:41:26,640
you catch them like you've been trying
to catch up and then you catch him,

3745
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:29,360
how much should you suspend them for?
Save.

3746
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:34,370
You got a guy who's hired some victor
content type individual back when victor

3747
02:41:34,471 --> 02:41:37,890
was doing this with the uh,
the clear and he some guy and this guy

3748
02:41:37,891 --> 02:41:41,070
gets him on some shit that no one knows
what it is and he's just running through

3749
02:41:41,071 --> 02:41:44,450
people and he's looking like Yoel Romero
and smashing people but,

3750
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:47,700
and everybody's like,
I don't buy it.

3751
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,710
Something's wrong.
And then one day you catch them,

3752
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,570
you spend for food.
So he shouldn't have a career ever

3753
02:41:51,571 --> 02:41:52,860
again.
I don't know what she does.

3754
02:41:52,890 --> 02:41:54,870
Not with years.
That's ridiculous.

3755
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:57,480
Cause we're going based off Olympic
curriculum.

3756
02:41:57,690 --> 02:42:00,270
What's the real question is like how
many people are cheating?

3757
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:02,460
Right.
And what should the punishment be?

3758
02:42:02,461 --> 02:42:05,520
Should it be based on how many people
are cheating or she'd be based on the

3759
02:42:05,521 --> 02:42:07,650
philosophy we're trying to get cheating
out of the sport.

3760
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:09,390
I don't know.
You ever can get it out.

3761
02:42:09,391 --> 02:42:11,530
And as you cited the answer,
cause obviously some shady,

3762
02:42:12,090 --> 02:42:16,740
do you wish,
do you wish that the Japanese were super

3763
02:42:16,741 --> 02:42:19,740
crazy strict about steroids back before
pride?

3764
02:42:19,890 --> 02:42:20,780
No.
No,

3765
02:42:20,910 --> 02:42:21,530
no,
no,

3766
02:42:21,530 --> 02:42:22,351
no.
As a fan,

3767
02:42:22,351 --> 02:42:24,600
no.
I think you saw as really wouldn't have

3768
02:42:24,601 --> 02:42:25,490
happened.
Right.

3769
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:30,600
So Anderson was making a point the other
day in a rational point for letting a

3770
02:42:30,601 --> 02:42:33,210
guy like him take something so that he
could recover.

3771
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:34,890
You know,
cause he's 40 years old,

3772
02:42:34,891 --> 02:42:36,840
he still enjoys fighting,
but his body doesn't produce

3773
02:42:36,841 --> 02:42:38,300
testosterone in the right way anymore.
Correct.

3774
02:42:38,310 --> 02:42:39,143
He's been trained.
He's beat.

3775
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:41,350
Whether you tried that for a while,
I remember they made that leap.

3776
02:42:41,430 --> 02:42:43,470
It was legal for awhile too,
are fucked it all up.

3777
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:47,210
And I know over even before they're like
got to pass over.

3778
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:51,290
He didn't have a testosterone use
exemption fee toward did he talk,

3779
02:42:51,300 --> 02:42:53,220
did it legitimately Dan Henderson deal
legitimate.

3780
02:42:53,320 --> 02:42:56,220
So a few other guys had hit a veto like
all right,

3781
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:01,280
well the
way it works,

3782
02:43:02,610 --> 02:43:04,080
it's way worse.
They don't test you.

3783
02:43:04,210 --> 02:43:05,043
No,
it was like,

3784
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:07,500
it was totally legal.
Just like insiders knew.

3785
02:43:07,710 --> 02:43:12,020
We knew where the key got it.
There was a guy in

3786
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:12,671
our gym,
they're like,

3787
02:43:12,671 --> 02:43:15,160
he got trt pass.
We're like fuck man.

3788
02:43:15,210 --> 02:43:18,460
Yeah.
Kind of a big name and had to be in with

3789
02:43:18,461 --> 02:43:19,770
Dana and Lorenzo.
Yeah.

3790
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:24,250
Like you can always be a guy.
Like what if they had like big veins on

3791
02:43:24,251 --> 02:43:27,280
their bicep and on their shoulder?
They had like that little spider vein.

3792
02:43:27,281 --> 02:43:28,061
You're like,
damn,

3793
02:43:28,061 --> 02:43:29,950
motherfuckers though.
We were so jealous.

3794
02:43:30,430 --> 02:43:32,280
I was like,
I want trt exam.

3795
02:43:32,290 --> 02:43:33,930
Get it.
Like you got to know someone at

3796
02:43:33,950 --> 02:43:36,880
[inaudible] to be fucking around.
But no one believed that.

3797
02:43:36,881 --> 02:43:38,530
It was like a conspiracy theory was
like,

3798
02:43:38,620 --> 02:43:39,910
no way.
They allow it.

3799
02:43:39,911 --> 02:43:40,391
He goes,
yeah,

3800
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:41,920
dude,
if you have a doctor's note,

3801
02:43:42,190 --> 02:43:44,410
you could fucking Dude Tiara and why
not?

3802
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:46,120
And no one would believe it.
It was like,

3803
02:43:46,150 --> 02:43:47,260
dude,
you're full of shit.

3804
02:43:47,700 --> 02:43:49,840
It was a tinfoil hat conspiracy.
Yeah.

3805
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:50,840
No,
no,

3806
02:43:50,890 --> 02:43:53,170
no.
I think the conspiracies all with Usada.

3807
02:43:54,330 --> 02:43:57,620
It just got exploited in,
everybody was tripping on that doctor's

3808
02:43:57,621 --> 02:43:58,480
note.
What trt.

3809
02:43:58,780 --> 02:43:59,770
Yeah.
Yeah,

3810
02:44:00,210 --> 02:44:02,290
and when they put us down for a while
there,

3811
02:44:02,350 --> 02:44:04,060
it was fucking legal.
Sure was.

3812
02:44:04,090 --> 02:44:07,090
How crazy and it was awesome.
He had a doctor's note,

3813
02:44:07,150 --> 02:44:10,210
but it was awesome.
And now it's too strict and it's fucking

3814
02:44:10,211 --> 02:44:10,861
things.
I'm guys,

3815
02:44:10,861 --> 02:44:12,280
I have to do other shit and they're
getting caught.

3816
02:44:12,310 --> 02:44:15,190
How would,
how would you like it if you got to be

3817
02:44:15,191 --> 02:44:20,191
the president of MMA and you saw to kick
rocks?

3818
02:44:21,101 --> 02:44:24,100
It's just making it more complicated.
We'll put the money elsewhere.

3819
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:26,470
It's honestly not.
What do you do about steroid testing?

3820
02:44:26,650 --> 02:44:28,170
You just don't of do it.
How Bell Tory.

3821
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:30,010
Yeah.
How does Bela Tarr do it?

3822
02:44:30,220 --> 02:44:34,270
Just has the commission do it.
So basically means yes,

3823
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:36,310
you gotta be a moron to get caught by
the commission.

3824
02:44:36,311 --> 02:44:38,800
So if you're going to do shit,
wait a minute,

3825
02:44:38,801 --> 02:44:43,600
I didn't know if there wasn't a Usada
and state would have their own,

3826
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:47,040
the commission would be responsible for
it.

3827
02:44:47,050 --> 02:44:48,580
Correct.
And what is it?

3828
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:49,900
They just don't know how to do them
right.

3829
02:44:50,200 --> 02:44:52,240
They don't do it as strict.
You get tested,

3830
02:44:52,270 --> 02:44:53,650
you know,
they don't do it weeks before.

3831
02:44:53,651 --> 02:44:55,780
They don't come randomly.
You get tests that,

3832
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:58,090
you know when you weigh in or the day of
the fight in the,

3833
02:44:58,091 --> 02:44:59,470
after the fight.
And so what if,

3834
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:02,230
what if fighters used to do,
they could get it out of your tasting

3835
02:45:02,270 --> 02:45:02,950
off.
Yeah.

3836
02:45:02,950 --> 02:45:03,581
Oh,
reward.

3837
02:45:03,581 --> 02:45:07,840
But there are certain states like la or
New Jersey was super strict.

3838
02:45:07,841 --> 02:45:08,710
So guys,
I chill.

3839
02:45:08,711 --> 02:45:10,570
Sony Dot.
Cotton California.

3840
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,620
Oh,
I dunno who Keith.

3841
02:45:13,730 --> 02:45:15,950
Keith Thurman.
He fought tonight on Fox.

3842
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:19,780
It should be all it started at six.
Maybe not.

3843
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:22,210
Maybe there's some fights on before it.
There was,

3844
02:45:22,211 --> 02:45:24,130
but it's not.
It's midnight on the east coast.

3845
02:45:24,170 --> 02:45:25,210
Foxes done.
So,

3846
02:45:25,660 --> 02:45:27,610
um,
see Keith Thurman?

3847
02:45:27,970 --> 02:45:29,050
It is.
I'll check.

3848
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:33,000
Was It on Fox?
So what it was,

3849
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:34,490
what was it?
ESPN sober.

3850
02:45:34,760 --> 02:45:35,593
Who won?

3851
02:45:36,190 --> 02:45:36,690
Yeah.

3852
02:45:36,690 --> 02:45:38,570
Tryna fine.
What'd you guys talk about?

3853
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:40,430
Japanese sweet.
Did your boys back tonight?

3854
02:45:40,610 --> 02:45:41,220
Oh,
won.

3855
02:45:41,220 --> 02:45:41,781
Oh,
hold on,

3856
02:45:41,781 --> 02:45:44,510
hold on.
I know Keith tweeted that.

3857
02:45:44,630 --> 02:45:46,910
Yeah.
Retains title fight for him for God

3858
02:45:46,911 --> 02:45:48,050
sakes.
And everyone to see him.

3859
02:45:48,051 --> 02:45:51,380
Verse Earl Spence.
But it'll spend spiky Brendan,

3860
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:54,620
if he was the king or the president of
MMA,

3861
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:57,080
how would he,
what would he do about the steroids

3862
02:45:57,081 --> 02:45:58,910
situation?
And he said he would get rid of Usada

3863
02:45:59,030 --> 02:46:01,070
correct.
And then words and then have the

3864
02:46:01,071 --> 02:46:04,130
commission see in her that the
commission test,

3865
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:06,270
which basically means that,
uh,

3866
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:09,040
all you gotta do is just be,
you know,

3867
02:46:09,380 --> 02:46:10,010
it's a stupid,

3868
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,530
he careful you're still going to do
shit,

3869
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:15,860
but none of the fight you're clean night
of the fight,

3870
02:46:16,350 --> 02:46:20,960
the fight that well when dad pay a clean
from a piss test.

3871
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:22,580
Oh okay.
I I think,

3872
02:46:22,581 --> 02:46:26,570
I think is that how they used to do it?
Well that's how they did it when I

3873
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:28,100
fought,
when alice or fought brock,

3874
02:46:28,101 --> 02:46:29,680
he was clean,
you know,

3875
02:46:29,700 --> 02:46:32,750
he tested clean cause it was a very
simple urine test.

3876
02:46:32,751 --> 02:46:36,350
It was like quest labs type shit.
You got a job at ups and I'm checking

3877
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:41,410
you from mushrooms.
The commission do

3878
02:46:45,090 --> 02:46:46,760
Spanish.
That's how Bellah toward does it.

3879
02:46:46,761 --> 02:46:47,551
They just,
it's a belt.

3880
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:49,220
You just don't really,
let me ask you this.

3881
02:46:50,090 --> 02:46:52,730
Did anybody ever approached you and
said,

3882
02:46:52,731 --> 02:46:53,930
hey man,
I think we can,

3883
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:55,310
uh,
we can get you on some stuff.

3884
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:56,300
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah,

3885
02:46:56,301 --> 02:46:56,880
for sure.
They say,

3886
02:46:56,880 --> 02:46:57,713
how did they say it?

3887
02:46:57,980 --> 02:47:00,630
Uh,
it was like locker room talk like a,

3888
02:47:00,631 --> 02:47:01,041
they're like,
Yo,

3889
02:47:01,041 --> 02:47:02,210
I got this guy,
dude,

3890
02:47:02,211 --> 02:47:03,290
he's great.
He does this,

3891
02:47:03,291 --> 02:47:03,860
this,
this.

3892
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:05,470
I can afford it at the fire.
Yeah.

3893
02:47:05,780 --> 02:47:08,360
That's how it starts with a yeah.
Or a coach would,

3894
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,171
we'd be like,
hey man,

3895
02:47:09,171 --> 02:47:10,160
you know you could do this.
This,

3896
02:47:10,250 --> 02:47:12,140
I can afford it though.
How much are they talking?

3897
02:47:12,870 --> 02:47:14,720
Uh,
I dunno cause they were going through

3898
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:19,670
like a doctor and I just remember herr
doctor.

3899
02:47:19,671 --> 02:47:22,100
I don't think he's still in business and
uh,

3900
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:24,010
I remember that.
Like your insurance won't it.

3901
02:47:24,011 --> 02:47:26,130
So you got paid cash.
I remember her ass and I met at the

3902
02:47:26,131 --> 02:47:26,481
time.
I was like,

3903
02:47:26,481 --> 02:47:27,830
Oh fuck,
that's a car payment man.

3904
02:47:27,831 --> 02:47:29,660
There's no way I couldn't do it.
Oh,

3905
02:47:29,661 --> 02:47:31,280
what I've done it probably,
yeah,

3906
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,740
probably a short window.
Man.

3907
02:47:35,090 --> 02:47:37,590
Bob Sapp is up to lately.
It's a good question.

3908
02:47:37,590 --> 02:47:41,520
It's a fucking girls in Japan.
He's on weedy boxes and dressing up as

3909
02:47:41,540 --> 02:47:43,880
scouts to the,
had a real problem in Japan.

3910
02:47:43,881 --> 02:47:46,070
He know he had to leave.
Oh for the,

3911
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:50,540
you'll get a k one fight and they
wouldn't let him sign a contract before

3912
02:47:50,541 --> 02:47:51,171
he fought.
He's like,

3913
02:47:51,171 --> 02:47:53,450
I'm not fighting without a contract.
And they said,

3914
02:47:53,451 --> 02:47:54,950
first you fight,
then we give you a contract.

3915
02:47:54,951 --> 02:47:58,970
And it was just like,
so he walked out on the finals and it

3916
02:47:58,971 --> 02:48:03,380
was the end of him.
Bob Sapp would become a huge star in

3917
02:48:03,381 --> 02:48:05,180
Japan and I don't think he'd do in
America.

3918
02:48:05,181 --> 02:48:07,190
Completely understood.
I mean he was like,

3919
02:48:07,210 --> 02:48:10,340
he was on literally cereal boxes,
big billboards.

3920
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:13,970
He had fucking figurines made up of,
I mean he's like,

3921
02:48:14,030 --> 02:48:17,390
what is a comparable celebrity in the
United States?

3922
02:48:18,070 --> 02:48:20,430
So super athlete maybe,
you know,

3923
02:48:20,431 --> 02:48:22,040
like who would be big right now?

3924
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:27,280
He was so big and he was such an oddity
because he was literally 370 pounds with

3925
02:48:27,411 --> 02:48:30,290
after seeing not those little Japanese
girls just sucking them on.

3926
02:48:30,380 --> 02:48:32,870
Good luck.
It luck God.

3927
02:48:33,010 --> 02:48:34,580
And he probably,
yeah.

3928
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:36,100
Oh Dude.
He,

3929
02:48:36,230 --> 02:48:41,230
you imagine,
I remember the fiesta who's twice sketch

3930
02:48:43,491 --> 02:48:47,600
that we wrote design it.
We wrote it as look at him.

3931
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:50,930
So he's still fighting this.
There's a couple of years ago.

3932
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:53,630
Yeah.
If he,

3933
02:48:53,650 --> 02:48:55,080
if he's doing well,
he was a pro.

3934
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:56,790
He was a prom,
but it's still looks big.

3935
02:48:56,980 --> 02:48:59,900
He's still giant is giant again.
Does he tap from mount?

3936
02:49:00,110 --> 02:49:01,210
No,
I think he'd be was,

3937
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:06,380
he was always a little bit of a damn.
He's got a belly.

3938
02:49:06,990 --> 02:49:09,560
But dude,
when fought Noguera he was about his

3939
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:14,280
fucking scary as a guy.
Do you have that guys in shape that he's

3940
02:49:14,281 --> 02:49:17,110
fighting?
He almost broke no gears back to the

3941
02:49:17,111 --> 02:49:18,480
land and I'm on his head.

3942
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:20,110
Remember that pile driver?
Yeah.

3943
02:49:20,690 --> 02:49:22,600
Gear up for a long time.
Yeah.

3944
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:23,730
For Life.
He,

3945
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:25,050
I see so fucked up from it.
Yeah.

3946
02:49:25,051 --> 02:49:27,980
He really hit some problems.
That's Christine's through on,

3947
02:49:27,990 --> 02:49:30,570
I mean,
Bob Sapp was so big,

3948
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:33,060
so ginormous.
Such a nightmare.

3949
02:49:33,061 --> 02:49:36,420
Like what do you do with that?
And because he was on everything,

3950
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:41,430
his fucking cardio wasn't the worst,
that best fighter's heart.

3951
02:49:41,460 --> 02:49:45,090
But he's just such fucking silence.
Yeah.

3952
02:49:45,091 --> 02:49:46,110
Where,
yeah.

3953
02:49:46,260 --> 02:49:48,240
But if the fight went for a long time,
yeah.

3954
02:49:48,241 --> 02:49:50,480
That was an issue.
He didn't fight it for a while.

3955
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:51,310
Well,
you know,

3956
02:49:51,310 --> 02:49:53,460
and after a while he took a bunch of
beatings and he's like,

3957
02:49:53,461 --> 02:49:54,630
gets it good.
That's enough.

3958
02:49:54,790 --> 02:49:56,160
Go back to the truck.
I'm broke.

3959
02:49:56,170 --> 02:49:58,110
His eyeball,
Cro,

3960
02:49:58,111 --> 02:50:00,540
cop smashes eyeball.
I remember when I was opening more than

3961
02:50:00,541 --> 02:50:03,540
the other.
I was cause they get that orbital is

3962
02:50:03,541 --> 02:50:04,380
fucked man.

3963
02:50:04,770 --> 02:50:09,330
When people get their orbital smashed,
almost always like anything more behind

3964
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:11,580
one I began,
I call it the sniper.

3965
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:14,180
You don't want the fucking one I bigger
than the other.

3966
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:16,160
The other one bigger?
I don't think so.

3967
02:50:17,370 --> 02:50:19,830
Is there surgeries?
Tell him to go in there and fucking

3968
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:22,410
straighten out that eyeball.
Don't want the sniper bro.

3969
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:24,870
Yeah,
I thought that was the oh Vaughn for a

3970
02:50:24,871 --> 02:50:26,070
second.
That's up.

3971
02:50:26,071 --> 02:50:27,330
Gender liquid.
Your hair cut,

3972
02:50:27,331 --> 02:50:28,830
son.
Gender neutral.

3973
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:32,700
You don't know what I am.
That's Marky mark ironing clothes.

3974
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:34,380
Oh this is for brothers.
Good movie.

3975
02:50:34,890 --> 02:50:39,180
All adopted mom gets murdered and they
have to avenge her death in Detroit,

3976
02:50:39,181 --> 02:50:40,800
Michigan.
I remember this movie.

3977
02:50:41,960 --> 02:50:44,980
You're like,
I am DB that did I know my database.

3978
02:50:45,690 --> 02:50:48,630
It's useless.
I get nineties references for four days.

3979
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:52,050
So we wrapped this pitch up.
So I think so man Pinto around me out

3980
02:50:52,310 --> 02:50:54,600
fade or it didn't bum me out.

3981
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:57,010
I mean the fucking sucks for him for
sure.

3982
02:50:57,030 --> 02:51:00,900
Suck them off so hard before that fight.
But for corrals it's a great thing.

3983
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,000
And for,
for martial arts,

3984
02:51:03,001 --> 02:51:06,930
when something like that happens,
every young fighter gets another little

3985
02:51:06,931 --> 02:51:11,370
piece of information in his database of
experiences that he can at least view,

3986
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:14,670
maybe not have,
but view and put that in your mind.

3987
02:51:14,700 --> 02:51:16,740
Okay,
this is what happens when you throw

3988
02:51:16,741 --> 02:51:19,650
caution to the wind and you just slug it
out with somebody.

3989
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:22,170
When you just slug it out,
you stand right in front of somebody.

3990
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:25,470
Sometimes you get knocked out to bad
idea and you know,

3991
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:28,710
I mean he was winning the fight.
Up until that moment he'd cracked the

3992
02:51:28,711 --> 02:51:29,610
guys,
he had hurt him,

3993
02:51:29,611 --> 02:51:32,760
he looked amazing and then boom,
he's standing.

3994
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:35,580
I mean he's so good,
but he's still human.

3995
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:39,180
And that's just the reality of being a
human being that's fighting and I'm

3996
02:51:39,181 --> 02:51:41,190
bummed out.
Yeah,

3997
02:51:41,370 --> 02:51:42,510
I get it.
Cause you know the guy,

3998
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:44,150
I get it.
Um,

3999
02:51:45,090 --> 02:51:48,870
I can't say that I think those,
those experiences,

4000
02:51:48,871 --> 02:51:50,700
it's not good for him.
Right.

4001
02:51:50,701 --> 02:51:53,220
Cause it happened again,
getting knocked down for anybody got

4002
02:51:53,221 --> 02:51:54,670
hurt bad.
But it's,

4003
02:51:54,671 --> 02:51:59,671
it's valuable for all of us to take in.
What happens when,

4004
02:52:00,270 --> 02:52:01,103
you know,
look,

4005
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:03,510
every time I got gets knocked out,
believe it or not,

4006
02:52:03,511 --> 02:52:05,980
it's valuable for the overall database
of martial

4007
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:06,813
arts.
Yeah.

4008
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:12,090
Even a striker Mirko Cro cop has decided
on at least two fights,

4009
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:15,820
I think,
where he decided,

4010
02:52:15,821 --> 02:52:18,160
you know what?
I think I have a better shot taken this

4011
02:52:18,161 --> 02:52:19,390
motherfucker down.
Sure.

4012
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:22,700
And throwing elbows on the ground from
the Taco Taco.

4013
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:25,210
You know what I mean?
That was like a strategy that he

4014
02:52:25,211 --> 02:52:26,044
thought,
you know what,

4015
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:29,080
I'm getting clipped every now and then.
It's like Russian roulette.

4016
02:52:29,230 --> 02:52:31,450
Even he's one of the greatest strikers
of all time,

4017
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:33,580
one of the most dangerous motherfuckers
out there.

4018
02:52:33,730 --> 02:52:36,280
And he even got to the point where he
was like,

4019
02:52:36,430 --> 02:52:38,470
you know what?
I think I'll have a better shot taking

4020
02:52:38,471 --> 02:52:42,160
this motherfucker down and smashed them.
Even vandelay Silva did that once or

4021
02:52:42,161 --> 02:52:42,994
twice.
Sure.

4022
02:52:43,470 --> 02:52:47,520
You remember when cro cop fought random
and random and chaotic and random mom

4023
02:52:47,521 --> 02:52:50,410
was known as more of a wrestler,
but you know,

4024
02:52:50,590 --> 02:52:52,110
he's a fucking stud athlete.

4025
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:55,570
Literally.
It's the best sport.

4026
02:52:55,810 --> 02:52:57,820
Well,
it's certainly the craziest to watch me

4027
02:52:57,821 --> 02:52:58,720
with.
Pico got knocked out.

4028
02:52:58,721 --> 02:53:00,640
We all jumped out of our chairs.
I fell on the ground.

4029
02:53:00,670 --> 02:53:03,820
We all walked around on the ground.
I believe.

4030
02:53:04,730 --> 02:53:06,700
It's crazy.
It's a crazy fucking sport,

4031
02:53:06,701 --> 02:53:08,200
man.
A crazy sport.

4032
02:53:08,730 --> 02:53:10,630
You know?
How crazy is it that we all work in it

4033
02:53:10,631 --> 02:53:11,560
somehow?
Like what happened?

4034
02:53:11,561 --> 02:53:15,610
They're like,
my family is fucking still confused.

4035
02:53:16,920 --> 02:53:21,730
How the fuck is anybody paying you tie
how to fight?

4036
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:23,830
I Dunno.
I'm pulling it off.

4037
02:53:23,831 --> 02:53:25,300
It's weird.
My family does not,

4038
02:53:25,320 --> 02:53:28,720
does not.
I left my family as a musician,

4039
02:53:28,810 --> 02:53:32,650
not theirs as a pussy who never got into
any fights.

4040
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:36,100
I got in a couple of fights,
but I wasn't known as a fighter.

4041
02:53:36,190 --> 02:53:36,980
Right.
You know what I mean?

4042
02:53:36,980 --> 02:53:39,260
I,
I wrestled a couple of years so I

4043
02:53:39,280 --> 02:53:41,920
thought I was cheating when I would find
I would just double legged d dude and

4044
02:53:41,921 --> 02:53:44,300
punch him in the stomach until the
teacher broke it up tight.

4045
02:53:44,350 --> 02:53:49,350
But I was never ever considered a
dangerous guy at all by my family,

4046
02:53:49,690 --> 02:53:52,780
by my closest friends that I grew up.
So even today they're like,

4047
02:53:52,781 --> 02:53:53,950
they still like,
man.

4048
02:53:53,951 --> 02:53:56,900
How did you pull that off dude?
Like what the fuck?

4049
02:53:56,910 --> 02:53:57,491
I'm like,
dude,

4050
02:53:57,491 --> 02:53:59,110
I don't know.
I got lucky.

4051
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:03,610
You paid attention to it.
You know I got fucking lucky.

4052
02:54:03,630 --> 02:54:07,900
Good pat though because it shows
everybody that if you really just learn

4053
02:54:07,901 --> 02:54:09,760
something,
you get good at it.

4054
02:54:09,790 --> 02:54:12,850
You keep getting better at it.
You keep acquiring information,

4055
02:54:12,851 --> 02:54:15,460
testing yourself,
really being obsessed with it.

4056
02:54:15,490 --> 02:54:18,700
You eventually,
one day after years of training,

4057
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:22,810
you become a fucking wizard at it.
Whatever it is in comparison to how you

4058
02:54:22,811 --> 02:54:25,420
were when you first started.
It doesn't matter what you do,

4059
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:28,750
like stand up like you,
you doing standup to your dude.

4060
02:54:28,751 --> 02:54:32,230
You did two years in,
you did a fucking showtime special.

4061
02:54:32,230 --> 02:54:34,420
Me and Brian were in the back room.
We were shaking our head.

4062
02:54:34,421 --> 02:54:37,520
He's like two years anyway.
That's incredible.

4063
02:54:37,630 --> 02:54:40,390
But you put in the fucking work,
you started out,

4064
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:42,820
you were uncomfortable at first.
She got better and better.

4065
02:54:42,821 --> 02:54:45,100
You kept working on it.
He chipped away at it.

4066
02:54:45,101 --> 02:54:47,710
You were constantly,
constantly doing sets,

4067
02:54:47,711 --> 02:54:50,590
constantly going over your material and
you pulled it off.

4068
02:54:50,650 --> 02:54:53,570
Got The nma work ethic with comedy.
Yes,

4069
02:54:53,670 --> 02:54:57,120
and it pro athlete f work ethic,
but it's,

4070
02:54:57,220 --> 02:54:59,650
it's that thing.
It's good for people to see.

4071
02:54:59,890 --> 02:55:02,320
I know it feels bad if you're not doing
anything in your life.

4072
02:55:02,321 --> 02:55:04,190
And I was one of the things that people
do when they hate,

4073
02:55:04,460 --> 02:55:05,660
once these two people do,
when they hate,

4074
02:55:05,661 --> 02:55:08,660
like if you're kicking ass,
they get upset because they're not and

4075
02:55:08,690 --> 02:55:11,180
they're looking at you like you're not
that good or you're not that this.

4076
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:14,420
You'd have to,
sometimes those criticisms are valid,

4077
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:17,210
but at the end of the day,
the reason why they're expressing them

4078
02:55:17,211 --> 02:55:19,970
as a,
as exuberantly as they are is because

4079
02:55:19,971 --> 02:55:23,330
they're find flaws in their own life
that they don't like to address.

4080
02:55:23,510 --> 02:55:25,010
And when they see someone that's doing
well,

4081
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:26,530
they,
they go after them.

4082
02:55:26,570 --> 02:55:30,260
They shit on what I'm trying to say.
It's natural.

4083
02:55:30,261 --> 02:55:31,280
It is an incident.
Natural.

4084
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:34,190
I'm not,
what I'm trying to say though is for all

4085
02:55:34,191 --> 02:55:37,910
those people,
if you just stop putting any energy into

4086
02:55:37,911 --> 02:55:40,040
that stock,
it doesn't help you.

4087
02:55:40,041 --> 02:55:42,050
I've done it before.
I did it when I was younger.

4088
02:55:42,051 --> 02:55:44,870
I 100% guilty of what I'm saying,
but it's a waste.

4089
02:55:44,900 --> 02:55:48,110
It's a giant waste of time.
If you just get better at stuff,

4090
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:49,730
just find a thing,
whatever.

4091
02:55:49,731 --> 02:55:52,760
That if can see too,
if it's stand up comedy or whatever it

4092
02:55:52,761 --> 02:55:55,100
is,
just find that thing and keep going.

4093
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:57,290
Just keep going.
My fave trade or getting better.

4094
02:55:57,320 --> 02:55:59,480
My favorite is when people go rogue and
righteous shit.

4095
02:55:59,481 --> 02:56:00,120
I'm like,
yeah,

4096
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:01,310
yeah.
Rhoden wrote the hour from me.

4097
02:56:01,460 --> 02:56:02,660
Yeah,
that's exactly what he did.

4098
02:56:03,580 --> 02:56:05,100
I had the time to do that.
Yeah.

4099
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:07,070
I'm barely,
that's my own comedy.

4100
02:56:07,310 --> 02:56:09,390
He's given my perspective and he's
writing it.

4101
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:12,530
You fucking bad to stare.
That is impossible.

4102
02:56:12,690 --> 02:56:15,230
Impossible comedy doesn't work that
well.

4103
02:56:15,231 --> 02:56:17,790
You know who did do that though?
For a lot of guys will definitely do

4104
02:56:17,791 --> 02:56:20,150
that for Chris Rock was Richard Jeni,
Richard,

4105
02:56:20,151 --> 02:56:23,020
Jenny would tighten up dudes material.
He,

4106
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:24,770
you would punch it up.
Yeah,

4107
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:28,100
you would go do sets and he would sit in
the back of the room and he'd watch it.

4108
02:56:28,101 --> 02:56:29,090
But Hey,
you've got to drop that.

4109
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:30,500
You've got to drop that to get rid of
that.

4110
02:56:30,770 --> 02:56:34,370
Just started with this and go into that
and he would give you this and guys are

4111
02:56:34,371 --> 02:56:34,940
just listened to it.

4112
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:38,390
It's kind of cool like a cut.
Like some guys have done that,

4113
02:56:38,391 --> 02:56:40,850
you know,
crusher where like I,

4114
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:44,660
I told him my story and he's like you,
but he doesn't say do this.

4115
02:56:44,661 --> 02:56:45,580
He'd go,
you're,

4116
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:46,790
you're,
it's too long here.

4117
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:47,420
Right,
right,

4118
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:49,490
right.
Focused on this and do this.

4119
02:56:49,850 --> 02:56:54,230
They meaning like focus on all the time
on this back when I did,

4120
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:55,500
uh,
the,

4121
02:56:55,610 --> 02:56:58,100
those few open mics,
like 15 years ago,

4122
02:56:58,101 --> 02:57:03,050
I remember I bombed so bad,
this one set and the r that you just

4123
02:57:03,051 --> 02:57:05,900
grabbed me and said,
follow me and you just drag me to the

4124
02:57:05,901 --> 02:57:06,900
back.
I had to tell you,

4125
02:57:07,570 --> 02:57:10,220
I'm to tell you,
so I was high and I had to tell you why

4126
02:57:10,221 --> 02:57:11,720
it was because when you're high like
thoughts,

4127
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:14,930
they're slippery.
So mad not mad at you.

4128
02:57:14,931 --> 02:57:16,830
I was never mad at you.
I was never mad at you.

4129
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:18,541
No,
no,

4130
02:57:18,541 --> 02:57:19,640
no.
I was not disappointed.

4131
02:57:19,641 --> 02:57:21,410
But I recognize what that was.
Cause I had done it.

4132
02:57:21,650 --> 02:57:23,120
I've done it before.
You went in there,

4133
02:57:23,121 --> 02:57:25,310
it didn't go well and then you just
crashed and burned.

4134
02:57:25,990 --> 02:57:28,130
But what happened with you,
which is interesting,

4135
02:57:28,131 --> 02:57:30,890
is you got really good at talking
publicly.

4136
02:57:31,190 --> 02:57:34,220
And as you got better at talking
publicly and doing classes and teaching

4137
02:57:34,221 --> 02:57:36,140
classes,
then a transition back to,

4138
02:57:36,340 --> 02:57:38,600
to,
to stand up comedy actually made sense

4139
02:57:38,870 --> 02:57:42,080
because now you weren't nervous at all
because before you were always really

4140
02:57:42,081 --> 02:57:44,690
funny.
But the hard part was you being yourself

4141
02:57:44,810 --> 02:57:46,680
on stage.
And that's uh,

4142
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:48,020
it's hard.
It's still,

4143
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:51,470
and I had no public speaking experience.
That's huge.

4144
02:57:51,710 --> 02:57:54,080
I mean,
it's going to be rose zero public

4145
02:57:54,081 --> 02:57:56,840
speaking experience.
And I knew it and I thought,

4146
02:57:56,841 --> 02:57:59,540
you know what?
I'm going to have to really spend a lot

4147
02:57:59,541 --> 02:58:01,220
of fucking time,
uh,

4148
02:58:01,470 --> 02:58:02,970
with this if I'm going to do it right.

4149
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:04,770
And I just didn't want to spend the
time,

4150
02:58:04,771 --> 02:58:05,730
so I decided,
you know what,

4151
02:58:05,731 --> 02:58:07,470
I can do it.
Let me just focus on Jujitsu.

4152
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:08,161
You know,
he could do,

4153
02:58:08,161 --> 02:58:09,390
if you could,
if someone,

4154
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:14,450
someone's going to do it eventually,
but if you could get joey diaz to for

4155
02:58:14,591 --> 02:58:14,871
it,
the,

4156
02:58:14,871 --> 02:58:19,080
his comedy to come off on a special,
like the same way he had all of us in

4157
02:58:19,081 --> 02:58:21,180
the back of the comedy store.
I'm doing some of that story.

4158
02:58:21,330 --> 02:58:22,660
I'll tell you after the show.
I'm town,

4159
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:24,860
Dude.
I'll tell you after the show my,

4160
02:58:25,180 --> 02:58:27,120
I thought I broke my rib the next
morning.

4161
02:58:27,121 --> 02:58:29,010
I was laughing so hard.
I was in tears.

4162
02:58:29,180 --> 02:58:30,030
Yeah,
we have a plan.

4163
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:34,470
My rebuttal was Ari and I were literally
just texting right before the show

4164
02:58:34,471 --> 02:58:36,150
started.
And that's kind of watches Netflix

4165
02:58:36,151 --> 02:58:37,500
special and not that anything's wrong
with,

4166
02:58:37,501 --> 02:58:38,760
he's still a fucking monster.

4167
02:58:38,910 --> 02:58:42,880
But if you could capture that man,
get that game over best in the world,

4168
02:58:42,910 --> 02:58:45,330
those netflix specials,
what they're doing is a half an hour set

4169
02:58:45,331 --> 02:58:47,340
they're doing with a bunch of other
people that they probably don't work

4170
02:58:47,341 --> 02:58:50,130
with a lot and they have two shots.
They have the first show and then they

4171
02:58:50,131 --> 02:58:53,190
have second show and sometimes it
doesn't work out as well.

4172
02:58:53,220 --> 02:58:54,990
It's hard.
You're under pressure.

4173
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:57,390
It feels weird.
You're not used to the crab.

4174
02:58:57,391 --> 02:58:59,940
Maybe the,
the audience's lit up in a weird way.

4175
02:58:59,970 --> 02:59:03,570
It also gets lost in the shuffle though,
cause there's a ton of them on there.

4176
02:59:03,571 --> 02:59:04,830
You know what I'm saying?
Like Joey,

4177
02:59:04,950 --> 02:59:06,950
he's in with a bunch of other guys.
You,

4178
02:59:06,951 --> 02:59:09,690
you can't fault that because the ones
that stand out,

4179
02:59:09,691 --> 02:59:11,520
I mean look at whether you like it or
not.

4180
02:59:11,521 --> 02:59:14,610
Like a,
that Nanette thing from Hannah Gatsby.

4181
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:17,160
I still haven't seen it,
but I know what stood out in a lot of

4182
02:59:17,161 --> 02:59:19,050
people liked it or not though.
Right,

4183
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:20,520
okay.
But there was other ones that didn't

4184
02:59:20,521 --> 02:59:22,680
stand out for that,
but they stood out because people really

4185
02:59:22,681 --> 02:59:23,930
responded to it.
Tom,

4186
02:59:23,931 --> 02:59:26,280
yours,
I mean tom selling out these places

4187
02:59:26,281 --> 02:59:28,600
because people responded so well to his
special.

4188
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:29,340
Oh No,
no,

4189
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:29,980
I'm not sitting.
No,

4190
02:59:29,980 --> 02:59:31,090
Netflix is amazing.
I'm not saying,

4191
02:59:31,110 --> 02:59:33,660
I'm saying how his was released in
degenerates.

4192
02:59:33,690 --> 02:59:36,660
There's eight 30 minutes.
It's a package,

4193
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:41,200
so it doesn't matter.
It really doesn't give us a lot about

4194
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:44,160
Neal Brennan special from people that
watch three months while he was on

4195
02:59:44,161 --> 02:59:44,994
there.
That's right.

4196
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:46,200
Comedians in the world.

4197
02:59:48,590 --> 02:59:50,930
Brendan's event set.
Neil Brennan Ready.

4198
02:59:51,870 --> 02:59:54,000
I want to say anything about his new
stuff because they'll give away the

4199
02:59:54,001 --> 02:59:55,640
premises,
but he's murdered that he's,

4200
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:58,530
I'm not super impressed with Neal
Brennan.

4201
02:59:58,570 --> 02:59:59,311
I was like,
Whoa,

4202
02:59:59,311 --> 03:00:00,510
this is the funniest I've ever heard
him.

4203
03:00:00,750 --> 03:00:01,561
I love that.
Oh,

4204
03:00:01,561 --> 03:00:04,020
he's a,
he's very good.

4205
03:00:04,050 --> 03:00:06,330
He's definitely the best one I've seen
so far on that,

4206
03:00:06,480 --> 03:00:08,310
on that speech.
He's very smart man.

4207
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:10,620
He's very smart and his new stuff is
excellent.

4208
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:13,490
She has isis,
his analogy of Isis,

4209
03:00:14,310 --> 03:00:15,120
don't say it,
but yeah.

4210
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:15,953
Yeah.
So good.

4211
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:18,480
He punches up a lot of people.
Your favorite comedians?

4212
03:00:18,481 --> 03:00:19,530
Shit.
He punches up.

4213
03:00:19,710 --> 03:00:21,150
Yes.
Ellen's rock.

4214
03:00:21,151 --> 03:00:25,550
Chris Rock's Whitney.
He was Dave Chappelle's writing partner

4215
03:00:26,010 --> 03:00:27,050
for the Chapelle show.
Yeah,

4216
03:00:27,550 --> 03:00:28,920
that was back when we were friends with
him.

4217
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:31,560
He hadn't even done stand up yet.
Remember that when we hung out with them

4218
03:00:31,561 --> 03:00:33,900
in New York and he came with me when I
did,

4219
03:00:33,901 --> 03:00:35,310
uh,
the fear factor,

4220
03:00:35,311 --> 03:00:38,910
Chappelle sketch,
we did a weird ass warehouse.

4221
03:00:39,630 --> 03:00:43,080
How long ago was this?
2004.

4222
03:00:43,081 --> 03:00:44,970
It was a long time ago.
What's it even,

4223
03:00:44,971 --> 03:00:49,971
it might might've been three.
So we fly out to New York and they're

4224
03:00:51,090 --> 03:00:55,320
filming all day in this fucking old ass
warehouse with no windows and it's

4225
03:00:55,321 --> 03:00:58,860
freezing every bodies in winter coats.
And we had a,

4226
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:02,800
like one of those burner here,
things,

4227
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:07,300
those portable like inferno here things.
Eddie and I were fucking huddled by this

4228
03:01:07,301 --> 03:01:09,280
time.
Everybody was the camera man,

4229
03:01:09,281 --> 03:01:12,250
the grips and the whole,
he did,

4230
03:01:12,251 --> 03:01:13,840
um,
the crackhead character,

4231
03:01:13,841 --> 03:01:15,120
Dave Chappelle.
Oh Shit.

4232
03:01:15,140 --> 03:01:20,140
Stayed,
he stayed in character the whole fucking

4233
03:01:21,911 --> 03:01:24,100
day and he's trying to tell him about
me.

4234
03:01:24,101 --> 03:01:25,870
Like he introduced me to Dave Chappelle
and goes,

4235
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:29,180
this guy,
he just tapped Hoya gracie and uh,

4236
03:01:29,230 --> 03:01:31,330
he was like,
hi Gracie.

4237
03:01:31,450 --> 03:01:34,330
God Damn,
until the whole bill all.

4238
03:01:34,331 --> 03:01:35,350
Yeah.
So all,

4239
03:01:35,620 --> 03:01:38,200
every time we ran into each other
throughout the day,

4240
03:01:38,201 --> 03:01:39,990
he'd look at me and goes,
you tap wise.

4241
03:01:39,990 --> 03:01:44,990
Grazie he was just staring at us over
and over.

4242
03:01:46,331 --> 03:01:49,730
He would say the same shit.
I wonder why it took so long to get into

4243
03:01:49,750 --> 03:01:52,090
stand up.
He's such a brilliant mom.

4244
03:01:52,180 --> 03:01:55,990
I think he sat back and watched it and
probably thought he could do it and then

4245
03:01:55,991 --> 03:01:56,531
said,
no on,

4246
03:01:56,531 --> 03:01:58,690
let me just give it a shot.
And he just took to it like a duck to

4247
03:01:58,691 --> 03:01:59,524
water.
Yup.

4248
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:01,840
Yeah.
But um,

4249
03:02:02,100 --> 03:02:04,450
I had a good conversation about standing
up with him last night.

4250
03:02:04,480 --> 03:02:07,870
I just saw Sebastian special yesterday,
last night.

4251
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:08,860
Sebastian.
Excellent.

4252
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:12,130
Excellent.
It's so crazy that we used to see,

4253
03:02:12,250 --> 03:02:14,380
we've seen him.
He was just one of the regulars at the

4254
03:02:14,381 --> 03:02:16,390
Olr when we'd go in like right after
this.

4255
03:02:16,420 --> 03:02:19,360
He just chose that one four shows at
Madison Square Garden.

4256
03:02:19,660 --> 03:02:23,730
Credible
thousand people a show.

4257
03:02:23,731 --> 03:02:28,120
He showed us
sold out for show top 10,

4258
03:02:28,121 --> 03:02:29,650
right?
For most uh,

4259
03:02:29,710 --> 03:02:30,040
yeah.

4260
03:02:30,040 --> 03:02:33,070
I said her name well this year he
probably be,

4261
03:02:33,071 --> 03:02:34,920
it's going to be number one fighting
gas.

4262
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:36,940
Seinfeld's saying hold my beer.
No,

4263
03:02:36,941 --> 03:02:37,331
no,
no.

4264
03:02:37,331 --> 03:02:40,600
Sipho can't do that.
He can't sell out four shows at Madison

4265
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:42,850
Square Garden like that.
He might sell at one flip.

4266
03:02:42,910 --> 03:02:46,330
Foresoft for is crazy.
There's guys like Louis C K and

4267
03:02:46,410 --> 03:02:49,960
capturing hell,
but Louie c Kathy sold out two in a row.

4268
03:02:50,170 --> 03:02:53,230
I don't think he ever did like four like
that and Chappelle's copyright to it and

4269
03:02:53,231 --> 03:02:55,470
it's a weekend dude.
He saw out for it.

4270
03:02:56,380 --> 03:02:58,090
It's insane.
It's insane.

4271
03:02:58,091 --> 03:03:00,190
It's almost unprecedent dice.
Did it die?

4272
03:03:00,191 --> 03:03:02,040
Sold out Madison Square Garden.
How many times?

4273
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:03,480
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

4274
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:06,400
Kevin Hart's for coming onto,
the thing about dice that you always

4275
03:03:06,401 --> 03:03:09,430
have to give up is at dice was z numero
uno.

4276
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:12,340
Nobody did that before.
Nobody did anything like that before

4277
03:03:12,520 --> 03:03:14,410
with dice done.
What he did,

4278
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:18,580
he would sell out arenas when nobody had
even heard about doing this before.

4279
03:03:18,700 --> 03:03:21,210
Nassau Coliseum.
Even Eddie Murphy's dice.

4280
03:03:21,220 --> 03:03:23,050
Dice Murphy was close though,
right?

4281
03:03:23,650 --> 03:03:27,070
He was until he stopped doing standup.
But he never quite reached the heights

4282
03:03:27,071 --> 03:03:29,650
at dice did.
Dice was absolutely without a doubt.

4283
03:03:29,651 --> 03:03:34,530
Unprecedented cause I remember it was
happening as I was getting into standup,

4284
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:38,680
but so he as I was getting into standup
dice was selling out arenas and he would

4285
03:03:38,681 --> 03:03:41,380
sell them out like two,
three nights in a row and they just had

4286
03:03:41,381 --> 03:03:43,780
done hundreds of arena shows all over
the country.

4287
03:03:43,781 --> 03:03:47,560
I mean nobody had been like that before.
Every before everybody was doing like

4288
03:03:47,561 --> 03:03:51,700
places that I used to do this kind of
like a different version,

4289
03:03:51,701 --> 03:03:54,760
a newer like cleaned up version of dice
sort of,

4290
03:03:54,761 --> 03:03:55,870
you know.
And when they used to go on the road

4291
03:03:55,871 --> 03:03:57,220
together,
Sebastian,

4292
03:03:58,120 --> 03:04:00,660
yeah.
It tells a story about not doing lot on

4293
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:02,520
long enough set and have you heard this?
No.

4294
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:05,480
Forget Sebastian talked about this.
He's opening for him and he goes,

4295
03:04:05,510 --> 03:04:08,840
he's supposed to do 12 minutes,
and he did eight and he came to the back

4296
03:04:08,841 --> 03:04:10,910
and dice just fucking tore him a new
one.

4297
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:12,800
It was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

4298
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:14,830
Well,
it's great to 12th yeah,

4299
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,340
you'll do your shit.
Nice.

4300
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:19,370
I guess ask is mine right?
Went to early.

4301
03:04:19,460 --> 03:04:21,110
Oh Dude,
I did a show with the guy wants,

4302
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:26,090
I went to the green room and a minute
and a half later he came backstage.

4303
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:28,140
It was great.
I go,

4304
03:04:28,141 --> 03:04:28,850
where are you?
It's great.

4305
03:04:28,850 --> 03:04:29,870
I go,
what did he do when he goes?

4306
03:04:30,710 --> 03:04:31,850
He just goes,
I can't do it.

4307
03:04:32,710 --> 03:04:34,790
You can't do it.
You're done.

4308
03:04:34,830 --> 03:04:36,380
Because yeah,
I'm just a tap.

4309
03:04:36,440 --> 03:04:38,720
I can't.
So I walked out through the green room

4310
03:04:38,721 --> 03:04:40,640
door onto the stage and the audience is
looking at me like,

4311
03:04:40,641 --> 03:04:41,474
what up?

4312
03:04:42,170 --> 03:04:43,280
Yes,
yes,

4313
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:44,870
yes.
I remember that.

4314
03:04:44,960 --> 03:04:46,530
I remember that famous cat.
Oh,

4315
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,400
young guy.
His name,

4316
03:04:49,401 --> 03:04:51,350
but the guy went out.
I remember that.

4317
03:04:51,540 --> 03:04:53,810
Yeah,
and then the whole night you were trying

4318
03:04:53,811 --> 03:04:54,920
to coach him back.
He was like,

4319
03:04:54,921 --> 03:04:56,000
I'm done with it.
I quit.

4320
03:04:56,001 --> 03:04:58,160
I'm never going to do this.
He should go out.

4321
03:04:58,490 --> 03:04:59,810
Well,
he just crowded.

4322
03:05:00,170 --> 03:05:03,320
What happened?
He used to do stand up and then he

4323
03:05:03,321 --> 03:05:04,970
stopped doing it.
Like it.

4324
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:09,980
He had a regular job too and he wasn't,
wasn't doing it as much in need.

4325
03:05:10,070 --> 03:05:12,170
I think he was drinking,
but I know him when I know him.

4326
03:05:12,200 --> 03:05:13,180
Joe.
Oh No.

4327
03:05:13,460 --> 03:05:14,930
Good guy though.
I like him a lot.

4328
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:17,630
He was a bomber.
Hopefully figure it out,

4329
03:05:17,660 --> 03:05:20,240
but like it's fucking hard man.
It's even harder in England,

4330
03:05:20,241 --> 03:05:21,590
man.
You want to make of New England.

4331
03:05:21,620 --> 03:05:23,210
It's not,
it's not as easy as it is.

4332
03:05:23,270 --> 03:05:26,780
If you ever had like just a nightmare
show like that,

4333
03:05:26,970 --> 03:05:29,840
like it was just horrible than not 1:00
AM I not.

4334
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:32,180
Not that one of my one hours,
like if I'm on the road,

4335
03:05:32,181 --> 03:05:33,390
no,
if you bomb it there,

4336
03:05:33,580 --> 03:05:35,590
I don't know what you're doing.
But at the comedy story,

4337
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:40,290
I've ate all the ticks in the room.
All right,

4338
03:05:40,330 --> 03:05:42,740
coming to see you there.
That's what I'm saying.

4339
03:05:42,741 --> 03:05:45,350
When I'm on the road though.
Those are my people.

4340
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:48,050
But that's why the comedy store,
the laugh factory have eight tons of

4341
03:05:48,051 --> 03:05:49,580
ticks.
Those are so important.

4342
03:05:49,581 --> 03:05:52,820
Those weird shows.
15 people on the lineup and they might

4343
03:05:52,821 --> 03:05:54,590
be there to see deleah.
They might be due to see

4344
03:05:56,150 --> 03:05:57,410
joey.
Scary Shit.

4345
03:05:57,411 --> 03:06:00,110
That's the only way.
That's what you're supposed to do with

4346
03:06:00,560 --> 03:06:02,220
the other night.
And uh,

4347
03:06:02,221 --> 03:06:04,400
you know,
it wasn't my crowd like I could notice

4348
03:06:04,401 --> 03:06:06,200
right away there's old people in the
back.

4349
03:06:06,220 --> 03:06:06,860
Oh,
it was kind of,

4350
03:06:06,860 --> 03:06:08,660
you know,
draw on pills.

4351
03:06:08,910 --> 03:06:09,743
Yeah.

4352
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:13,850
It's better when they're there to see
those.

4353
03:06:13,990 --> 03:06:17,180
Is that whiskeys fucking good?
It's good whiskey one another one.

4354
03:06:17,430 --> 03:06:18,880
Ah,
I got to drive that.

4355
03:06:18,910 --> 03:06:20,390
Thinks fast as fuck.
How funny he was doing.

4356
03:06:20,391 --> 03:06:22,220
Stand up.
It's the fun.

4357
03:06:22,221 --> 03:06:24,540
It's shit.
It's the funny shit when you don't bomb

4358
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:27,500
and when it goes great.
It's a,

4359
03:06:27,501 --> 03:06:28,520
it's too much fun.
Dude.

4360
03:06:29,060 --> 03:06:30,410
Last Saturday,
my special,

4361
03:06:30,411 --> 03:06:32,390
so Rogan introduced me.
I come out in the crowd,

4362
03:06:32,391 --> 03:06:35,270
so awesome.
Oh and A,

4363
03:06:35,271 --> 03:06:38,140
I start getting emotional like I,
my eyes start fill up with tears.

4364
03:06:38,141 --> 03:06:39,770
I'm like,
fuck dude.

4365
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,000
Fuck.
Do not cry.

4366
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:45,260
Do not fucking so they'll definitely use
the edit of the second show cause I

4367
03:06:45,261 --> 03:06:47,990
didn't get emotional because I had to
find my way in that first one.

4368
03:06:48,210 --> 03:06:49,490
It gives a great crowd too,
man.

4369
03:06:49,491 --> 03:06:51,800
They were super hyped.
It was really fun.

4370
03:06:51,890 --> 03:06:53,870
It was so cool.
Count went up until like 10 minutes,

4371
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:54,970
10 minutes.

4372
03:06:54,970 --> 03:06:57,330
I really stepped off the side and then a
proper ended up.

4373
03:06:57,331 --> 03:06:58,021
Yeah,
it was awesome,

4374
03:06:58,021 --> 03:06:59,160
man.
We were so proud of you.

4375
03:06:59,550 --> 03:07:00,600
Yeah,
so cool.

4376
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:02,070
So cool.
It was so fun,

4377
03:07:02,071 --> 03:07:02,970
man.
In my life,

4378
03:07:02,971 --> 03:07:04,980
man.
You sound super positive,

4379
03:07:04,981 --> 03:07:05,401
man.
Dude.

4380
03:07:05,401 --> 03:07:08,210
I drove all the way the fuck down and
all the way the fuck back and I can't

4381
03:07:08,211 --> 03:07:10,980
believe you did that.
I drove five and a half hours down in

4382
03:07:10,981 --> 03:07:14,400
two and a half hours back,
eight hours of driving son.

4383
03:07:14,460 --> 03:07:17,070
It was rough.
That's how I got home.

4384
03:07:17,071 --> 03:07:19,620
I'm like,
I got my head out the window trying to

4385
03:07:19,621 --> 03:07:23,790
stay awake,
face imagining how good that bed is

4386
03:07:23,791 --> 03:07:25,440
going to feel.
You're just like,

4387
03:07:25,441 --> 03:07:27,810
fuck dude.
I told you I'd get you a route,

4388
03:07:27,811 --> 03:07:30,480
whatever you want to Berta flying a
helicopter.

4389
03:07:30,481 --> 03:07:30,901
But he's like,
no,

4390
03:07:30,901 --> 03:07:33,060
you might get back dog.
It would have been great.

4391
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:35,070
It's been great.
How much would a helicopter ride?

4392
03:07:35,280 --> 03:07:36,430
I Dunno.
I offered it.

4393
03:07:37,110 --> 03:07:40,290
I had to drive.
My daughter had a gymnastics event and

4394
03:07:40,320 --> 03:07:42,890
so I was going to get back.
Yeah.

4395
03:07:42,930 --> 03:07:46,530
How to get back in the morning.
I got emotional before the thing,

4396

03:07:57,450 --> 03:07:59,220
And I'm like,

4401
03:07:59,820 --> 03:08:01,170
It's just that when you were like,

I need to see that.

4407
03:08:08,581 --> 03:08:10,470
I need to see that.
It was fun.

4408
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:12,500
It was a good night.
It was very positive,

4409
03:08:12,530 --> 03:08:13,670
positive vibes.
I was,

4410
03:08:14,070 --> 03:08:16,860
I was beaming like half the way home
until I started getting tired.

4411
03:08:16,890 --> 03:08:19,910
I was super happy,
so happy.

4412
03:08:20,270 --> 03:08:22,990
Where does it come out?
Uh,

4413
03:08:23,130 --> 03:08:25,710
I would say may,
may or April.

4414
03:08:26,490 --> 03:08:31,440
So you got a tour now and then try to
work in new material while you're

4415
03:08:31,441 --> 03:08:33,090
touring.
Here's the thing,

4416
03:08:33,140 --> 03:08:33,541
I'm,
no,

4417
03:08:33,541 --> 03:08:37,260
I'm not going on the road to March.
I have and you're gonna be like,

4418
03:08:37,261 --> 03:08:40,220
you're a fucking idiot.
I almost have seen because I record this

4419
03:08:40,221 --> 03:08:42,040
special.
I'm done with that man.

4420
03:08:42,450 --> 03:08:43,620
So I'm,
I'm trying to,

4421
03:08:43,770 --> 03:08:46,650
I'll still do,
obviously I have to do certain bids when

4422
03:08:46,651 --> 03:08:49,860
I did the store,
but I'm trying to get at least 30

4423
03:08:49,861 --> 03:08:52,010
minutes before you should.
Um,

4424
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:56,550
but it's not a bad idea to do the road
while you still can because you can make

4425
03:08:56,551 --> 03:09:00,090
money doing clubs and theaters and all
the different than reps.

4426
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:03,930
And the,
the strategy that I always employed,

4427
03:09:03,931 --> 03:09:05,820
it's not the best one.
You can do whatever you want,

4428
03:09:05,821 --> 03:09:08,820
but what I like to do is do a bit that I
know works and then some new shit and

4429
03:09:08,821 --> 03:09:10,410
then a bit,
I know we're responding to new shit.

4430
03:09:11,840 --> 03:09:12,900
Shit Sandwich.
Correct.

4431
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:14,850
And then eventually after events,
yeah,

4432
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:18,480
I turned that shit into beef jerky and
then eventually it's a steak.

4433
03:09:18,510 --> 03:09:19,770
Yup.
Just takes time.

4434
03:09:19,830 --> 03:09:22,590
Yeah.
But that's the best way I've found is

4435
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:24,330
to,
you got to give him some stuff that's

4436
03:09:24,331 --> 03:09:26,820
100% legit or have to,
I do.

4437
03:09:26,850 --> 03:09:30,810
I definitely still do workout sets like
in town where there's fucking around.

4438
03:09:30,811 --> 03:09:33,240
But even now it's like,
what if I do a workout side of the

4439
03:09:33,241 --> 03:09:35,280
store?
Like a lot of times it's mobbed,

4440
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:36,960
man.
I mean there's a story.

4441
03:09:36,961 --> 03:09:40,800
Can I can't do my job,
my mom and that made them good shit.

4442
03:09:40,830 --> 03:09:42,480
And you go on stage and they go fucking
crazy.

4443
03:09:42,481 --> 03:09:44,340
Like they'd got babysitters,
Bro.

4444
03:09:44,520 --> 03:09:46,350
I got a plan cause that horrible
anxiety.

4445
03:09:46,351 --> 03:09:48,260
Literally the next morning I woke up at
the worst thing,

4446
03:09:48,261 --> 03:09:48,720
anxiety.
I'm like,

4447
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:50,510
I come up with all new shit.
I don't,

4448
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:52,050
I got a plan cause I feel better about
it.

4449
03:09:52,051 --> 03:09:54,460
I don't bump people,
but I understand

4450
03:09:54,460 --> 03:09:59,410
it because with a guy like Chris Rock or
Louis C K or a lot of the guys that

4451
03:09:59,411 --> 03:10:00,580
would would,
um,

4452
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:03,550
when I say bump,
it's not thought of as a negative thing.

4453
03:10:03,580 --> 03:10:06,160
It's thought of as a negative thing if
you really don't deserve it.

4454
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:07,810
Right?
Like if you're a certain person who

4455
03:10:07,811 --> 03:10:10,360
tried to bump people and people like
this fucking guy is pumping people.

4456
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:14,860
But you know if Chris rock shows up,
generally most people just let them go

4457
03:10:14,861 --> 03:10:18,350
on stage and Dave Chapelle perfect
example and it just let him go.

4458
03:10:18,351 --> 03:10:20,110
He's already spent,
but it's awesome.

4459
03:10:20,111 --> 03:10:21,910
It's complete respect.
But what it is,

4460
03:10:21,911 --> 03:10:26,770
it's how they managed to try stand up
when they know it's not their audience.

4461
03:10:26,890 --> 03:10:29,290
Like they're famous.
So it's almost like every audience is

4462
03:10:29,291 --> 03:10:33,610
Dave Chappelle's audience home games.
But that's how you develop material

4463
03:10:33,640 --> 03:10:36,940
because if you,
if people are common to see you 100% and

4464
03:10:36,941 --> 03:10:39,430
then you feel more inclined to do new
stuff,

4465
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:43,090
whereas if you just drop it in,
you feel like you could work on new

4466
03:10:43,091 --> 03:10:45,550
stuff better.
If people come to see rather you,

4467
03:10:45,570 --> 03:10:47,800
you're going to,
you're going to do stuff that's tried

4468
03:10:47,801 --> 03:10:48,634
and proven.

4469
03:10:48,950 --> 03:10:52,730
I caught him last his and it was in the
or I was leaving and I pass by and I'm

4470
03:10:52,731 --> 03:10:53,960
like,
Oh shit.

4471
03:10:54,230 --> 03:10:57,590
Dave Chappelle's onstage and everybody,
I mean,

4472
03:10:57,591 --> 03:11:02,591
there was so much God damn loving,
positive energy in that room because,

4473
03:11:03,170 --> 03:11:07,340
and he was just sitting on a chair
smoking a cigarette and he was just

4474
03:11:07,341 --> 03:11:11,780
standing recruiting.
He said people lost their fucking mind.

4475
03:11:11,781 --> 03:11:13,910
Like one line he was,
he would just sit there,

4476
03:11:18,450 --> 03:11:20,790
don't ever tell your wife's gay friends
shit.

4477
03:11:23,230 --> 03:11:28,230
And then
they didn't even have to hear the rest

4478
03:11:28,921 --> 03:11:30,180
of the story.
Everybody.

4479
03:11:30,181 --> 03:11:32,140
Comedians.
Yeah.

4480
03:11:33,020 --> 03:11:35,010
It's like,
fuck did he so good,

4481
03:11:35,011 --> 03:11:36,780
so confident.
He's just,

4482
03:11:36,870 --> 03:11:38,850
he's like the fucking Yoda.
You know,

4483
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:41,820
comedy is just incredible.
He's is good as anybody that's ever

4484
03:11:41,821 --> 03:11:42,900
lived.
Yeah.

4485
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:45,960
Hell fucking yeah.
And he's got his own style to this laid

4486
03:11:45,961 --> 03:11:47,160
back,
you know,

4487
03:11:47,161 --> 03:11:51,300
so confident.
Just calm and silly and knows he's going

4488
03:11:51,301 --> 03:11:52,740
to kill.
It's like impossible.

4489
03:11:52,770 --> 03:11:56,010
I love how he wears his own clothes.
You noticing like,

4490
03:11:56,310 --> 03:11:58,140
so this is a Gucci fucking shirt,
right?

4491
03:11:58,410 --> 03:12:01,470
He would have that Gucci sign taken off
and it says,

4492
03:12:01,550 --> 03:12:04,530
uh,
Dave d c he has his logo on it,

4493
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:05,960
all his clothes to see.
Right.

4494
03:12:06,030 --> 03:12:09,930
Is it just as you see it's just,
see it's just a c on all his clothes and

4495
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:12,870
just fucking Jean.
Jacques is genes you have notice cause

4496
03:12:12,871 --> 03:12:15,360
he get those clothes made.
I think it's his own wine.

4497
03:12:15,390 --> 03:12:18,150
I'm not sure,
but I don't obviously I'm a weird

4498
03:12:18,151 --> 03:12:22,430
fashion dude gets closer.
We shirts my shirts all the time though.

4499
03:12:22,460 --> 03:12:25,830
His is like designer shit.
Like he like his Jean Jacket.

4500
03:12:25,831 --> 03:12:28,740
We'll just have his logo on it.
His chain will be his logo.

4501
03:12:28,800 --> 03:12:30,990
Really shirt will be as low as smart as
fuck.

4502
03:12:31,350 --> 03:12:32,600
He's like,
why am I going where other people's

4503
03:12:32,601 --> 03:12:34,140
shit.
Well it's also like

4504
03:12:34,240 --> 03:12:38,140
you don't want to get caught up in that
designer name trap where people are

4505
03:12:38,141 --> 03:12:40,750
trying to wear Gucci everywhere and all
these different,

4506
03:12:41,050 --> 03:12:43,120
you know what I'm saying?
Like people get caught up in that where

4507
03:12:43,121 --> 03:12:43,470
they have,
yeah,

4508
03:12:43,470 --> 03:12:46,080
show that off.
It's fucking stupid.

4509
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:49,860
Yeah.
Wouldn't you rather have a big old be on

4510
03:12:49,861 --> 03:12:51,880
everything?
Did

4511
03:12:51,990 --> 03:12:55,630
she go for it?
Don't you go buy Goethe?

4512
03:12:55,880 --> 03:12:56,750
No,
dolce now.

4513
03:12:56,800 --> 03:12:57,620
Okay.
What is,

4514
03:12:57,620 --> 03:13:00,860
what's top of the line?
Gucci is Gucci.

4515
03:13:00,970 --> 03:13:04,940
Gucci.
Louis Vuitton in probably six months

4516
03:13:04,941 --> 03:13:07,340
with Virgil's release.
He's the head crater now.

4517
03:13:07,490 --> 03:13:08,720
They're going to take go,
fuck.

4518
03:13:08,721 --> 03:13:13,650
Did you just say,
I know Jamie can understand them.

4519
03:13:13,990 --> 03:13:16,010
Do you understand Jamie?
He's on black twitter.

4520
03:13:18,900 --> 03:13:20,020
Gucci.
What?

4521
03:13:21,220 --> 03:13:22,610
What?
What else is the shit?

4522
03:13:23,030 --> 03:13:25,250
Gucci off whites.
Huge right now.

4523
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,180
Kratos still good.
Proud of what it's like.

4524
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:30,590
Are there certain watches the guys try
to wear?

4525
03:13:31,280 --> 03:13:32,950
Rolex is always killing it.
Oh,

4526
03:13:33,050 --> 03:13:34,910
this is never going to go and it never
goes anywhere.

4527
03:13:34,940 --> 03:13:36,920
You gotta I stop role lax and you're a
rapper.

4528
03:13:36,980 --> 03:13:38,090
You're a winner.
Yeah.

4529
03:13:38,330 --> 03:13:39,040
Yeah,
right.

4530
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:40,970
Oh always.
But tone is classic.

4531
03:13:41,780 --> 03:13:45,840
But if you're like a floyd mayweather,
you gotta take it to a two level for Tom

4532
03:13:45,870 --> 03:13:49,660
can cube the lower tall.
He wears a Louis Vuitton or Gucci all

4533
03:13:49,700 --> 03:13:51,470
time Gucci ski like caught in the
streets.

4534
03:13:51,510 --> 03:13:52,350
That's number one.
She's like,

4535
03:13:53,490 --> 03:13:55,100
it's a crossover.
How do you know this?

4536
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:56,540
Because the,
their style,

4537
03:13:56,541 --> 03:13:58,400
it's just,
you'll see in the magazines.

4538
03:13:58,401 --> 03:13:59,270
Is there like where's it coming?

4539
03:14:01,550 --> 03:14:04,010
It's just like how do you do out there?
I don't know.

4540
03:14:04,011 --> 03:14:05,450
It's just you have your finger in the
past.

4541
03:14:05,451 --> 03:14:06,284
But where's the,
where's the,

4542
03:14:06,760 --> 03:14:10,850
what magazine do you have to read?
Paul says like what kind of the pulse

4543
03:14:10,851 --> 03:14:14,420
will start with like what's the website?
This is going to be,

4544
03:14:14,470 --> 03:14:17,480
this is him with this is millions of
dollars with a watch has played this

4545
03:14:17,481 --> 03:14:20,920
cause it's so preposterous starting from
the beginning and play it.

4546
03:14:22,370 --> 03:14:25,780
He's so ridiculous.
He's got like 30 watches with it.

4547
03:14:25,790 --> 03:14:28,760
But can you do it from the beginning?
What's that?

4548
03:14:29,500 --> 03:14:31,190
I can't start it over.
Okay,

4549
03:14:31,550 --> 03:14:33,550
look at this.
Do you know what the kind of security

4550
03:14:33,570 --> 03:14:34,403
has to any of this?

4551
03:14:34,520 --> 03:14:36,600
Well,
do you know what you know what was

4552
03:14:36,601 --> 03:14:37,500
crazy?
Three days.

4553
03:14:37,501 --> 03:14:39,180
30 watches.
10 more days.

4554
03:14:39,930 --> 03:14:44,930
I Take Tim more watches Jesus Christ.
But then I say fuck it.

4555
03:14:45,930 --> 03:14:48,490
If I want to bring up the one and only
you're not bringing out the wash,

4556
03:14:48,491 --> 03:14:49,680
their cost.
18 million.

4557
03:14:50,500 --> 03:14:55,120
Ah Oh my God.
That's so preposterous.

4558
03:14:57,160 --> 03:14:59,950
$18 million on your wrist.
That's insane.

4559
03:15:00,340 --> 03:15:01,540
Plus the press play,
Jamie.

4560
03:15:02,770 --> 03:15:04,640
Fuck you.
You motherfucker.

4561
03:15:04,641 --> 03:15:07,020
Hey,
just today I'm you go fuck off $50,000

4562
03:15:07,021 --> 03:15:10,130
cause I ain't got shit else to do.
Mother fuckers money May,

4563
03:15:10,420 --> 03:15:11,460
oh all mother fucking day.

4564
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:17,400
That's the end retake is crazy million
dollar watch 50 cent or is that an act?

4565
03:15:19,570 --> 03:15:21,550
It's a good question.
That's a real thing.

4566
03:15:21,580 --> 03:15:22,800
I think they were really mad at each
other.

4567
03:15:22,820 --> 03:15:23,653
Yeah.
I don't think

4568
03:15:25,150 --> 03:15:27,430
a lot of people get in.
And is it a little scraps?

4569
03:15:27,990 --> 03:15:29,280
Yeah,
I dunno.

4570
03:15:29,310 --> 03:15:30,610
Floor.
He gets them scraps.

4571
03:15:30,820 --> 03:15:31,930
Well,
you know,

4572
03:15:32,050 --> 03:15:34,030
I mean when you act like that,
that's his,

4573
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:36,700
this whole thing in Asia.
But the problem is like Adrian broner

4574
03:15:36,701 --> 03:15:38,400
tries doing the same thing,
but he doesn't win.

4575
03:15:38,410 --> 03:15:40,120
So it's tough.
You know his,

4576
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:41,280
his club,
his,

4577
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:46,320
I think his slogans about billions.
Adrian boner ab about billions.

4578
03:15:46,710 --> 03:15:48,220
It's tough.
It's a tough sell.

4579
03:15:50,330 --> 03:15:51,840
Well,
if he was light and everybody up on

4580
03:15:51,841 --> 03:15:53,990
fire,
sorry.

4581
03:15:54,210 --> 03:15:56,980
Well Little Shit.
Jamie's mixing it up.

4582
03:15:58,450 --> 03:16:00,630
A Dj Jv.
Jay was at black twitter.

4583
03:16:01,760 --> 03:16:05,280
He's talking about Adrian Broder.
Y'All know I beat that boy.

4584
03:16:05,281 --> 03:16:06,550
He said what?
What is 50 cents?

4585
03:16:06,560 --> 03:16:09,450
And as he's talking shit about Adrian.
Oh Damn.

4586
03:16:09,451 --> 03:16:10,710
Ab.
I want my money.

4587
03:16:10,711 --> 03:16:14,850
I bet on you back.
Oh look at this 50 cents.

4588
03:16:14,851 --> 03:16:16,740
The guy that just jumps in to stay
relevant.

4589
03:16:16,741 --> 03:16:18,140
Huh?
That's a little bit of it.

4590
03:16:18,150 --> 03:16:20,260
Like he's trolling and he gets his name
out.

4591
03:16:20,350 --> 03:16:21,660
Well,
he definitely does that.

4592
03:16:22,140 --> 03:16:22,900
Yeah.
Damn.

4593
03:16:22,900 --> 03:16:25,320
He's still do these days.
He's looks like he's got a bunch of

4594
03:16:25,321 --> 03:16:28,290
parties he's doing,
he's on power.

4595
03:16:28,291 --> 03:16:29,670
Right?
Power.

4596
03:16:29,880 --> 03:16:32,760
Those are shows a launch party.
So he's got a brand brandon,

4597
03:16:32,790 --> 03:16:34,410
if he owns that club.
Yeah,

4598
03:16:34,411 --> 03:16:36,840
I think he's doing parties.
I don't think he's necessarily like

4599
03:16:36,850 --> 03:16:38,070
rapping there.
No,

4600
03:16:38,071 --> 03:16:38,850
he's not.

4601
03:16:38,850 --> 03:16:39,750
Doesn't rap anymore.
Right.

4602
03:16:39,751 --> 03:16:41,080
Does he rap now?
He's an actor,

4603
03:16:41,081 --> 03:16:41,911
right?
He's on power.

4604
03:16:41,911 --> 03:16:44,680
And then he made a shitload of money off
vitamin water,

4605
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,500
they say,
although that might be a rumor because

4606
03:16:46,501 --> 03:16:50,900
they said he's bullshitting you might be
an investor in beltour some he's going

4607
03:16:50,910 --> 03:16:53,460
to code like what is he doing with no
involved in it?

4608
03:16:53,461 --> 03:16:55,290
They,
it's almost like he's doing that same

4609
03:16:55,291 --> 03:16:56,124
shit that,
uh,

4610
03:16:56,320 --> 03:16:58,570
what was the girl Carmen Electra?
Did you know?

4611
03:16:58,571 --> 03:17:00,360
We were like a celebrity,
remember when she was,

4612
03:17:00,361 --> 03:17:02,610
uh,
connected to the UFC?

4613
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:03,960
Electra was,
yeah.

4614
03:17:03,961 --> 03:17:06,460
You don't remember any,
she was post fight interview or

4615
03:17:06,461 --> 03:17:06,890
something?
No,

4616
03:17:06,890 --> 03:17:07,480
no,
no,

4617
03:17:07,480 --> 03:17:07,681
no,
no,

4618
03:17:07,681 --> 03:17:08,161
no,
no.

4619
03:17:08,161 --> 03:17:10,800
She was the liaison.
She was like a celebrity,

4620
03:17:10,801 --> 03:17:11,460
like,
uh,

4621
03:17:11,460 --> 03:17:12,160
she was,
uh,

4622
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:14,520
like a promoter,
celebrity promotive UFC.

4623
03:17:16,360 --> 03:17:18,750
I want to say he's a manager.
He's my manager.

4624
03:17:18,751 --> 03:17:20,670
I want to say I wasn't working for the
UFC then.

4625
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:21,983
Yeah.
See,

4626
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:23,710
look at her.
Carmen Electra with two of those.

4627
03:17:24,540 --> 03:17:28,140
Jens pulver chocolate.
Yeah.

4628
03:17:28,860 --> 03:17:30,000
Wow.
Joe His,

4629
03:17:30,001 --> 03:17:31,080
Oh,
who's the other guy behind her?

4630
03:17:31,081 --> 03:17:34,430
Who's the guy behind her?
Look solely at rainbow.

4631
03:17:35,310 --> 03:17:36,960
Look at that picture.
Crazy.

4632
03:17:37,370 --> 03:17:40,890
That was current culture.
So like that Carmen Electra was like,

4633
03:17:40,920 --> 03:17:41,671
uh,
you know,

4634
03:17:41,671 --> 03:17:44,360
she was a hot celebrity on 10 hottest
small.

4635
03:17:44,361 --> 03:17:47,400
She would do these interviews and she
would talk about the UFC.

4636
03:17:47,820 --> 03:17:48,481
Yeah,
dude,

4637
03:17:48,481 --> 03:17:50,400
I'm all about that.
Bring that shit back.

4638
03:17:50,610 --> 03:17:52,890
They tried it for a little while,
but I don't think they got a lot of

4639
03:17:52,891 --> 03:17:55,440
mileage out of it and so they bailed on
the bad idea.

4640
03:17:55,510 --> 03:17:56,790
All right.
She's so hot.

4641
03:17:57,160 --> 03:17:57,991
Um,
yeah.

4642
03:17:57,991 --> 03:18:01,230
Well she was really nice too.
I did a thing with her or for Spike TV

4643
03:18:01,231 --> 03:18:02,850
back in the day.
We did some car thing.

4644
03:18:03,130 --> 03:18:06,080
You fucking kid rock and spike every
single at the time.

4645
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:08,160
No,
sorry.

4646
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:11,700
Well that ends this shit.
I don't think she was either,

4647
03:18:11,701 --> 03:18:12,830
so it's all right.
They,

4648
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:16,050
you can figure it out.

Never mingle on twitter.
It's just instagram,

4666
03:19:02,800 --> 03:19:05,330
too toxic.
There's a bunch of it,
