3
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,560
So everywhere you'll,

4
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,170
Ohio folks stick together.

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,273
No messing around.

6
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,170
Yeah.

7
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,470
What is it about Ohio?

8
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:08,160
We live,

9
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,320
what is it about Ohio,

10
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,830
Ohio guys like Ohio,

11
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:11,881
Cleveland,

12
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,690
Columbus.

13
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,800
You guys all stick together.

14
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,520
Sandman is,

15
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,211

16
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,140
I just good people.

17
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:16,430
You know?

18
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,580
Even when you won the title,

19
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,390
they're like Gleevec.

20
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,230
We got a trip.

21
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,723
I'll wait til.

22
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,220
What is it about Ohio?

23
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:24,990
Why does everybody love it so much?

24
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,620
I Dunno.

25
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,790
I just think it's the mentality of people.

26
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,511
They just,

27
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,620
the people are awesome.

28
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,543
Um,

29
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,120
you know,

30
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,911
I don't like it.

31
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:32,711
Just hard to explain.

32
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,670
I think you just got to live there.

33
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:34,440
Like,

34
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:34,840
you know,

35
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,040
there's people that have lived in our
states and move to Cleveland or Ohio and

36
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,251
they're like,

37
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:39,551
Nah,

38
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:39,791
you know,

39
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,361
I get it now.

40
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:43,870
I see why you guys like you guys are
so like in depth with the charters are

41
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:44,261

00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,190
Like you guys love each other.

43
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:45,371
I'm like,

44
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:45,701
yeah man.

45
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:46,300
We just,

46
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,140
it's like its own nation.

47
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,351
It is weird.

48
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,670
Like Columbus in particular.

49
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,170
It's like one of my
favorite places to visit.

50
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:52,004
It's like one of the,

51
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,820
it's,

52
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,280
it's like I get the weather sucks a lot.

53
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,143
I get it,

54
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,800
but the people are so damn nice.

55
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,900
Like it's like overall it's like,

56
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,040
it's really good spot.

57
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,600
Yeah.

58
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:01,930
Yeah.

59
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,050
Actually I love Columbus drive.

60
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,893
Uh,

61
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,700
I had a bunch of a blurry nights.

62
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,534
They're well

63
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,851
down there.

64
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,560
I went to my brothers
and all that good stuff.

65
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:11,891
But I,

66
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:12,431
it's a,

67
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,211
I love Columbus too.

68
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:13,540
It's one of,

69
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:13,840
you know,

70
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,400
do went on there and especially for like,

71
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:16,960
we'd go down to the Arnold
and stuff like that.

72
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,100
Just checking it out.

73
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:18,461
And you know,

74
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,910
the head of the Kubota may fights and,

75
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,880
and our local shows to low,

76
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,350
we have lack of our coaches go
down there for a local MMA shows.

77
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,410
Remember when they used to
do the UFC with the Columbus?

78
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,160
With the Arnold?

79
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,820
Yeah.

80
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,080
There was a big event.

81
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,070
That was a bit,

82
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,180
I wonder why that stopped.

83
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,620
That was always a lot of fun.

84
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:33,790
No,

85
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,110
the one time that Strikeforce there,

86
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,270
that's when a round a
round with soccer up.

87
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:37,631
Sorry,

88
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,441
I suck at this.

89
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,580
This is my first podcast.

90
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:40,414
Be Gentle.

91
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah.

92
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,920
Yeah.

93
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
How the fuck is the heavyweight
champion of the world?

94
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,280
Never been on a podcast before.

95
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:46,930
I've been on podcasts like over the phone,

96
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,764
but not like,

97
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,680
yeah.

98
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,270
Yeah.

99
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,930
So,

100
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,560
um,

101
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,560
but I think it was a strike force is when
I rousy and Tate font and that's when

102
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,950
she had dislocated her elbow.

103
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,500
Yeah.

104
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,800
Is that,

105
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,331
was that one of the,

106
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,680
I think that was one of them.

107
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,633
Yeah,

108
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,593
I think so.

109
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,380
Yeah.

110
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,220
Back in the day.

111
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So what's it like walking around the
UFC heavyweight champion of the world?

112
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,830
How's that feel?

113
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,663
It feels good.

114
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,380
It doesn't really matter.

115
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,001
My household.

116
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm like fourth on the ladder.

117
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,610
It's my wife and the two dogs and then me,

118
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm there just to pay bills.

119
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,030
It's feels like that sometimes,

120
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:19,271
right?

121
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:19,950
Yeah,

122
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,860
the money machine.

123
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,173
But um,

124
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,350
so is everything good now you're
finally got a title fight.

125
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,120
He finally got a real challenger and
Francis and Guano on January 20th.

126
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,170
How do you feel about this?

127
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,310
I think he's a great fighter,

128
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,610
you know,

129
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,001
definitely.

130
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,540
Uh,

131
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,373
he brings it,

132
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,100
it's hard,

133
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,520
you know.

134
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,210
Um,

135
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,140
but you know,

136
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,510
unfortunately nothing's going to change.

137
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm walking out with the
will wrapped around my waist.

138
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,034
I mean,

139
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,083
you know,

140
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,991
I'm excited for him.

141
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:44,141
You know,

142
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:44,411
he's getting,

143
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:44,921
he's getting shot,

144
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:45,940
but as long as I'm here,

145
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,833
no one's gonna be champ.

146
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,943
Damn.

147
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,450
You have to have that mentality.

148
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,030
What do you think about
him that's unusual?

149
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,391
Well,

150
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:52,761
like what,

151
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,594
what about him?

152
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,990
Other than the size and the strength,

153
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,010
what stands out?

154
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,080
I mean,

155
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,541
was power,

156
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,171
I guess know.

157
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:00,010
But I think everyone

158
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,421
in turn,

159
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:03,910
the heavyweight division mean
260 pound man to a 50 pound man.

160
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,744
I mean,

161
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,600
you know,

162
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,861
you know,

163
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,660
you're not supposed to be
hit by something like that.

164
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,451
And I,

165
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:08,741
you know,

166
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:11,050
JDF Rj Dsfr now stuff on my car.

167
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,321
I mean,

168
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,154
I got guys who,

169
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,133
you know,

170
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
do hard.

171
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,620
Yeah.

172
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:14,891
You know,

173
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,724
and uh,

174
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,001
you know,

175
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,320
he just thought he's a little while too,

176
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,650
which is,

177
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,160
that's tough.

178
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,371
You know,

179
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,850
sometimes you can't prepare
for that because just there's
punches you don't see.

180
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,380
It's like the punchy Allister
with that Wilde took swings wide.

181
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,110
Well,

182
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,280
I think that was a little bit
of both on both ends over him.

183
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,630
You know,

184
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,670
we were just going to be a little sloppy
and then just put his face right in the

185
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,840
lane and yeah.

186
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,210
Overeem's got a weird style now.

187
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:37,600
Right.

188
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,080
It's a different,

189
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,690
it's a totally different style
over the last couple of years,

190
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,470
you know,

191
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,240
but he does awkward stuff.

192
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:43,781
Know,

193
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:44,890
like when you fought him,

194
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,760
what did you,

195
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,593
how did you feel?

196
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
Well,

197
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,521
when I fought him,

198
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,370
he was like very traditional
and moving around running,

199
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:52,390
but like kept yelling,

200
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,440
keeping his distance.

201
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:53,680
I'm like,

202
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,880
oh,

203
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,080
hey,

204
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,251
cool.

205
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:54,731
It's a fight.

206
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,564
You know?

207
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:55,991
And then,

208
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:56,111
uh,

209
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,291
you know,

210
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,070
he tried that,

211
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,391
that,

212
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:01,900
or lunging down what kind of kicked in
my thigh and I grabbed it and time it

213
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:02,441
took them down.

214
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,191
But you know,

215
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:03,611
I mean,

216
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,750
I didn't watch the whole fight with Negan.

217
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:05,860
No,

218
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,010
but what I saw was he's
doing all these wild punches.

219
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,670
You know,

220
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,280
when he fought me,

221
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,260
you're still in the straits and you know,

222
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:11,771
he wasn't really,

223
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,604
you know,

224
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,650
I think was in Ghana,

225
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:15,790
it was almost like he felt
like he could not get hit,

226
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,720
which was correct.

227
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,351
Right.

228
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,970
So he just decided to be just completely
wild and unpredictable me through that

229
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,850
wild lunging left hand to start the
fight off and then got the clinch

230
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,250
immediately but wasn't able
to do anything with it.

231
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,060
Yeah,

232
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,241
I,

233
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,074
you know,

234
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,120
I don't mean I'll find
out January 20th thing.

235
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,190
I think I'll be all right.

236
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:33,750
But you know,

237
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,560
I have the best coaches in the world.

238
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:35,720
You know,

239
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:35,791
I'm,

240
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:35,971
I'm,

241
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,300
I'm pretty capitol walking in there,

242
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:37,481
you know,

243
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,500
he's a big dude.

244
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,101
Throws hard.

245
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,370
I mean,

246
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,280
but that's every,

247
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:40,690
every way.

248
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:40,950
I mean,

249
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,251
it doesn't,

250
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,100
it doesn't take much.

251
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:42,740
Well,

252
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,370
the only time we've seen
him on his back was a,

253
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,960
which fight was it?

254
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,120
[inaudible] that was Curtis
plates took him down.

255
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,043
Yeah.

256
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,370
That was his first UFC fight.

257
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,030
Right?

258
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,331
Yeah.

259
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,350
That was an interesting fight.

260
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:53,560
Right.

261
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,371
You got a chance to see it,

262
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,390
but it's,

263
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,750
it's hard to see when it
guys real young in MMA,

264
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,620
it's hard to see a fight from three years
ago or whatever that was and then look

265
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:03,221
at him and say,

266
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,930
well that's the same guy
today cause it's not.

267
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,260
Right.

268
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,070
Yeah.

269
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,311
Yeah.

270
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:06,850
I mean,

271
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,000
I,

272
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,460
I've definitely changed the past
couple of months ago for sure.

273
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,601
You know,

274
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:10,961
I think,

275
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,310
uh,

276
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,560
you know,

277
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,371
he's definitely gotten better.

278
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,091
There's no question.

279
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,360
Um,

280
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,751
but you know,

281
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,051
we'll see.

282
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:14,741
We'll see what happens.

283
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,150
You know,

284
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:15,551
I listen,

285
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm going to different bro.

286
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,581
You know,

287
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,010
I'm going through when you always do.

288
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,903
Yeah.

289
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,320
Now this is January 20th and right
now what it was this December 13th or

290
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:23,681
something?

291
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:24,020
What's today?

292
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,580
The second.

293
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:24,911
Second.

294
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:25,150
Yeah.

295
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,050
It says number second.

296
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,650
No,

297
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,560
today's not the second one.

298
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,870
Tell you I'm talking about their fight.

299
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,531
Oh No,

300
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,390
today is the 13th.

301
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:31,780
Yeah.

302
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,420
So like how much time did
you have to prep for this?

303
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:34,661
Well,

304
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,860
I've been prepping and
y'all been working out?

305
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,040
I've been staying in shape.

306
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,090
And so did you turn to have a feeling
that January was going to be the card?

307
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:40,510
Yeah.

308
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,590
So like when the UFC lets,

309
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,424
you know,

310
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,240
how do they,

311
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,990
how do they do that?

312
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,770
How does that work?

313
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,910
Usually contact with Andrew,

314
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,121
like,

315
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:46,850
Hey,

316
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,740
this is what we're thinking.

317
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,820
You know,

318
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,451
I think you'd be ready.

319
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,110
So,

320
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,351
you know,

321
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,570
I was a little beat up after the,

322
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,570
the jds fight.

323
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:52,910
Um,

324
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,170
you know,

325
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,861
my shit and everything,

326
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,300
not just my shin by other things
and just had the heel up there,

327
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,180
tried it took me awhile.

328
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,981
Um,

329
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:58,151
you know,

330
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:58,520
I thinks things,

331
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm just trying to hold
onto the belt and just,

332
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,390
you know how the fuck says that
all the time they fucked up.

333
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,110
Don't listen to that.

334
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,943
Don't even respond.

335
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,420
I think it's funny.

336
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,901
I think it's great.

337
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,100
Yeah.

338
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,933
That was crazy.

339
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,520
But uh,

340
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,330
he fought everybody.

341
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,810
Yeah,

342
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,220
it is what it is we going to do.

343
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,140
I can't make everyone happy,

344
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,620
but uh,

345
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:12,861
but yeah,

346
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,100
man,

347
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,251
you know,

348
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:13,420
I was,

349
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,140
it was to be up a little bit
and just have a lot going on.

350
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,600
So,

351
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,860
you know,

352
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,290
now here we are to jds
fight was interesting,

353
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:18,580
right?

354
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,540
Cause that Shin was swelling up.

355
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,580
Heart couldn't leave that like,

356
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,593
yeah,

357
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,501
I feel fine.

358
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:24,790
Austin.

359
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,011
I'm like,

360
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:25,230
man,

361
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,970
it doesn't feel right.

362
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,181
You know,

363
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:26,750
I just,

364
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,800
I could feel like the Russia like
blood in my Shin and I'm like,

365
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:31,850
hmm.

366
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,130
It gives me again am I get
checked it and I was like,

367
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,641
cool,

368
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,211
I got hurt.

369
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,044
I got to end this.

370
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,550
So I was like chasing down and finding
my opportunity and thank God I got it.

371
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:46,250
But it's so interesting that
after all these years in Nma,

372
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,660
a new trend surfaces and that
trend is the low leg kick,

373
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,420
the low leg kicks to the
Shin and the calf area.

374
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,710
It's devastating.

375
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,620
Now you saw it with Benson Henderson,

376
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,340
I think it was the first guy to really
bring it to the UFC and really make it a

377
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,480
big part of his arsenal.

378
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,291
But you know,

379
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,830
you're seeing it with so many guys now
at the low leg kick is just a giant

380
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:07,580
technique.

381
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,413
Sucks.

382
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,500
It fucking sucks.

383
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,334
Right?

384
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,890
Well you can't condition
that part of your leg.

385
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,753
It's not the same.

386
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,260
I think some people are different,

387
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:15,561
some people,

388
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,550
but it's going to be real bad.

389
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,770
I think so like for me it sucked.

390
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,461
It was terrible.

391
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,750
I go up the stairs after that fight.

392
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,300
It was like the hardest thing
I ever just trying to train us.

393
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,680
Look like your leg was broken.

394
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,970
Like it swoll up so quick.

395
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,380
I was wondering if you had like uh,

396
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,360
the fibula was cracked
or something like that.

397
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,661
Yeah,

398
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,180
my doctor is actually was super
pumped about it cause he can be like,

399
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:32,631
oh my God,

400
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,220
look off deep bone bruise is,

401
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,063
this is amazing.

402
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,333
You were so pumped.

403
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,310
And he's like,

404
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,001
he's a train with us.

405
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:38,331
So he's a,

406
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:38,931
he's a good dude.

407
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:39,860
And he just loved the show.

408
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,960
My coach and my coach was like,

409
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,091
oh,

410
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:41,691
that's awesome.

411
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:41,931
I'm like,

412
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,150
so what did he look and put it
on an Mri or something like that.

413
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,430
I think it was an extra
or something like that.

414
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,600
And he saw the pictures and he's like,

415
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:48,650
man has a deep bone bruise.

416
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,371
Like this is a deep,

417
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:49,821
as you get,

418
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:49,990
you know,

419
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,370
he's,

420
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,630
you know,

421
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,463
it's pretty bad.

422
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,130
Yeah.

423
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,870
It's amazing to me that,

424
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,290
you know,

425
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,290
you think of all the techniques in martial
arts that this technique becomes like

426
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,110
a prominent technique in 2016 2017 yeah.

427
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:03,321
You know,

428
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:03,491
I'm,

429
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm still trying to work on my jab,

430
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,391
you know,

431
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,580
that's what I'm working on
right now in 2016 so over,

432
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,690
that can takes off for a while.

433
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:08,841
No,

434
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:09,440
but yeah,

435
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,071
it's funny.

436
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:10,310
Huh?

437
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:10,550
You know,

438
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,390
mixed martial arts,

439
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,830
there's one thing and then like,

440
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,040
you know,

441
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,660
when to started,

442
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,910
you know,

443
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,020
there was one guy who was a wrestler,

444
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:15,450
one guy,

445
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,220
Jujitsu won't gap.

446
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,570
Now it's trending and train
more and more and than,

447
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,110
you know,

448
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,943
you got guys who are like,

449
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,260
you know,

450
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,340
sprawl and brawl or,

451
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:22,891
yeah,

452
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:22,981
it's,

453
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:23,451
it's crazy.

454
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,011
We were watching the,

455
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:24,741
how the sport evolves.

456
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:25,670
It's amazing actually.

457
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,421
Well you,

458
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,780
you're an interesting case because you
are a guy who does everything right.

459
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,570
You're not a one sports specialists.

460
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:36,590
Like you didn't come in as a kickboxing
champ like Overeem or like Mark Hunt,

461
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,101
you know,

462
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:37,371
you,

463
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:39,230
you came into the sport with everything,

464
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:39,801
you know,

465
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,050
you are,

466
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,980
you're one of the new
guys were essentially,

467
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,221
you know,

468
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:43,490
your,

469
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,510
you do everything,

470
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,781
you know,

471
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,310
you're not,

472
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,580
you're not a specialist.

473
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,410
Yeah.

474
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,550
I,

475
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,383
yeah,

476
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,650
yeah,

477
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,483
I think so.

478
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,331
Yeah.

479
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:50,541
I mean,

480
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,590
I rest of my life and then,

481
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:51,850
uh,

482
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,190
you know,

483
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,871
actually it was,

484
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:57,871
it was my coach actually who made it
better because my started a training what

485
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,131
mixed martial arts.

486
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,150
He literally was like,

487
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
I would take everyone down.

488
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,761
Am I off?

489
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,140
This is easy to deal with Mario.

490
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,063
And he's like,

491
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,760
no,

492
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:04,831
no,

493
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:04,990
no,

494
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,320
me go.

495
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,030
He's like,

496
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,560
every time you say it takes someone down,

497
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,081
I'm going to stay in,

498
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:08,761
drag it back up.

499
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,720
So yelling how to flight.

500
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,380
I'm like,

501
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,190
oh.

502
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,180
And I just got a crappy out of me for a
while until I started like learning how

503
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,020
to use my hands better than,

504
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,710
than,

505
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,100
you know,

506
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,000
I took a little time off,

507
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,220
just do go and goes boxing
and now here we are.

508
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,233
When did you start?

509
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,793
And then they,

510
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,713
Ooh,

511
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,263
10 years ago,

512
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,743
nine years ago.

513
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,280
That's not that long
when you think about it.

514
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,230
And now you're the UFC heavyweight champ.

515
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,600
I took a year and a half
off just for boxing.

516
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,703
Really?

517
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Just to learn how to
use your hands better.

518
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,493
Yeah,

519
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,640
it's probably a good move.

520
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:38,980
Right?

521
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,421
That was great.

522
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,254
Best,

523
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,710
best move.

524
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,040
I did.

525
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,840
Especially coming in with
a wrestling background,

526
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,910
but you have an overall
athletic background too.

527
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:46,500
Like you paid paid baseball,

528
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:46,891
you know,

529
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,031
you,

530
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:47,520
you were,

531
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,900
you were a multisport guy.

532
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,351
Yeah,

533
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,184
I tried.

534
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,241
I tried,

535
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,074
but uh,

536
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:52,381
yeah,

537
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:52,630
you know,

538
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,371
I definitely wrestle.

539
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:53,730
Uh,

540
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,563
you know,

541
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,920
the rest and does help me out.

542
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,210
You know,

543
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,300
Imma make sure you use that and you know,

544
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,000
I think baseball definitely
helps me out too,

545
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,760
just because of the reaction and the
way he uses my hips and stuff like that.

546
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:03,181
It definitely,

547
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,560
it definitely martial arts.

548
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,831
Yeah.

549
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,640
I would imagine.

550
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:05,820
Yeah.

551
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,510
I think that having a bunch
of different skills like uh,

552
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,750
like have you uh,

553
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,280
you,

554
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,270
I'm sure you're a boxing fan.

555
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,090
Did you watch the Loma Chenko
a got it gets fucking amazing.

556
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:15,211
What?

557
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:15,511
Gandhi.

558
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:15,930
I'll file.

559
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,830
I'm going to want to share.

560
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,241
Oh yeah.

561
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,110
He was wearing a sweater.

562
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,140
Go fucking crazy.

563
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,951
Chicago was okay.

564
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,221
I'm good.

565
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:21,054
There you go.

566
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,763
I mean,

567
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,560
what I thought was fascinating
about the commentary,

568
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,960
they were talking about
how his dad making him,

569
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,980
made him take four years off
and just do Ukrainian dancing.

570
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,960
That's how he got his foot work.

571
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,410
Really?

572
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,130
Yeah.

573
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,911
His father said,

574
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:36,810
do you want to be a fighter?

575
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,141
And he goes,

576
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:37,321
well,

577
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,830
you're going to take four years off
of fighting and just learn traditional

578
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,060
Ukrainian dancing.

579
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,060
Yeah.

580
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,730
I mean,

581
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,870
his fucking father is a wizard man.

582
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,203
Right.

583
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,163
Nailed it.

584
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:49,960
Nailed it.

585
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,560
I mean they,

586
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,731
you know,

587
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:51,600
they asked his dad like,

588
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,190
when did you know that it
was going to be the champion?

589
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,540
He said before he was conceived,

590
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,670
Holy Shit,

591
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,170
that's some Russian chair,

592
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,570
Ukrainian dark,

593
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:01,341
my God,

594
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,060
late Soviet Union type shit.

595
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,520
Watching that guy through
lots of that dude.

596
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,441
It's like,

597
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,250
it's like,

598
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,001
it's like poetry.

599
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,670
I don't know,

600
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,340
it's just,

601
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,800
he's like,

602
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,940
oh everything.

603
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,880
Even body shots like it slides
out of the way a body shot.

604
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,990
He slides out of the way.

605
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,480
A body shots the way like a Muy
Thai guy slides away from leg kicks.

606
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:19,770
Yeah.

607
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,401
You know what I'm saying?

608
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:24,390
Like he's just moved so much different
than anybody I've ever seen box before.

609
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:24,920
And they're like,

610
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
well his last four points,

611
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,520
the coaches through the towelette this,

612
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,111
fuck this,

613
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:30,990
this is terrible.

614
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:31,711
I was fucking that dude.

615
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,280
I'd be like,

616
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,070
I'm done.

617
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,903
I want to walk her ring.

618
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,670
I wouldn't go around and I'm like,

619
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,720
we'll call it best.

620
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,370
I'm wondering what,

621
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,540
I think he's one of those guys,

622
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,620
it's like a bar raiser,

623
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:40,951
right?

624
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,580
Like where he's just raised the bar
where people look at what footwork is and

625
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,450
they look at that guy and go,

626
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:46,080
okay,

627
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,840
this is not just like moving around a lot.

628
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,520
Everything's so purposeful.

629
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,200
Like when he turned around them,

630
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,030
when Regati out,

631
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,950
like he put his hand on his head
and then spun all the way around.

632
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,460
We're going to,

633
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:57,761
I was like,

634
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,710
what in the fuck is going on here?

635
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,551
He's a smaller guy.

636
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,090
Yes.

637
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,923
What's going on?

638
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,950
That's crazy.

639
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:03,784
Like mind blowing.

640
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,091
Yeah,

641
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,810
because it's not like he got
out like struck by a bigger,

642
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,220
heavier power puncher.

643
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,130
Now you've got the shitbox doubt about it,

644
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,401
but he was just pop,

645
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:12,611
pop,

646
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,570
Double Jab pup up.

647
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,230
Oh,

648
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,063
it's over here.

649
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,703
I mean,

650
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,300
I just like watching that guy.

651
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:19,511
I mean,

652
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:19,841
sorry,

653
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm trying to comfortable here.

654
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,430
Ah,

655
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,640
yeah.

656
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,020
I mean just it's that guy just,

657
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:23,790
it's like I'm,

658
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,750
I'm so happy to be alive to watch this.

659
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:27,941
I was there,

660
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:28,774
you know what I mean?

661
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,750
I watch videos and they got
all dairy is right there.

662
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,050
Yeah.

663
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,050
I mean just the fucking
guy barely gets hit.

664
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,910
I mean there's no one like him in boxing
because what he's doing is he standing

665
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,670
literally right in front of
you and he's unavailable.

666
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,630
It's not like he's like dancing
all over the place and moving away.

667
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,020
He's doing some shit and it doing it
in a way that nobody else is doing.

668
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:55,021
Like Floyd had lotta shoulder rolls
and he's slick as fuck and Floyd stands

669
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,170
right in front of you too.

670
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,060
And He ties people up and shit.

671
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,860
But what Loma Chenko is doing is
just some total next level shit.

672
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,573
What he does,

673
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,910
his hand in hand drops.

674
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,400
You don't care.

675
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,601
You know,

676
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,590
he knows he can get out of the way.

677
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,071
Yeah.

678
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,960
He does a lot of very interesting stuff.

679
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:13,900
But I'm wondering like if we're
going to see this in the future now,

680
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,230
I mean,

681
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,561
you know,

682
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:16,110
obviously when Ali came along,

683
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,970
bunch of guys started imitating Ali.

684
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,270
Yeah.

685
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,511
You know,

686
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:19,420
and Tyson came along,

687
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,800
bunch of guys tried to imitate Tyson.

688
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,670
You always see that.

689
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,750
I wonder how many guys were going to
figure out a way to take that to the next

690
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:26,560
level.

691
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:26,920
Yeah,

692
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,753
I think,

693
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,031
you know,

694
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,300
I think some guys are going to
take it to like not to that.

695
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,750
I mean I don't know if everyone's
going to catch that level.

696
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,980
That's just,

697
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,420
well that you know what the next level
is that but with like Roy Jones Jr power.

698
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,110
Yeah.

699
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,030
You know what I mean?

700
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,810
Think if someone figures out a way to
move like that with that kind of footwork.

701
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,160
But that one punch,

702
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:45,994
go to sleep,

703
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,850
you know,

704
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,770
knock out power.

705
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,633
That'd be sick.

706
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah.

707
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,980
That's probably the next level.

708
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,240
Hopefully I'm alive for that too.

709
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,813
We'll see it.

710
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,280
I mean this is a amazing time for,

711
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,020
for all combat sports I think.

712
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,010
I think the bar,

713
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,570
like I think with all sports,

714
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:01,871
right?

715
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,420
Like if you look back at the olden
days and you look back at today,

716
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,350
the athletes are bigger.

717
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,370
They don't know how to train better,

718
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,204
they're faster.

719
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,540
But I think anywhere that's
more apparent than MMA,

720
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,600
I feel like MMA is like the best
example because it's so new.

721
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:13,901
Yeah.

722
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:14,570
I'll have her send it.

723
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,403
Even like you said,

724
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,290
it's always something always evolving.

725
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:17,531
Like,

726
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:17,770
you know,

727
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean like,

728
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,600
like was it John Jones,

729
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,820
you said a teeth to thei think that,

730
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,100
you know,

731
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,150
got a couple years ago and then they
started when we started doing it.

732
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,120
And then you're like
Benson Henderson doing,

733
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,810
you know what I mean?

734
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,643
Just,

735
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,640
I dunno,

736
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,190
I just,

737
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,140
I just love it because
it's always evolving,

738
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,321
you know?

739
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:32,900
I mean you were like,

740
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,010
you literally cannot take like two months
off and if you do it people are going

741
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:36,844
to pass you off.

742
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,331
Yeah.

743
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,320
And it's interesting too,

744
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,000
it's like there's different
schools of thought,

745
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:40,271
right?

746
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:44,410
There's like the Aka school where you
have all these killers in one room and you

747
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:49,411
have like world champions beaten up world
champions and then you have your gym,

748
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,430
which is much more specialized.

749
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,100
You know,

750
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,470
it's like you're the big
guy to emerge from your gym.

751
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:55,490
And then it's been Jessica,

752
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:59,060
I and some other high level MMA
fighters coming out of your gym.

753
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,260
But that's a,

754
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,090
like a lot of people think
that's the way to go.

755
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,170
To have specialized training.

756
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:06,500
Like Max Holloway has
specialized training where like,

757
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,010
you know,

758
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,843
there's not,

759
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,040
you're not dealing with a bunch
of people that are already champs.

760
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,270
You're building champs.

761
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,950
Yeah,

762
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,460
that's right.

763
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,890
We're a lot like at my gym is awesome.

764
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,300
Like my coach Marcus
Mare Ma Marinelli yeah.

765
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,620
It's like all home grown man.

766
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:18,940
Guys come in and he
just makes them better.

767
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:19,774
We all,

768
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,053
uh,

769
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,820
you know,

770
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,440
even like,

771
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,620
you know,

772
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,420
I don't get any specialized
training like anyone else.

773
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:25,121
Like I don't go out,

774
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:25,490
you know,

775
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,100
everything's pushed aside because the guy,

776
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:27,281
you know,

777
00:15:27,281 --> 00:15:27,530
like,

778
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,690
like if he's got to fight,

779
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,910
they're going first and then I go,

780
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:31,091
you know,

781
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:31,170
I'm,

782
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,600
I'm,

783
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,710
I'm not better than anyone else.

784
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:33,400
Yes.

785
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,001
He weight champ.

786
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:34,240
I don't,

787
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,051
I don't look at it that way.

788
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:35,591
I look at like,

789
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:35,771
all right,

790
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:36,610
you got a fight coming up,

791
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:37,444
you go first,

792
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,840
we'll push my training back later.

793
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:38,981
I,

794
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:39,161
you know,

795
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:39,241
like,

796
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,074
I don't care.

797
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,571
But yeah,

798
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:40,781
like,

799
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:41,020
uh,

800
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,170
it,

801
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:41,401
it's,

802
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:42,041
it's great watching,

803
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,760
like,

804
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,090
you know,

805
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,511
our gym,

806
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,210
like guys coming in,

807
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,461
they're like,

808
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:45,611
oh,

809
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,444
Hey island chain.

810
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,970
And I was thinking like to come out
like a few months later and you guys are

811
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:49,571
killing it and you're like,

812
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:50,051
Jesus,

813
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:50,321
like,

814
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:50,441
you know,

815
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:50,711
we have a,

816
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,300
we have a Kenyan Alexia,

817
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,340
I two have 500 kids in animal.

818
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,720
Like he keeps me young.

819
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,863
I had to like,

820
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,340
he's like,

821
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,160
he just turned pro.

822
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,370
He was third pro fight.

823
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:00,701
And I'm like,

824
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,181
God Dang,

825
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:01,901
I come in some days.

826
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:02,734
I'm like,

827
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:03,940
all right,

828
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,720
isn't it an interesting
how there's guys like that?

829
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,310
And then Jim,

830
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,510
and then for whatever reason,

831
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:08,470
it never clicked for them.

832
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:11,500
Like there's some guys that
are just so insanely talented,

833
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,800
but they just don't have whatever it is,

834
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:15,900
whether it's focus,

835
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,240
the,

836
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,240
whether it's the discipline to keep going
when things get weird to just finally

837
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,140
realized their potential.

838
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,780
Like what separates a guy like that?

839
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,790
That's like a gym killer from a guy like
you who can perform one of the bright

840
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:31,624
lights.

841
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,073
You know,

842
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,011
when I,

843
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:35,640
uh,

844
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,091
when I was fighting,

845
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:36,520
you got to see,

846
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,710
and I don't mean the whole story here,

847
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:38,240
but,

848
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,190
so I was thinking on fighting.

849
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,470
I,

850
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,600
I was like nine,

851
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:40,770
no,

852
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,730
I lost the struve and I,

853
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:41,911
you know,

854
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,470
I thought I was unstoppable
and it's true of beat me.

855
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:44,304
I'm like,

856
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,660
I almost didn't want to fight anymore.

857
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:45,931
I was like,

858
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,190
I don't know if I'm
ready for this anymore.

859
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:50,190
And then came back forward and Nelson,

860
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,200
y'all got a couple more fights
and then I lost the jds and Lilly,

861
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,900
when I walked in my
bag and my locker room,

862
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:55,441
I was just like,

863
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:55,911
I'm down.

864
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,161
And I'm like,

865
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:56,970
I don't even care anymore.

866
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,380
Like I don't even care what happens.

867
00:16:58,381 --> 00:16:58,981
I'm gonna go out there,

868
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:01,530
I'm going to train and I don't
want to do is put it all out there.

869
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:01,741
But when,

870
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,300
when I'm gonna lose and
I don't really care,

871
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,470
it is going to happen.

872
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:04,970
It's gonna happen,

873
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,250
you know,

874
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,830
but I'm going to go out there and get
my damn this to win and want to do

875
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,110
whatever we gotta do
and I just don't care.

876
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:10,921
So,

877
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:11,390
but some,

878
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,170
so something switched in your head.

879
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,411
We,

880
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,460
you can kind of see it like
when you're doing this,

881
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,020
one of the things I've
always said about you,

882
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:19,590
but when you walk out the fights
and during the stare down,

883
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,360
you're like stoic.

884
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,990
You're like,

885
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,280
you give them dead eyes.

886
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,361
You just like you,

887
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,021
like you're there.

888
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:25,411
Here we go.

889
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,490
Like when you fought for doom,

890
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,310
when you fought for Doman Brazil and
knocked him out in the first round,

891
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,160
it's like you look at it your
face while you're standing there,

892
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:32,711
it's like you,

893
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,680
you might be waiting in line
at the fucking car wash,

894
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,311
you know?

895
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:35,491
I mean,

896
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,420
you could be anywhere.

897
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,580
You're not,

898
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,981
you don't,

899
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:39,240
you're not mean mugging him.

900
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,480
You,

901
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,800
you've,

902
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,840
you almost got like that fate or
face going on or you're just like,

903
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:42,961
hey,

904
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:43,550
we are.

905
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:43,751
Yeah.

906
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:44,010
You know,

907
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,370
I get,

908
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,530
I think at the dead fish from my,

909
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,530
when my wife yells at me,

910
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,363
no,

911
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,700
no,

912
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:51,930
no.

913
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,200
I,

914
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,720
yeah,

915
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:52,990
yeah,

916
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,360
yeah.

917
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,670
Just,

918
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:53,881
you know,

919
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:54,181
I just,

920
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:54,840
I looked at it a lot.

921
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,130
Really.

922
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,410
I was,

923
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,131
I just stopped caring.

924
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:56,401
I'm like,

925
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:56,671
you know what,

926
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm not going to like over
like get emotional about stuff.

927
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:00,151
Like,

928
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:00,571
I don't care.

929
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:01,201
Like all I care about,

930
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,620
I was like,

931
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,220
I'm married,

932
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,090
I got a beautiful wife,

933
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,050
she takes care of me.

934
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,221
End of the day,

935
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,480
no matter what happens in this fight game,

936
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,321
she's going to be there for me.

937
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,630
She likes me for who I am,

938
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,980
not because I find she likes me,

939
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,461
cause you know,

940
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:12,151
I make her laugh.

941
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:12,370
I,

942
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,540
you know,

943
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,261
do good things for her.

944
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:13,710
She does good.

945
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,010
I mean,

946
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,700
just like,

947
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,451
like a marriage should be.

948
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,380
And you know,

949
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:16,650
and like,

950
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:16,961
she,

951
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,050
she was there before all this,

952
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:18,360
you know,

953
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,270
all this stuff happened.

954
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:19,860
So like,

955
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,693
she's not like a,

956
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,440
what do they call it?

957
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,170
Uh,

958
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,600
what's that?

959
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,120
What's the goal?

960
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,450
Digger.

961
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,110
Gary Go.

962
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,560
Yeah,

963
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,393
I called them.

964
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,131
I would think of that.

965
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:26,790
I'm an idiot.

966
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,091
But I,

967
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:27,241
yeah,

968
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:27,751
something like that,

969
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:27,951
you know?

970
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:29,220
And she's been there the
whole time and you know,

971
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,060
that's what I love about her and,

972
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,721
you know,

973
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,410
and I just stopped looking,

974
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,243
anchored.

975
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,700
Yeah.

976
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:32,911
Yeah.

977
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:33,090
You know,

978
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,781
I just stopped caring.

979
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:34,111
I just like,

980
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,941
who cares if I lose,

981
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:35,551
I lose beyond.

982
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:36,384
I'm going to go out there,

983
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,160
but I'm,

984
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,810
I'm very competitive so I'm gonna go out
there and do everything I need to win.

985
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,410
Yeah.

986
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,230
Randy couture said that once he
was talking to young fighters,

987
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,420
you know,

988
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,470
saying you can't be worried about losing
the people who love you are always

989
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,020
going to love you,

990
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,150
not going to lose anything.

991
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:49,500
You're just going to lose a contest.

992
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,850
And if you're to ring into something
like a mixed martial arts fight,

993
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,630
someone's got to win and someone's going
to lose and you've got to learn from

994
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,060
those losses and you know,

995
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,350
some of those losses,

996
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,460
that devastating feeling like I'm sure
it was there for you after this true

997
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:10,290
fight that the rebuild from that
is what makes real champions.

998
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,940
Yeah,

999
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,773
definitely.

1000
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,210
It helped build them a model
that she took my mom there,

1001
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,240
she didn't go to the fight.

1002
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:17,340
She never seen me fight.

1003
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:17,940
But like,

1004
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,450
so you're not,

1005
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:18,721
you know,

1006
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,670
in London they got those
big double decker buses.

1007
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,120
Right.

1008
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,620
So we're going back into my head like,

1009
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,280
oh man,

1010
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,120
like it's throbbing you.

1011
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:24,391
I'm like,

1012
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:24,781
Oh God,

1013
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,291
this sucks.

1014
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,220
I'm driving back and my Koser next thing,

1015
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,480
when he was trying make me laugh of all
center talking and I look out the window

1016
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,510
at the hotel and my mom
spoke to graduate like,

1017
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,231
sure.

1018
00:19:33,231 --> 00:19:34,064
Like

1019
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm like,

1020
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,211
I looked to my buddies,

1021
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:36,421
I'm like,

1022
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:36,540
man,

1023
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,380
I'm fucking high school right now.

1024
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:37,531
Like,

1025
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,191
who does that?

1026
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:38,371
You know,

1027
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,150
and I get that great.

1028
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:39,421
They're like,

1029
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:39,961
made me feel better.

1030
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:40,230
Like,

1031
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,801
like you said,

1032
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:41,910
like no matter what happens,

1033
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,380
you know,

1034
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,213
always going to be,

1035
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,000
you know,

1036
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,850
someone's going to be there no
matter what happens to the Oregon.

1037
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,703
Love you no matter what.

1038
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,020
Yeah.

1039
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,320
Your family's always your family,

1040
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:49,681
your friends,

1041
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,311
always your friends.

1042
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:50,911
And if they're not,

1043
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,500
they would never really your
friends in the first place.

1044
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,300
You'd probably better off that way.

1045
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:57,240
Sometimes it's good to have some losses
just so you realize who's just going to

1046
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:57,990
abandon you.

1047
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,231
Yeah.

1048
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,120
Right now it makes sense.

1049
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,133
So do you,

1050
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,270
do you have any mental coaching?

1051
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,901
The Do,

1052
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:04,081
do,

1053
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,100
do anything like that?

1054
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:05,560
Uh,

1055
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,061
I did.

1056
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:07,950
I did for a little bit back in the day.

1057
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,310
Uh,

1058
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,270
after that.

1059
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,173
That is true fight.

1060
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,030
I think it was a street.

1061
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,670
I talked to the sports psychologist,

1062
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,780
which it turned into about
a minute talking about
fighting the next was about my

1063
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:19,300
personal life.

1064
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,310
Had nothing to do with sports.

1065
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:22,390
It's just really just all it talked about.

1066
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:22,750
It just,

1067
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,060
it was just by half an hour.

1068
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:24,600
Just,

1069
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,430
I did it a few times.

1070
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,110
I walked there every time and that's
when I started getting an entire like,

1071
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,070
why do I care anymore?

1072
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,300
Like,

1073
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,990
and stop caring and that
and I don't carry more like,

1074
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,400
like what,

1075
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,160
what was he trying to cheat sheet?

1076
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:35,431
Sorry,

1077
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm a sexist.

1078
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,390
I took immediately as soon as
the next person must be a man.

1079
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,080
How could a woman no in anything

1080
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,860
such a piece of shit.

1081
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,160
What do you think when you think about,

1082
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,640
uh,

1083
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,500
like your,

1084
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,210
that's,

1085
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,050
that's a critical component in the
keeping your mental state together,

1086
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:53,321
right?

1087
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:54,640
That's one of the things that uh,

1088
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,680
a lot of people will talk about.

1089
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,380
Like the having a good
support group around you,

1090
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,610
having a support system,

1091
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,211
family,

1092
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:01,721
friends,

1093
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,860
real loved ones.

1094
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,650
So in her examining that,

1095
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,040
do you think she was trying to like
reinforce like what matters and what's

1096
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:09,874
important?

1097
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:10,691
You know,

1098
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,400
I never actually thought
about it that way.

1099
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,310
She just nosy maybe.

1100
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:15,911
But I've known her,

1101
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:17,970
I've known her for awhile now.

1102
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,241
Shit.

1103
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:18,670
Like we know.

1104
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,440
I know.

1105
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
Uh,

1106
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,351
she,

1107
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:20,751
I don't know.

1108
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:21,340
I don't,

1109
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,731
you know,

1110
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,190
I thought about it,

1111
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,860
but we just started talking
and she'd just be like,

1112
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:26,080
so let's talk.

1113
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,441
And I'm like,

1114
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:26,580
right.

1115
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:26,951
And I said,

1116
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:27,521
talking about fighting,

1117
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:27,761
I'm like,

1118
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:28,061
Yo,

1119
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:28,831
this and that.

1120
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:29,664
And then I'd be like,

1121
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:29,970
no,

1122
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,980
I got my girlfriend into the
girl at the town was loose,

1123
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,250
she's doing this then it,

1124
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:33,680
you know what I mean?

1125
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,513
And she's like,

1126
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,643
she likes,

1127
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,903
you know what I mean?

1128
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,450
Nobody.

1129
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:39,941
But with lily,

1130
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,541
I walked down,

1131
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,180
I felt like so much better and not
even just because of the financial,

1132
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,480
I think it needed to
clear all our stuff out.

1133
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,080
Just needed like mine straight.

1134
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,000
They say that for people to go to shrinks.

1135
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,800
Like if you go to a psychiatrist,

1136
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,371
I never gone.

1137
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,950
But if you go like the best
thing is just to talk about it.

1138
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,050
Like most people just keep
things bottled up inside.

1139
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,930
They don't have anybody to talk to
about a lot of the shit that's going on

1140
00:21:58,931 --> 00:21:59,764
inside their head.

1141
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,310
Yeah.

1142
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,660
That was my problem when
I was younger actually.

1143
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:01,960
I,

1144
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,240
you know,

1145
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,910
like especially like my wife,

1146
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,930
one thing that made us better was
that I communicate because I was like,

1147
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,561
she'd get mad at me,

1148
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,394
I'm like

1149
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,400
holy.

1150
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,730
And finally one day I would like the how.

1151
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,460
She's like,

1152
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,920
Whoa,

1153
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,200
Whoa,

1154
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,550
whoa.

1155
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,520
That was like two weeks ago,

1156
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,660
like called boundary,

1157
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,643
you know what I mean?

1158
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,410
I was like,

1159
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,221
well you told me that,

1160
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:21,521
you know,

1161
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:25,390
and then now and now it's just talking
to that lady and just opening up more

1162
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:26,380
than just when something bothers me.

1163
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:26,540
I,

1164
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:26,920
you know,

1165
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,180
she hates it now cause I'm like,

1166
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,014
listen,

1167
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,610
you know you need to do this.

1168
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:30,910
Like,

1169
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,100
you know,

1170
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,331
she's like,

1171
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:31,601
oh,

1172
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:31,900
what's up?

1173
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,351
Tough guy.

1174
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:32,940
You know,

1175
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,220
you're a full time firefighter too,

1176
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,630
as well as being the UFC
heavyweight champion.

1177
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:37,990
How does,

1178
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,160
how do you balance that?

1179
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,371
Well,

1180
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:39,921
I'm part time.

1181
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:41,140
I actually had two departments.

1182
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:41,541
Oh,

1183
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:41,781
okay.

1184
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:41,950
You know,

1185
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,783
but just uh,

1186
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,401
he's just tough.

1187
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:44,210
It can be in full time.

1188
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,300
Yeah.

1189
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,580
I didn't get hired full time so
I couldn't be tough to do both.

1190
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:49,200
You know,

1191
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,530
if I did before I'd be a lot easier.

1192
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:53,680
But I can't just take a test because
you have to probation and year long and

1193
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:54,251
then you can't.

1194
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:54,700
Right.

1195
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,960
So while you're fighting,

1196
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:56,980
you work part time.

1197
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,840
And do you have it set up where you know,

1198
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,100
like you tell them in advance like,

1199
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:00,311
hey,

1200
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:02,080
I got a January 20th fight.

1201
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,273
Yup.

1202
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,600
I already picked my schedule.

1203
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,790
So a month in advance,

1204
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:11,170
like one station and I pick it within the
first week I picked my whole the whole

1205
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,930
month and then the next
station we go like,

1206
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:14,200
you know,

1207
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,033
seniority.

1208
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,440
So when I come up I pick my
schedule so I make sure that,

1209
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,303
you know,

1210
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,211
it's when he picked out.

1211
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:24,190
So I really work by five
times in about two weeks now.

1212
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,880
12 hour shift.

1213
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,530
How much does that get in
the way you're training?

1214
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,370
Never.

1215
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:27,850
Never?

1216
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,330
Nope.

1217
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,163
No.

1218
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,273
How's that work?

1219
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,990
Just because the way I picked my schedule,

1220
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:32,411
if I had to do,

1221
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,430
I could trade someone and someone's
coming in and make it work and they're,

1222
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:36,670
they're,

1223
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,570
they're amazing people.

1224
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,040
Both stations were amazing.

1225
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:39,221
They're,

1226
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,090
the chiefs are great.

1227
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,361
The guys that worked that,

1228
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:43,060
I mean actually a lot of
them are coming to the fight.

1229
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,270
Jerry touring this song.

1230
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,291
Yeah.

1231
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,100
Well that's

1232
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,281
a,

1233
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:49,310
that's an interesting thing
about firefighters is that
a lot of times you get

1234
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,900
those 24 hour shifts,

1235
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,561
you know,

1236
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:52,130
and where,

1237
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,490
you know,

1238
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,780
you get a chance to work out,

1239
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,643
you can cook,

1240
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,483
you know,

1241
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,600
hanging out with guys.

1242
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,530
It's like once the,

1243
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,120
the duties are done around the firehouse,

1244
00:23:59,121 --> 00:23:59,540
right?

1245
00:23:59,540 --> 00:23:59,691
Yeah.

1246
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,100
I play a lot of call of duty two.

1247
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,963
Yeah.

1248
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,850
They're losing a 10 year old kid.

1249
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,950
It's a crazy job because when,

1250
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,230
when you have to do something,

1251
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:12,680
what you have to do is so extreme and
what's demanded of you is just insane.

1252
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:15,830
Like I'm sure you've been paying attention
to what's going on just a few miles

1253
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,420
from here in Ventura.

1254
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,780
It's out of control nor,

1255
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:21,020
it's crazy is that we just went past,

1256
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,970
there was at Getty Boulevard Getty Center.

1257
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,640
It looked like it was like,

1258
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,450
I'm forgetting and then we just
pass it today and it was like burnt,

1259
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,180
you know,

1260
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,571
it was not,

1261
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:30,440
it's like a couple of days ago.

1262
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,211
That's what it will look like.

1263
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:32,420
I mean it was like shocking.

1264
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,370
Well La is a fucking mess.

1265
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:34,911
You know,

1266
00:24:34,911 --> 00:24:38,300
the beautiful thing about California is
we don't have any weather in it never

1267
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:38,631
rains.

1268
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:41,780
But the terrible thing is once it
gets crispy and the other night,

1269
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:41,991
you know,

1270
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,220
when this was all happening,

1271
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,701
uh,

1272
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:46,200
I was at my house and the
wind was blowing like we did.

1273
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:49,880
They were calling it a dry hurricane
because the wind was so crazy.

1274
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,910
Trees were falling down all over
the place and the thought was,

1275
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:53,330
man,

1276
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,920
if a fire gets lit here,

1277
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,993
we're fucked.

1278
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,721
And then boom,

1279
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,620
they start popping up.

1280
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,570
There was a natural like from different,

1281
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,423
no,

1282
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,633
I don't think so.

1283
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,410
I think there's a lot
of psychos out there.

1284
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,950
I think there's a lot of fucking people
that recognize these are crazy fire

1285
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,510
conditions and they just want a light,

1286
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:09,350
something on fire.

1287
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,970
And they do and they step away.

1288
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,170
And then next thing you know,

1289
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:14,240
it's a 300,000 acre fire.

1290
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,290
It's crazy.

1291
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,730
There's accidents for sure.

1292
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,210
But I think for sure some of this
is arson within a day or two.

1293
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,053
All those ones.

1294
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,131
That's kind of,

1295
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:22,964
how is that possible?

1296
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,870
Yeah.

1297
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,640
There's a bunch of
fucking psychos out there.

1298
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,420
That's what I think.

1299
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,890
I think there's definitely some accidents
and obviously those wins exacerbate

1300
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:32,390
anything that would
have been a small fire.

1301
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,060
Like there was a small fire in my
neighborhood a couple of months ago,

1302
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,620
but it wasn't winning.

1303
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,840
The firefighters jumped on it
quick and they put the house down.

1304
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:39,590
Um,

1305
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,423
but man,

1306
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,260
when the winds were the way they were,

1307
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:44,420
when you were having chunks of
embers that were flying six,

1308
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:45,620
700 yards away,

1309
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,730
flying through the air,

1310
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,900
this and that and everywhere,

1311
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:49,250
there was no way they
can stay on top of it.

1312
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,190
That's,

1313
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,840
that's,

1314
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,770
that's like scary.

1315
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,220
You know what I mean?

1316
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,780
They're fine.

1317
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:52,890
Like,

1318
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,271
we don't want,

1319
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:53,630
I mean,

1320
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,770
we have like brush fires.

1321
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,521
Yeah.

1322
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,110
Well that's a good thing about Ohio.

1323
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,990
We are right now we've got,

1324
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,360
think we got like six or seven inches.

1325
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,100
Yeah.

1326
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,680
The snow.

1327
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,460
So yeah.

1328
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:01,851
Listen,

1329
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,170
man snow,

1330
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,370
you just need snow tires,

1331
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,270
you know,

1332
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,103
warm clothes,

1333
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,831
no tires.

1334
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,810
You're good fucking firestorm.

1335
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,220
It's not good.

1336
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:10,970
Yeah.

1337
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,470
I mean that,

1338
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:11,700
that's,

1339
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,380
that's like,

1340
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,041
Oh God,

1341
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:13,731
that's scary man.

1342
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:14,430
Like just,

1343
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,720
just reading about it and just
seeing it and seeing the pictures.

1344
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,000
Just,

1345
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,181
you know,

1346
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:18,170
you feel terrible for people.

1347
00:26:18,171 --> 00:26:18,321
You know,

1348
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:19,430
we actually have friends in San Diego.

1349
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:21,080
They had to get evacuated.

1350
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,620
He said there was 85% chance that
their house would be be be gone.

1351
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,201
Jesus.

1352
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:27,860
He came back and within a 10th
of a mile of the fire stopped.

1353
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,931
They're got lucky.

1354
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:29,370
Yeah.

1355
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,590
I've been evacuated twice.

1356
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,783
That's scary.

1357
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,391
Yeah.

1358
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:32,901
It's scary.

1359
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:33,321
But you know,

1360
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,490
you just got to get out quick,

1361
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:35,510
throw the dogs in the back,

1362
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,390
let's go fuck it.

1363
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,310
You know,

1364
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,450
part of it's like cleansing.

1365
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:38,621
Look,

1366
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:40,340
all that stuff in your house is not you.

1367
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,080
You're fucking TV or your clothes.

1368
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:42,651
That's not you.

1369
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:42,840
You're,

1370
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,270
you.

1371
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:43,580
Yeah,

1372
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,070
you'll be all right.

1373
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,760
Which I listen,

1374
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
I always buy a new one.

1375
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:45,961
Yeah.

1376
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,190
Just fucking stay with your
grandmother for a while.

1377
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,283
You'd be fine.

1378
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,180
Everybody live.

1379
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,530
As long as you get out,

1380
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:53,130
you're all right.

1381
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,990
You'll be able to rebuild and get back.

1382
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,950
It's sometimes it's a,

1383
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,401
I mean,

1384
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,890
it's not a good thing to lose
everything that you work for,

1385
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,500
but sometimes it's a good thing
to know that you are vulnerable,

1386
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,191
you know,

1387
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:02,761
like in these,

1388
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:03,481
these fires,

1389
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:07,200
like I think it's one thing
that La is missing is um,

1390
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,420
humility that's brought on by the weather.

1391
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,261
I like,

1392
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,860
you know how it is an in Cleveland when
it fucking snow's right when it snows

1393
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:15,780
out and it's thick.

1394
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,930
There's that feeling in the
air where everybody calms down.

1395
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,040
Right?

1396
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,640
Everybody's like,

1397
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,210
okay,

1398
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,180
like there's no one driving like a
fucking crazy psychopath when it's snow.

1399
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,650
Everybody's going real,

1400
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:26,700
kind of slow,

1401
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,570
slow and steady.

1402
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,430
Your back tires are
kicking out a little bit.

1403
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,211
You know what I mean?

1404
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,044
Like that,

1405
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,340
that keeps people humble.

1406
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,670
Yeah.

1407
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,121
We actually,

1408
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:33,954
uh,

1409
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,470
uh,

1410
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,430
was it the weekend of what it,

1411
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,603
where's One New York,

1412
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,421
Madison Square Garden?

1413
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:40,410
Which means that you'll see what,

1414
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,880
what was that,

1415
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,713
what number was that?

1416
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,050
I don't know.

1417
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,580
Whatever happened,

1418
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,413
whatever,

1419
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,433
whatever it was.

1420
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,520
Um,

1421
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,840
so I'm coming home.

1422
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:49,351
My wife's like,

1423
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:49,651
Hey,

1424
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,010
you know,

1425
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,900
there's a huge storm coming.

1426
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:51,121
Just like,

1427
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:51,341
you know,

1428
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:52,174
all my cool.

1429
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,060
She's caused me again at my house.

1430
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:55,260
We have actually a built in generator,

1431
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,310
so if the power goes out,

1432
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:56,671
oh,

1433
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:57,360
that's nice.

1434
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,901
Sweet Dude.

1435
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:58,530
Awesome.

1436
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,950
So every Saturday I
would hear it kick out.

1437
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:00,181
I'm like,

1438
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,440
awesome to think works great.

1439
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,180
Of course the tower needs to work,

1440
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,650
the power goes out is dead.

1441
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,270
The battery busted on it.

1442
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:06,540
But,

1443
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,260
so we came home and I came home and I
flew home that night and it was like a,

1444
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,860
like a Zombie apocalypse man.

1445
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,170
It was like stuff everywhere.

1446
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:14,100
Like it was all dark.

1447
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,380
There's trees like on top of it was crazy.

1448
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,070
And then they said that 15
ton of tornadoes touched
down within between Indiana,

1449
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:20,431
Ohio,

1450
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:21,180
and uh,

1451
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,013
an IPA.

1452
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,780
And so we came to my house
and there was like half,

1453
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,280
I have one big tree in my yard.

1454
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:30,090
I have eight and a half acres at one big
tree that magically got split in half.

1455
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:30,780
Wow.

1456
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,381
Then our barn,

1457
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:32,010
we have a barn.

1458
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,570
It's like,

1459
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,450
it has like software on the side of that
all got like half of got ripped down

1460
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:36,961
that it was,

1461
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:37,471
it was crazy.

1462
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:37,711
Like,

1463
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,700
I mean there was like so much stuff.

1464
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:40,040
Fine.

1465
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,640
We had a [inaudible]
black got ripped down.

1466
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:41,840
Like,

1467
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,031
you know,

1468
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:42,601
he's like you're saying,

1469
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,261
but yeah.

1470
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:43,690
But it,

1471
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:43,930
you know,

1472
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,391
you said it's,

1473
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,211
it's humbling because you know,

1474
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:46,021
you're not safe.

1475
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,370
So I believe we can find out that the,

1476
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:48,150
uh,

1477
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,410
generated and working
on that we're getting,

1478
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,720
because it actually worked in their day,

1479
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:51,090
the power,

1480
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,730
and it was so windy that the power
went out and actually kicked down.

1481
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:53,941
I was like,

1482
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:54,721
oh yeah,

1483
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,190
there's something that like,

1484
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,610
that's comforting about hearing that.

1485
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,500
When I lived in Colorado,

1486
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,334
we had a generator,

1487
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,510
the power go out and you're

1488
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:02,460
like,

1489
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,293
Ooh,

1490
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,230
I'm okay.

1491
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,153
I'm safe.

1492
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:06,610
Yeah.

1493
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,231
Are you handy?

1494
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,870
Do you fix shit?

1495
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,200
Like buddy,

1496
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,043
my buddy Rick,

1497
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,001
it actually,

1498
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:12,834
he was over the other day.

1499
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,711
I was like,

1500
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:13,891
hey.

1501
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,131
He said,

1502
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:14,551
what's that man?

1503
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:14,731
I'm like,

1504
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:15,110
Hey.

1505
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,351
And I'm like,

1506
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:15,721
what are you doing?

1507
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:15,901
He's like,

1508
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:16,531
I'm calling your house,

1509
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,300
but uh,

1510
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,170
what?

1511
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,391
He's like,

1512
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:19,501
yeah,

1513
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:19,911
talk to her.

1514
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:20,940
Why she needed to fix something.

1515
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:21,121
I'm like,

1516
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:21,361
all right,

1517
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:21,481
cool.

1518
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:22,314
I'll see you at the gym.

1519
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,450
She comes over and does that for me.

1520
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:24,570
Oh,

1521
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:24,751
I mean,

1522
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:25,471
I do help them out,

1523
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:26,161
but it's mostly,

1524
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:26,910
it's all him.

1525
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,743
He'll lucky,

1526
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,590
lucky.

1527
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,820
Didn't know someone who could fix shit.

1528
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,030
Yeah,

1529
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,990
I'm terrible at that stuff,

1530
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:31,141
man.

1531
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm like,

1532
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,820
I make it worse.

1533
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,241
Well,

1534
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,540
especially if you live in a place
like where there's fucking tornadoes,

1535
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,231
like can you,

1536
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:39,060
is there a tornado proof house?

1537
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:40,620
Can you make a house like a number,

1538
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:41,560
like three little pigs.

1539
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,840
You remember like the guy with the bricks,

1540
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,221
you can make it,

1541
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,330
you have to figure it out or you can
make a little shout out to the ground,

1542
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:46,661
I guess.

1543
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:47,470
I don't know.

1544
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,400
I don't like a little,

1545
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,910
like a little doors and I have no idea.

1546
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,150
Right.

1547
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,680
Like wizard of Oz type shit I guess.

1548
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,514
Yeah.

1549
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,060
Yeah.

1550
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,660
You'd have to go,

1551
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,110
you'd have to make something that
like was underground some underground.

1552
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,340
Does it do to have that member?

1553
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,540
Remember when we were kids,

1554
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,190
like a lot of guys had a,

1555
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,510
like not a lot of guys,

1556
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,620
but people were talking about building
bomb shelters in their backyard.

1557
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:07,840
Yeah.

1558
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,020
That was like a big kind of day.

1559
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,701
I kinda like that thing.

1560
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:10,320
Yeah,

1561
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:10,820
yeah,

1562
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,061
yeah.

1563
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:11,170
I,

1564
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,430
well my basement's print,

1565
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,101
it's not bad.

1566
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:13,210
It's,

1567
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,040
it's got a few like cinder windows,

1568
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,160
like the right,

1569
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,541
whatever.

1570
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,171
That's about it.

1571
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:17,620
I mean,

1572
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,790
so you'll probably survive down there.

1573
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,750
Plus we have like a little area and then
two with like with like the furnace and

1574
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:26,410
stuff so he can hide in
there and nothing will,

1575
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,760
do you workout at home at all?

1576
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,270
No.

1577
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,511
God,

1578
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:28,870
no,

1579
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,260
no.

1580
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,891
I actually,

1581
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:30,724
I have a,

1582
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,960
I have a 300 square foot barn with Raby
heats was like warm all year round.

1583
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,291
You know,

1584
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,124
it's awesome.

1585
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,521
And it was like,

1586
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:36,821
dude,

1587
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:38,110
you should put a cage
in there as a training.

1588
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:38,411
I'm like,

1589
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,111
Hell No.

1590
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:39,310
I'm like,

1591
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,240
this is my sanctuary.

1592
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,051
This is where I go.

1593
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:44,530
And I watch TV and I
relax and I do fun stuff.

1594
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:44,771
You know,

1595
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:45,580
like,

1596
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:45,881
no,

1597
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm not bringing anything.

1598
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,261
My wife does,

1599
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:47,591
my wife,

1600
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:47,800
you know,

1601
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,480
she has a some honest stuff.

1602
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:49,771
We have it,

1603
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:50,870
a little kettle bells and her,

1604
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:51,970
you know,

1605
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,451
stuff like that.

1606
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:52,841
She loves it.

1607
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:53,061
So,

1608
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:53,250
uh,

1609
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:53,471
you know,

1610
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:55,660
share the treadmill yet and
she just does her thing there.

1611
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:56,740
Yeah.

1612
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,280
Um,

1613
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,720
that's probably a good attitude,

1614
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,021
right?

1615
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:02,740
To burn it all out in the
gym and then home is peace.

1616
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,870
That peace was,

1617
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:05,191
that can be,

1618
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,024
you know,

1619
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,960
if I piss off the wife
and it's not so peaceful,

1620
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,620
how do you,

1621
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,453
how do you,

1622
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,130
like when you're the UFC
heavyweight champion,

1623
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:12,580
the world,

1624
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,160
like that's a tremendous
amount of pressure and stress.

1625
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,260
Play some call of duty.

1626
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:17,711
I don't know,

1627
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:18,530
just to hang out.

1628
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,300
I really honestly,

1629
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,133
I just chill.

1630
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,070
I don't do much like,

1631
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:21,221
you know,

1632
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,054
John Volante,

1633
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,900
I man,

1634
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,120
I played with him online with a bunch
of guys from New York and we just sit

1635
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:25,960
there and talk smack,

1636
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,820
Talk Shit to little kids and make,

1637
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,660
make yourself feel better.

1638
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,400
You know,

1639
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,560
imagine you getting new shit if
you're playing online call of duty,

1640
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,840
like UFC heavyweight
champions talking shit to you.

1641
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,250
What the fuck.

1642
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,390
I,

1643
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,220
my buddy was actually,

1644
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,340
we were playing with
[inaudible] and he's like,

1645
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:39,621
goes,

1646
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:39,811
look,

1647
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:39,930
Yo,

1648
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,320
Yo gonna come over and kick your ass.

1649
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:41,870
I,

1650
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,440
he's like,

1651
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,211
let me do it.

1652
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:43,750
And I'm like,

1653
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,810
don't you consider where I'm like,

1654
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,930
just let him have his moment,

1655
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,710
you know,

1656
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,550
come over and kick.

1657
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:49,384
Yeah.

1658
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,230
I mean I,

1659
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,240
it's so funny to get direct
messages and stuff like that.

1660
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:52,460
You know,

1661
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,680
you're terribly threatening you.

1662
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,563
Oh yeah,

1663
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,270
you're such a noob and now you're lucky.

1664
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,491
I'm not,

1665
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,031
I don't know where you live.

1666
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:59,440
I fucking find you and I kill you.

1667
00:31:59,441 --> 00:31:59,680
I'm like,

1668
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,340
ugh.

1669
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,060
It's so fun.

1670
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,720
You imagine the thought that would go
through their head if they found out who

1671
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:05,860
the fuck they were talking to.

1672
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:06,341
Well,

1673
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,174
the horror,

1674
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,800
you're some 14 year old shit talk and get
all folk and to house stick my dick in

1675
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:12,634
your mind.

1676
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,203
Like

1677
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,270
you find out you're talking to
the UFC heavyweight champion like,

1678
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,173
oh Jesus.

1679
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,470
Oh Jesus Lord,

1680
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,043

1681
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,130
Yeah,

1682
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,410
yeah.

1683
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,131
I remember we were at,

1684
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:25,480
we were in Vegas probably like that.

1685
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,380
Some guy had no idea,

1686
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,550
like not being like talking shit.

1687
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,780
But we went to like,

I'm a bud light party and that we want
them to like just him to him man Shannon

1689
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:32,111

1691
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:33,670
It was having fun that like,

1692
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,060
like bunch of different Elvis Presley's
wherever they are like always miles they

1693
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,590
or I'm with my wife and we're hanging
out and I'm like sitting like they're

1694
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,151

1695
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,530
like not looking around because I
know that I do and girls might goes,

1696
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,361

1697
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:44,871
and so anyway,

1699
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,060
do you want anything on there

1700
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,271
She's like,

1701
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:47,451

1702
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,010

1703
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,843
we randomly met,

1704
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
I'll never forget that macaroni cheese,

1705
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,970
whether we get some Mac and cheese and
I came back and just be talking to my

1706
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,050
wife and I'm like,

1707
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,723

1708
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,700
I'm like it turns around and
we're here at and he's like,

1709
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,050
oh I'm so sorry.

1710
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:01,190
I didn't know.

1711
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,390
Like he was being nice little life.

1712
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,231
Like he's being nice.

1713
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,550
He's just asked me what I was doing.

1714
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,770
Like we had no idea.

1715
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,550
I was with her younger disaster.

1716
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,150
Yeah it was,

1717
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,150
it was actually pretty funny guy.

1718
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,690
Like they'll be like piss his pants.

1719
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,583
It was,

1720
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,440
did people treat you any different or
on the fire station or is it pretty

1721
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:15,860
normal?

1722
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,190
It's good.

1723
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,023
It's gotten worse.

1724
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,811
Worse.

1725
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:18,051
Yeah.

1726
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:18,280
They,

1727
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,460
they treat me like garbage.

1728
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,343
So I,

1729
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:21,591
you know,

1730
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:22,151

1732
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:23,031

00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:24,690
I'm like,

1736
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,190

1737
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,820
You know?

1738
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,151
Yeah.

1739
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:26,984
They don't care.

1740
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,160
That's funny.

1741
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,310
No,

1742
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,001
but they're good guys.

1743
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:29,181
I mean,

1744
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,160
I love them both stations that are just,

1745
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:31,820
uh,

1746
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,010

1747
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,850
Oakland Valley view though.

1748
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,693
Those guys are just,

1749
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,610
they're just good guys.

1750
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,444
They're just always,

1751
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:35,900
you know,

1752
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,111
like,

1753
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:36,411
they actually,

1754
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,520
when I fought in Brazil so
they couldn't go to the fight,

1755
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:41,330
so they flew to Vegas and have their own
wash punting Vegas to watch the fight.

1756
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:41,570
You know,

1757
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,940
how convenient they couldn't stay in Ohio.

1758
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,960
I go to bed,

1759
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,171
honey,

1760
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:46,760
I gotta go to Vegas to support Steve.

1761
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:47,920
That's fine.

1762
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,410
Vegas?

1763
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:48,540
No,

1764
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:48,740
no.

1765
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,401
He's in Brazil.

1766
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,810
But the hookers were in Vegas.

1767
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:51,644
Yeah.

1768
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:53,030
I got to go where I got to go.

1769
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,861
Yeah.

1770
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:55,310
No,

1771
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:55,571
I mean,

1772
00:33:55,571 --> 00:33:55,910
honestly,

1773
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,451
they're great guys.

1774
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,040
I mean they're just,

1775
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,873
uh,

1776
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,640
you know,

1777
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,450

1778
00:33:59,450 --> 00:33:59,641

1780
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,161
they really don't care.

1781
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:01,341
I,

1782
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:02,151
I felt bad for him though,

1783
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,140
cause like really sly,

1784
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,610
you want to title on Saturday?

1785
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,570
I flew in on Monday,

1786
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:08,060
I got home Monday and I think
worked Wednesday at the state,

1787
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,010
the one station and Lilly,

1788
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,430
everyone found out and that phone
did not stop ringing the doorbell.

1789
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,720
And they were like looking at me like,

1790
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,591
are you serious?

1791
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:18,140
You and other folks I suppose
to be taking naps right now.

1792
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:18,650
Like,

1793
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:18,840
you know,

1794
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,460
Ding Dong,

1795
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,850
what is the chilled bars?

1796
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,460
So I felt like they understood,

1797
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:23,570
but I felt really bad because like,

1798
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:24,440
I want to relax too,

1799
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:24,711
you know?

1800
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,060
And they have like a
little prayed for you.

1801
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:26,571
Yeah.

1802
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:26,801
Well,

1803
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:27,634

1805
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:28,821
Well not a little parade.

1806
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:29,240
It was a,

1807
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,631
I wasn't there.

1808
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,130
I wasn't like,

1809
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,963

1810
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,080
Oh yeah.

1811
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:32,661
It was pretty big.

1812
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,210
1.3 million or 6 million.

1813
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,073
That's crazy.

1814
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:35,751
It was nuts.

1815
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:36,531
It was so hot too.

1816
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,200
Like UFC,

1817
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,401

1818
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:38,234

1823
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,230
We only wear this Black Jersey right now.

1824
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,431
One of them.

1825
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:43,850
Reebok.

1826
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,230

1829
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,910
It was like 90 degrees and I'm like,

1830
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,801

But it was honestly,

1834
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:51,111

1839
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:56,270
It was just,

1840
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,660
just,

1841
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,493
it was great to see,

1842
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,070
you know.

1843
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,700
There it is.

1844
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,533
Yeah.

1845
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,251
Yeah.

1846
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,090
He's sweating like a pig.

1847
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,370
Oh,

1848
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,190
so there is,

1849
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,980

around the street now?

1850
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:07,460
Like what does,

1851

what is a normal life for you?

1852
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,510
Normal.

1853
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:10,950
I'm a man.

1854
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,840
Everyone's so nice there.

1855
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,201
Don't,

1856
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:14,140

1857
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,331

1859
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:15,381
They're just like,

1860
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:15,531
hey,

1861
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,364

1862
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,331
Is there any,

1863
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,250
do you think there's any
benefit of keeping a day job?

1864
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,460
Do you think like in any way it's
like good for your head or anything?

1865
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,180
I think so.

1866
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,020
I definitely think so.

1867
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,550
I think that it keeps me grounded because,

1868
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:26,384
uh,

1869
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:26,721
you know,

1870
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:27,710
we don't always talk about fighting,

1871
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:27,921
you know,

1872
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:28,790
but like it just,

1873
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,390
you know,

1874
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,150
one of the things we're worried about
the worry about funding this Nacuso mine

1875
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:32,631
off of it,

1876
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,230
but,

1877
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,560
um,

1878
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,060
I think also too is always a plan B.

1879
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:35,570
You know,

1880
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,060
I feel like I could walk
out of here for trip and,

1881
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:37,980
and break my hand.

1882
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,700
I'll never fight again.

1883
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,533
You just never know.

1884
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,830
So that's why you keep the job.

1885
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,550
They're a little bit,

1886
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,350
but I really work hard
and make my mom proud.

1887
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:44,770
Okay.

1888
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:44,990
No,

1889
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,560
I just don't.

1890
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,371
Plus I love helping people,

1891
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:46,491
you know,

1892
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:49,420
my whole life I guess I would have been
helped and so it's my don't want to get,

1893
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,150
cause I was saying about being a coast
guard police officer and my buddy's like,

1894
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:53,421
dude,

1895
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:54,080
check the firemen,

1896
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,261
dude.

1897
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:55,094
It's great job.

1898
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,193
I looked at him like,

1899
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,590
get full time 24 on 48 off.

1900
00:35:58,591 --> 00:35:59,040
It's awesome.

1901
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,851
That's awesome man.

1902
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:01,020
Like who would want to do that?

1903
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:01,291
And then,

1904
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,124
uh,

1905
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,551
yeah.

1906
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,330
So yeah,

1907
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,660
but like some people would say
like to be at the top of your game,

1908
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:10,230
you literally must devote all of your
time to it all the time and that you

1909
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,640
wouldn't have enough time

1910
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,540
okay.

1911
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,010
To,

1912
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,740
to work a regular job.

1913
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,550
No,

1914
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:15,851
I mean,

1915
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:16,290
I make it,

1916
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,811
I make it work,

1917
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:17,110
man.

1918
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,770
I got,

1919
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,450
I don't care.

1920
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:18,650
You know,

1921
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:18,781
I,

1922
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,050
I work a lot of Sundays.

1923
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,093
I'll do 24 hours.

1924
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,500
If you just hit the lottery tomorrow,

1925
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,580
you got $100 million,

1926
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,260
I'm out.

1927
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,700
You'd quit.

1928
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,533
Oh yeah.

1929
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,191
But that's the point.

1930
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:31,270
Like what if,

1931
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,750
uh,

1932
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,201
you know,

1933
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,230
say you,

1934
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,420
you continue your,

1935
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:37,390
your title run and you
make more and more money,

1936
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:38,680
become a giant superstar.

1937
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:42,450
Like you deserve to be and you start
making those Conor McGregor checks if you

1938
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,330
going to keep that job.

1939
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,840
Yeah.

1940
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,260
Really?

1941
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,220
Oh really?

1942
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,451
Yeah.

1943
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:47,740
I know I hit ups for loans.

1944
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,500
It's going to have had been there,

1945
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:50,910
done that.

1946
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,200
Every one of those days it's so bad.

1947
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:53,770
I'm like,

1948
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,610
I'm was my family.

1949
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:54,971
I'm like,

1950
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:55,271
Bro,

1951
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:56,650
how I'm night my family are bothered me.

1952
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:56,861
I'm like,

1953
00:36:56,861 --> 00:36:57,341
this is great.

1954
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,290
But like I friends and stuff like Jesus,

1955
00:36:59,291 --> 00:36:59,510
really?

1956
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,430
They want loans,

1957
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:00,701
right?

1958
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:01,020
Yeah.

1959
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,310
That,

1960
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,310
you know are not loans.

1961
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,940
No,

1962
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,650
nobody's ever paying one loan.

1963
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,270
I only one I've ever get
out and it came back.

1964
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,920
They came back and got lucky.

1965
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,990
Actually it's that guy that looks like
my brother with a mustache or who?

1966
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,170
Steak and potatoes.

1967
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:14,461
Potato.

1968
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:15,820
You know Tom About think my coach.

1969
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,471
Oh,

00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:17,860
the guy with the mustache that I,

1971
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,350
last time I got to talk about I was,

1972
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,184

1973
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,790

1974
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,040
now it's his other buddy's name.

1975
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,023
MMM,

1976
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,893
okay.

1977
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,040
What's his name?

1978
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,700
Brian Cowen.

1979
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,210
Yeah.

1980
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:27,511
He was like,

1981
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:27,841

1982
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:28,740
His brother or something.

1983
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:29,750
And you're married in the Cajun.

1984
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,121
Oh,

1985
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:30,361
right,

1986
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:30,601
right,

1987
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:30,850
right,

1988
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,051
right,

1989
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:31,311
right.

1990
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:31,470
Yeah.

1991
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:31,690
Yeah.

1992
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,120
Actually stairs on business.

1993
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:33,340
Health,

1994
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,860
the mountain.

1995
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,080
No,

1996
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,660
he's the only guy I trust
someone that you're close to,

1997
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:39,330
but it's always people that you kind
of like in the periphery that have some

1998
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,640
stupid business idea
that you can't go wrong.

1999
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,190
Yeah.

2000
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,500
They can't go wrong.

2001
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:43,861
Those are,

2002
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,940
those people are my favorite.

2003
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:46,490
This can't miss the idea.

2004
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,131
I don't know.

2005
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:47,940
I don't play that game.

2006
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,040
I plus my wife somewhere in pretty
much in charge of the money.

2007
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,820
That's good.

2008
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,660
So that's good.

2009
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:53,430
You have like removal from it like hey,

2010
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,181
I can't even do anything.

2011
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,014
I'm sorry.

2012
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,680
I blame her.

2013
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,161
And she's like,

2014
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:57,150
she didn't even wear sneakers.

2015
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,850
Yeah,

2016
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,330
yeah.

2017
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,820
I can't buy underwear for myself.

2018
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,811
I went from,

2019
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,530
and I saw it.

2020
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,040
Who,

2021
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,300
who schedules your training?

2022
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:07,260
Like say if you're going to do a big
camp for like this in Ghana and fight,

2023
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,590
like who schedules what
you do all the time.

2024
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,570
Oh my coach Marcus.

2025
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,920
You always use my sesame dies
or I'm with this guy here.

2026
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:15,121
I went,

2027
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:15,520
this guy,

2028
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,580
I think we should meet this guy in,

2029
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:16,790
you know,

2030
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,430
and just,

2031
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,630
we kind of just figure it all out.

2032
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,160
And so does he have all this written out?

2033
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,960
Like keep like a certain amount of rounds.

2034
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,640
He wants certain amount of
strength and conditioning.

2035
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:23,900
See,

2036
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,890
so he's he or your overall trainer?

2037
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,191

Yeah.

2040
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:28,074
He's the one who

2041
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,510
okay.

2042
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,210

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,430

2047
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,314

2048
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:32,740

2057
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:40,671
Yo me,

2058
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:42,790
I'd tell him apart and talk
shit to him and you know,

2059
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,370
it makes them make themselves feel
better about myself and I'm like,

2060
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:45,551
God,

2061
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,690
you're so old and fat and like,

2062
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,201
I feel good.

2063
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,034
You know what I mean?

2064
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,310
But I,

2065
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,481
yeah,

2066
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,230
he and Margaret,

2067
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,160
he sets it all up,

2068
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,080
make sure it's all good,

2069
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,400
you know,

2070
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,690
you know,

2071
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,070
Monday,

2072
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,070
Tuesday,

2073
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,070
Wednesday,

2074
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,071
Thursdays,

2075
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:54,340
and then,

2076
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,520
you know,

2077
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,500
as you Saturday they just
take Fridays off somebody.

2078
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,270
How much strength and
conditioning do you do?

2079
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,860
I don't do too much.

2080
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:00,250
I don't,

2081
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:00,701
not like,

2082
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:01,990
I want to do like heavy lifting,

2083
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,913
you know what I mean?

2084
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
Because it's not a power
lifting competition.

2085
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,553
It's a fight.

2086
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,900
So like on Tuesdays I do a posterior chain
working for my lower back and my leg,

2087
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:11,231
my half.

2088
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:12,850
We have a Yo westside barbell.

2089
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,450
Sure.

2090
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:13,781
You know,

2091
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:14,420
they uh,

2092
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,130
bowed squat.

2093
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,481
Yeah.

2094
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,830
I do love that dog putting one in here.

2095
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,910
Oh yeah,

2096
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,400
yeah.

2097
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,280
Do to Louie Simmons is the bomb.

2098
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:21,760
Good Dude.

2099
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,600
I love that guy.

2100
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,440
He's a freak.

2101
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,891
He,

2102
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,720
we had one of the best
podcasts ever with him.

2103
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,280
He's so fucking crazy.

2104
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,360
He's out of his mind.

2105
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,300
My coach is like one of like the ogs it
within make you worked out of his garage

2106
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,820
before it became like it is now.

2107
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:35,650
Like he used to like just train
with them back in the day.

2108
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:35,921
Yeah.

2109
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:39,730
We went there and gave us a tour
and that whole belt squat thing,

2110
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,630
that thing's amazing.

2111
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:40,860
Oh,

2112
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,420
it's awesome.

2113
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,710
Like gets you traction and not so strange.

2114
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:43,911
So I,

2115
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:44,081
you know,

2116
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:44,531
I do that,

2117
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:44,860
you know,

2118
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,693
uh,

2119
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,100
under the new one that's
even awesome are now too,

2120
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:48,910
which is great.

2121
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,810
They can dead lift off of it and you can
do rubber bands like they're geniuses

2122
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:53,880
over there and just do amazing jobs.

2123
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,720
So I do a bunch of that
like reverse hypers.

2124
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,351
Yeah.

2125
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,060
I've got a reverse
hyper machine back here.

2126
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,710
The pendulum swings real good too.

2127
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,820
That thing's amazing.

2128
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,121
Yeah.

2129
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,040
That reverse hypers a back fix her.

2130
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:03,790
I mean,

2131
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,390
night and day.

2132
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,230
It's the craziest thing.

2133
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:05,740
I mean,

2134
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,131
if you,

2135
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,750
if you have a back issue,

2136
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,531
ladies and gentleman,

2137
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,660
please just Google reverse hyper.

2138
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,100
It is an amazing machine that Louie
Simmons created and it literally

2139
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:18,490
decompresses your spine and
strengthens it at the same time.

2140
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,630
It is a work of art.

2141
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,311
Yeah.

2142
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:21,131
I mean I love it.

2143
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:22,250
I mean you,

2144
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,940
you,

2145
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,110
she's,

2146
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,830
I can't talk to him.

2147
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,663
Excited.

2148
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,060
Uh,

2149
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,181
yeah.

2150
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:25,781
There it is right here.

2151
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:26,220
It's showing,

2152
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,090
look at me motherfucking paper boy hat.

2153
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,670
But belt squat they got,

2154
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,580
it's,

2155
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,840
that thing's amazing man.

2156
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,140
But I feel like having that thing on you,

2157
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,860
you would seriously develop
some like real power in your,

2158
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:40,060
in your movements and your,

2159
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:41,320
your ability to push off.

2160
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:44,290
And I think for striking that
would be fucking incredible.

2161
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,124
That thing.

2162
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,040
Yeah.

2163
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,620
I dude,

2164
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,560
yesterday I did three,

2165
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,400
five minute rounds,

2166
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:48,910
uh,

2167
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,690
to 90.

2168
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,880
So do you a shadowbox
while you're doing that?

2169
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,121
Yeah,

2170
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:52,811
it depends what I do.

2171
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,900
I a little shove out of the first one I
did marching and I slide back and forth

2172
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:56,530
just a little bit.

2173
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:56,791
I do,

2174
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,620
uh,

2175
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,211
it's Kinda funny,

2176
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,550
but actually grabbed the
bar and I thrust my hips,

2177
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,430
works my hips and have
to do my lower back.

2178
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:07,110
And then next time we did
a with squat medicine ball,

2179
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,410
throw it to one coach squat,

2180
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,580
throw it back back and forth,

2181
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:10,061
five minutes.

2182
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:11,830
And then I'll know when I like bourbons,

2183
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,480
keep me on just counting,

2184
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,890
keep moving a little bit like that.

2185
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:18,130
And then you evolve this over over time.

2186
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,791
And we have,

2187
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:19,624
we actually have a,

2188
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,130
put it back up again.

2189
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,130
We used to have a medicine ball that
was strapped up and be like a more Thai

2190
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:25,964
clinch.

2191
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,860
It's we did that,

2192
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,190
you know,

2193
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,000
the five minutes.

2194
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,540
That was hard.

2195
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,291
That was terrible.

2196
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,550
And so that was actually not funded all
we did that and then we had like um,

2197
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,650
these massive like

2198
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,010
on what the weather,

2199
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:41,010
I almost like part of a boat but there's
these big metal rings like Oval Rings

2200
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:41,930
and their Chin.

2201
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,161
I don't know,

2202
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,870
we just sit there and just lock her like
this and keep your hands up high and

2203
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:45,460
just,

2204
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,370
just working on,

2205
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,210
keep your hands up.

2206
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,430
Plus we put it for the Max
in that you're a veteran max?

2207
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:49,671
No,

2208
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:50,391
what's the Virta Mac?

2209
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,290
So it's like,

2210
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,183
um,

2211
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,900
it's like a,

2212
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,950
it's like a platform.

2213
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:57,160
The platform has got
all the straps number,

2214
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,113
I'll resistance.

2215
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,271
It's pretty cool.

2216
00:41:59,271 --> 00:41:59,930
So you can jump,

2217
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,490
you know,

2218
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,280
punching.

2219
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,551
Oh,

2220
00:42:01,551 --> 00:42:01,881
you know,

2221
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,330
I had,

2222
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,740
I think I have seen that before.

2223
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:07,630
It's like it strapped up to different
parts of your body so he could throw knees

2224
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,590
and punches and kicks and stuff like that.

2225
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:09,810
Yes.

2226
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,000
We had that to that.

2227
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,470
So it's a pretty interesting,

2228
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,880
and you do operate on Brown's,

2229
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:14,720
you do rounds?

2230
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,440
We've done that.

2231
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,160
I've been around.

2232
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah.

2233
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,850
So like when we go back and forth with
that and stuff like they can want to be,

2234
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,170
I want to have you on when then
when resistance and Dah Dah Dah.

2235
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,013
So are they,

2236
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,760
do they monitor your heart rate?

2237
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,230
No,

2238
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,900
no.

2239
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,950
I just pushed to the limit.

2240
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,323
I don't worry about it.

2241
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:29,811
You know,

2242
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,630
like I do listen to my body if
I'm tired of 'em are struggling,

2243
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:33,440
you know,

2244
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,790
like the last camp for Jds camp,

2245
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,571
I don't know what I was thinking,

2246
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,404
but I did like,

2247
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,670
I was already doing five,

2248
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,350
five minute rounds within like
the first like totally so foot 10,

2249
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,930
10 to 12 weeks for per fight.

2250
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,221
And it was like fire,

2251
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:43,701
like Oh yeah,

2252
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:44,211
I feel good.

2253
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:44,411
Yeah,

2254
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:44,961
it's amazing.

2255
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,250
And then like a week thing,

2256
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:46,850
I was like,

2257
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,660
Ooh,

2258
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,430
I just died too hard.

2259
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,110
Yeah.

2260
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,460
I just was being just the dumb Jack.

2261
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,020
Well that's what I wanted to say.

2262
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:54,410
It's like,

2263
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,370
like what is the,

2264
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:56,210
not that you're dumb jock,

2265
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:56,991
but like that is,

2266
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,770
what is the,

2267
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,070
what's the way you prepare for a,

2268
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,760
like a major championship fight?

2269
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,960
Like what is the buildup?

2270
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,370
Like like how do you,

2271
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,890
how do you know like
when to push too hard?

2272
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:08,300
How do you know when you're peaking?

2273
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:10,700
When to back off every fight?

2274
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:11,120
Uh,

2275
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,620
two weeks out I stopped swearing.

2276
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:13,850
I don't spark two weeks before a fight.

2277
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,451
Two weeks,

2278
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:14,990
two weeks.

2279
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,770
Why is that?

2280
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,610
Just my body rest.

2281
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,180
No worry about building my back,

2282
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,220
hurt my body and stuff.

2283
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,890
That's some reason I made that
jds fight cause I really like,

2284
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,940
everything hurts so bad.

2285
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:25,950
I would wake up in the morning
but just stretching outage,

2286
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,781
they get to feel the pain.

2287
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:29,560
Like just my bones now this
bar and just sorting that.

2288
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,620
See I was just being
sore and then from spine,

2289
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,110
from doing everything grappling and just,

2290
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,311
you know,

2291
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,061
I'm not boxing,

2292
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:35,840
whatever.

2293
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,380
And then uh,

2294
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:36,591
you know,

2295
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:37,251
if I had two weeks,

2296
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,360
man I felt like $1 million.

2297
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,130
So what you do for those two weeks out?

2298
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:40,920
I do pair work,

2299
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,410
conditioning running and stuff like that.

2300
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:42,640
You know,

2301
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,280
just uh,

2302
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,290
just keep my mind straight my mind.

2303
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:45,561
Right.

2304
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:46,070
You know,

2305
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,930
I work in a patch,

2306
00:43:46,931 --> 00:43:49,760
it's like technique going over
the game plan for the week,

2307
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,623
you know,

2308
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,430
everybody's got a different
strategy for that.

2309
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:52,791
Like mad,

2310
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:55,910
he was told me he would work out hard
right up until the day of the fight.

2311
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,260
Like,

2312
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,501
yes.

2313
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:57,951
She's like,

2314
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,940
that's what we've always done.

2315
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,050
It's what I've always done.

2316
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,400
It feels right for me.

2317
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,010
I can keep puts his mind in a good place,

2318
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:04,820
I guess too.

2319
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,330
Yeah.

2320
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,050
I mean I,

2321
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:06,801
that's old school,

2322
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:07,634
you know what I mean?

2323
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,530
For him though,

2324
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,660
he worked for him of all time.

2325
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,140
Yeah,

2326
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,973
no doubt.

2327
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,390
But I talked to another coach who said
that when he was competing that what he

2328
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,940
would do is the last week of the fight,

2329
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:21,350
he literally wouldn't do anything.

2330
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,341
He goes,

2331
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:23,390
I wouldn't work out at all.

2332
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:23,661
I go,

2333
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,380
nothing.

2334
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,101
He is nothing.

2335
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:25,791
He wasn't my ride,

2336
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:26,600
my bike.

2337
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,811
He goes,

2338
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,550
I might swim a little bit
because I don't do shit.

2339
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:28,701
He goes,

2340
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,600
I already know how to fight.

2341
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,740
It was Marty and shape.

2342
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,020
He goes,

2343
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,920
I'm just trying to recover.

2344
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,701
And he goes,

2345
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:35,520
and you think about it like if you haven't
worked out in a week when you go and

2346
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:35,971
work out,

2347
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:36,181
you're like,

2348
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:36,920
fuck.

2349
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,480
It's like,

2350
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,600
that feels so,

2351
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,110
so powerful and energetic.

2352
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,250
Cause everything's recovered.

2353
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,001
And he's like,

2354
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:43,340
that's how I want to be when I'm finding.

2355
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,170
And I'm like,

2356
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:44,920
okay.

2357
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,660
I think,

2358
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,493
I think that's how I,

2359
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:47,280
you know,

2360
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:47,970
I still go hard and he,

2361
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:48,990
I to do my rounds and I,

2362
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:49,480
you know,

2363
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,520
I'm pushing the limit and,

2364
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:51,600
but like,

2365
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:51,770
you know,

2366
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,920
I definitely just the last two weeks,

2367
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:56,430
just let my body rest from
getting beat up mine right to,

2368
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:57,000
you know.

2369
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,601
Do you,

2370
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:58,050
uh,

2371
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,090
you have any sort of recovery methods?

2372
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:03,570
Do you do like cryo therapy
or massage or ice baths or,

2373
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,021
yeah,

2374
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:04,530
I um,

2375
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,670
I do ice baths on my own.

2376
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,030
Um,

2377
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:06,421
but I do,

2378
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:08,790
I cry and I would place that
looks to be obstacle there.

2379
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:09,781
Ben Cleveland,

2380
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,670
I do Epsom salt pie once a week with a,

2381
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,031
with a,

2382
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,331
with a,

2383
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:13,061
with a menthol.

2384
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:14,240
I was always called Natalia,

2385
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,570
that green menthol,

2386
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,360
menthol cigarettes.

2387
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,773
I think it's like,

2388
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,061
well,

2389
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:21,261
you know,

2390
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,094
like come to the Er,

2391
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,390
they can either put it at like
the Epson salt and light green,

2392
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,980
like the g the liquid.

2393
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,030
I don't even know what that is.

2394
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,231
It's Epson salt,

2395
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:28,980
but it's green.

2396
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,161
Yeah.

2397
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:29,401
It's like,

2398
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:29,640
man,

2399
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,360
these Menthol,

2400
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,841
I have no idea.

2401
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,070
I shouldn't have to pay attention to that.

2402
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,400
You know,

2403
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,851
who knows.

2404
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:33,260
But,

2405
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:36,090
but it opens up the pores actually
helps with people cutting way too.

2406
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,980
But then she opens up beyond
it gets everything out.

2407
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,331
And then,

2408
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:38,780
uh,

2409
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,040
I do that once or twice a week.

2410
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,060
I think the crowd I want,

2411
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,150
I want to start doing that here as soon,

2412
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:42,331
once,

2413
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:43,021
twice a week.

2414
00:45:43,021 --> 00:45:43,810
Um,

2415
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:44,100
you know,

2416
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,030
I proteins,

2417
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:45,751
amino acids,

2418
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,321
all this stuff.

2419
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:46,471
You know,

2420
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:47,304
you're supposed to,

2421
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,570
I go to a chiropractor a couple times a
week and they asked that without sets,

2422
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:52,450
including massagers.

2423
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,450
So for 20 minute massage after.

2424
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,500
So yeah,

2425
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,360
I think massage is super beneficial.

2426
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:58,820
I think the more people do that,

2427
00:45:58,830 --> 00:45:59,460
the better.

2428
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,680
I think especially for fighters,

2429
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:00,961
he just,

2430
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:04,020
you're constantly dealing with knots
and things that could eventually become

2431
00:46:04,021 --> 00:46:05,070
like real injuries.

2432
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,430
Yeah.

2433
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,480
I remember one night I was supposed to
have Ben Rothwell and pull out a flight.

2434
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:10,980
It was like worst time of my life.

2435
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:11,970
I never pull out a fight before.

2436
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:12,804
I didn't know what to do.

2437
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,160
I feel it couldn't bend over.

2438
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:14,940
Like I was like,

2439
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,920
I never forget I dropped my wallet.

2440
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,443
I was like,

2441
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,790
what happened?

2442
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:20,461
It's just my back.

2443
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,660
It was so screwed up,

2444
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,523
like I was driving,

2445
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,740
I was pretty like sit up straight.

2446
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,640
I felt like it was,

2447
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:27,361
it was so bad.

2448
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,060
I let my bag was so
messed up like I would,

2449
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,120
did you get an Mri?

2450
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:30,591
Yes.

2451
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:31,210
So in my,

2452
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:31,510
my,

2453
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,480
my lower my,

2454
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:34,314
um,

2455
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,800
what else am I else?

2456
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,930
For whatever else,

2457
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,170
they were just screwed up their,

2458
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:40,560
you know,

2459
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,100
their herniated bulging out,

2460
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:42,934
whatever you wanna call him.

2461
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,741
And uh,

2462
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:47,220
so I went and talked
to Tom from west side,

2463
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:47,920
you know,

2464
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,753
Irish guy,

2465
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,730
whenever he's out,

2466
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,121
he was like,

2467
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:51,481
hey man,

2468
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:52,530
check out is so ass.

2469
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,520
SOS muscle mass muscle is no,

2470
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:57,441
so it's a muscle.

2471
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,610
It's connected on the
inside of your thigh.

2472
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,230
You didn't tell your bone
when it goes over hipbone in,

2473
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,260
it goes to your lower back.

2474
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:04,830
Okay.

2475
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,920
So I was sitting there and like,

2476
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,620
I would like take your shit and I'm like,

2477
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,070
oh,

2478
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,000
like I feel like,

2479
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,490
like my spine,

2480
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:12,211
it would kill.

2481
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:16,100
So I said like stretching it out
and say get massage and massage.

2482
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,023
It was like,

2483
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:17,611
she's like,

2484
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:17,941
I'm like,

2485
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:18,511
I'm not gonna lie.

2486
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:19,110
She was like,

2487
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,210
you touching your so s muscle cars,

2488
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,550
they have to dig and get to it
cause like you just can't find it.

2489
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,890
She was like a rubber
band was like bumps on it.

2490
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,050
She was disgusting.

2491
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:27,450
She was like,

2492
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,081
it was the dance.

2493
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:30,100
So I go to a

2494
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,220
west and this guy named John
Quinn who is a release therapist,

2495
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:33,490
whoever,

2496
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:34,120
big dude.

2497
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,601
Awesome.

2498
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,920
Did he actually say my career?

2499
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:38,290
He started working on my so ass
and started stretching me out.

2500
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,570
Well I mean now I can do head kicks now.

2501
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,970
I'd never be able to hit kick.

2502
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,150
So it was like a muscle that's just was
broken down and it wasn't getting enough

2503
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:47,770
for covering this wrestling from being,

2504
00:47:47,771 --> 00:47:47,981
you know?

2505
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:48,430
Sure.

2506
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,310
And then just being tired all the time
and then hurting my bag when I was little

2507
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:51,551
kid.

2508
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:51,820
You know,

2509
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,800
not a little kid when I was 18 I my back
and then he just carried on and family

2510
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,643
do yoga.

2511
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,120
I did the,

2512
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,223
it's tough for me

2513
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,150
like,

2514
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,510
Oh I,

2515
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,330
of course it is.

2516
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:03,640
Yeah,

2517
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,960
that's why it's supposed
to be good for you.

2518
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:05,150
Again.

2519
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:05,890
It's hard to do.

2520
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,360
I probably should do it.

2521
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,500
It's just that it's tough.

2522
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:09,071
I'm going to forget.

2523
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:11,290
When I was training at a gym before
I started doing mixed martial arts,

2524
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,960
I was doing yoga class and I was
trying to like do it and his leg,

2525
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,171
like,

2526
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:15,100
you're just too big.

2527
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,070
She only told me that.

2528
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:16,481
I was like,

2529
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:17,650
you're a terrible instructor.

2530
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,650
Like how do you want me to come back?

2531
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,440
Like what?

2532
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,670
You're just too big.

2533
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:21,930
She's like,

2534
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,511
you're just too big.

2535
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:23,321
Your muscles are too big.

2536
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:23,450
It's,

2537
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,283
she's told me

2538
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,690
I was so devastated.

2539
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:28,821
I,

2540
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:29,501
it's walked out.

2541
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,131
I know what to do.

2542
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:30,430
I was like,

2543
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,263
this is stupid.

2544
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:31,871
Yeah.

2545
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:32,561
That's ridiculous.

2546
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:34,030
I lost my Mojo after that.

2547
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,720
No,

2548
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,110
no.

2549
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,010
You gotta to get back in there.

2550
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,230
I would just think that like for a,

2551
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,970
for anyone that's involved in
anything that's as brutal as a MMA,

2552
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,160
that yoga is a great sort of balancing
thing for that keeps you flexible,

2553
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:48,791
you know,

2554
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,890
keeps your core strong,

2555
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:52,260
does a lot of you,

2556
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:54,520
you've developed like weird strength,

2557
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,710
strength and like it,

2558
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:56,890
it helps the joints.

2559
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,190
It helps a lot of the connecting
tissues helps stabilize everything.

2560
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,650
Yeah.

2561
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:00,971
Yeah.

2562
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,430
I believe it puzzle isn't a real go
with your mind and stuff like that.

2563
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:03,840
Sure.

2564
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:03,940
Yeah,

2565
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,480
that's right.

2566
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:04,890
I mean,

2567
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,880
I don't even know.

2568
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,060
I've done it like once or twice.

2569
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:09,480
I get told you in the lady was like
your mom sent me like when I read,

2570
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:10,750
I read about and when I seen him on it,

2571
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,593
it looks pretty good.

2572
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,831
Yeah.

2573
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:15,820
I looked that post on Instagram that
I've put up last night and I saw it from

2574
00:49:15,821 --> 00:49:16,400
um,

2575
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,410
what pull this up.

2576
00:49:17,411 --> 00:49:21,280
Like this is a from Jujitsu brotherhood.

2577
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,830
This a yacht.

2578
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:24,800
It what's up?

2579
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,073
Um,

2580
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,510
yoga is a martial art
you do against yourself.

2581
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,160
How do you say Nick's last name?

2582
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,110
Grigori Atus quick,

2583
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:39,970
gory aid this or Gloria is anyway,

2584
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,601
real good.

2585
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:41,141
Jujitsu guy.

2586
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,550
He was the guy that was in London.

2587
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:42,821
Rio,

2588
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:43,450
right?

2589
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,283
Wasn't he?

2590
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:46,970
Sure

2591
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,610
use that little fancy Google machine.

2592
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,440
I'm pretty sure that's neck.

2593
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,281
Uh,

2594
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:51,750
he was the,

2595
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,950
in the early London Real,

2596
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,030
he did our podcast.

2597
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,840
Yeah.

2598
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,673
Yeah,

2599
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,041
yeah.

2600
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,420
He did the podcast long time ago.

2601
00:49:58,421 --> 00:49:59,860
But that's a great quote that,

2602
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,740
that yoga is a martial art
you do against yourself.

2603
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,050
How long have you been doing it for?

2604
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,420
Real serious for like two years.

2605
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,560
Two and a half years.

2606
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,521
Before that,

2607
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:12,220
I would do it like once a month
or once every now and then.

2608
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,570
But now I do it pretty regularly.

2609
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:14,660
We did a,

2610
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,970
the sober October thing.

2611
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,080
No booze,

2612
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,860
no pot,

2613
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,720
15 hot yoga classes a month.

2614
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,580
I was fucking with life changing,

2615
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:21,990
man.

2616
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,390
Yeah.

2617
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,661
Yeah.

2618
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:23,710
I haven't done yoga since.

2619
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,000
I really have

2620
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,460
it,

2621
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,710
but I need to cause I fucking,

2622
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,030
I tweaked my back
yesterday doing something.

2623
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:32,864
Joe copywriter.

2624
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,950
No,

2625
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:34,400
no.

2626
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,581
Yeah.

2627
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:35,340
I don't believe in them.

2628
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,173
Really?

2629
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,640
Don't.

2630
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:36,960
I don't know.

2631
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,793
I'm sure you do.

2632
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,630
So good.

2633
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,770
I think massage is good,

2634
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:40,251
but if you,

2635
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,770
did you know how chiropractic was founded?

2636
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,753
Do you know where it came from?

2637
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,350
Came from a scam artist.

2638
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:47,690
That guy was a magnetic healer and a,

2639
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:52,130
it came to him in a seance that he could
cure all ailments if you manipulate

2640
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:53,120
people's spines.

2641
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:53,841
Yeah.

2642
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:56,390
And then he was killed
by his own son who then,

2643
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:57,860
who was also a scam artist.

2644
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:01,310
His own son ran over him with a fucking
car and they took over the business.

2645
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,603
I'm so,

2646
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:04,850
yes,

2647
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:05,180
you know,

2648
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,840
people claim all sorts of
benefits for all sorts of things,

2649
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:12,110
but there's no scientific evidence that
manipulating your spine does anything.

2650
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,710
The only thing that it does show is
that if you can manipulate lower backs,

2651
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,530
sometimes with some people you
can relieve some of the pain.

2652
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,050
But I think a lot of that
is just massaging them.

2653
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,270
Like a lot of that is
just manipulating them,

2654
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:24,620
just he's just rubbing into them,

2655
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:26,810
giving them some sort of
relief and adjusting them.

2656
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,180
But the neck is very dangerous.

2657
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:29,551
You know,

2658
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,830
like people want to get their
neck adjusted and feel that pop.

2659
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:33,471
It feels good.

2660
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:33,741
Right.

2661
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:36,710
But literally people have
gotten strokes from that.

2662
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,813
Oh yeah.

2663
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,921
Well I,

2664
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:39,754
uh,

2665
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:40,310
I just,

2666
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,670
I read a study on it and said like,

2667
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,931
you know,

2668
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:42,764
they did like,

2669
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,130
you know,

2670
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,720
adjusting,

2671
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:43,970
you know,

2672
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,790
twice a week and a kid's like reaction I
in sports right quicker just because of

2673
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:49,624
the,

2674
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,230
everything was like lined up perfectly.

2675
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:51,951
Yeah.

2676
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:52,970
I don't think that's real.

2677
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,070
I feel like it is that,

2678
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,860
I'm sure you do.

2679
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,693
I'm just sure.

2680
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,040
I just don't think that you,

2681
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,750
I don't think your body has
been manipulated that way.

2682
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:05,990
I think that what's happening is
you're putting attention on your body.

2683
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,700
You thinking about recovery more,

2684
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:09,780
you're getting adjusted and
while you're getting adjusted,

2685
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,633
getting massage.

2686
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:10,900
Yeah,

2687
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,990
like when I used to get adjusted,

2688
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:13,460
the best part of it was what you said,

2689
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:14,294
the massage.

2690
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,171
That was the best part.

2691
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:18,020
I get it massaged and then I get
adjusted and it felt good like everything

2692
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:18,854
loosened up but,

2693
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,280
but when I talked to guys that are actual
orthopedic surgeons and real doctors

2694
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,180
like spinal doctors
and they talk about it,

2695
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:29,180
they're like you're
just making like a pop.

2696
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:29,901
Like it's not,

2697
00:52:29,901 --> 00:52:31,950
it's not real like it doesn't your,

2698
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,900
your body be so fucked up if like you
could manipulate it one way or another and

2699
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:36,910
that's how you fix things.

2700
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,000
It's like that's night fixing things.

2701
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,110
Like you got an injury.

2702
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,120
It's like there's a whole
bunch of shit going on.

2703
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,000
Like if you have some sort of
a muscle pull or a back injury.

2704
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,850
I soured on it when I had a bulging disc.

2705
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,400
And the reason why was because this
guy was convinced that I didn't have a

2706
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:52,430
bulging disc and I didn't get an Mri and
I was just going to a chiropractor and

2707
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:53,960
he was like pushing down on my head.

2708
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:55,630
I had a in my cervical and my,

2709
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,483
my neck,

2710
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,140
it was uh,

2711
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,760
my hands are going numb from Jujitsu and
this guy was like trying to tell him,

2712
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,660
you just keep coming to the car,

2713
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:03,471
you'll get adjusted,

2714
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,304
it'll be fine.

2715
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,900
And then I finally went to a real doctor
and they gave me an Mri and they were

2716
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:08,031
like,

2717
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:08,241
no,

2718
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:09,290
this is why you're in pain.

2719
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,650
Your disc is bulging out and it's pressing
against your nerve and it's called

2720
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,660
the Ulnar nerve and that's
why your hand is going numb.

2721
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,740
Like we're going to give you spinal
decompression and you should try to look

2722
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:21,020
into some things that are
going to reduce inflammation.

2723
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,760
They changed my diet and um,

2724
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,471
I started,

2725
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:24,620
uh,

2726
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,130
getting called Regena cane,

2727
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,100
which is like platelet rich
plasma where they take your blood,

2728
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,240
they spin it to heat it up.

2729
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,520
And in the heating up the blood,

2730
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:37,521
it produces this radical anti inflammatory
process and they then inject that

2731
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,870
your own blood back into the injuries
and just fixed it over like a period of

2732
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,310
like two or three months.

2733
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,040
Then I got another Mri and it went away.

2734
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,750
So I think a lot of that
shit is just fucking Voodoo.

2735
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,460
It's just nonsense and you think it's
working or you you you're thinking about

2736
00:53:56,461 --> 00:54:00,420
it or you're giving yourself time to
rest while you're getting all those

2737
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:01,020
adjustments.

2738
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,180
So you think that the
adjustments are what's doing it.

2739
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,600
But obviously there's a lot of people
that are chiropractors that are very

2740
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,600
skillful in all sorts of
different methods of recovery,

2741
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:10,261
like electrical,

2742
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:11,430
muscular stimulation,

2743
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:13,990
massage as a bunch of different
things and attraction.

2744
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:16,350
I don't know enough about acupuncture.

2745
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,000
I always,

2746
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,330
I never got it down and I read,

2747
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:20,164
he's like,

2748
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,000
eh.

2749
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,680
It seems to me like Horse Shit.

2750
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,330
If I had a guest it just,

2751
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,131
but I don't know.

2752
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:28,050
I mean maybe there's some method to it.

2753
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:31,680
I mean I think that massage works,

2754
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:32,970
that definitely works.

2755
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:33,181
Like,

2756
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:36,930
if I get a good massage and I have like
something that's tight and you know,

2757
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,020
I'll look your neck as fucked up from
not tapping or something like that.

2758
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:41,490
And then you go get it massaged out.

2759
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,020
Like you can fix that.

2760
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,630
Like that actually can
provide you some relief.

2761
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:46,650
Um,

2762
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,890
and I'm sure that if you go to a good one
of those people that does the cupping,

2763
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,290
like people apparently swear by that Shit,

2764
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:52,801
you know,

2765
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:54,260
you know cup it is covering by the way,

2766
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,583
I seen it like,

2767
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,410
like socks on the bag and he's like,

2768
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,650
it's terrible marks in your body.

2769
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:00,480
But I think that's half of it.

2770
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,420
Half of it is like the marks and your
body make you think like you're getting

2771
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:07,920
something done but they take
this cup and it sucks all your,

2772
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:09,840
your skin up into the cup.

2773
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,610
And how does that,

2774
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,013
I don't know how it works.

2775
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,590
Like look at this asshole that guy looks
like he has the worst disease known to

2776
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:17,160
man.

2777
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,410
I can manage if that was just
like what happened to your skin?

2778
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,060
You got to like some porcupine disease.

2779
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,103
It a nipple.

2780
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,490
Yeah.

2781
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,810
I guess like they have a vacuum thing
and it attaches to the top and it polls.

2782
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,870
How is that like,

2783
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:31,170
yeah.

2784
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,100
Olympic cupping.

2785
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:34,380
A practice rooted in ancient Islam.

2786
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,603
Oh Shit.

2787
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:36,840
Hmm.

2788
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,650
Interesting.

2789
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:37,951
Yeah.

2790
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:38,460
I mean,

2791
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,030
look,

2792
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:43,830
these fucking people are world class
athletes at the top of their game is

2793
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:44,580
cupping there.

2794
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,060
Okay.

2795
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:49,100
How about Google does cupping work is
cupping therapy where it's probably

2796
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,570
probably some weird sexual
shit called cupping to,

2797
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,640
I gotta be real careful when you pull up.

2798
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,290
How does cupping work?

2799
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,933
Hmm.

2800
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:57,983
Dry Cupping.

2801
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,501
Yeah.

2802
00:55:58,501 --> 00:55:59,311
How does it work?

2803
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:04,110
The Glass Cup is warmed by burning and
alcohol soaked cotton ball inside of it

2804
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:04,944
and they're making a bomb.

2805
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,000
Uh,

2806
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,570
this,

2807
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,000
this removes the oxygen in the cup,

2808
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,650
which creates a vacuum.

2809
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,220
The Cup is turned upside down
and placed on the patient's back.

2810
00:56:14,221 --> 00:56:16,680
The vacuum created by the lack of oxygen.

2811
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:16,931
Oh,

2812
00:56:16,931 --> 00:56:18,210
that's this kind of cupping.

2813
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,880
But the other one seemed to have
like a stem on the top of it.

2814
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,320
We're a vacuum thing pulls in,

2815
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,580
but what is it supposed to do?

2816
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,930
Facts down here it says,

2817
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:28,540
how do you feel about ice now
thing that's very important.

2818
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,680
Yeah.

2819
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,790
Drawing up the skin.

2820
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,680
Go scroll over towards the rights.

2821
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,710
I can see the year drawing up the skin
and the cop is believed to open the

2822
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:36,550
skin's pores,

2823
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:40,120
which helps to stimulate the blood
flow balances and realigns the flow.

2824
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,481
Okay,

2825
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,410
you fucked me with this,

2826
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:45,960
this ci Q I Ballot
realigns the flow of Qa.

2827
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,150
Oh,

2828
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,900
you got any?

2829
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,870
You got any peer reviewed
studies on that Qa.

2830
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,960
You fucking dipshit.

2831
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,420
Breaking up obstructions creates an
avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the

2832
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:56,254
body again,

2833
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,870
as soon as ass all start
talking about toxins,

2834
00:56:59,050 --> 00:56:59,361
oh,

2835
00:56:59,361 --> 00:56:59,511
well,

2836
00:56:59,511 --> 00:57:00,430
I'm just cleansing.

2837
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,660
I'm on a deep cleanse,

2838
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,490
getting the toxins out of my body.

2839
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,040
It's just bullshit talk.

2840
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,780
That whole toxins talk is,

2841
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,460
I'm pulling toxins out of my body.

2842
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,870
The fuck you are.

2843
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:11,291
No.

2844
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:11,561
You know,

2845
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,850
it pulls toxins out of your body.

2846
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,511
Your liver,

2847
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:14,344
you dump cunt.

2848
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,110
That's what,

2849
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,270
that's what your livers for.

2850
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,500
It gets the toxins out.

2851
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,000
You're not pulling them out with a cup.

2852
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,421
For me,

2853
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:20,041
it's a sauna.

2854
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,300
After I've been drinking all day sweat.

2855
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:22,841
Yeah,

2856
00:57:22,841 --> 00:57:24,850
your sweat does Lisa,

2857
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:27,560
a little fat filter
out some of that water,

2858
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,280
that ionic foot spa thing.

2859
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,801
Oh,

2860
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,810
that's the worst where the the your foot,

2861
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,140
the water turns black and they try to
pretend that it's like toxins coming out

2862
00:57:36,141 --> 00:57:36,650
of you.

2863
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,180
But meanwhile it's just a reaction.

2864
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,830
It's a chemical reaction.

2865
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:40,920
Yeah.

2866
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,753
You ever seen that?

2867
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:42,290
Yeah.

2868
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:42,511
They,

2869
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:42,870
they,

2870
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,090
they have this thing,

2871
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:45,440
it's plugged in and your,

2872
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,180
your foot sits in it and there's some
sort of reaction with the water and your

2873
00:57:50,181 --> 00:57:50,490
feet.

2874
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,040
It turns black and they try to tell you,

2875
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:52,341
oh,

2876
00:57:52,341 --> 00:57:55,550
the toxins and coming out of your
body and then you walk out of there.

2877
00:57:55,551 --> 00:57:56,570
I feel amazing.

2878
00:57:56,571 --> 00:57:56,751
No,

2879
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:57,650
I need a colonic.

2880
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:58,903
No,

2881
00:57:58,970 --> 00:57:59,803
no.

2882
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:00,801
This is not real.

2883
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:01,640
Ladies and gentlemen.

2884
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,050
What is that like?

2885
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:03,890
What are they doing?

2886
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:05,220
What is the exact reaction?

2887
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:08,360
There's lots of videos you can look up
where people would do the exact process

2888
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:08,801
with ad.

2889
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,340
Not without putting anything in there.

2890
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:10,490
Yeah.

2891
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,660
And the water is still turns black.

2892
00:58:11,661 --> 00:58:14,030
And I think it's something to
do with like battery acid or,

2893
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:14,810
I don't know.

2894
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,141
Honestly,

2895
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:15,741
that might not be it,

2896
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:16,521
but it's something weird.

2897
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:17,354
It's bullshit.

2898
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:17,991
See,

2899
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:19,550
people want to get healed.

2900
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,413
You get hurt,

2901
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,460
you want to get healed.

2902
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,520
You want to believe anything.

2903
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,270
Well,

2904
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,710
you ever heard of Reiki healers?

2905
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:26,191
No,

2906
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:26,550
they didn't.

2907
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:26,691
No,

2908
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:27,261
that's a,

2909
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:28,094
that's Raul thing.

2910
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:28,641
That's real.

2911
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:29,250
That's legit.

2912
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,100
That's like Sasha manipulation.

2913
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:34,640
Reiki is like they rubbed their hands
and they just pass him over your body and

2914
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,140
they heal you.

2915
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,540
We have this one video
that we were watching this,

2916
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,750
this one lady was just rubbing
her hand above this lady's Vagina.

2917
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:42,830
Just like above it.

2918
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,000
Like what is going on there?

2919
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:44,780
You're trying to,

2920
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:48,100
who kind of sorcery are
you using when you try to,

2921
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,530
what are you trying to
exercise from this lady's body?

2922
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,810
Yeah.

2923
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:54,710
And next thing you know,

2924
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,540
she's the number one
porno star in America.

2925
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:57,920
I look and I did it with my hands,

2926
00:58:57,921 --> 00:58:58,670
my healing,

2927
00:58:58,670 --> 00:58:59,331
my Reiki,

2928
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:00,164
healing.

2929
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,160
I met a dude last night.

2930
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:03,620
There was a psychic healer told
me it was a psychic healer.

2931
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:04,101
I go,

2932
00:59:04,101 --> 00:59:04,940
good luck with that.

2933
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,410
That's not real.

2934
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,590
You fuck psychic healer.

2935
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,250
The reason I asked about icing cause like
I know there's some people that don't

2936
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:13,640
like icing.

2937
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,870
They like doing that like that.

2938
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,930
It's like the drink gets
hurt unless it's needed,

2939
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:18,310
but like,

2940
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:18,500
you know,

2941
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,050
see you sprain your ankle and you can't
just start moving right away and get

2942
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,250
blood flow back in there without,

2943
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,513
yeah.

2944
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:23,931
There's,

2945
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,480
there's some evidence that um,

2946
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,590
well I think it depends
entirely upon the injury,

2947
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,770
but if you look at the vast majority
of scientists and sports medicine

2948
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:38,750
therapists and the people that are
at the cutting edge of the business,

2949
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,100
they almost all use eyes.

2950
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,940
Yeah.

2951
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,420
Yeah.

2952
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,350
They don't think that you,

2953
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:43,820
you're not supposed to use ice,

2954
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,170
um,

2955
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:45,710
within,

2956
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,221
what was it?

2957
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:47,600
Who was it on the podcast?

2958
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:49,220
Was it a Andy Galpin?

2959
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,320
Who was it that was talking about the,

2960
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:56,210
about the timeframe between icing
and exercise where you need to,

2961
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,890
or it might've been Rhonda Patrick.

2962
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,120
There's a beneficial amount of time
you should wait before you ice after an

2963
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:03,680
exercise like that.

2964
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:03,911
You,

2965
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:08,690
you give yourself a chance for
more recovery and more growth.

2966
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,970
If you wait a while before icing,

2967
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:11,300
like save,

2968
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,530
you had a hard training session,

2969
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,170
you wouldn't want to go
right to cryotherapy.

2970
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,940
You might want to wait an hour and a half,

2971
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:20,690
two hours and then go and then you'll
get the benefits of the hard training.

2972
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,810
But then you also get the
anti-inflammatory benefits of Cryo.

2973
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:24,240
Yeah,

2974
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,590
when I get crown at first time,

2975
01:00:25,591 --> 01:00:26,730
a couple of times to do it and I was like,

2976
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:27,783
this

2977
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:29,310
sucks.

2978
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,600
Like I wasted a bunch of money.

2979
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:31,321
Like this is like,

2980
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:32,160
I just hated it.

2981
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:33,263
Right.

2982
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,081
This is the only place.

2983
01:00:34,081 --> 01:00:34,891
Plus also it's free,

2984
01:00:34,891 --> 01:00:35,724
which is nice.

2985
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,560
That's really nice.

2986
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:37,780
Yeah.

2987
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:37,981
Right.

2988
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:38,491
And the guy's like,

2989
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:38,881
hey man,

2990
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:39,031
you know,

2991
01:00:39,031 --> 01:00:39,490
to come out.

2992
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,770
So I checked out and like,

2993
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:41,310
man,

2994
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:42,240
I got done with that one.

2995
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,840
It was like I felt the coldness
coming like in my whole body.

2996
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,640
And so it was a better place
you into a better place?

2997
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,051
I think so.

2998
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:49,800
I think it works cause I
definitely feel a difference.

2999
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:50,130
You know?

3000
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,210
How long you in town for her?

3001
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,283
I'm leaving tomorrow.

3002
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,710
Tim,

3003
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:53,970
I want to take you to a place out here,

3004
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,710
cryotherapy,

3005
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:56,960
cryo healthcare out here.

3006
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:58,430
They have a very unique system.

3007
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,600
Their system is,

3008
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,720
it's first of all the
guys that developed it,

3009
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:06,290
what they did was instead of having it
while you're breathing in lik liquid

3010
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,124
nitrogen,

3011
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,210
you know like where it's from,

3012
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:08,961
the neck down,

3013
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:10,130
which is a lot of those places.

3014
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,610
You go into it and you're breathing air
and you have to have your head above

3015
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,540
where the Cryo is because you can't breed
that shit in which is how that girl in

3016
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,291
Vegas died.

3017
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:18,920
Folks,

3018
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,030
if you don't know,

3019
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:20,870
there's a girl in Vegas,

3020
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:25,871
they went in the tank by herself and she
was too short and she was breathing in

3021
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:29,150
the nitrogen and she passed out
and then she froze to death.

3022
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,350
But the ones that cryo healthcare,

3023
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,300
that's the normal one.

3024
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,100
That's like Floyd Mayweather in there,

3025
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,630
right there where you see the,

3026
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,170
the,

3027
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,560
the,

3028
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,020
the cryo stuff is all below his head.

3029
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,510
The ones that Cryo healthcare,

3030
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,830
they jack the temperature way
down like 240 degrees below zero.

3031
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,620
And one of what they do is
they freeze the air itself.

3032
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,770
So the air they're pumping
into his super cold air.

3033
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:54,980
So you go in there with full,

3034
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,050
like you're,

3035
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:56,581
you're,

3036
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:58,310
you're breathing in this cold air.

3037
01:01:58,311 --> 01:01:59,210
It's on your head.

3038
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,270
Your full body is immersed in this,

3039
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:02,104
this cold air.

3040
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,290
So it's a,

3041
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,890
it's way more intense and it's supposed
to have way more benefit because your

3042
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,120
head gets cold too.

3043
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,200
So the reaction that your body
has for producing sidechains and

3044
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,420
anti-inflammatory,

3045
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:14,630
cold shock proteins,

3046
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,140
your body freaks out way more
when everything is covered.

3047
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,770
Not just the neck down,

3048
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:20,010
but your

3049
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,843
head too.

3050
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:21,290
Yeah.

3051
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:21,630
So too,

3052
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,261
I wish you were in town.

3053
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:22,760
I'll take you there.

3054
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,070
Yeah,

3055
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:23,761
that's pretty sweet.

3056
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:24,451
We gotta do this.

3057
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:25,920
You've got some other duties.

3058
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,720
Yeah,

3059
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,553
I do.

3060
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,150
What do you have to do
other UFC stuff now?

3061
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:30,651
Not even your,

3062
01:02:30,651 --> 01:02:30,940
yeah,

3063
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:31,411
kind of,

3064
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:31,671
kind of,

3065
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:31,871
Nah,

3066
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:32,310
I was like,

3067
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:32,970
my stuff,

3068
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:33,803
I don't know.

3069
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,381
I didn't want to go,

3070
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:36,900
but I had to go like a big kid.

3071
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:37,150
Oh,

3072
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:39,480
it's my wife's like just go and I,

3073
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,370
I put below,

3074
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,203
fine.

3075
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,380
That's funny right now.

3076
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:45,960
And just training when
you have a big fight,

3077
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,220
how much of the big fight is like how
much of the pain in the ass it's doing

3078
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:51,054
press?

3079
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,260
I want to say you're complaining about it,

3080
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:57,390
but I mean it's as far
as like time constraints.

3081
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,620
Sometimes it sucks.

3082
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,180
It does suck cause like you
and you're sitting in a year,

3083
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,820
you're thinking about
doing this in the car.

3084
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,541
Like hey,

3085
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:03,850
you're like,

3086
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,100
oh right.

3087
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:05,641
You know,

3088
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:07,370
but I understand it's part of the game.

3089
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,410
It helps you know,

3090
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,940
promote you and you know,

3091
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,950
your sales and you know,

3092
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:11,491
paper views,

3093
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:12,420
all that stuff like this.

3094
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,550
But there's like a balance to be achieved.

3095
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:14,701
Right.

3096
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:16,080
Those kind of Greg argument,

3097
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:20,220
Conor Mcgregor's argument was whether
when he went on that world tour with Aldo,

3098
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,030
he's like,

3099
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,740
they just did way too much.

3100
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:23,430
He's like,

3101
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,200
by the time you're doing all this,

3102
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,400
you don't have time to train.

3103
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:26,851
He goes,

3104
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:28,110
there's no way you're going to train,

3105
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:28,561
recover,

3106
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:29,430
sleep correctly.

3107
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,280
You're flying from one
city to another country,

3108
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:35,340
to another country and you're
just constantly on a jet.

3109
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:36,600
I was like,

3110
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,410
I mean,

3111
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,090
yeah,

3112
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,150
when we went to Australia,

3113
01:03:39,151 --> 01:03:39,841
I mean I'm flew,

3114
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:41,960
I'll share my five Mark Hunt and uh,

3115
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:45,600
I remember I flew more than it actually
was there in Australia while I was there

3116
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:47,340
for like a day and a half
and I flew back home.

3117
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,353
That's crazy.

3118
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,201
It was bad.

3119
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,730
So the flight is more,

3120
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,720
more time.

3121
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,291
I think it was,

3122
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,440
it was like a 20 hour flight
there in 24 and 20 hours

3123
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,953
of Dicks.

3124
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,093
That flight is,

3125
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,230
you get out of there and
you're just half a person,

3126
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:06,231
you look confused and like something
happens to you when you fly in 1617 hours

3127
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:07,440
in a plane.

3128
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,890
I was there for after the flat.

3129
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,530
So I got there a week
early before the flight.

3130
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:12,990
I stayed for the week of the flight and
I was there like three or four more days

3131
01:04:12,991 --> 01:04:13,261
later.

3132
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:14,430
So I was the one who was there with three,

3133
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:15,990
three and a half,

3134
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,590
two and a half,

3135
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:17,423
23 weeks.

3136
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,410
And I got home and I literally,

3137
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,041
it was crazy.

3138
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:23,430
So I get home at like seven in the
morning and my brothers in my house,

3139
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:24,990
my wife from your wife
come home and I'm like,

3140
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,070
I'm tracking my eyes open
and like it was like my,

3141
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:31,200
I was like so miss combobulated
so I'd get in the car.

3142
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,830
I almost forgot how to drive because
I was on the other side of it was my

3143
01:04:34,831 --> 01:04:35,071
brother.

3144
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,281
I'm like,

3145
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:36,001
you should probably drive.

3146
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:38,100
He's the way I like cause I have not
been on the side of the road in a long

3147
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:38,550
time.

3148
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,720
What you drive it in Australia?

3149
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,931
No,

3150
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:40,680
no it was just,

3151
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,350
I was seeing they,

3152
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,570
I was just saying that happens inside.

3153
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:43,440
It was just so weird,

3154
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:43,670
you know,

3155
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:45,360
just everything was so
awkward and immune was Craig.

3156
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:45,571
We went,

3157
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:49,540
I went for a run and they're freaking
parrots and like Kangaroos and shit dude.

3158
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,020
Like just regular like it's
like our seagulls and crows.

3159
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,100
I'm like running right
cause like rainbows,

3160
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,400
like two can't stand next to me.

3161
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:56,841
Yeah,

3162
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:58,200
Australia is a weird place,

3163
01:04:58,201 --> 01:04:58,590
man.

3164
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:58,951
Yeah it was,

3165
01:04:58,951 --> 01:04:59,401
it was crazy.

3166
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:00,780
But like my time clock was screwed up.

3167
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:04,350
I went to work a couple a couple of days
later and like I was still like four

3168
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:06,480
days later and I was still like messed up.

3169
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,290
It was bad.

3170
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:07,661
Yeah.

3171
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:09,240
I could fuck you up for a week or two,

3172
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,560
but you know,

3173
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,430
it's worth it just to
go to Australia to see.

3174
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:13,980
Amazing.

3175
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,790
It's a great place.

3176
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:15,120
Yeah.

3177
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,810
Once your family,

3178
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:17,920
when you have a big fight
with a guy like say mark,

3179
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,110
how

3180
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:18,600
well you know,

3181
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,040
could be a brawl and that turned
out to be a five round fight.

3182
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:21,820
Right.

3183
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,100
Was it a fair four and a half?

3184
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:24,491
Yeah.

3185
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:25,450
He stopped him in the fifth.

3186
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:25,990
Yep.

3187
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,560
Um,

3188
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,331
when you,

3189
01:05:27,331 --> 01:05:29,410
you have a fight like that and you know,

3190
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:29,770
this is,

3191
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:30,970
you're in there for the long haul.

3192
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:35,170
Do you plan on like staying for
days after the fight to recover?

3193
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,183
No.

3194
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,450
I actually wanted to get home,

3195
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:39,140
but I had,

3196
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,220
I was the bad boy,

3197
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:44,600
so he wanted me to do a couple
like promotional thing down here.

3198
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:44,881
They play,

3199
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:45,740
they get to see my family.

3200
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:47,900
So I have family other
than Melbourne and Sydney.

3201
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,201
Oh,

3202
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:49,100
you have family out there.

3203
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,821
Oh no kidding.

3204
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:49,931
Yeah.

3205
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:51,080
So we hung out there for a little bit.

3206
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:51,810
It was cool.

3207
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,920
Did you see that video that
they posted a yesterday of a,

3208
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,580
these guys in Australia with a 39 foot
boat and a shark swam by those 20 feet

3209
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,414
long?

3210
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,343
You see that video?

3211
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:06,380
It's a fucking insane video cause the
shark is almost as big as the God damn

3212
01:06:07,021 --> 01:06:07,350
boat.

3213
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:10,290
They have this 39 foot boat
and they have an overhead,

3214
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:13,980
like a drone footage of the sharks
swimming around the boat and they're like

3215
01:06:14,030 --> 01:06:15,440
cheeses.

3216
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:17,460
I definitely shit my pants.

3217
01:06:17,461 --> 01:06:18,810
And that one was not much you can do.

3218
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:19,891
I mean,

3219
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:21,210
you don't have a whole lot of options.

3220
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:22,140
I mean,

3221
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:22,470
yeah.

3222
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,800
Wow.

3223
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,060
It's like 20 foot shark.

3224
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:24,661
That's crazy.

3225
01:06:24,661 --> 01:06:25,500
Fuck all that.

3226
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:27,540
And that was truly has a ton of those.

3227
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:28,530
They're all over the place.

3228
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:28,720
Yeah,

3229
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,430
I mean I,

3230
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:29,980
I was talking,

3231
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,380
math happens a lot apparently.

3232
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,430
Right?

3233
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,590
18 foot shark next to a 21 foot boat.

3234
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:38,630
Fuck that dude.

3235
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,780
Oh my God.

3236
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,110
Videos like those whales
and stuff that I brought up.

3237
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,220
You know,

3238
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,250
like right next to the bone.

3239
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:44,970
Yeah.

3240
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:45,900
What does this one Jamie,

3241
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:48,000
18 foot shirt next to the 21 foot boat.

3242
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:48,811
Oh my God.

3243
01:06:48,811 --> 01:06:49,680
That thing is big.

3244
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,940
Jesus Christ.

3245
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,903
Huge.

3246
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:56,080
And it's just swimming
next to the boat going,

3247
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,820
can I eat you?

3248
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,420
Hmm?

3249
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,350
How do I eat you?

3250
01:06:58,410 --> 01:06:59,160
Hmm.

3251
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,330
Not sure if I can eat you.

3252
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,860
God Damn Kid.

3253
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:02,694
Get back.

3254
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:03,990
Get back and it was your son.

3255
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:04,681
Get back.

3256
01:07:04,681 --> 01:07:05,514
You little fuck.

3257
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,783
Sit down.

3258
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,050
Jesus Christ.

3259
01:07:08,051 --> 01:07:08,884
It's a shark.

3260
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:10,420
Yeah,

3261
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:10,721
there,

3262
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:11,240
there,

3263
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,073
there.

3264
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,850
Did you see the video of the guy was
diving the real recent video and they like

3265
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:17,260
hit the back of the shock,

3266
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,210
came over and thumped
the back of his head.

3267
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:19,691
He just,

3268
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:21,010
that one guy who was our fishing.

3269
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:21,470
Nah,

3270
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,090
he was like,

3271
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,310
oh it was probably
thinking of other video,

3272
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:23,980
but he's like this,

3273
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:27,940
you know old guys like this and that
and the seat and he's like this and the

3274
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:28,774
swordfish.

3275
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,703
Half of it.

3276
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:30,151
Go do it.

3277
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:31,090
The holding jumped in.

3278
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,010
Oh what was it started going crazy?

3279
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,411
The one guy,

3280
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:34,570
he jumped overboard cause he's like,

3281
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,600
you didn't want get like
sauteed by this thing.

3282
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:37,000
You know,

3283
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,530
guys know though.

3284
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:37,870
She's like,

3285
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,950
I tried to like get out of the chair.

3286
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:39,740
I tried to hurry it up.

3287
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:40,500
You know,

3288
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:40,931
it was great.

3289
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,280
Fish is trying to get away from a shark.

3290
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:44,100
Is that what I think you
should just flew his jumped in.

3291
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:44,461
Yeah,

3292
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:45,090
yeah,

3293
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:45,420
yeah,

3294
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,253
yeah.

3295
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,131
I saw like that,

3296
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:48,450
like the seal one time was like,

3297
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:50,130
you jumped in the boat was
trying to wait from my guy.

3298
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,630
I kill a whale.

3299
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:52,521
Yeah.

3300
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:53,270
To My,

3301
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,060
my oldest daughter when she was 13,

3302
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,910
we went fishing and she was
a vegetarian at the time.

3303
01:07:58,911 --> 01:08:00,080
She loves animals.

3304
01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:00,741
And uh,

3305
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:01,574
and I was like,

3306
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,110
but she was eating fish.

3307
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:03,381
I said,

3308
01:08:03,381 --> 01:08:03,920
listen,

3309
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,150
let's just go fishing.

3310
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,440
We'll catch a fish,

3311
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,393
we'll cook it.

3312
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,920
And you'll get like this sort
of connection with your food.

3313
01:08:09,921 --> 01:08:10,161
Is this,

3314
01:08:10,161 --> 01:08:10,990
what was this one?

3315
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,290
She's in south beach the other day.

3316
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,210
Some guy just shortly,

3317
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,740
10 feet the coast.

3318
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,750
This guys just trying to die.

3319
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,010
What is he doing?

3320
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,540
Because I don't know if he even saw it.

3321
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,470
So anyway,

3322
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,800
um,

3323
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,800
I'm on this boat and we
catch a Marlin within

3324
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,890
10 minutes of the,

3325
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:30,770
the trip,

3326
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,603
10 minutes in,

3327
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,510
we catch a Marlin,

3328
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:33,231
which is crazy,

3329
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:33,770
right?

3330
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,603
All of a sudden

3331
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,240
I'm pulling this thing in
and it's not a big Marlin.

3332
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,730
It's probably like 80 pounds
or something like that.

3333
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,710
We get it into the boat and they beat
the fucking thing to death with clubs

3334
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:46,581
right in front of her.

3335
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:47,480
Cause that's what they do.

3336
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,910
They pull it in and
then just fucking thump,

3337
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:50,990
thump,

3338
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:51,441
thump.

3339
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:52,274
And she's sitting there,

3340
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:53,283
Ooh.

3341
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,660
And then they put it on ice after that.

3342
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:57,770
And then when they put it on ice,

3343
01:08:57,771 --> 01:08:58,880
it's like still alive.

3344
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,480
Every now and then he'd
hear like its tail.

3345
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:03,560
It'd be flapping out,

3346
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:04,430
it'd be spasming.

3347
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,100
It would come back to life and
they sub it in the head again.

3348
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,180
She was a vegetarian for another
year after that took a while.

3349
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,860
It took a while to turn it back around.

3350
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,560
My thought was like,

3351
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,440
we're going to go catch some Mahi Mahi.

3352
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,550
This is going to be great Marlin,

3353
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,900
you usually don't catch a Marlin.

3354
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,790
And we caught one within 10 minutes.

3355
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:23,660
Yeah,

3356
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:23,931
it was,

3357
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:24,350
uh,

3358
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,183
I mean,

3359
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:25,640
yeah,

3360
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,880
like you were going to be a good dad.

3361
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,210
You know,

3362
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,930
like they're just

3363
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,440
smash the smile.

3364
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,790
It's just was the total wrong experience.

3365
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:35,930
Like my youngest daughter's,

3366
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:40,730
I took them fishing and they caught
little fish and it was a great experience.

3367
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:41,990
It was like what I was hoping for,

3368
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,460
like the caught little fish.

3369
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,080
We brought it back to the restaurant.

3370
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:46,220
The restaurant cooked him.

3371
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:48,320
You were staying at a
resort and that was great.

3372
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:48,581
I was like,

3373
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:49,414
Woo,

3374
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,323
nobody got club.

3375
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,450
I was terrified the
first time I took them.

3376
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:53,961
I'm like,

3377
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:57,410
if you're fucking four and you watch
a Marlin and get clubbed today,

3378
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,270
might not ever bounce back from that.

3379
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,100
I remember I would do if I,

3380
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:03,263
if I,

3381
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:05,750
if I was a child and saw that
I probably be scarred for life.

3382
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,080
I fucked up.

3383
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,411
I didn't,

3384
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:09,860
I just didn't.

3385
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,131
I just,

3386
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,890
the only time I've ever
caught a Marlin to I've,

3387
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,420
I've gotten ocean fish and a hundred
times they won't cut a Marlin.

3388
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,980
I've never been Osha fishing.

3389
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:16,431
Oh,

3390
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:17,264
it's the best.

3391
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:17,751
Yeah,

3392
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:17,961
man.

3393
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:18,680
It's amazing.

3394
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:18,861
Yeah.

3395
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,920
The only thing that that's kind of a
bummer was a lot of times they just want a

3396
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:22,550
troll.

3397
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:22,821
Right?

3398
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:24,780
So they're just pulling
the lines behind the boats.

3399
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,360
You're not really actively doing anything.

3400
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:27,740
I like casting,

3401
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:28,501
you know,

3402
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:32,090
like the best a ocean fishing
I've done is in Mexico for,

3403
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:32,540
um,

3404
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,270
I think there are either skipjack or
amberjack tune and I forget what they're

3405
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:35,571
called,

3406
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:37,550
but we would go and there would be a,

3407
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:40,220
they would follow these
seagulls and bait fish.

3408
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,100
So like the bait fish should be frothing
on the water cause the tuna were

3409
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:45,740
underneath jacket him and then
just cast into them and just,

3410
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:45,921
Oh,

3411
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:46,510
it was amazing.

3412
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:47,450
We're in Mexico.

3413
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,111
Uh,

3414
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,260
it was outside of Cabo,

3415
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,580
so it's like,

3416
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,414
uh,

3417
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,191
no,

3418
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:55,401
no,

3419
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:56,440
it was outside Puerto by.

3420
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:57,850
Yeah,

3421
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:01,250
it was outside Puerto Bayada so I'm not
sure like what part of the ocean it was,

3422
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,780
but it's great.

3423
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,480
You know,

3424
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,020
it's not when you eat a fish
that you caught like an hour ago,

3425
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,011
you realize like,

3426
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,431
wow,

3427
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:08,540
this tastes way better.

3428
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:08,870
Yeah,

3429
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:09,591
it's amazing.

3430
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:10,460
Like what happened?

3431
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:11,780
The degrading of the,

3432
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,910
it's the kind of the opposite
meat because with meat,

3433
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,750
like you can eat a lot of meat fresh right
after he kill it and it tastes really

3434
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:19,081
good,

3435
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,040
but much,

3436
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,260
much of like,

3437
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,300
like the best cuts of meat that you
get like from a butcher or form a,

3438
01:11:25,301 --> 01:11:25,621
a,

3439
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,850
a really good steak restaurant.

3440
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,910
They let it age now they let an,

3441
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:30,420
apparently they do that with tuna too.

3442
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,890
Like when you get Sushi.

3443
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:32,783
I didn't know that.

3444
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:33,360
Yeah,

3445
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,290
they let that Shit Age.

3446
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,443
I love Sushi.

3447
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,343
Do you fish?

3448
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,520
Ah,

3449
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,800
I mean I used to like back in the day.

3450
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:40,510
Yeah.

3451
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:40,970
I,

3452
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:41,803
how do you have time,

3453
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,020
right?

3454
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:42,170
Yeah.

3455
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:42,950
I'm kind of busy.

3456
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:43,880
I have a little pot in my house,

3457
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:45,050
but I don't think have a pond.

3458
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,441
Yeah,

3459
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:47,060
it's not huge.

3460
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:48,770
Probably 20 yards by 20 yards.

3461
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:49,604
Not Big at all.

3462
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:52,130
But we do have the massive turtles,

3463
01:11:52,131 --> 01:11:52,620
like,

3464
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,610
like the one that bond.

3465
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:54,741
I had no idea.

3466
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:56,540
So I actually,

3467
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:57,260
we made a bet,

3468
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,480
one of the UFC fights and budget.

3469
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:02,190
My coaches were over and I was lit up
having fun in the work and I never bet.

3470
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:02,720
And they're like,

3471
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:02,910
hi,

3472
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,160
bridging.

3473
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:03,751
This person went.

3474
01:12:03,751 --> 01:12:04,161
And so I was like,

3475
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:04,940
I'll take that back.

3476
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,430
Like w w w what happens
in you when I'm like,

3477
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,270
if you,

3478
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,200
if the person that wins,

3479
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,900
you know you can do
everyone to pick whatever,

3480
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:12,580
you know.

3481
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,190
So I went,

3482
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:13,551
oh my God,

3483
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:16,110
you gotta have to get in them getting a
little shuttle boat and had to do across

3484
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,960
the lake and we did snow balls at you.

3485
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:18,970
It was never winter.

3486
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:20,413
And they're like,

3487
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:20,901
no,

3488
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:22,550
I'm like a hundred percent
you're going to do it.

3489
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,990
So the best part was,

3490
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:24,531
it was heavy,

3491
01:12:24,531 --> 01:12:25,460
it was covered in ice.

3492
01:12:25,461 --> 01:12:26,810
So they can go anywhere and put pedicle.

3493
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:27,644
It's sucks.

3494
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,750
So they're just sitting
and I'm just really numb,

3495
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,071
so whatever.

3496
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:33,080
And we'll do our thing in Austin.

3497
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:33,801
Like months later,

3498
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:34,311
my wife's like,

3499
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:34,840
honey,

3500
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,170
she sends me a video of these,

3501
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,940
these massive snapping turtles.

3502
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,800
They're like hate fucking each other.

3503
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,560
Like really the ones I sent,

3504
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:41,880
I want,

3505
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,820
if I can find it on the phone,

3506
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,500
the ones like this and I'll get some bags.

3507
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:45,671
And I was thinking,

3508
01:12:45,671 --> 01:12:46,504
I was like,

3509
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,050
I tried to like brace face off.

3510
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:48,261
I'm like,

3511
01:12:48,261 --> 01:12:48,951
what the Hell is going on?

3512
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:49,730
It was like,

3513
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:50,330
but they were like,

3514
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,051
I mean I could,

3515
01:12:51,051 --> 01:12:51,250
you know,

3516
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,970
they had both that doing
that big there are massive.

3517
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:56,150
And then I looked over and they had
like a bunch of babies and they don't,

3518
01:12:56,151 --> 01:12:58,580
and then an extra so long
I get the grab and by like,

3519
01:12:58,730 --> 01:12:59,460
by the behind the,

3520
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,890
cause they'll bite your hand off.

3521
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:01,381
Yeah.

3522
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:02,120
So those uh,

3523
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,380
just moved into your neighborhood?

3524
01:13:03,381 --> 01:13:04,214
Is that what happened?

3525
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,750
It was there where I live.

3526
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:06,740
Like it's weird.

3527
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:08,840
So I have like a private
drive from my house.

3528
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,610
You can't see my house off the driveway.

3529
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:11,600
So we have like a little pond.

3530
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,080
And so yeah.

3531
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,180
But were they there before?

3532
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,193
They're always been there.

3533
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,720
They go back and forth in
a little pond next to it.

3534
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:19,550
That connected where
our drivers cook 'em up.

3535
01:13:19,551 --> 01:13:20,870
Turtle soup recipe,

3536
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,490
half decent if you cook it right.

3537
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,310
What is your diet like?

3538
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,730
You know,

3539
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,750
usual pizza,

3540
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,613
beer.

3541
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,250
I frowned upon that.

3542
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:30,611
I mean,

3543
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:31,630
I joked around about that,

3544
01:13:31,631 --> 01:13:33,230
but we had Courtney [inaudible],

3545
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,970
she's a woman who won
the Moab to 40 oh Yay.

3546
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,910
Check is a fucking savage.

3547
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,950
She beat every man,

3548
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,370
every person who entered that
race by a marathon length,

3549
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:48,820
240 miles and she was,

3550
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,920
she was ahead by more than 20 miles.

3551
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,940
The next person,

3552
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:55,150
the second place person was more than
20 miles behind her when she won.

3553
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,400
So he's just like an ultra marathon.

3554
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:57,820
Yeah,

3555
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,150
yeah.

3556
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,070
To three days for some people.

3557
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,851
But for her,

3558
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:02,830
she did it and I think she did it in too.

3559
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,510
Right?

3560
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:03,851
Cause she,

3561
01:14:03,851 --> 01:14:04,684
she's an animal.

3562
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,531
She's a fucking animal.

3563
01:14:05,531 --> 01:14:06,310
Anyway,

3564
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,940
beer,

3565
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,773
Nachos,

3566
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:08,763
candy.

3567
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:09,683
That's what she eats.

3568
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,080
Beer and Nachos and,

3569
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:11,981
and we were like,

3570
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:12,510
what?

3571
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,270
Like I expected some sophisticated
Kenogenic diet protocol where they're

3572
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:21,271
monitoring or fucking or ketone
levels in her blood and checking out.

3573
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,130
All of our portions are mapped out.

3574
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,550
Rago running around.

3575
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:25,871
When she was here,

3576
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:26,980
she just kept eating candy.

3577
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,470
She was just eating candy
like m and m's and shit.

3578
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,060
She said,

3579
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,893
I mean,

3580
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,463
I kind of meals.

3581
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,111
Yeah,

3582
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:35,944
those are great.

3583
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:37,993
You get a meal prep?

3584
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:38,341
Yeah,

3585
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:39,490
definitely send me a bunch of stuff.

3586
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:39,851
It's good.

3587
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:40,210
Um,

3588
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,400
yeah,

3589
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,660
but I am going to have you
wait so long or you know.

3590
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,310
Right.

3591
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:43,600
You know,

3592
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,710
on some days a lot pizza.

3593
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,160
You can do whatever the fuck you want,

3594
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,320
but I don't like,

3595
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,870
have you ever thought about
trying to go to two oh five

3596
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,211
we thought about it,

3597
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:53,380
but I'd be really tough.

3598
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,273
What do you weigh now?

3599
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,780
To 40 yeah.

3600
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,800
And you're not fat,

3601
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,210
so what you like,

3602
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,470
even if you got super lean,

3603
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:04,471
you're probably looking at two 25 and
then a hard cut to 25 classes all day.

3604
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,290
Yeah.

3605
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:05,831
Easy mate.

3606
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:07,390
That I think there should be one.

3607
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,253
Me Too.

3608
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,360
I think there should be a
lot more weight classes.

3609
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:10,901
I really do.

3610
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:13,180
And I know there's a resistance because
they want to keep the spore pure.

3611
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:13,631
They don't want it.

3612
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:16,420
Like boxing was a weight
class every four pounds.

3613
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,610
But I feel like if you look at guys,

3614
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,980
there's a lot of guys
that I think are tweeners,

3615
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,520
you know,

3616
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:21,911
they're like,

3617
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:22,690
they're not quite,

3618
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:22,930
yeah,

3619
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:23,740
well you're a heavyweight.

3620
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,770
You can't say you're a trainer,

3621
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,270
but you can't see the champ.

3622
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:29,890
But this guys that,

3623
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:30,551
you know,

3624
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:32,530
like Diego Sanchez was
always a good example.

3625
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,090
He's a little bit too small to make 55
when he tried to make 45 was a disaster

3626
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:37,924
like,

3627
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,840
but if there was a 65 pound weight class,

3628
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:41,980
I think that's perfect for him.

3629
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:46,330
And there's a lot of guys that
like 70 to 85 that's a big jump.

3630
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:48,510
85 to two oh five that's crazy.

3631
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,600
That's 20 pounds.

3632
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:50,830
Yeah,

3633
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,170
I mean I think definitely
a few more weight classes.

3634
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:53,561
Not like,

3635
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:54,330
yeah,

3636
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,190
every 10 pounds.

3637
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:55,300
Yeah,

3638
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,051
I think I'd be great too.

3639
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,610
I think I'd be on board for that.

3640
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:58,150
Um,

3641
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,770
I think that's the move every 10 pounds.

3642
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:04,500
And then when you go to o five
two oh five to two 25 to 25 to,

3643
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,920
it should be unlimited.

3644
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,390
It shouldn't be to 65.

3645
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:08,530
I know that seems silly to me,

3646
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,280
but I think that two of those
guys that are unlimited that that,

3647
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,580
that they won't last long,

3648
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:18,090
they might not put in Ghana was cutting
weight to get to two 65 way to 50 last

3649
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:18,410
Friday I thought.

3650
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:18,880
No,

3651
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,880
no he weighed two 62 63 to
63 or [inaudible] 64 yeah,

3652
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,070
no he's cutting weight.

3653
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,760
Oh cool.

3654
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,593
Yeah.

3655
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,130
Yeah.

3656
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:35,130
I'm a big fellow but obviously
there's pros and cons to being big.

3657
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,470
And the con is that if you're
getting into the third,

3658
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:39,550
fourth and fifth rounds,

3659
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,060
yeah.

3660
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,490
You know those big guys are
not known for their endurance.

3661
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,410
Did they say that the weight class,

3662
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,500
like there's like there was
always a thought in MMA,

3663
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,240
like when Cain Velasquez was on top,

3664
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,040
there was a thought that that
might be the perfect size,

3665
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,410
like two 40 like anything
bigger than that,

3666
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,880
maybe it's just like not worth it.

3667
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:58,150
Cause a 240 pound man cause basically
knock out anybody on the planet.

3668
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,950
And so the power is still there.

3669
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:02,440
But you have more like nobody
had more endurance and cane.

3670
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:03,450
No,

3671
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:03,600
no.

3672
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:03,981
I think.

3673
01:17:03,981 --> 01:17:04,391
I think so.

3674
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:05,980
I think being at two 48
you just throw it out.

3675
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:06,361
The curt here,

3676
01:17:06,361 --> 01:17:07,750
it's sort of the strengths or the speed.

3677
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,440
I mean that's why I love be where I'm at.

3678
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:09,591
You know?

3679
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:09,980
I don't

3680
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,490
try again.

3681
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,490
I mean I'm not going to trust you more
than you ever thought about gaining or

3682
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:13,870
no,

3683
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:14,180
no,

3684
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:14,330
no.

3685
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:14,930
I mean I've,

3686
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:15,711
I've I've gained,

3687
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:19,910
I remember why after mark on man I w I
kind of went off the deep end and just

3688
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:22,460
went on a binge drinking and finally
me waiting for like living in an but of

3689
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:23,091
life and I show,

3690
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:23,821
I stepped on the scale.

3691
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:24,654
It's like,

3692
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,650
what'd you want to 59 wow.

3693
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,670
I never weighed in my life.

3694
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,350
Do you take a picture
like holding your gut?

3695
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:30,591
No,

3696
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:31,041
I didn't actually.

3697
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,150
I looked exactly the same.

3698
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,640
I know that I just looked
like a little bit thicker.

3699
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,250
Nothing like bad though.

3700
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:36,290
So it filled out good.

3701
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,620
Yeah,

3702
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,041
it was a good,

3703
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:37,430
yeah,

3704
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:38,440
I think a lot of him in the ass too.

3705
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,360
So if you're a chick,

3706
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,220
it would have been a good move.

3707
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:40,470
Yeah,

3708
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,510
I would have been working all day.

3709
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:47,270
Don't totally rambled back to
the whole ultra marathon thing.

3710
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,261
So I'm a Weirdo.

3711
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:50,030
And so I found out about
watching marathons.

3712
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:52,340
So I go on Wikipedia and I
started reading all about it.

3713
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:54,021
They were talking about,

3714
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,940
and then I really like the top three guys.

3715
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:57,410
Like they're crazy.

3716
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:59,070
Like the one guy was like the first ever.

3717
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,330
My argument of the guy like
that did awesome was it's,

3718
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:05,390
I can't a little runner kettle
like guy cattle farmer guy,

3719
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:06,343
cattle farmer.

3720
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,001
They run through the night.

3721
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,860
Well he didn't sleep at night so
he would just run and keep on it.

3722
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,010
She didn't run fast but his feet.

3723
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,210
But then they had another
guy who I saw that guy,

3724
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:15,830
I saw a video about that guy.

3725
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,220
And then,

3726
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:16,610
yeah.

3727
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,960
And then there was another guy,

3728
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:18,470
he uh,

3729
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:19,470
he was like third years old here,

3730
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,091
like epiphany.

3731
01:18:20,091 --> 01:18:20,390
He was like,

3732
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:24,680
he was drinking one night and he just
got sick or like he just wants to drink

3733
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:25,630
when I first birthday party,

3734
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,720
put on my shoes and just start running.

3735
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,230
Realized yet,

3736
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:27,590
you know,

3737
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,490
you can still run.

3738
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,050
And he like tore it up again.

3739
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,160
I don't know who the guy's name was.

3740
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,480
He like American and another guy,

3741
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,560
he was like,

3742
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,530
at one point he was sleeping and running
and like he's still like while he was

3743
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,540
sleeping he was running.

3744
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:38,811
Yeah.

3745
01:18:38,811 --> 01:18:39,644
He was like,

3746
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:40,480
yeah,

3747
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,301
I can't talk.

3748
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:42,110
Give me a break.

3749
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,943
But he's like,

3750
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,820
but he's like that.

3751
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:45,411
They laid,

3752
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:46,101
watched him sleep.

3753
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:46,690
I was running,

3754
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:47,211
I use like,

3755
01:18:47,211 --> 01:18:47,770
Whoa,

3756
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:48,441
I don't remember him.

3757
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:48,980
The guy,

3758
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,560
he's like twins Doring no,

3759
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:51,021
no what I'm saying,

3760
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:51,291
what I'm saying,

3761
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:52,090
he was just running,

3762
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:52,400
just,

3763
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,061
I don't know if you're snoring,

3764
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,230
but like they had another time,

3765
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,460
like they were saying a story about it.

3766
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:58,940
He like twist his ankle and beginning
of the race and it was a good size of a

3767
01:18:58,941 --> 01:18:59,774
grapefruit.

3768
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,610
He still destroyed everyone.

3769
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,660
We did the fish.

3770
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,430
Like I fight everyone in
the cross finish line.

3771
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,353
Wow.

3772
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,950
It's got about in there and look it up.

3773
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:07,813
And he was like,

3774
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,410
I dunno.

3775
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,243
It's like,

3776
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:13,490
did you find this cliff young shuffle?

3777
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:13,821
Yeah,

3778
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:14,420
that's the,

3779
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:15,200
yeah,

3780
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,480
that's the cattle rancher guy.

3781
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,591
So he,

3782
01:19:17,591 --> 01:19:18,141
he does,

3783
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:19,430
he kind of has a shuffle.

3784
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,640
And the idea was that that shuffle allowed
him to save energy because he wasn't

3785
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:25,301
a,

3786
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:27,710
it wasn't like picking up
his legs like really high.

3787
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,390
He's just kind of like shuffling along.

3788
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,040
Yeah,

3789
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:31,910
I remember this guy.

3790
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:33,461
Yeah.

3791
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:34,294
Look at him.

3792
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:39,870
He competed without his false teeth
because they rattled when he ran Jesus

3793
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:40,550
Christ

3794
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:43,490
when they showed up and no one
thought it was nobody was doing,

3795
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,160
they didn't know what he did if he
didn't knew what he signed up for.

3796
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:47,320
Wow.

3797
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:47,481
I mean,

3798
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:48,314
well he won.

3799
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:51,450
Well,

3800
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:53,560
the history is filled with guys like that.

3801
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:57,520
It's like everybody thinks they know
exactly how everything works until someone

3802
01:19:57,521 --> 01:19:58,354
comes along.

3803
01:19:58,390 --> 01:20:01,840
That's a completely unique version
that no one had seen before.

3804
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,610
Like that guy doing this little shuffle.

3805
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:04,690
It's amazing.

3806
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,500
Or like this Courtney go.walter Chick,

3807
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:06,770
she,

3808
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:07,603
she won.

3809
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:08,130
She

3810
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,210
has beat the world record for the most
amount of hours a woman has ever run in

3811
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:13,044
24 hours.

3812
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,393
She's a freak.

3813
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,420
And again,

3814
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:16,430
candy drink,

3815
01:20:16,431 --> 01:20:17,264
a beer.

3816
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,413
Nachos.

3817
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:20,981
I think watching this people,

3818
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:22,620
I run marathons like it's crazy.

3819
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,720
Remember one year I have my one coach,

3820
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:28,380
he did like security detail for
like the Cleveland Refco Marathon.

3821
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,370
So I'm like,

3822
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,881
I sat there,

3823
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:31,030
it was a worst day of my life though.

3824
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:34,710
I literally sat by ended than driving
five miles power behind people running,

3825
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,360
so they like fell off.

3826
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:37,120
I'd pick him up,

3827
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,070
take him to the finish line,

3828
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:40,170
but it was just crazy why she'd be like,

3829
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:41,000
there was so like,

3830
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,900
like nuts.

3831
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:42,734
I'm another one guy,

3832
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:44,850
we stopped the checkout him.

3833
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,350
He's like saying like,

3834
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,230
ah right,

3835
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,103
you're right again.

3836
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:48,431
And,

3837
01:20:48,431 --> 01:20:49,290
and stuff like that.

3838
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:49,951
He's like,

3839
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:50,041
yeah,

3840
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:50,874
I'll be fine.

3841
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,020
He put IBM,

3842
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,280
he went to go finish the race,

3843
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:53,430
right.

3844
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:54,510
And this guy is like dead on west,

3845
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:55,470
gets ivy,

3846
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,491
comes back to life.

3847
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:56,731
He's like,

3848
01:20:56,731 --> 01:21:00,120
I got this cozy get started running again
and I'll never forget we're brought to

3849
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:00,541
be done.

3850
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:01,470
And I see the guy running,

3851
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,470
he's about a hundred yards away and
he starts like tripping and falling.

3852
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,610
He couldn't finish the race.

3853
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,151
Wow.

3854
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:07,260
Hundred yards away.

3855
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,370
And he's like lily a hundred yards away.

3856
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:08,801
He couldn't have,

3857
01:21:08,801 --> 01:21:09,461
he couldn't finish it,

3858
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:09,960
but I was like,

3859
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,300
oh,

3860
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,133
I felt so bad.

3861
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:12,691
He was like,

3862
01:21:12,691 --> 01:21:14,460
lily about the thought
pass out of the first time.

3863
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:15,520
They put an Ivy felt great.

3864
01:21:15,521 --> 01:21:15,750
He's like,

3865
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm good.

3866
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,033
Leave me alone.

3867
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,061
Took off again.

3868
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:19,530
And then it's an endurance.

3869
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:21,520
Racing is a totally
different kind of thing.

3870
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:23,070
As far as like the mindset,

3871
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,700
like if you think about a
five round heavyweight title,

3872
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,410
fight is a grueling affair,

3873
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:28,830
right?

3874
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:33,420
It's 25 minutes of throwing bones
at the best fighters in the world,

3875
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,520
but it's still 25 minutes.

3876
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,900
These mother fuckers like this,

3877
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:38,040
Courtney do alter chick.

3878
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:39,420
She's running for three days.

3879
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,283
It's crazy.

3880
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,740
What does it as a Dallas Marathon,

3881
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:42,940
this was the lady that was winning.

3882
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,350
She uh,

3883
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,420
got to the end and she
just collapsed in this,

3884
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,380
this girl helped her.

3885
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:48,460
She's like a high schooler.

3886
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,550
She was running one of the shorter
races and just saw her and just like,

3887
01:21:51,551 --> 01:21:52,870
I was compelled to help her.

3888
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,920
Wow.

3889
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:54,820
Do you still won the race?

3890
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,421
She's,

3891
01:21:55,421 --> 01:21:55,810
yes,

3892
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,260
she was.

3893
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,870
I guess the lady said she was afraid she
was going to get disqualified because

3894
01:21:58,871 --> 01:21:59,591
someone was helping her,

3895
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:00,340
but they still,

3896
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:01,110
she still won.

3897
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,260
Oh,

3898
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,540
it is.

3899
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,970
We get at check some of that
money so someone's helping her.

3900
01:22:03,971 --> 01:22:04,960
That seems weird.

3901
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,290
Sort of helping or you can
kind of tell she doesn't really

3902
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:08,490
picking her up though.

3903
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,950
She's picking her up every time she falls.

3904
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,990
I feel like that's cheating.

3905
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,190
They might've had some rules.

3906
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:14,910
I don't listen.

3907
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:15,210
Hey.

3908
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,043
Hey,

3909
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:16,751
what about the rules?

3910
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:18,360
And people will tell that
bitch she get back or metal.

3911
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:18,900
No,

3912
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,450
just kidding.

3913
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:20,021
Just kidding.

3914
01:22:20,021 --> 01:22:20,854
Just kidding.

3915
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,990
Who himself was legal?

3916
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,400
They said in fights.

3917
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,420
Now if you pooped yourself,

3918
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:28,254
they stopped the fight.

3919
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,120
A lot of guys up shit themselves.

3920
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,650
A lot of guys famously.

3921
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,030
Yeah,

3922
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,540
I mean,

3923
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,490
let the rest of the gang card.

3924
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,490
One time that shows pants.

3925
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,200
I remember Michael [inaudible],

3926
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,130
who was he fighting?

3927
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,890
A Bonil Dariusz and right.

3928
01:22:40,891 --> 01:22:42,520
We're right before the fight started.

3929
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:43,470
He leans over to the cage.

3930
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:43,681
He goes,

3931
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:44,370
dude,

3932
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:44,791
he goes,

3933
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,890
I might shit myself during the fight.

3934
01:22:46,891 --> 01:22:47,170
I go,

3935
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,003
you serious?

3936
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:48,631
And he's like,

3937
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,190
I got shit so bad.

3938
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,833
Are you serious?

3939
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,170
And he wound up choking out there.

3940
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:54,420
You should thank God.

3941
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:55,590
And we were talking about it afterwards.

3942
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:55,801
He goes,

3943
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:56,130
Bro,

3944
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,671
he goes something.

3945
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:57,570
What happened during the fight?

3946
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:57,961
It went away,

3947
01:22:57,961 --> 01:22:59,850
but I was convinced I
was going to shit myself.

3948
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,541
He goes,

3949
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:01,590
I just got out there and I was like,

3950
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,550
oh no,

3951
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,800
that's the worst feeling I have
the table feeling that'd be like,

3952
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:06,040
or I'll ski like from my

3953
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,521
hotel room.

3954
01:23:06,521 --> 01:23:07,241
They're coming to get me.

3955
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:07,631
And I'm like,

3956
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:08,060
you know what I mean,

3957
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:08,890
just shit.

3958
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,720
Make sure thank God I Shit.

3959
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:14,750
Cause wherever came out of me like
it was like just discussing diarrhea.

3960
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:14,880
I'm,

3961
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,140
I said,

3962
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:15,790
all right,

3963
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,070
I'll get down on my
imagine we'll fill that in.

3964
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:18,760
Oh yeah.

3965
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,120
I didn't feel like I
had to go by the yellow.

3966
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,250
Just checked me on the safe side.

3967
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:22,084
No Man,

3968
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,140
thank God I fucking,

3969
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,440
that was a big win for you to,

3970
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:25,710
we just started it all.

3971
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:26,171
Yeah,

3972
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:28,900
it was a big one cause
it was like a definitive,

3973
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:32,380
it was like you were marching towards
a title and then when you blast it or

3974
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:33,250
Lawsky out there's like,

3975
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:33,910
all right,

3976
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:36,580
this guy's the guy that
does the next Guy Mo.

3977
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,040
It took a little alarm map.

3978
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:38,500
Yeah.

3979
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:38,921
But I mean,

3980
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:39,521
you know what I'm saying?

3981
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:41,620
Like that was the definitive
like where you're like,

3982
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:42,730
I want my fucking shot.

3983
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:43,680
Like where's my fucking shit?

3984
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,240
Like right then and there,

3985
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,040
like that was sort of one of those
moments where like he got to give this guy

3986
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:48,590
the shot.

3987
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:48,990
Yeah.

3988
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:49,231
Yeah.

3989
01:23:49,231 --> 01:23:49,440
No,

3990
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,010
I appreciate it.

3991
01:23:50,010 --> 01:23:51,070
You helped me out with that too.

3992
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:51,993
I appreciate that.

3993
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,010
You know a big fan now.

3994
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:54,580
I appreciate it.

3995
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,660
In the title fight man.

3996
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:56,231
Holy Shit.

3997
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,250
That must've been amazing.

3998
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:02,430
Knocking out for doom in Brazil like
that with one punch and the Holy Shit.

3999
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:07,330
That was like one of the best title
fight winning performances ever.

4000
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:07,721
Yeah,

4001
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:08,554
it was a good night.

4002
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,230
Yeah.

4003
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:09,550
Yeah.

4004
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:10,570
I wish to work on that a lot.

4005
01:24:10,571 --> 01:24:13,510
Step over and Red Cross and the
guy chasing you down just dangling,

4006
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:13,771
you know.

4007
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:14,710
And you know,

4008
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:15,050
it's just,

4009
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:15,870
uh,

4010
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:16,660
it was just,

4011
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,321
what a great night.

4012
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:17,501
You know,

4013
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:18,334
I just,

4014
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,200
I wouldn't be there without
my coaches honestly.

4015
01:24:20,201 --> 01:24:21,220
They're just great people.

4016
01:24:21,221 --> 01:24:24,130
Of course there's just this one reason
there just cause they put so much time

4017
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:24,670
and effort into me.

4018
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,960
I got to say it over and over again.

4019
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:28,930
But they're just amazing guys and I'm
very lucky to have them in my corner.

4020
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:29,231
Well,

4021
01:24:29,231 --> 01:24:30,550
they're very lucky to have you to,

4022
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:30,821
you know,

4023
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:31,654
it takes both,

4024
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:32,111
you know,

4025
01:24:32,111 --> 01:24:33,210
and you're right.

4026
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:34,051
You know,

4027
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:35,920
you have a great relationship
with your coaches too,

4028
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:37,210
which is very important I think.

4029
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:37,841
Like,

4030
01:24:37,841 --> 01:24:39,910
like you were saying
about having a great wife,

4031
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:41,320
having great friends,

4032
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,210
having a great support system,

4033
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:43,961
like all that stuff.

4034
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:45,820
Like for your mind,

4035
01:24:45,821 --> 01:24:46,690
for your mindset,

4036
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,530
it's great.

4037
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:50,890
But having coaches that you have a
great relationship with that you really,

4038
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:51,551
you know,

4039
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:52,450
they're looking out for you,

4040
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:52,721
you know,

4041
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:54,790
they're working hard for you
guys are in there together.

4042
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,120
Yeah.

4043
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,310
Yeah.

4044
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,050
I mean,

4045
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,310
it's what I love about
my head coach Marcus.

4046
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:59,050
I looked at him like a long time ago.

4047
01:24:59,051 --> 01:24:59,351
I was like,

4048
01:24:59,351 --> 01:24:59,591
man,

4049
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:00,490
what is wage retired today?

4050
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:01,300
He's like,

4051
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,230
more time to drink wine,

4052
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:03,064
bro.

4053
01:25:04,150 --> 01:25:04,941
That's what I love about it.

4054
01:25:04,941 --> 01:25:05,260
Fine.

4055
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:05,690
Yeah.

4056
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:05,951
He's like,

4057
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:06,761
I don't care dude.

4058
01:25:06,761 --> 01:25:07,391
You can do what you want.

4059
01:25:07,391 --> 01:25:08,770
I just drove around and
see what he would say.

4060
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:08,950
You know?

4061
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:09,251
He was like,

4062
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:09,491
Bro,

4063
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:10,450
he's like whatever.

4064
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:10,841
He was like,

4065
01:25:10,841 --> 01:25:11,674
I listened to,

4066
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,640
I just mind you be happy.

4067
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:13,290
You know?

4068
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,980
That's the best kind of coach man.

4069
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:18,070
That's the best kind of coach that way
when you were talking in the worst is the

4070
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,660
kind of coach that wants to go to fight.

4071
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,010
When you really know it's over,

4072
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:21,630
you know,

4073
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:24,910
and the guy really should be
stepping away and then you see them,

4074
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,330
you know,

4075
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:27,560
trying to give the guy
the pep talk and you know,

4076
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,930
the best days are in the past.

4077
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,820
That's why mark is
actually real good at that.

4078
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:30,971
You know,

4079
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:32,620
we've got a couple of guys that were like,

4080
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:33,100
I want to get down.

4081
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,933
He's like,

4082
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:34,391
he's like,

4083
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:34,700
yeah,

4084
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,590
and you'd be in your corner.

4085
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:36,071
He's like,

4086
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:36,240
no,

4087
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:36,820
she retire.

4088
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:36,970
Yeah.

4089
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:37,803
I mean he was,

4090
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,970
he really killed them
inside to tell him that.

4091
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:40,241
But he's like,

4092
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:40,540
listen,

4093
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,373
you know,

4094
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:41,890
you know,

4095
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,371
you know what,

4096
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:44,130
this is an important point to talk,

4097
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,260
but you remember that feeling that
you felt like after this true fight,

4098
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:51,430
it's like you've got to kind of figure
that out on your own and come back on

4099
01:25:51,431 --> 01:25:52,264
your own.

4100
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,133
Right.

4101
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,580
And some guys,

4102
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:57,880
they have that feeling
and then they're never,

4103
01:25:57,881 --> 01:25:59,200
they're set those same again.

4104
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:04,230
They never reached those same like you
got better for sure you rose above that.

4105
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:10,030
But some people are dwarfed
by bad performances or a
bad knock out or whatever

4106
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:10,611
it is.

4107
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:11,444
And they just never,

4108
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,590
they never the same again.

4109
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:13,101
Yeah.

4110
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:13,761
I mean I just,

4111
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:14,360
I think it's,

4112
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:14,600
you know,

4113
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,350
there's two types.

4114
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,810
People are either going to be
going above and beyond it or not.

4115
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:18,141
I mean,

4116
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:18,974
that's just how it is.

4117
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,810
But there's also stages in your life too,

4118
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:21,081
right,

4119
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:22,520
where you just don't
want to do it anymore.

4120
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,100
Like you see some guys
who at one point in time,

4121
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:28,660
great driven fighters and then
the grind just gets to them.

4122
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,220
Yeah.

4123
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:29,430
Yeah.

4124
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,850
I mean,

4125
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:30,110
I,

4126
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,250
I told understanding like,

4127
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,050
I mean,

4128
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:33,130
I was just talking to her.

4129
01:26:33,131 --> 01:26:34,710
They're talking about this volante.

4130
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,220
Yeah.

4131
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:37,010
It seems less,

4132
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,650
I mean,

4133
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:40,340
I've had 11 UFC fights,

4134
01:26:40,341 --> 01:26:42,860
I think more than level of
Lowe's or been five rounder.

4135
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,830
I would train for five hours.

4136
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:44,750
That's insane.

4137
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:45,613
Yeah.

4138
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,603
My third,

4139
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:51,710
my fourth UFC fire was a five rounder.

4140
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:53,091
Did.

4141
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,530
Even if they didn't go five rounds,

4142
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:55,730
you're still doing training for fire.

4143
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:55,950
Yeah.

4144
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,560
You're doing a camp for five rounds.

4145
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,423
I mean,

4146
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:59,180
I mean,

4147
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,013
yeah.

4148
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,791
Ever since diff,

4149
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:04,910
a dune fight was so crazy because I almost
think you benefited from it being in

4150
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:09,290
Brazil because it seemed like
for doom was so emotional.

4151
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,420
It's so ramped up
because it was in Brazil.

4152
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:13,040
He's like chase and after you,

4153
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:13,881
which I was like,

4154
01:27:13,881 --> 01:27:14,900
this is crazy.

4155
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,170
Yeah.

4156
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:16,370
I think a little bit too is that,

4157
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:16,551
you know,

4158
01:27:16,551 --> 01:27:19,400
we knew exactly what was going to do and
she did and everything he wanted to do

4159
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:22,580
and I just wasn't falling for
anything you wanted for a flying knee.

4160
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:23,550
You went for a take down,

4161
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,130
you want it for a body kick.

4162
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:26,440
I just wasn't giving
me anything you wanted,

4163
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,751
you know,

4164
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:29,600
I don't think you realize
that it wasn't going anywhere.

4165
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,930
You also caught him before
that big punch to yeah,

4166
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,970
when we watched the fight we did a fight
can pan and we've watched the fight.

4167
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,620
You clipped him early and I was like,

4168
01:27:36,621 --> 01:27:37,410
he's hurt.

4169
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,800
You could tell there
was something going on.

4170
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:40,730
Like when he got hit,

4171
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:41,630
like,

4172
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:45,470
and then he tried to get it back and you
know when a guy gets hit and then just

4173
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:46,910
try extra hard to get it back.

4174
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:50,090
Like a lot of times they're exposed
and he just caught that right hand.

4175
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:50,670
Perfect.

4176
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:51,020
Yeah,

4177
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,853
yeah,

4178
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,210
yeah.

4179
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:53,330
I heard it wouldn't be here right now.

4180
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:54,770
What was that feeling like?

4181
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:55,604
Man?

4182
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:56,810
Awesome.

4183
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:57,320
Like,

4184
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,690
so when I hit him to any phone,

4185
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,060
I was like,

4186
01:27:59,060 --> 01:27:59,960
Oh shit.

4187
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:03,520
He fell because I was the last time
he's been knocked out like that.

4188
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,363
Right.

4189
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,870
He was out like junior was
the last real early on.

4190
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:08,210
I was like,

4191
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:08,930
he's on a tear.

4192
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,141
I'm like,

4193
01:28:09,141 --> 01:28:09,621
Holy Shit.

4194
01:28:09,621 --> 01:28:11,750
So I gave me a couple extra one.

4195
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:12,410
Right.

4196
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:12,741
And then,

4197
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:13,070
you know,

4198
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:13,903
um,

4199
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:15,230
I stopped the fight and I was,

4200
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:15,631
I looked at her,

4201
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:16,490
I saw my coach was like,

4202
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:17,410
Oh hell yeah.

4203
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:17,980
Yeah,

4204
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,471
run over.

4205
01:28:18,471 --> 01:28:19,150
And I was like,

4206
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:19,401
you know,

4207
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:20,360
like no one heard it before that.

4208
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,470
But before I said,

4209
01:28:21,471 --> 01:28:22,221
I'm a world champ,

4210
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:23,090
I looked at my coach and like,

4211
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:23,631
we did it.

4212
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:24,141
We did it,

4213
01:28:24,141 --> 01:28:24,341
you know,

4214
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:25,101
that's what I told him I was,

4215
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:25,934
we all did it,

4216
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:26,451
you know,

4217
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:26,671
that's,

4218
01:28:26,671 --> 01:28:29,870
I'm a world champ and that kind of like
Fred Tanke I blacked out and to remember

4219
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:30,810
what I said that to her,

4220
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:31,851
but I,

4221
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:32,091
you know,

4222
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:32,661
it was a,

4223
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:33,411
it was just,

4224
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:35,660
it was awkward too because
it was so quiet in there.

4225
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,010
Not here was myself screaming.

4226
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:37,490
Oh,

4227
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:38,323
it was amazing.

4228
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:39,291
It was amazing.

4229
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,590
We were clapping when,

4230
01:28:40,591 --> 01:28:41,240
when you were,

4231
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,640
when you hopped over the,

4232
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,570
the octagon and you're standing there,

4233
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:44,960
you're like,

4234
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,793
I'm a world champ,

4235
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:46,963
I'm the world champ.

4236
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,631
You're like,

4237
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:49,850
it was like setting in
like you could see it,

4238
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:50,571
those moments,

4239
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:50,900
man,

4240
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:54,830
those are some of my all time favorite
moments when a guy realizes is like the

4241
01:28:54,831 --> 01:28:56,360
biggest dream,

4242
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,170
the biggest accomplishment
of his career thus far,

4243
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:03,060
at least in to see a guy
like you win the title.

4244
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,893
It's just,

4245
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:05,370
there's nothing like that man.

4246
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:06,570
It's nothing like that.

4247
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:06,880
Yeah,

4248
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,800
it really is great.

4249
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,430
You know,

4250
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:11,520
you know it's 45,000 we
had about 15 people there,

4251
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,030
so 45,000 people rooting for,

4252
01:29:14,031 --> 01:29:14,800
for breezy overdue.

4253
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,040
My,

4254
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,570
she was 44,985 I 15 there for me.

4255
01:29:18,571 --> 01:29:19,980
So and then boom.

4256
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:20,521
Yeah,

4257
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,081
it was my,

4258
01:29:21,081 --> 01:29:21,680
my actually my,

4259
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,510
my brother and my cousins and now they're
all the top row with my buddies and

4260
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,170
they said when I knocked him out,

4261
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:26,880
they all go into,

4262
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,380
yeah,

4263
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:28,201
they're going crazy.

4264
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:29,034
And actually they're like,

4265
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:30,550
oh yeah,

4266
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:31,300
all right,

4267
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,180
I'll go down.

4268
01:29:32,181 --> 01:29:32,610
I'm like,

4269
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:33,443
what's up bro?

4270
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:35,070
What's up?

4271
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,880
They're like,

4272
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,481
we're sorry.

4273
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:36,810
They're like,

4274
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,351
it's okay.

4275
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:37,590
You know?

4276
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,341
Congratulations.

4277
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:39,091
They weren't really nice about,

4278
01:29:39,091 --> 01:29:39,241
you know,

4279
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:39,850
they were there.

4280
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:39,941
Oh,

4281
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:40,710
that's cool.

4282
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:43,110
It must have been silent in there
though when you dropped him.

4283
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:43,471
Oh,

4284
01:29:43,471 --> 01:29:44,210
it would deal with it.

4285
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:44,490
Honestly,

4286
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:45,270
it was so awkward.

4287
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,350
Like it was so awkward.

4288
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:46,861
Like you're just,

4289
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:48,570
cause I remember sharing
myself screaming like,

4290
01:29:48,571 --> 01:29:50,130
am I gay man?

4291
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,190
What was the crowd doing?

4292
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,060
Nothing.

4293
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,893
They're just quiet,

4294
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:56,251
quiet.

4295
01:29:56,251 --> 01:29:57,210
It was like,

4296
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,170
I am a hermit.

4297
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:58,261
He,

4298
01:29:58,261 --> 01:29:59,094
my wife's screaming.

4299
01:29:59,550 --> 01:29:59,971
I hear,

4300
01:29:59,971 --> 01:30:01,530
I heard her screaming
and that was about it.

4301
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:02,843
Wow.

4302
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:03,691
It was a,

4303
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:05,280
it was awkward and then clean.

4304
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:08,290
It was like a total one 80 you know,

4305
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,690
that was crazy too.

4306
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:10,860
I'm sure,

4307
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:11,680
you know,

4308
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:14,580
I'm gonna put on my ass and then getting
up and when the Zombie mode didn't care

4309
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:15,414
after that.

4310
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:16,763
Wow.

4311
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,330
It's a crazy time for you.

4312
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,673
You know,

4313
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:22,020
you're the UFC heavyweight
champion of the world.

4314
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:22,201
I mean,

4315
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:24,750
one day you're going to
look back and we talk.

4316
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:29,160
Any grandkids you could talking about
the time now and you're the fucking champ

4317
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:29,820
of the world.

4318
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,510
No,

4319
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,410
that was pretty intense.

4320
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:31,711
Yeah.

4321
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:32,221
I'm excited,

4322
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:32,370
man.

4323
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:32,890
You said something,

4324
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:33,723
you know,

4325
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:34,563
you know what,

4326
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,650
be proud of my wife,

4327
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,241
my wife,

4328
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:36,910
my mom,

4329
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:37,200
you know,

4330
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,591
he's like,

4331
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:37,771
Hey,

4332
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:37,981
you know,

4333
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:39,330
my son actually did
something with his life.

4334
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,700
You know what I'm excited about too,

4335
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:42,060
for the,

4336
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:42,391
for you,

4337
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:42,981
for this and gone,

4338
01:30:42,981 --> 01:30:43,420
oh fight.

4339
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,620
It's just going to be a lot of
people buying this on paper view.

4340
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:46,650
This is going to be a big fight,

4341
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:47,581
you know,

4342
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:48,990
and these big fights,

4343
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,920
this is what makes you know,

4344
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:52,020
a champion popular.

4345
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:52,231
I mean,

4346
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:53,064
this is really,

4347
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:53,850
this is,

4348
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:54,400
I mean,

4349
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,810
the historically inboxing,

4350
01:30:56,811 --> 01:30:59,370
they've always said that the
health of the heavyweight division,

4351
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:01,410
it just represents like boxing overall.

4352
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,870
I don't think that's the case
anymore because now I'm boxing.

4353
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:05,460
You got all these lightweight
guys like Gennady,

4354
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,440
Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez,

4355
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:08,640
a Loma Chanko,

4356
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:12,420
all these big stars now that are emerging
in a lighter weight divisions just

4357
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:14,190
because they're so skillful and talented.

4358
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:15,023
Andre Ward.

4359
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:18,300
But I think in the
heavyweight division that UFC,

4360
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:19,290
um,

4361
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:24,000
it's been a while since people like
really pumped up about a big heavyweight

4362
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:24,780
title fight.

4363
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:25,480
Yeah.

4364
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,120
Yeah.

4365
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:26,671
I'm excited,

4366
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:26,851
man.

4367
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:27,150
He listened.

4368
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:27,720
He's a good,

4369
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,320
tough dude,

4370
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:28,680
you know?

4371
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,250
I mean,

4372
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,150
you bring the pain,

4373
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:30,780
so why?

4374
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:30,991
But,

4375
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:31,290
uh,

4376
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:32,910
fortunately I'm not walking
out without that balance.

4377
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,170
I'm still the champ and we were,

4378
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:34,770
and still,

4379
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,390
when you see a guy like that,

4380
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,040
what preparations,

4381
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:38,610
like what,

4382
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:42,240
what do you think is different about him
than guys you fight before and what are

4383
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:43,140
you going to do different?

4384
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:43,471
Well,

4385
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:43,831
I mean there's,

4386
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:44,071
I mean,

4387
01:31:44,071 --> 01:31:44,881
every guy is different.

4388
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:45,060
I mean,

4389
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:45,980
every fight is different.

4390
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:46,161
You,

4391
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:46,571
you know,

4392
01:31:46,571 --> 01:31:46,770
like,

4393
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:46,971
yeah,

4394
01:31:46,971 --> 01:31:47,401
everyone's like,

4395
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:47,881
oh my God,

4396
01:31:47,881 --> 01:31:48,640
his punching power.

4397
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:48,840
I mean,

4398
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,111
listen,

4399
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:49,681
there's a lot of guys,

4400
01:31:49,681 --> 01:31:50,514
they had a hard,

4401
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:50,940
I mean,

4402
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:51,360
yeah,

4403
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:51,780
there's,

4404
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,490
there's no question and you guys hit hard.

4405
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:53,940
I mean,

4406
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,620
but I'm going to knock to be stupid.

4407
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:57,210
Put myself in a position
where I'm going to get hit.

4408
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:57,390
You know,

4409
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:00,180
I'm going to do things that
make him feel uncomfortable and

4410
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:00,941
won't do what I'm going to do.

4411
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:02,500
I'm not going to sit there
and let him do what he wants.

4412
01:32:02,501 --> 01:32:04,300
I'm going to dictate what I want.

4413
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:07,720
When you see the rest of
the heavyweight division,

4414
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:11,410
do you see any standouts or any guys
that are coming up that are exciting to

4415
01:32:11,411 --> 01:32:12,030
you?

4416
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:12,863
Wow.

4417
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:14,550
Honestly,

4418
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:15,010
I don't pay,

4419
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,843
you don't pay attention.

4420
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:16,930
That's,

4421
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:19,710
that's a fascinating thing
because some people deal,

4422
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:19,971
you know,

4423
01:32:19,971 --> 01:32:24,700
like I talked to Matt Hughes after and
Matt Hughes got beat by Bj Penn and this

4424
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:25,211
is what he said.

4425
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:27,010
It was really fascinating because he had,

4426
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:31,840
he's got so much courage that guy like
to say to say this in an interview as

4427
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:32,081
well.

4428
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:32,381
He's like,

4429
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:32,921
honestly,

4430
01:32:32,921 --> 01:32:33,760
it's a relief.

4431
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:34,721
And he's like,

4432
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:37,030
being the champ was like so much pressure.

4433
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,571
It was just,

4434
01:32:37,571 --> 01:32:38,980
it's overwhelming.

4435
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,300
So having this happen,

4436
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:40,721
honestly,

4437
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:42,790
right now I feel relieved and I was like,

4438
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,541
wow,

4439
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:44,380
that's crazy.

4440
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,020
Yeah.

4441
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:46,990
It's not like you gave up
and he fought his heart out,

4442
01:32:46,991 --> 01:32:49,000
but he got caught and got choked out.

4443
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:51,010
And then to go from that to say,

4444
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:51,281
you know,

4445
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:51,671
honestly,

4446
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:53,500
he's really then rebounds,

4447
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,390
then gets back on the horse and you know,

4448
01:32:55,391 --> 01:33:00,391
probably had to have that experience
just to have the perspective that more,

4449
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:02,980
I don't know if he ever had
the perspective that you have,

4450
01:33:02,981 --> 01:33:06,190
but your perspective is
different in that you like,

4451
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:08,380
you don't seem to be concerned.

4452
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:09,161
Well,

4453
01:33:09,161 --> 01:33:10,060
I mean I'm concerned.

4454
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:10,781
There's no question.

4455
01:33:10,781 --> 01:33:11,614
I think every Friday,

4456
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:11,950
you know,

4457
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:12,580
I'm nervous,

4458
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,120
I'm always never know what's gonna happen.

4459
01:33:15,121 --> 01:33:15,590
And that's what,

4460
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:15,790
you know,

4461
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,440
as real as the guest because you
never know what's going to happen.

4462
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:19,990
But you're not concerned at all
these guys nipping at your heels.

4463
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:21,280
All these guys coming up the ladder.

4464
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:22,260
It's part of the game.

4465
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:23,170
It's what I signed up for.

4466
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:24,363
Yeah.

4467
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:25,490
I,

4468
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:26,323
if I,

4469
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,550
if I didn't want to do it,

4470
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:28,211
I wouldn't do it.

4471
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:28,361
You know?

4472
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:28,980
I knew that,

4473
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:29,201
you know,

4474
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,190
one day I'll be the champion.

4475
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:31,720
I knew there were people
who come from my built.

4476
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:32,621
Yeah,

4477
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:33,131
I understand that.

4478
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:33,401
And you know,

4479
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:36,640
and you know there's a lot of
good guys out there that I mean,

4480
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:36,911
you know,

4481
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:37,210
like,

4482
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,043
you know,

4483
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,040
find Jvs fretting over
[inaudible] you know Nigga,

4484
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:41,410
I mean they,

4485
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,520
I mean they all want a piece of it,

4486
01:33:42,521 --> 01:33:42,631
you know,

4487
01:33:42,631 --> 01:33:45,430
I understand that no matter who it is
and it's not even you just meet it says

4488
01:33:45,431 --> 01:33:46,660
whoever it may when Kane was fighting,

4489
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:48,880
you don't want to overdo them.

4490
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:49,040
You know,

4491
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,140
every one of the pieces of the title.

4492
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:50,921
Well you know,

4493
01:33:50,921 --> 01:33:54,550
it's an interesting thing too because
what we're seeing today with MMA,

4494
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:59,320
we're seeing this combination like this
marriage of fighting with promotion.

4495
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,213
I can't do it.

4496
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:00,551
Yeah,

4497
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:01,390
you're not that guy.

4498
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,140
I hate it.

4499
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:02,470
But,

4500
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,790
but you not being,

4501
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:05,620
that guy is promotable.

4502
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,090
This is what it's like.

4503
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,373
It's almost like,

4504
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:08,980
no.

4505
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:09,611
First of all,

4506
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:14,110
I don't think the UFC has enough resources
to promote every fighter adequately.

4507
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:18,130
Cause I think UFC is a promotional entity,

4508
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:20,420
but it's also like this sanctioning body,

4509
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:20,591
you know,

4510
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:21,130
like the,

4511
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,000
not the sanctioning body,

4512
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:23,830
but they're the ones
who put on the fights.

4513
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:28,990
They're the ones who decide who fights
and you've got a 500 fighter roster.

4514
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,960
Whereas like in other
organizations you would have a,

4515
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:33,150
you know,

4516
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:36,550
you would have a bunch of different
venues and avenues for different fighters.

4517
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:40,000
Could go when a guy like you
is the heavyweight champion,

4518
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:44,170
blue collar guy works as a firefighter.

4519
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:44,800
You know,

4520
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,000
you've got a great story,

4521
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,260
you're a fun guy.

4522
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:52,370
Like does it frustrate you that
people expect you to talk shit and,

4523
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,121
and get,

4524
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:53,631
I mean you,

4525
01:34:53,631 --> 01:34:57,070
you've seen all these guys
that are getting a lot of
attention now for obviously

4526
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:58,040
Conners the master

4527
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,251
at it,

4528
01:34:58,251 --> 01:34:58,431
right?

4529
01:34:58,431 --> 01:34:58,970
Yeah.

4530
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:00,860
But you're seeing other guys that are,

4531
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:01,340
you know,

4532
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,660
trying that route,

4533
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:05,930
trying to say outrageous
shit to try to get attention,

4534
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:06,530
you know.

4535
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:06,801
Yeah.

4536
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:08,300
I'm not going to be a copy cat.

4537
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,010
Um,

4538
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:13,040
it's too exhausting for me to figure out
what I'm willing to say and like what I

4539
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,270
want to say and hurt someone's feelings.

4540
01:35:14,271 --> 01:35:14,751
I don't like,

4541
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,410
I don't care.

4542
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,720
And like I got more important
shit to worry about.

4543
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:17,890
Like,

4544
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,150
yeah,

4545
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:18,861
like my kitchen,

4546
01:35:18,861 --> 01:35:19,970
I had to figure out to fix that.

4547
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:20,121
Like,

4548
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:20,710
I don't,

4549
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:21,560
I need to worry about that.

4550
01:35:21,561 --> 01:35:24,530
And you knew at a new worry about like
what next I was in a fight was going to

4551
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:25,460
say what was going to say to my,

4552
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,210
like,

4553
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,040
I'm good man.

4554
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:28,100
I'm just gonna do my thing.

4555
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,000
I'm going to go on there.

4556
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:29,840
I'm going to beat your ass.

4557
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:30,660
I'm gonna walk out.

4558
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:31,493
I'm the champ.

4559
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,400
I'm torn because on one hand I'm like,

4560
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,740
I love a good shit talking session.

4561
01:35:36,741 --> 01:35:37,311
I like shit.

4562
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:38,071
Talking like this.

4563
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:39,320
And even at the fire station all day,

4564
01:35:39,321 --> 01:35:39,561
man,

4565
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:40,840
I thought I should talk to the bathroom,

4566
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,061
you know?

4567
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:41,331
But like,

4568
01:35:41,331 --> 01:35:43,340
I just don't want to go home away
and just put someone's feelings.

4569
01:35:43,341 --> 01:35:44,174
I don't even know.

4570
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,870
Yeah.

4571
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,100
But like Colby Covington,

4572
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:47,420
like he's making a name for himself,

4573
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:48,410
but he's making a name for himself,

4574
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:50,510
not just beating good
guys like Damien Maia,

4575
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,400
but talking mad shit.

4576
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:52,730
Yeah,

4577
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:54,370
like talking shit in Brazil.

4578
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:55,680
You see only for resale we're doing,

4579
01:35:55,681 --> 01:35:56,640
we hit him in the head with it

4580
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:59,840
because he had to go to court for that.

4581
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,440
I think that I go to corporate and I think
a couple of weeks he's got to fly all

4582
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:04,970
the way to Australia to
go to court for that.

4583
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,470
It's crazy to let it go.

4584
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:08,590
Fucking bowling.

4585
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:09,423
Right.

4586
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:11,930
It wasn't trying to hit him.

4587
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:12,920
I mean it wasn't trying to kill him.

4588
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:14,660
He just threw whatever
he had in his hands.

4589
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:15,290
I Dunno.

4590
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:16,123
It's pretty sweet though.

4591
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,090
Fine.

4592
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,850
Give him a little fun in Australia.

4593
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:19,630
Yeah,

4594
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,150
it's great.

4595
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:20,361
Yeah.

4596
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:21,830
It's like hitting someone
the head with a Koala bear.

4597
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,933
Right.

4598
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,070
A bottle of vegemite
or something like that.

4599
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:26,120
Oh God.

4600
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,841
It's all that stuff.

4601
01:36:26,841 --> 01:36:27,674
So salty.

4602
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:28,663
I like that stuff.

4603
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,151
Yeah,

4604
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:29,984
I do.

4605
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:30,861
I did one time,

4606
01:36:30,861 --> 01:36:32,450
it was so salty as good with butter,

4607
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,160
with butter on bread.

4608
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:34,970
Um,

4609
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:36,140
but the,

4610
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:36,920
the,

4611
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,581
that thing,

4612
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:42,050
like has there been any pressure on you
to try to talk some shit to try to like

4613
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:43,580
promote things more?

4614
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:44,390
No.

4615
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,580
I mean dude telling me like,

4616
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,820
you're your own promoter.

4617
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:48,170
I'm like,

4618
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:48,560
well,

4619
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:48,950
okay.

4620
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:49,783
That's what they say to you.

4621
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,220
Like how does the UFC say it?

4622
01:36:51,221 --> 01:36:51,380
Like,

4623
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:51,600
I mean,

4624
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:51,760
no,

4625
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,593
I mean it just,

4626
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:53,570
I dunno,

4627
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:56,510
like I don't really care what they think.

4628
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:56,611
Well,

4629
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:58,510
I'm going to do like promoting
like I promote myself.

4630
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,070
That's why you guys are
in a promoting company.

4631
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:01,851
That's what you're supposed to do.

4632
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:02,511
You guys do that,

4633
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:02,761
you know,

4634
01:37:02,761 --> 01:37:03,590
I just,

4635
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,800
you know,

4636
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,461
I think they'd rather,

4637
01:37:04,461 --> 01:37:05,294
you know,

4638
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,410
50 50 with it,

4639
01:37:06,411 --> 01:37:07,640
but I don't see it that way.

4640
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:08,421
Well,

4641
01:37:08,421 --> 01:37:11,840
I think they would rather someone
who's just promotes themselves.

4642
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,670
Like Conor McGregor is a preppy example,

4643
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,900
but he's a fucking Unicorn.

4644
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:18,140
Like every now and then one
guy comes along that has,

4645
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:18,591
first of all,

4646
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:18,681
yeah,

4647
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:20,060
it was it an entire country behind him.

4648
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,890
Like I'd never seen anything like that.

4649
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:23,570
Like Ireland is on a big country,

4650
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,910
but it seems like they're the
biggest country in the world.

4651
01:37:25,911 --> 01:37:28,250
When is fighting and
he's fighting in Vegas.

4652
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:30,680
It gets an American and there's
more Irish people in the audience.

4653
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:30,951
I mean,

4654
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:31,880
that's just bananas,

4655
01:37:31,881 --> 01:37:32,690
right?

4656
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,760
But when they got a guy like that,

4657
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:35,750
they kind of get spoiled.

4658
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,141
Like,

4659
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:36,351
Hey,

4660
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:36,491
what,

4661
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:37,760
this is the how you got to do it.

4662
01:37:37,761 --> 01:37:38,810
You gotta do like Connor does it.

4663
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,880
Well not everybody's Connor,

4664
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:41,960
you know,

4665
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:46,960
so like for a guy like you to see all
these guys getting a lot of attention and

4666
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:51,650
they're very good fighters as well until
Congress case great fighters as well.

4667
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:54,890
But the thing is the
shit talking like that.

4668
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,820
That's sort of what's
ramping everything up.

4669
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:59,010
That's what's getting all these
people to buy the paper view.

4670
01:37:59,160 --> 01:37:59,550
Right?

4671
01:37:59,550 --> 01:37:59,821
Yeah.

4672
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:01,230
I mean if someone came at me,

4673
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:01,690
you know,

4674
01:38:01,690 --> 01:38:02,820
you're forced to defend myself.

4675
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:03,654
I'm pretty ready.

4676
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,950
I mean I'm a fireman.

4677
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,620
I get shit talked to her day by you know,

4678
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:08,581
five or six guys.

4679
01:38:08,581 --> 01:38:09,700
So like I got,

4680
01:38:09,701 --> 01:38:10,081
like I said,

4681
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:11,190
like I just want to go home away and just,

4682
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:11,970
just,

4683
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,890
I have other stuff to worry about
like training wise and like,

4684
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:15,450
and what am I going to
tweet today when I went,

4685
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:18,270
when it was too much made jail sentence.

4686
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:18,870
Career.

4687
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:19,141
Yeah.

4688
01:38:19,141 --> 01:38:20,520
I mean I think than being a great fighter,

4689
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:25,080
but I did chills like career really
took off when he started talking shit.

4690
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:27,420
If people remember chill in
the early days of his career,

4691
01:38:27,421 --> 01:38:28,021
he was a gentleman.

4692
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:28,854
He never talked shit,

4693
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,960
but then somewhere along
the line he's like,

4694
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:32,340
Anderson Silva,

4695
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:37,490
you absolutely suck my belt and it's like
a WWE promotion and everybody's going

4696
01:38:39,151 --> 01:38:41,490
crazy and shale took it to a new level,

4697
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:45,030
like jail opened up the
door to a lot of shit.

4698
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:46,320
Talkers of the modern era.

4699
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,850
It really let them know like,

4700
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:48,121
look,

4701
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:50,300
the guy promoted the fuck out of here.

4702
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,950
Take classes or any of that.

4703
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,370
I'm not trying to be funny.

4704
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:53,511
Like,

4705
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:54,960
I mean he's just very smart.

4706
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:55,181
Yeah,

4707
01:38:55,181 --> 01:38:55,741
we talked to him.

4708
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:55,891
No.

4709
01:38:55,891 --> 01:38:56,041
Yeah,

4710
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:56,874
he's very intelligent,

4711
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,773
very smart.

4712
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,070
I did a couple of his radio shows.

4713
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,790
Exceptionally smart and very articulate,

4714
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:03,630
very.

4715
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:06,870
He's got a great vocabulary
and just knows right there.

4716
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:07,801
I have no vocabulary.

4717
01:39:07,801 --> 01:39:08,670
I'm at articulate.

4718
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:10,990
I'm the year you get just,

4719
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,800
I think I always said that
like people just need to,

4720
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:13,980
it's,

4721
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:16,470
it's almost like there's no way.

4722
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,800
I mean other than like maybe having
a podcast or something like that,

4723
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:20,191
there's no,

4724
01:39:20,191 --> 01:39:21,900
and I know that Tyron does that now.

4725
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:25,440
Tyron Woodley has his own podcast and I
think a couple of other guys may be as

4726
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:25,950
well,

4727
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:27,300
but it's hard.

4728
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:29,220
It's hard for people to get to know you.

4729
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,370
All they see is this stoic fireman.

4730
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:32,850
He goes out there and fucks people up.

4731
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:33,893
You know they're not,

4732
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,860
which should be enough.

4733
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:35,760
Who doesn't want that?

4734
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,433
That's what I say.

4735
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:38,543
I should be enough.

4736
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,533
But it's like,

4737
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:40,620
it's hard.

4738
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,110
I think it's hard for the UFC to
figure out how to promote everybody.

4739
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:43,621
No.

4740
01:39:43,621 --> 01:39:43,741
Yeah,

4741
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:44,070
I understand.

4742
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:47,250
I mean there's fiber people
on the roster and all that,

4743
01:39:47,251 --> 01:39:48,031
so yeah,

4744
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:48,451
definitely.

4745
01:39:48,451 --> 01:39:49,284
Um,

4746
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:50,483
yeah,

4747
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:51,421
whatever it is,

4748
01:39:51,421 --> 01:39:54,220
what it is or we need to do while
he made everyone happy weight.

4749
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,650
I think the embeddeds
helped me out a little bit.

4750
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:56,670
Yes.

4751
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,161
I think better.

4752
01:39:57,161 --> 01:39:57,690
It's a great,

4753
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:58,250
I think those out.

4754
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:58,860
Yeah.

4755
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,790
They help you out a lot.

4756
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:00,061
Yeah.

4757
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:00,880
I get the chance to see.

4758
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,410
We really,

4759
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:01,830
honestly,

4760
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:05,330
I was living in the comments is either
as I'm to lose or my wife's got a fat

4761
01:40:05,331 --> 01:40:06,164
ass.

4762
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,333
Both might be true,

4763
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,340
but there's nothing wrong with the,

4764
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,020
you know,

4765
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,411
first of all,

4766
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:14,490
I can't read the comments.

4767
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:15,180
I love it.

4768
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:15,780
I laugh,

4769
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,613
I laugh.

4770
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:17,520
Sorry.

4771
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,330
Back in the day.

4772
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:20,490
Back in the day when I lost
the street right there,

4773
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:21,121
like I was like,

4774
01:40:21,121 --> 01:40:23,550
people would write me like not want
to tell how bad a person I was.

4775
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:24,440
I should kill myself.

4776
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,600
That was the worst fighter
America and I was in the world.

4777
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:26,850
I'm like,

4778
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:27,683
oh my God.

4779
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,833
Well God,

4780
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:29,461
and the wife's like,

4781
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:30,121
stop reading it.

4782
01:40:30,121 --> 01:40:32,370
So I deleted my Facebook account,

4783
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:32,941
my personal,

4784
01:40:32,941 --> 01:40:33,131
yeah,

4785
01:40:33,131 --> 01:40:33,811
I deleted it.

4786
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:34,130
I want it.

4787
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:34,910
And then,

4788
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,390
then I came my epiphany.

4789
01:40:36,391 --> 01:40:36,631
I said,

4790
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:37,141
I'm screwed.

4791
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:37,800
I don't care anymore.

4792
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,950
It's now if you're watching
me Instagram once in a while,

4793
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,000
the tag the tag or something,

4794
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:42,834
they'll be like,

4795
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:43,850
well job Joe,

4796
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:44,580
it's over your skin.

4797
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,413
You know?

4798
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:46,800
Say say something stupid.

4799
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:47,510
Like he was like,

4800
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:48,450
you're a paper champion.

4801
01:40:48,451 --> 01:40:48,820
I was like,

4802
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:49,111
he's like,

4803
01:40:49,111 --> 01:40:49,711
he's a fake.

4804
01:40:49,711 --> 01:40:50,521
It's a paper champion.

4805
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:50,731
I'm like,

4806
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:51,061
I know.

4807
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,740
Do totally fake and paper champion.

4808
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,750
Do Zass beat you?

4809
01:40:54,820 --> 01:40:55,031
I mean,

4810
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:55,870
that's what I'll put out.

4811
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,480
It's me.

4812
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:56,910
It's not about me.

4813
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:57,743
And he's the guy guys like,

4814
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:58,960
and then we'll put a word.

4815
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,141
I'm like,

4816
01:40:59,141 --> 01:40:59,591
what the fuck,

4817
01:40:59,591 --> 01:40:59,821
man?

4818
01:40:59,821 --> 01:41:01,010
I come back with me something man,

4819
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:01,270
like,

4820
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:01,890
you know,

4821
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:02,520
like,

4822
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:02,660
like,

4823
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:02,860
Nah,

4824
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,610
don't guys laughing.

4825
01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:04,900
I just think it's funny and shit.

4826
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,050
But isn't it kind of a waste of
energy to engage those people?

4827
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:08,920
You actually enjoy it.

4828
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:09,813
I actually enjoy it.

4829
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,850
I have the people usually hit me
up on a message and then like,

4830
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,220
Bro,

4831
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:14,981
hugs love a champ.

4832
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:16,240
I just want him to get
a reaction out of me.

4833
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:16,541
I'm like,

4834
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:16,721
Oh,

4835
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:17,554
you're that guy,

4836
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,393
that guy.

4837
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:19,660
Those guys are the saddest.

4838
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:23,020
But it's also like after this true fight,

4839
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,250
you were at your lowest,

4840
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:26,500
so you're reading comments
when you actually lost.

4841
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,880
Now you're reading comments.

4842
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:29,620
When you're the heavyweight
champion of the world,

4843
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,460
it's like,

4844
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,510
what are you going to say bitch?

4845
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:32,510
It's true.

4846
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:32,890
The fuck.

4847
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:33,723
I say,

4848
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:35,263
kiss the rain.

4849
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,340
The worst thing you know they could
say is they can't say anything.

4850
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:40,211
You fucking,

4851
01:41:40,211 --> 01:41:40,870
you're the champ.

4852
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:41,240
Yeah,

4853
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,550
you're going to lose some day.

4854
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,140
That's the worst thing they could say.

4855
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:45,123
Yeah,

4856
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:46,061
most likely.

4857
01:41:46,061 --> 01:41:46,330
I mean,

4858
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:47,021
if you keep going,

4859
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:49,280
eventually can kick your ass.

4860
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:51,250
That's gonna suck everybody.

4861
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:52,120
If you keep going,

4862
01:41:52,121 --> 01:41:52,810
we'll lose.

4863
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:53,820
Including Mayweather,

4864
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:55,060
including everybody who's ever lived.

4865
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:57,340
If you keep going long enough,

4866
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:58,000
yeah,

4867
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,960
father time will kick.

4868
01:41:58,961 --> 01:42:01,210
Your ass will be there to help him out.

4869
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,270
I go more my three acres
once a week and I'm like,

4870
01:42:04,271 --> 01:42:04,720
I get down.

4871
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:05,170
I'm like,

4872
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:05,920
oh,

4873
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,580
how old are you?

4874
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,590
I'm 35 you're still all right.

4875
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,990
You still got a couple
of years ahead of us.

4876
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,331
They say,

4877
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:11,530
but you're later in life.

4878
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:13,120
Not when I cut the grass bra.

4879
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:13,841
I feel like I'm mad.

4880
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:14,674
In fact,

4881
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,850
I get down at my back is like tight
and sore and my God damn cutting grass.

4882
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,320
I got a big scag man.

4883
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:20,861
I fly around,

4884
01:42:20,861 --> 01:42:22,020
I get done and I wake up in the morning.

4885
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:22,690
I'm like,

4886
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:23,381
oh,

4887
01:42:23,381 --> 01:42:24,171
like everything hurts.

4888
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:24,371
I'm like,

4889
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:25,720
what's a big SCAG Scott?

4890
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,800
It's a 61 inch.

4891
01:42:26,801 --> 01:42:28,470
Like it's like a commercial lawnmower.

4892
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:29,180
Oh you got one of them.

4893
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:30,370
Babbel just seems like fun.

4894
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:31,263
Oh it's flies.

4895
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,051
But that,

4896
01:42:32,051 --> 01:42:32,890
that hurts your back.

4897
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:33,431
Yeah.

4898
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:34,500
Cause I'm always balancing like,

4899
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:34,790
oh,

4900
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:35,770
it's not perfect level.

4901
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:39,730
Sometimes the fucking daily
grind of MMA training,

4902
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:43,090
like what that's gotta be doing to your
body that like when you were talking

4903
01:42:43,091 --> 01:42:44,590
about how you barely get out of bed,

4904
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:47,890
like some days most people would think
like they see you fighting like this

4905
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:52,600
fucking guy just doing cartwheels all
around his house all day and it's so bad.

4906
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,150
Like I'll wake up in the
morning and the life like,

4907
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:55,950
Hey,

4908
01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:56,290
I'm like,

4909
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:56,680
Hey,

4910
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,520
show Kimmy coffee.

4911
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:58,354
I'm like,

4912
01:42:58,540 --> 01:42:59,880
she wants you to get her a coffee.

4913
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:00,521
It's right.

4914
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:01,354
It's right to do it.

4915
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,633
Jab,

4916
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,620
Jab.

4917
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:05,720
I guess I'm fourth in my coffee.

4918
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:08,181
I'm like for them,

4919
01:43:08,181 --> 01:43:08,651
my house man,

4920
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:09,101
it's like her,

4921
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:09,761
the dogs on me.

4922
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:11,140
Like I guess I'm there to pay the bills,

4923
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:11,490
man.

4924
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:13,330
I got to give me a sense for you though.

4925
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,500
I really do.

4926
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,740
I think that's healthy to have
somebody gotta answer to sometimes.

4927
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,640
I love it honestly.

4928
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:18,821
Like,

4929
01:43:18,821 --> 01:43:19,001
you know,

4930
01:43:19,001 --> 01:43:19,661
she takes care of me,

4931
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:19,841
man.

4932
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:21,840
She does a lot for me and so
it's at least I could do for,

4933
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:22,871
you know what I mean?

4934
01:43:22,871 --> 01:43:23,501
She's a good woman.

4935
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:23,890
She,

4936
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:24,723
she like,

4937
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:25,571
like I said,

4938
01:43:25,571 --> 01:43:27,340
we had that big storm.

4939
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,870
I had no idea what to do.

4940
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,880
She called insurance should
be screened with them,

4941
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:31,660
get more shit.

4942
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:32,050
We didn't,

4943
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:34,610
we knew that we needed and I wouldn't.

4944
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:34,901
I'm like,

4945
01:43:34,901 --> 01:43:35,141
Oh yeah,

4946
01:43:35,141 --> 01:43:35,591
that's fine.

4947
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:36,710
Who gave me like a check him,

4948
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:37,300
I'm fine with it.

4949
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,850
You should film like you getting
out of bed in the morning.

4950
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:43,600
Maybe we should do something like that
for like Instagram to look an Instagram

4951
01:43:43,601 --> 01:43:43,931
video.

4952
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:44,764
You here we go.

4953
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:49,840
I mean people just don't,

4954
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:53,750
they don't know because
we'll their singing is you
kaolin for breezy over doing,

4955
01:43:53,751 --> 01:43:55,310
knocking out junior dos Santos,

4956
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:56,360
raising your hands,

4957
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:56,961
you know,

4958
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:58,580
all of the glory moments.

4959
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:02,150
I think that's one of the things that
embedded does really well is they show

4960
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:02,271
like,

4961
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:02,511
hey,

4962
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:07,511
this is a fucking grind for weeks and
weeks and weeks and weeks until you get

4963
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:15,851
into a cage for a fist fight and this is
a fucking brutal way to get by in life.

4964
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:19,820
I could go 30 seconds or 25 minutes,

4965
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:23,330
which of course rather
go 30 seconds and when,

4966
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:24,560
but yeah,

4967
01:44:24,561 --> 01:44:26,780
maybe they should do something
like that for this fight.

4968
01:44:26,781 --> 01:44:29,600
Like really like follow
you from beginning to end.

4969
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:30,290
Like fuck.

4970
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:30,800
See,

4971
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,560
see what it's like when you're getting
up in the morning and then just put it

4972
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:35,120
together for something after the fight.

4973
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:35,631
Yeah.

4974
01:44:35,631 --> 01:44:36,050
You know?

4975
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,261
Yeah.

4976
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:37,970
I mean it sucks on some days man.

4977
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:38,151
You know,

4978
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:38,520
like,

4979
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:38,720
you know,

4980
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,340
some days I'm all right
by the days I'm like,

4981
01:44:40,341 --> 01:44:40,851
God damn.

4982
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:41,180
It said,

4983
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:41,901
I'm so sorry.

4984
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,051
Like,

4985
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:42,301
you know me,

4986
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:42,531
I'm like,

4987
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:42,771
man,

4988
01:44:42,771 --> 01:44:43,221
this sucks.

4989
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:43,951
I got to sleep wrong.

4990
01:44:43,951 --> 01:44:46,160
Like unfortunately we let
the dog sleep in bed with us,

4991
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:48,170
so I get like one eighth of the bed,

4992
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,280
a king size bed.

4993
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:50,413
So

4994
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:52,270
like a skydiver.

4995
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:53,133
Yeah.

4996
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:53,540
I'm like,

4997
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:53,890
I'm like,

4998
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:54,300
I'm like,

4999
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:55,820
I mean cousin covers please.

5000
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:56,031
You know,

5001
01:44:56,031 --> 01:44:56,310
like,

5002
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:56,700
yeah,

5003
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,100
the dog's a fart in your face.

5004
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:59,540
Last night was so bad,

5005
01:44:59,541 --> 01:44:59,840
man,

5006
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:00,650
Primo guy.

5007
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:02,330
That dude in high stage last night.

5008
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:02,691
Yeah.

5009
01:45:02,691 --> 01:45:03,231
I had her move.

5010
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:05,000
My dog was watching TV with me last night,

5011
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:09,830
farting up a storm to not cool.

5012
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:11,720
It's the worst.

5013
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,560
But when do you like have a,

5014
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,120
like how do you know when to call it?

5015
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:20,360
Like if you get up in the morning and
your white real fucking sore and you just

5016
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:20,660
can't,

5017
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,760
how do you know when like
maybe I should take today off?

5018
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,160
I usually know by that night.

5019
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:25,970
The night before.

5020
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:26,330
Yeah.

5021
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,210
I talked to my coaches,

5022
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:27,531
you know,

5023
01:45:27,531 --> 01:45:28,340
and you know,

5024
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:28,601
be like,

5025
01:45:28,601 --> 01:45:28,771
Hey,

5026
01:45:28,771 --> 01:45:29,471
I didn't feel,

5027
01:45:29,471 --> 01:45:32,900
and just on my sparring goes and stuff
like that are grappling wherever I do

5028
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:34,640
some type of my condition,

5029
01:45:34,641 --> 01:45:36,410
like my sparring session,

5030
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:39,180
if it's [inaudible] kickboxing
or boxing or digits,

5031
01:45:39,181 --> 01:45:40,014
whoever it is,

5032
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,210
it's just washing me and they're like,

5033
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:41,771
how are you feeling?

5034
01:45:41,771 --> 01:45:41,980
I'm like,

5035
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:42,920
I feel like shit.

5036
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:43,611
And then my guy,

5037
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:43,881
you know,

5038
01:45:43,881 --> 01:45:46,100
it's just take tomorrow off and yeah.

5039
01:45:46,101 --> 01:45:46,850
Or just know,

5040
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,620
take half a day and
then work out at night.

5041
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,270
And when you do take a day off,

5042
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:53,810
do you do like ice baths
or like how do you,

5043
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:54,380
uh,

5044
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:56,150
try to accelerate the recovery?

5045
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:57,381
Like ice bath,

5046
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:58,490
Epsom salt or something?

5047
01:45:58,491 --> 01:45:58,770
I just,

5048
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,410
I actually do know that I sleep all day.

5049
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:01,880
I literally just eat and sleep all day.

5050
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:02,871
Just sleep.

5051
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:03,800
Just catch up my rest.

5052
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:04,281
Yeah,

5053
01:46:04,281 --> 01:46:04,641
it's good.

5054
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:08,180
It's interesting though because there's
no real set thing where you can know

5055
01:46:08,181 --> 01:46:09,410
when to do it and when not to.

5056
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:10,670
He's got to do it all by feel.

5057
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:11,150
Yeah,

5058
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:11,391
I think,

5059
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:12,350
I think just knowing your body,

5060
01:46:12,351 --> 01:46:13,340
I think it's one thing I buy,

5061
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,700
I picked up while on since I've started
finding and just knowing my body,

5062
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:17,541
cause you know,

5063
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:18,374
I think God,

5064
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,250
you're the best critic on your body.

5065
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:22,490
Cause like back in the day
we was do cave and training,

5066
01:46:22,491 --> 01:46:23,410
you know like I feel fine,

5067
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:24,303
you know,

5068
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:25,880
but there's nothing too is like,

5069
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:29,090
we're so used to training a certain way
you can get through those workouts even

5070
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:29,960
if you're tired and sore.

5071
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:33,080
But I can go and pick up a bag
of groceries and blow up my back.

5072
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:33,650
Right,

5073
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:34,200
right.

5074
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,140
You pick up a baby or
put to put on my shit.

5075
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:36,741
Like I never have it.

5076
01:46:36,741 --> 01:46:37,230
But it just,

5077
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:38,870
you do random stuff that
you don't do every day.

5078
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:39,820
Like you know,

5079
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,360
you pick up a bag of groceries out your,

5080
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:42,050
oh my back.

5081
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:42,410
Oh,

5082
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,161
you're back was out.

5083
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:45,200
But then I can go and spar five,

5084
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:46,730
five minute rounds and I'm a by his dad.

5085
01:46:46,731 --> 01:46:47,181
But yeah,

5086
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:50,750
I can make it through just cause
I'm so used to my by which,

5087
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,241
yeah,

5088
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:52,080
that's the weirdest thing,

5089
01:46:52,081 --> 01:46:52,350
right.

5090
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:56,690
Was you do the most ridiculous hardcore
shit and then like you just go to tire

5091
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:59,160
shoes wrong and something tweaks.

5092
01:46:59,220 --> 01:46:59,790
Yeah.

5093
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:00,623
Like what is that?

5094
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,680
Like what's causing that?

5095
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:02,661
Ratchet actually has her,

5096
01:47:02,661 --> 01:47:05,460
my Overeem fight sitting there and uh,

5097
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,001
we're,

5098
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:07,850
we're both my buddy Ron,

5099
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:09,140
what his parents were hanging out with,

5100
01:47:09,170 --> 01:47:09,450
you know,

5101
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:10,890
a couple of cocktails all day drinking.

5102
01:47:11,410 --> 01:47:12,060
We're hanging out,

5103
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:16,410
drive around browns stadium on the water
and he has this little like four pound

5104
01:47:16,411 --> 01:47:16,950
dog.

5105
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:17,341
I was like,

5106
01:47:17,341 --> 01:47:17,521
oh,

5107
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:18,301
what's up little girl?

5108
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:18,960
How you doing?

5109
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,100
I go to pick her up and I'm like,

5110
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,950
and my back went out after the fight.

5111
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:23,261
Yeah.

5112
01:47:23,261 --> 01:47:24,094
Is after the fight,

5113
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,510
like a week later we declare how crazy.

5114
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,020
I was like,

5115
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:27,570
oh,

5116
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:28,770
but anything like go fully,

5117
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:30,790
fully like I felt to him like,

5118
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:31,500
okay,

5119
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,160
we're good.

5120
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:32,580
We're good.

5121
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,150
Wow.

5122
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:36,300
So then a couple of days later I do
anything for a couple of days of it.

5123
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:38,000
So I went to spar and hit a AA,

5124
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:38,310
my home,

5125
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:39,570
my pinched nerve in my back and went,

5126
01:47:39,571 --> 01:47:40,590
I was out for a whole week.

5127
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,761
That's crazy.

5128
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:43,020
From picking up a dog.

5129
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:43,943
Four pound dog.

5130
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:45,601
Fuck that man.

5131
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:46,051
It's like,

5132
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:46,781
what am I mean?

5133
01:47:46,781 --> 01:47:47,010
Yeah,

5134
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:47,371
I get,

5135
01:47:47,371 --> 01:47:51,750
I get punched in the face by massive
man and then doc fucks me up.

5136
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:57,450
I was a go into Vegas once for a
k one bout way back in the day.

5137
01:47:57,450 --> 01:47:59,040
There was so some k one fights in Vegas.

5138
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:03,570
We're going to go watch and I'm
in the shower on the way to like,

5139
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,860
like leave the house.

5140
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:05,703
I'm like taking a shower.

5141
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:06,570
Oh this is going to be fun.

5142
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:10,300
Can't wait to see his fights and
I just turn to grab this show,

5143
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,110
this soap and something popped in my neck.

5144
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:14,280
I was like fuck.

5145
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,510
Out of nowhere.

5146
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:18,690
So I drove to Vegas like
this the entire way,

5147
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:19,524
like four hours.

5148
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,990
And every time I had a turn
like to look behind me to park,

5149
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,160
I had to literally turned my whole
body like this from just turning to get

5150
01:48:26,161 --> 01:48:29,460
grabbed shampoo or something
like just turning ah,

5151
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:31,410
like no idea what it was.

5152
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,610
It doesn't make any sense.

5153
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:35,880
We just turned around and just every now
and then and it fucked me up for like

5154
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:37,050
two weeks for like two weeks.

5155
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:37,950
My neck was fucked.

5156
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:40,440
Dao Ji Ji still get adjusted.

5157
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:41,040
No,

5158
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:41,873
didn't get a job.

5159
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:42,690
That's true.

5160
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:45,570
Maybe I should if I was trying to make
sure that should go into wealth checking

5161
01:48:45,571 --> 01:48:46,404
doctor,

5162
01:48:46,410 --> 01:48:49,230
they kill the fucking duck
and waffle over my head.

5163
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,070
Some Buddhist Shit.

5164
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:52,501
Me,

5165
01:48:52,501 --> 01:48:53,334
look mate,

5166
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,470
I'm not saying they going to
a chiropractor is a bad thing.

5167
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:55,951
Some people,

5168
01:48:55,951 --> 01:48:56,641
I'm sure it works,

5169
01:48:56,641 --> 01:48:58,760
but you know the history of what,

5170
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,790
like how it got started.

5171
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:00,900
I know that a little wacky.

5172
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,950
Yeah,

5173
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:02,783
there's a,

5174
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:05,130
there's some pretty good
articles about how wacky it is.

5175
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:06,453
Let me look into it.

5176
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,600
But there's a lot of like,

5177
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:12,120
it's interesting because there's a lot
of methods of recovery that some people

5178
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:16,830
swear by like the cupping thing or like
electrical muscular stimulation or you

5179
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:18,660
ever see those Norma tec boots,

5180
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:21,570
they put those things on
your legs if your use those.

5181
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,733
No,

5182
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:24,381
no,

5183
01:49:24,381 --> 01:49:24,460
no,

5184
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:24,670
no.

5185
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:25,990
Oh those are a,

5186
01:49:25,991 --> 01:49:26,641
they're like a,

5187
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:27,230
it's like,

5188
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:28,710
like you're putting on pants,

5189
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:30,150
they go all the way up your legs.

5190
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:32,700
Circulation.

5191
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,061
Yeah.

5192
01:49:33,061 --> 01:49:33,894
They have like,

5193
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,180
they,

5194
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:35,910
they're supposed to be
really good for recovery.

5195
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,760
Like it's interesting how so many of
these things and it's like they're just

5196
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:41,910
trying things out and they're trying to
figure out like what works for you and

5197
01:49:41,911 --> 01:49:43,080
what doesn't work for you,

5198
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,160
you know?

5199
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:44,281
Yeah.

5200
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:45,120
When I had knee surgery,

5201
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:46,080
I bet it's awesome.

5202
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:48,610
Like contraption like around
your leg and she's like,

5203
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,331
how,

5204
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:50,950
like compress you want them.

5205
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:51,220
We don't want,

5206
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:51,450
you know,

5207
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:51,840
we're,

5208
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:52,230
you know,

5209
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:52,901
eventual get tight.

5210
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:55,270
So she gets a tight announced to the cold
water comes through and they get super

5211
01:49:55,271 --> 01:49:55,580
tiny,

5212
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:58,120
constricts it and push it all
the bad blood and you know,

5213
01:49:58,150 --> 01:49:58,321
it's,

5214
01:49:58,321 --> 01:49:58,571
it's,

5215
01:49:58,571 --> 01:49:59,051
it's awesome.

5216
01:49:59,051 --> 01:49:59,440
I love it.

5217
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,000
Would you have done with
the ne it's a scope.

5218
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:01,660
Yeah.

5219
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,090
Yeah.

5220
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:02,923
It's my fifth one.

5221
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,113
Fifth one.

5222
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:05,140
Holy Shit.

5223
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:06,850
On the same name.

5224
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:07,091
No,

5225
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:09,010
I had two of my writing through my left.

5226
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:11,253
Yeah.

5227
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:13,300
Talking a big guy and be
crippled when I get older.

5228
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:14,283
Do you run?

5229
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,131
I do.

5230
01:50:15,131 --> 01:50:16,450
I use the antigravity treadmill.

5231
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:18,460
What's an antigravity treadmill?

5232
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:20,320
So I put on these super tight,

5233
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,230
these super tight things
and I sit myself up and I,

5234
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,550
and he can go like half your body weight,

5235
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,730
6% of the body weight,

5236
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,060
whatever in the water.

5237
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:29,700
It's air and lifted me up.

5238
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:30,783
Watson.

5239
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:31,711
Really?

5240
01:50:31,711 --> 01:50:32,380
It's pretty bad.

5241
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,213
Yeah.

5242
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:33,850
Um,

5243
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,960
what's the benefit of that?

5244
01:50:35,170 --> 01:50:36,320
Just a sit on Paul.

5245
01:50:36,321 --> 01:50:37,700
My fees much that it right there.

5246
01:50:37,701 --> 01:50:37,900
Yeah,

5247
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:38,620
that's it.

5248
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:39,281
Whoa.

5249
01:50:39,281 --> 01:50:42,790
So it doesn't pound your feet like so
cause I'm 240 pounds so I'm going to kill

5250
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,940
my feet and my legs and my
knees so it lets me out.

5251
01:50:44,941 --> 01:50:45,820
It makes a little bit easier.

5252
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:46,660
But does it,

5253
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,800
it can't possibly be giving
you is hard to work out.

5254
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:49,211
Definitely.

5255
01:50:49,211 --> 01:50:50,800
I'm running a 9.5 miles per hour.

5256
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:51,881
Right.

5257
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:55,180
But you're running at 9.5 miles per
hour at less than your body weight.

5258
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:55,451
Yeah.

5259
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:56,284
I'm still running a,

5260
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:57,370
you know,

5261
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:02,370
2100 some pounds that a two 40 oh yeah.

5262
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:03,591
So what will happen,

5263
01:51:03,591 --> 01:51:03,851
by the way,

5264
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:07,550
I'm wearing 120 pounds and then it's 25%
of them are like 200 something pounds,

5265
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:08,270
whatever it is,

5266
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:08,890
it's still works.

5267
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:09,221
I still,

5268
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:09,821
I get a great sweat.

5269
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:10,620
I'm still breathing hard,

5270
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:10,960
you know what I mean?

5271
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:11,830
It's still pushing myself.

5272
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,380
Is that like one of your
main forms of cardio?

5273
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:15,011
Yeah,

5274
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:18,160
that and I do like a lot of pair work.

5275
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:19,330
You know what the sparring,

5276
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:20,470
it's like you don't what sparring.

5277
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:22,510
I do my rounds and I get done.

5278
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:26,230
I do either pair work for like 20 minutes
straight right after and then I do

5279
01:51:26,231 --> 01:51:27,640
some my sticks with my coach,

5280
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:27,960
you know,

5281
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,910
we're going to have moving,

5282
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:29,561
just keep my studio.

5283
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:30,430
The foam foam.

5284
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:31,030
Yeah.

5285
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:31,390
Boy,

5286
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:31,990
whatever they made,

5287
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:33,940
they made some weird contraption.

5288
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:35,203
Power would.

5289
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:39,280
Do you do any other machines
like a versa climber or any,

5290
01:51:39,281 --> 01:51:40,120
anything at swimming?

5291
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:40,870
Do you know any swimming?

5292
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:41,530
No.

5293
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:42,363
No,

5294
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:42,821
no.

5295
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:43,360
I do a lot.

5296
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,860
I'll wrestle or I'm sorry,

5297
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:46,860
I started to wrestle here soon.

5298
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:49,630
Know mostly a lot of
his old school training,

5299
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:51,760
which is probably the best way anyway.

5300
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:51,971
Yeah,

5301
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:52,391
I like it.

5302
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:54,250
I mean I run twice a week though,

5303
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:54,700
for sure.

5304
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:55,301
There's no question.

5305
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:58,950
I like running just cause like I run hard
on Mondays and then Fridays is more of

5306
01:51:58,960 --> 01:51:59,650
recovery run,

5307
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:00,390
but my body rest,

5308
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,601
you know,

5309
01:52:00,601 --> 01:52:01,610
you're doing it in this thing.

5310
01:52:01,611 --> 01:52:02,740
You're not running on the concrete.

5311
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:03,940
Yeah,

5312
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:04,751
I like running.

5313
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:05,321
I think it just,

5314
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:05,981
it feels so much better.

5315
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:07,930
My legs like I feel a
hundred times better.

5316
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:08,270
Oh,

5317
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:09,011
I couldn't imagine.

5318
01:52:09,011 --> 01:52:09,910
I mean especially when you're,

5319
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:10,571
you know,

5320
01:52:10,571 --> 01:52:14,410
you're dealing with 240 pounds pounding
on your knees and you've scoped out all

5321
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:15,310
the cartilage and shit.

5322
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:17,410
They're doing some stuff now though.

5323
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:20,080
You should look into like talk
to Dr. Davidson from the UFC.

5324
01:52:20,081 --> 01:52:20,570
Yeah.

5325
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:24,340
The shooting stem cells and to knees
and regenerating cartilage and meniscus

5326
01:52:24,341 --> 01:52:26,740
tissue and you're getting
into that for sure.

5327
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:29,140
I mean I definitely want to get knee
replacement with when I'm older.

5328
01:52:29,141 --> 01:52:31,810
So new replacement where
I don't want to have that.

5329
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:32,161
Oh No,

5330
01:52:32,161 --> 01:52:32,371
no,

5331
01:52:32,371 --> 01:52:32,930
I don't want that.

5332
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:33,210
Yeah,

5333
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:34,043
exactly.

5334
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,280
I don't think that you're going
to have to do that anymore.

5335
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:37,690
I think soft tissue stuff,

5336
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:38,950
they're going to be able to fix that.

5337
01:52:38,970 --> 01:52:39,160
Oh,

5338
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:39,670
thank God.

5339
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,180
Yeah.

5340
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:40,810
They're pretty,

5341
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:41,950
they're pretty damn close.

5342
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:42,310
There'll be,

5343
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:44,290
they're able to do some
pretty incredible shit now.

5344
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,500
And um,

5345
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,230
there's the interior

5346
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:47,063
teeth now.

5347
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:47,900
Really?

5348
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:48,141
Yeah.

5349
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:49,490
My wife just person harm.

5350
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:50,480
They grow your teeth.

5351
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,100
They can grow your tea like the PRP,

5352
01:52:52,110 --> 01:52:53,480
like it's something like that.

5353
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:54,310
Whoa.

5354
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,790
Hold on a sec.

5355
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:56,020
Really Jamie,

5356
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:56,870
we'll find it.

5357
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,370
They grow your teeth,

5358
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:04,780
put a little scaffolding or some kind and
then they use some injection to regrow

5359
01:53:05,151 --> 01:53:05,510
teeth.

5360
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:06,920
I don't know if it's in full use yet,

5361
01:53:06,921 --> 01:53:07,280
but like,

5362
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,540
it's definitely on the way.

5363
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:10,970
If it's not going to be able
to grow all kinds of shit,

5364
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:12,620
they're going to be
able to grow body parts,

5365
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:14,360
our great grandchildren,

5366
01:53:14,460 --> 01:53:16,640
they're going to cut their hands off
and grow new ones that they don't think

5367
01:53:16,641 --> 01:53:17,200
they look good.

5368
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:17,900
Yeah.

5369
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:18,950
Kids going to be like my hands,

5370
01:53:18,951 --> 01:53:19,671
like to ugly.

5371
01:53:19,671 --> 01:53:20,271
I wanted long,

5372
01:53:20,271 --> 01:53:21,104
slender finger.

5373
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:22,990
So I caught them off like that.

5374
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,940
That's the world we're
going to be living in.

5375
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:26,690
Yeah.

5376
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:28,130
It's going to be superficial.

5377
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:28,611
Well,

5378
01:53:28,611 --> 01:53:29,450
not just superficial,

5379
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:30,260
but bizarre.

5380
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,240
Like you're gonna be able to re,

5381
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:31,581
you know,

5382
01:53:31,581 --> 01:53:33,830
they've already regenerated a
bunch of different body parts.

5383
01:53:33,831 --> 01:53:38,120
Like this one woman had bladder cancer
and so they made her a new bladder with

5384
01:53:38,121 --> 01:53:38,960
her own skin.

5385
01:53:38,961 --> 01:53:43,961
They used her own skin and I'm used stem
cells and grew her bladder in a petri

5386
01:53:44,271 --> 01:53:46,850
dish and then put it back in her body.

5387
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:48,441
Great.

5388
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:49,640
Works Great.

5389
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:49,821
It is.

5390
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:50,930
I haven't talked to her about her pee.

5391
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:53,210
The promise of growing new teeth,

5392
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,980
dental stem cells could revolutionize
treatment for patients who face

5393
01:53:57,981 --> 01:53:58,880
extractions.

5394
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:00,253
Wow.

5395
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:01,580
Growing new teeth.

5396
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,740
Fuck what a weird world we're living in.

5397
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,633
Right.

5398
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:06,350
That's got to feel good for you though.

5399
01:54:06,351 --> 01:54:07,730
It'd be thinking about the future,

5400
01:54:07,731 --> 01:54:09,470
like all the stuff you're
doing yourself right now,

5401
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:12,020
all the injuries and getting banged up,

5402
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,420
squirt some stuff in
there and fix everything.

5403
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:15,283
I'm cool with that.

5404
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:16,723
I'm good with that.

5405
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:17,300
All right.

5406
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:17,600
Steepy.

5407
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:18,021
So,

5408
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:18,854
uh,

5409
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:20,570
January 20th,

5410
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:25,460
everybody should watch UFC heavyweight
championship live from Boston,

5411
01:54:25,461 --> 01:54:26,300
Massachusetts.

5412
01:54:26,301 --> 01:54:27,110
I'll be there.

5413
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:27,943
I can't wait.

5414
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:28,551
Good luck to you,

5415
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:29,240
brother.

5416
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:29,991
Thanks for doing the show,

5417
01:54:29,991 --> 01:54:30,824
man.

5418
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:31,960
John.

5419
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:32,120
Oh,

5420
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,480
for sure.

5421
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,313
Ladies and gentlemen,

5422
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:33,961
Steve Bay,

5423
01:54:33,961 --> 01:54:36,380
Meo chick heavyweight champ of the world.

5424
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,540
Let these bitches know.

5425
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,523
Well,

5426
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:40,820
Cleveland's in the house.

5427
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:41,090
Oh,

5428
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:41,410
H I.

5429
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:42,243
L

5430
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:47,400
I know.
