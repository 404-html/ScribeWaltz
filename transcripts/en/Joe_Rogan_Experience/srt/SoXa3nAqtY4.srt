1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,600
Man has to be careful about what size
accoutrement he carries around with him.

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:05,550
Right.
Know when you get into like the man bag

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:09,330
category it's like,
I don't know if you could pull that off

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,890
is a note too.
So he's big.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,140
He's held,
what we're talking about is Ian's um,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,030
phone cover here.
It's,

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,660
it's very personalized.
It's like a change purse.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,590
You put your cards and shit.
So it is a person

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,670
in a way it's like a wallet,
like a wallet phone.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,130
While it's a good word.
Isn't that funny?

11
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,450
Like there's words you're allowed to
use.

12
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,430
Like,
like you could walk around all day with

13
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,670
a backpack and no one says anything
like,

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,020
well Ian,
unless she's just keep it.

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,140
Should I do act.
But yeah,

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,250
no,
no problem with that.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,180
But if you have some sort of a Satchel,
yeah.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,170
You know,
very suspect,

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,040
very suspect.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,220
Open yourself up for a lot of verbal
attacks,

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,060
you know,
saying and it's like this style of

22
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:55,740
satchels important too because if you
got like a Satchel that's like in any

23
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,920
way stylish,
then you can't just be wearing like

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,900
converse all stars and a tee shirt.
You have to wear like hipster clothes,

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,960
you have to come like rolled up cuffs
and you have to have like a nice tie up

26
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,670
leather shoe.
You know,

27
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,780
like you have to go there having mcinnis
Gavin mcinnes you know,

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,420
you gotta you gotta figure out what,
what are you going to wear with it?

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,150
Yeah,
you gotta you gotta look the part.

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,380
So that's why I still take a lot of heat
for the fanny pack.

31
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,590
And I think it's funny cause I,
I,

32
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:24,930
you know,
where the thing all the time.

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,570
But yeah,
I feel uncomfortable when I wear it

34
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,540
sometimes.
Quite honestly like yeah,

35
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,630
wear it.
And I've realized people are looking at

36
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:33,810
it and they notice it and they're
mocking me.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't have the balls to wear a fanny
pack.

38
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:39,060
I got to tell you that right now.
I wear it on stage.

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,340
You wear it on stage award onstage a
bunch of times,

40
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,460
you're not going to pull anything out of
there because I don't want to leave my

41
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,090
wallet in the greenroom.
Shady people working on the comedy club.

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,590
I'd Robert him steal my wallet
and so that's how like much I'm into

43
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,740
like looking off looking like a man.
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,110
Like I'm like,
I can't do it.

45
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,850
You just call this a purse.
You may never see this again as I call

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,693
it a bit.
I might,

47
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,120
I might throw the phone away with it and
just get a new phone.

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,490
You have to have a cover though.
I found that out man.

49
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,780
I tried to go natural with my,
my last phone and uh,

50
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,040
man,
I dropped it a few times and it was

51
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,900
toast.
It's shattered.

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Jamie's going natural.
You don't drop it.

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,410
Pretty careful with in there,
but it's still good to go.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,390
You know what?
I don't think I dropped this one now

55
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:28,850
that I have a case.
That's what's funny.

56
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,671
The funny thing.
Yeah,

57
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,600
that happens.
Yeah.

58
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,110
Like you don't have a case like bad,
but I dropped back here.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
Yeah.
When you go,

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,150
I've been raw like no case.
Just raw,

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,890
no condom on the phone.
You have to be careful with that shit.

62
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,130
Feels good that way,
doesn't it?

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,590
That way I have the natural phone in
your hand with nothing on it.

64
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,910
It also feels like you're a risk taker.

65
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,930
I'm a mother fucker and he's got no
cooper.

66
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,470
My phone pitch right.
Doesn't it feel kind of more modern

67
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,880
times?
That is a risk.

68
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,050
That's 2016 it is a risk to not have a
case on your fucking phone.

69
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,960
That's crazy.
We're rebel were rebelling.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,550
Yeah.
This is the softest time to be alive.

71
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,360
It's so easy to be alive.
You know,

72
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,530
we're trying to eradicate all the
dangerous parts that are left.

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,100
Like there's the dead dangerous parts
are left like particularly in America.

74
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,790
There's so highlighted now.
It's one of the reasons why I think like

75
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,840
Chicago and Baltimore and Detroit and
when we find out like the murder

76
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,780
statistics for all these cities.
One of the things that freaks us out is

77
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,050
that for the most part,
most of this country is,

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,800
is easy going and soft as its ever been
ever.

79
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,060
So when you see some crazy violence like
in a youtube video or Worldstar hip hop

80
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,890
or something like that,
live leak.

81
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,050
I watch some live leak shit the other
day I got to stop doing that.

82
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,730
Man,
I got to stop traumatizing and they'll

83
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,180
get you.
But you realize like there are still

84
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:05,440
spots where it's dangerous as fuck,
but for the most part it's so soft.

85
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,310
Right now it's so soft.
Right now we're risk takers if we have

86
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,410
no phone cover,
that's us.

87
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,970
Yeah,
that's the new tattoo.

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,920
Yeah.
Like I have no phone cover.

89
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,230
Everybody's tattooed now.
To me that's weird.

90
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,180
I mean obviously I have them,
but I just,

91
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,180
it's odd for me to see how many more
people have tattoos today.

92
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,520
How long have you had your tactics?
Awhile.

93
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,260
While I had one on my shoulder forever,
I got one when I think I was like 23 or

94
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,220
four or something like that was
rebellious back then.

95
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,691
I was like,
Ooh,

96
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,300
I'm going crazy.
It was something I drew two and my

97
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,710
friend Tommy,
um,

98
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,560
my friend Tommy Jr had gone to this guy
already,

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,220
uh,
Danny Williams in Connecticut and he was

100
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,330
really good artists.

101
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,740
Man,
this guy was a really good ours,

102
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,580
big biker looking dude.
But uh,

103
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,290
it's just the trust that would your
tattoos back then it was a wicked

104
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,430
artists,
you know,

105
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:59,170
he was like,
it's like back then tattoos as an art

106
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:02,920
form was way more obscure.
Like now I think people know like Kat

107
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,130
von d,
they recognize these like celebrity

108
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,430
tattoo artists.
Like ed hardy came out with the line of

109
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,590
clothing.
Like ed hardy was like a world famous

110
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:12,790
tattoo guy.
Like way,

111
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,560
way back in the day.
Like his,

112
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,400
like there's a whole style of tattoos
that people associate with Ed Hardy,

113
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,600
but there was only a few other ones and
now it's like they have all these

114
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:26,860
magazines and TV shows and the guy that
did me,

115
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:31,810
Aaron Dellavedova is fucking awesome.
He's down in San Diego at Guru Tattoo

116
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,520
and it's,
you know,

117
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,110
he's like my,
he's a good friend.

118
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,170
Like,
I really love that store and it's like

119
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,050
he's a cool guy to talk to,
which is I think important.

120
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,120
If you want to have someone draw on you
for the rest of your life.

121
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,290
That's funny.
Like they have the like the hair dress

122
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,810
up barbershop.
It's style,

123
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,880
you know conversations when you're going
there to get the tats.

124
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,080
Yeah.
Well you do,

125
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,130
you get to learn about a guy,
you'll get to have like these deep

126
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,150
conversations.
Like Erin and I,

127
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:04,151
we talked for like 45 hours on my right
arm and like probably like 60 hours on

128
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,870
my left arm.
It's a lot of this talk as a lot of

129
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,780
talking and sometimes you don't really
talk though cause sometimes he's just

130
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:16,781
deep into it and I'm just like watch a
like like a watch I was watching.

131
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,760
That's my watch.
Like most of a breaking bad season one,

132
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,850
season two as well as shit.

133
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,890
That's funny.
That's like the perfect show to watch it

134
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,460
be getting a tattoo.
It's like that's good mood music.

135
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,740
You know what I'm saying?
Watching breaking bad and getting a

136
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,460
tattoo.
It's almost like the pain of the Tattoo

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,300
accentuates the show because the show is
so chaotic and fucked up.

138
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,040
It's almost like better while someone's
drilling on your elbow and the tattoo

139
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,440
needle.
You said elbow and needle.

140
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,040
I felt that he feel it.
Yeah.

141
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,370
That's a,
that's a rough spot.

142
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,580
The inside of the oboe wreck right here.
That's a really rough spot.

143
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,850
What's interesting is that the closer it
gets to your chest,

144
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,130
it's a really rough spot.
Like you're like woo.

145
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,760
Different spots of different level of
pain.

146
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,410
They experience trauma.
It's very strange.

147
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,570
Like your shoulder.
Nothing.

148
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,330
He could draw me all day on my shoulder.
I fall asleep.

149
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,220
Like I'm not kidding.
It's weird.

150
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,470
Like the shoulder just doesn't seem to
hurt.

151
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,340
But you get down to like some air.
The inside of the arm.

152
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,850
Yeah.
It's like a different feeling.

153
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,684
It's,
I don't know.

154
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,680
I guess the nerves are closer.
Like anywhere that's got more meat on it

155
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,690
is like protected more from the,
I don't know.

156
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,370
It's funny though cause it's like,
it's like you're finding out shit about

157
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,720
your body,
you know,

158
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,060
while you're getting tattooed,
you know it's like,

159
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,610
it's kind of like sometimes you are
having sex with a girl and I always

160
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,411
liked when she,
oh,

161
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:44,960
I never felt that before like that.
Nobody's ever touched that part or

162
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,370
explored that part and it's like you
find it anywhere you digging Ian and

163
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,570
everywhere.
Where am I not good?

164
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,980
If you love a you just,
you will try to find it.

165
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Of course when the girl says like that,
the good percentage of me always goes,

166
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,170
y'all right.

167
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,800
Ah Shit.
Fuck.

168
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,620
Every time,
every time in my life a girl said

169
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,840
something like that.
Always be like,

170
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,640
okay,
because it seems like something that

171
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,470
girls think that guys want to hear.
Dot.

172
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,060
Yeah.
It's a part of faking it.

173
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,770
Well it's a part of getting the guy to
like you like getting a girl to like,

174
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:31,520
you guys will do all kinds of ridiculous
artificial shit.

175
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,480
Pretend to be a certain way per hen.
Pretend to behave a certain way,

176
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,720
but when it gets down to it,
you know,

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,390
you get to know them.
It takes,

178
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,540
takes a long time to chip away from that
stuff.

179
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,120
So when someone says something that's
like Cliche,

180
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,550
ridiculous,
or along those lines,

181
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,960
he got to think like,
oh,

182
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,240
this person just running their game and
their game,

183
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,770
they're running their fall in love with
me.

184
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,070
Game.
They're falling in love with it.

185
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,230
You got it.
You got to challenge those women says to

186
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,050
the show that they respect you and you
keep it on that level,

187
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,510
you know,
or don't date.

188
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,550
Fakers yeah.
That's hard though.

189
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,230
That's hard though.
It's like my hot,

190
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,064
yeah.

191
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,580
What are you doing?
Checking tweets while the show was

192
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,450
trying to retweet the thing,
but I'm not getting any reception

193
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,284
reception.
Yeah.

194
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,780
I just want,
that's the only thing I want to do is

195
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:22,350
like retweet it,
but not my purse ain't allowing me to do

196
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,900
this.
Yeah.

197
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,070
You're in your rebel because you have an
android phone to both.

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,010
Both.
Fuck.

199
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,920
Is that the,
uh,

200
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,310
the note where you could draw on the
screen?

201
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,630
Yeah.
Those are the shit.

202
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,710
Yeah.
I love that shit.

203
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,190
I love it.
That's what I that no,

204
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,450
you had one though,
had one of those and then you switched

205
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,081
it back out.
Yeah.

206
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,620
Now I have a galaxy.
I have an iphone.

207
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,610
I have two different phones.
Oh,

208
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,130
that's good.
So you got to go to the mess.

209
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,910
That note that.
I just think that the ability to draw on

210
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:52,230
the show,
it was like God is going to come into

211
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,064
play someday.

212
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,750
I'm going to make some funny shit with
this.

213
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,940
And you're like,
have your friends and,

214
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,310
but it seems like those are meme
generators.

215
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,860
We just go and get like a little thing
and put the text into it.

216
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,160
That seems like that's easier.
It's easier.

217
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:08,010
But sometimes it's a pain in the ass
sometimes to move it to where you want

218
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:09,180
to move it to.
My Shit.

219
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,760
Like the reason,
one of the reasons I like having this is

220
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:14,340
like,
like there was like last year I wasn't,

221
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,710
I didn't,
I was living in a friend's,

222
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:20,750
I sold that placement of one last time
and I was living at a friend's house so

223
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,170
I didn't have no printer.
No,

224
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,453
no,
no,

225
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,230
no setup where you could like if you get
a contract for a show or just with

226
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,720
anything but so you could print it up
yourself with this.

227
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,700
You just look at the thing on your
phone.

228
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,640
You could sign it,
you could like read the contract and

229
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:40,590
then sign it and send it in via email
back without printing anything out or

230
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:42,380
anything.
So yeah,

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,470
that's a big thing to have in that case.
But how weird is that?

232
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:48,630
We're still signing things like how much
longer is that going to,

233
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,790
I mean,
think about it,

234
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,220
a unique movement with your hand.
Really.

235
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,140
Like,
we all know that I used to replicate all

236
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:01,110
the kiss signatures.
Every kid knows how to do that,

237
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,030
right?
Michael Jordan's autograph.

238
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,270
Oh sure.
Well probably a bunch of people who have

239
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,730
fake memorabilia,
right?

240
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,910
Like with a guy like Michael Jordan,
like a basketball signed by Michael

241
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,150
Jordan is worth how much more than a
regular basketball and a fake

242
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,400
basketball,
not cyber.

243
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,890
My coach is worth still a lot of money.
Yeah.

244
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,930
Well how about,
yeah,

245
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,850
it doesn't even have to be a real
basketball.

246
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,280
It would be a child's toy,
Michael Jordan signs.

247
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,870
It's worth a lot of money.
So it,

248
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,450
it only makes sense that a unique hand
movement,

249
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,840
it can be easily replicated.
It's not like what he could do on the

250
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,890
basketball court.
He could do with his handwriting.

251
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,310
Is that hilarious?
Nobody can fuck with his hand.

252
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:41,120
Right.
You can't nobody get malaria.

253
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,100
Fuck slams,
gunk from center court like he did.

254
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,151
You know,
nobody,

255
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:46,470
you can't do it.
I can't do it.

256
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,810
But the motherfucker rights just like,
right.

257
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,980
It doesn't have some crazy writing and
nobody

258
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,080
can replicate.
Yeah.

259
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,210
He just,
he just writes his name.

260
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,870
So all you have to do is look at that
thing and then recreate it.

261
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,940
Like I was watching this,
um,

262
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,710
a documentary on art forgery.
Fascinating shows,

263
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,400
fascinating shit.
Which one I wish I could remember,

264
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,310
um,
because I caught it on television and I

265
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,470
caught it when it was already started,
you know,

266
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,120
just flipping through the channels.
Like what is this?

267
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,540
And I don't remember,
but what I do remember was that,

268
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,550
um,
there was an article that I had read as

269
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:29,020
well about this one guy who was a
forgery guy,

270
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:33,640
but in a weird way when he would do is
he would make a fake version,

271
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,510
a new piece of art,
but from that artist's style,

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,720
and this guy apparently was making
fucking millions of dollars in Europe

273
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:43,481
with this.
Like,

274
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,960
people would go crazy after the war,
during the war or something like that.

275
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:48,520
I wish I remembered that.
Um,

276
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
do you know it is,
yeah.

277
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure this is it.

278
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,420
It's on,
I'm pretty sure it's on Netflix or it

279
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,171
was,
yes.

280
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:55,690
That's the guy truckee the artist
forgeries what it is.

281
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,441
Yes.
Okay.

282
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,630
There we really,
his story's really cool how he does it.

283
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,464
You can probably explain it.

284
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,211
Yeah.
Oh No.

285
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:05,211
It's incredible.
He would study the art of each guy or

286
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,100
woman or whoever he was trying to
replicate,

287
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,460
and then he would create a new fake
piece that they did that was so good

288
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,680
that experts couldn't understand it.
Experts were,

289
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,990
they were like,
this is,

290
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,580
this is a picasso.
Like I know because I've seen,

291
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,620
because I study because this is a
picasso.

292
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,010
That's how good he was.
And I think what fucked him up was he

293
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:34,011
got cocky and he used a color of paint
that wasn't available back then.

294
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,970
And it was almost like summit speculated
that he did it like you wanted to see if

295
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:42,450
he could get caught.
Like it's almost like he wanted to take

296
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:45,220
credit for his work.
Serial killer.

297
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,920
Yeah,
exactly.

298
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,570
You know,
um,

299
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,460
that was,
that was how it happened.

300
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,294
Right?

301
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,950
I'm pretty sure I,
cause I was really confused as I was

302
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:56,260
watching it because he and his wife both
got,

303
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,140
they were both arrested in both were
serving prison sentences,

304
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:02,110
but they were allowed out during the day
to go work to draw.

305
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,510
But it had to be separated for some and
some part.

306
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,120
But yeah,
I think he was working now selling art

307
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,090
of his own because he was so good and
people knew how good his forgeries,

308
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:13,330
where some people actually wanted those
forgeries because they were so good.

309
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,310
So now he's got to name them.

310
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,350
Okay.
And wait for somebody forges his shit.

311
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,600
Well he doesn't have a style.
He's like a hack exact community.

312
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,180
You know what I mean?
But obviously super talented.

313
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,480
What a bittersweet thing though,
because you got to think that a guy that

314
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:30,270
can be that talented,
that can replicate that,

315
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,770
that is art,
right?

316
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,910
Right.
Cause he's,

317
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
he's,
he's doing new pieces,

318
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,110
right.
New Pieces in their style.

319
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,910
[inaudible] which in a way is kind of
more honorable of form of forgery.

320
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,540
I mean if you're going to go down the
fucker food chain,

321
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,870
like to recreate a piece of art is
probably more honorable or to

322
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,110
create your own version of this person's
arts.

323
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,470
Parvin more honorable than like if you
had a painting and I had made an exact

324
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,304
duplicate of it.
Yeah.

325
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,690
Well when you first started the story,
I was like fuck rich people for being so

326
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:05,930
much into art.
They deserve to get screwed by this

327
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,760
dude.
Then when you said he's a hack,

328
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,810
then I related to it on a comedy level
and I was like fuck this guy.

329
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,540
Cause I feel the pain of following hacks
who are ripping,

330
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,100
you know what I'm saying?
Or or getting accolades and the

331
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:26,910
audiences don't know that they are hack.
Oh that's the sort of story I can relate

332
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:29,130
to it on on,
on different levels.

333
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,390
Isn't that terrible feeling when you
walk in a room and someone's killing

334
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:37,391
with some like really bullshit material.
Like you know for sure this is just chop

335
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,690
chop material.

336
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,700
Yeah.
It makes me more angry at the audience

337
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,830
then the person,
cause I've already been angry at this

338
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:44,240
person.
I've already seen him before and knowing

339
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,240
them before,
most likely.

340
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,410
But then I was like I have to try to do
my shit in front of this audience that

341
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,730
doesn't know that this is fake.
This is a fake y'all.

342
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,880
Yeah.
I watched somebody still on a Freddy,

343
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,090
so those bits,
the other guy,

344
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,090
oh shit.
And I had to leave the room.

345
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,250
Audience was laughing.
I don't leave the room.

346
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,100
I was like,
Oh God,

347
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,790
yeah,
I can't even see this.

348
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,140
Yeah.
You know,

349
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,020
especially a guy like Freddy who was
dead,

350
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,840
who was awesome,
one of the best guys ever.

351
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,100
Just such a sweetie.

352
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm trying,
I'm trying to get over stuff like that

353
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:16,480
though and not let it affect me.

354
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,360
Just get away from it.
You know,

355
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,100
we were talking about that last night.
Um,

356
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,570
Tony Hinchcliffe and I,
cause he was talking about,

357
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,010
um,
people that get to a certain point in

358
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:29,110
their career and then they want it
fucking things up.

359
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,640
And Tony's like super ambitious.
So Tony's,

360
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,680
um,
he's essentially making sure that none

361
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:39,080
of this stuff ever happens to him.
So he's like seeing things that people

362
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,350
are fucked up and,
and then,

363
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:43,240
you know,
dealing with people that hate on him

364
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,070
because he's ambitious because,
you know,

365
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:48,220
he's always getting after it,
but kids always writing,

366
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,710
always doing new stuff.
And some people,

367
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,820
they just get upset with them.
Like they think they feel like he is,

368
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:58,840
his ambition is threatening to their
examination of themselves.

369
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:01,000
Right.
You know,

370
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,770
and up,
we were having a conversation about it

371
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,700
last night and I was like,
don't dwell on it just right.

372
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,600
You know,
it's easier said than done,

373
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,880
but you see all these people out there
that are fuck it up.

374
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,510
Don't pay attention to them.
Just there's plenty of people around

375
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,640
like bird,
like you like Joey,

376
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:18,310
like Ari.
This is plenty of people that are out

377
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:19,760
there that are just killing it.
Right.

378
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,740
Pay attention to them.
This is the best time ever for this

379
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:24,910
shit.
You know,

380
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,670
like my new thing is,
you know,

381
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,150
and I've done it in spurts,
like just focus on the shit that I want,

382
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,220
not the stuff that can stop me from
getting what I want.

383
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,600
But I find like if you focus on the
stuff that you want or where you want to

384
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:43,370
get to and you have tunnel vision,
then you'll be fine and you'll get

385
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,700
there.
Like instead of creating all this

386
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,070
wasting time,
taking time away from your creativity,

387
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,750
thinking about what people are thinking
about you and all that stuff and just

388
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,970
focus on like,
I need to make this joke work,

389
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:58,110
this joke work.
I need to do this.

390
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,120
I need to do that.
Everything that gets you that step

391
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:00,990
further,
you know?

392
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,680
Well,
this is,

393
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,870
I think there's patterns of thought that
are really easy to fall into it.

394
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,200
Yeah,
they just seem natural and one of them

395
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,890
is when there is something that's in
your way and you're trying to figure out

396
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:14,040
why it's in your way,
you start concentrating on some of the

397
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,720
aspects of it that are out of your
control.

398
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,800
Right?
Like you know,

399
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:20,130
how come they don't like what I do,
but they like what she does or how come

400
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,320
you know this has happened and how the
fuck did this guy get this?

401
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Instead of try to figure out how to get
so tuned into what you're doing that you

402
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:32,030
don't concentrate on what they don't
want.

403
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,170
You just concentrate.
God,

404
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,790
come on.
How many times I cleaned my fucking

405
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,470
brother,
I got to stop drinking this butter

406
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,900
coffee fucks up.
Podcasts.

407
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,993
It does,
right?

408
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,370
I'm a little too,
a little too much,

409
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,430
but it's hard to say.
I mean it's easy to say.

410
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,970
It's hard to do.
It's hard to actually like get your mind

411
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,000
into a place where you're concentrating
on only what you're trying to do,

412
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,730
especially when the,
in the beginning of your career trying

413
00:18:56,731 --> 00:19:00,060
to get out there and getting booked and
nobody wants to book you write

414
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,050
some dude was bitching about that at the
comedy store the other night.

415
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,090
He was talking about how,
uh,

416
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,940
you know,
nobody's helping him out and all,

417
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,160
you know,
all these other people are doing well

418
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:11,994
and,
but you know,

419
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,470
it seems like it's bullshit and the
system is stacked against him.

420
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,590
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

421
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,660
like you're,
you're dead.

422
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,550
Well,
it's,

423
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,080
it's so foolish because nobody knows who
you are.

424
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,910
First of all,
if nobody knows who you are,

425
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,631
there's no,
there's,

426
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,700
I'm plotting against you,
but they don't know yet.

427
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,170
And this idea that this big grand
conspiracy,

428
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,500
just because it's about fear and ego,
both of those Keller,

429
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,370
but because these patterns and these
patterns that people go down to down

430
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,610
through there just,
they seem real normal.

431
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,100
It seems normal to concentrate on stupid
shit.

432
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:48,900
It's almost like it's a distraction from
concentrating on the really important

433
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,240
shit that's it's,
it's so comforting.

434
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm trying not to clear my throat them.
Fuck it.

435
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,260
Just do it man.
But it's,

436
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,490
it's so comforting to go down those
stupid patterns.

437
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,370
That's what happens when people,
that's how people get obsessed about

438
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:03,810
things.
They get obsessive,

439
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,490
they start freaking out.
It's like their pattern.

440
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,190
Creating your own distractions.
Like,

441
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,610
listen man,
nobody can work harder to stop you.

442
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,540
Then you want to work hard enough to
make it so just,

443
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,340
just work hard and you'll be,
you're good.

444
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,010
Nobody.
Nobody's like taking that much time out

445
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,320
of their life to stop you like that.
Yeah.

446
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,120
Most of it is in your head.
Yeah.

447
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:25,620
Most of it's in our head.
Most of it,

448
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,540
and especially comics,
well I guess everybody,

449
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:32,090
but like have had a good,
has a comic.

450
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,930
I've been in my head,
we all have,

451
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,290
everybody has,
you know frank and Steve and I were

452
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,390
talking about this last night at the
comedy store bar.

453
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,780
We're talking about the difference
between when you're learning how to do

454
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,000
stand up and you kind of like wonder if
this is going

455
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,200
to work again,
this idea like,

456
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,700
Oh God,
is this going to work?

457
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,100
Can I get this to work?
How do I get this to work?

458
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,690
Which is still kind of do as you get
like a better at it or more experienced.

459
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:03,370
But as you get older it's,
how do I convey why I think this is

460
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,204
funny,
right?

461
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,790
Yeah.
Before I had like no jokes.

462
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,110
Yeah.
Right.

463
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,340
But now I have like concepts of premises
that aren't funny and it's like,

464
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,080
how do I make this funny?
Yeah.

465
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,160
What do I think is funny about this?
Yeah.

466
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,790
Yeah.
How do we get started on this?

467
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,700
We're talking about something I was
going to diverge,

468
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,460
but I forgot what did,
what did we go from,

469
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,670
we went from,
we're going to show the Tom [inaudible]

470
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,870
thing.
We should probably just show that.

471
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:34,960
That's why I'm so distracted.
This Thomas,

472
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,880
he,
let me just explain it.

473
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,713
This,
we give it,

474
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,490
let me get a little,
uh,

475
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,050
ended up Tom Segura,
our pal is killing it.

476
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:46,660
And he's been on the road,
he's selling out theaters is killing it

477
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:49,120
all over the place.
And one of the things that he asked to

478
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,920
do unfortunately is sometimes he has to
do these morning shows.

479
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,120
So if he's trying to sell tickets and
let everybody know that he's in town,

480
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,330
he does morning radio and he'll do these
morning tv shows and when you talk about

481
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,870
like levels of lameness for like
entertainment,

482
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,690
like the morning shows are the most,
it's like,

483
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,350
it's like people think milk is spicy,
you know,

484
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,770
they're just like,
how can you drink a whole milk,

485
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,810
half done water my milk down and put
sugar in it.

486
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,960
It's like the last remnants of Grandma
TV.

487
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,940
It is.
Here are the weirdest shows.

488
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,640
They don't,
they don't bear any resemblance to

489
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,260
anybody that I know that it's that age.

490
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,720
When I see them talking to these young
people,

491
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,950
young,
handsome,

492
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,250
good looking people and you go,
who the fuck are they?

493
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,320
Whose talks like this?
What planet are they from?

494
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,790
Where,
where is this taking place?

495
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:44,020
You guys are at a time capsule too in
1950s it never really existed.

496
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,850
It's all that media depiction of the,
the Norman Rockwell days.

497
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,580
It's like,
it's like they colorize some old black

498
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,060
and white news footage.
Yeah.

499
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,580
You know,
they're brutal.

500
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,260
They're brutal.
The dew point being,

501
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,540
um,
a morning radio shows usually pretty

502
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,470
fun.
Yeah.

503
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,570
Most of those guys are just trying to
have a good time.

504
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,690
But so tom goes on these morning tv
shows and now he has a character and his

505
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:10,240
character as a rapper and uh,
he wears,

506
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:15,180
he's got a Chinchilla scarf on and giant
fat gold rope and he's wearing his

507
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:20,181
sunglasses with his cincinnati hat on
and he plays his character now and he

508
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:26,410
just says a bunch of crazy shit.
And to him,

509
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:30,890
so much more fun than actually like
trying to have a casal.

510
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,550
Tom,
where did y'all start comedy and when

511
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:38,551
did you know that you were going to be a
funny man instead of that he,

512
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,240
you know,
he does this

513
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,990
announcement,
the big announcement

514
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,080
wanting to make a is the last year,
you know,

515
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,350
uh,
I,

516
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,780
I came out as poly and by,
and now I'm proud to say that,

517
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,250
uh,
I'm non binary.

518
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Why is that interesting?
Is there any,

519
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,240
is there more to this because I'm
confused.

520
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,650
Oh yeah.
Like so most people right fall within

521
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:09,651
the male and female binary.
And then I'm nonbinary I don't fall into

522
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,700
either one.
You know,

523
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:16,701
so like I'm actually like fluid binaries
meaning that depending on the moment I

524
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:22,610
kind of go between different genders.
Interesting.

525
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:27,611
I like today I'm astral gender right now
I'm a gender from the outer space as to

526
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,070
host.
Could find a door yesterday.

527
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,560
Totally lost.
Listen a little,

528
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:38,561
whether you're talking giggled threw a
pretty big thing to come out as

529
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,020
nonbinary first we've encountered.
Really?

530
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,490
Yeah.
So that is a big announcement.

531
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,800
It's a big announce that on our show.

532
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,690
Yeah.
I'm happy to share it with everybody.

533
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:52,610
She actually,
they real like the,

534
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,100
with the chickens at least trying to get
over here.

535
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,630
They are going to be at the comedy zone
tonight.

536
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,770
So what can people expect from you all
on?

537
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,230
Uh,
well,

538
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,790
you know,
we're going to do our thing.

539
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,410
It's a,
it's a whole new hour.

540
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,650
It's,
it's different than mostly stories or

541
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,980
completely normal.
The last to Netflix specialist.

542
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,970
So it's a whole new hour.
And then,

543
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,170
um,
you know,

544
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,640
I'll,
I'll be going from,

545
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,110
from the stage,
like I said,

546
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:21,170
to spinning records at a local place
for,

547
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,520
for an after show,
maybe doing some recruiting here in the

548
00:25:24,521 --> 00:25:25,354
area too,
right?

549
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,020
Yeah.
I mean,

550
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,710
yeah.
Um,

551
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,111
you know,
I,

552
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,920
I might have time to swing by a
tallahassee,

553
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:32,860
maybe on Friday,
meet some players and try to sign

554
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:36,440
somebody else.
But you are a busy guy.

555
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,520
Triple threat,
but in different,

556
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,160
different careers.
I like that.

557
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,240
Come on,
you can catch Tom onstage all weekend at

558
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,100
the Kennedy's down.
Shut up the throat.

559
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:48,020
Zella okay.

560
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,280
Shown up the throat.
Oh,

561
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,330
Shit.
His throat.

562
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,850
Zillow,
zillow.

563
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,670
No,
no.

564
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,360
Tom Segura is obsessed with black
twitter and uh,

565
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,140
so as Jamie,
so jamie could call you in a better than

566
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,960
anybody,
but throat Zilla is apparently a

567
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:14,890
prostitute who's famous for oral skills.
And she was in,

568
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,250
and some sort of a paid sexual
experience with a football player who

569
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:23,670
turned out to be a cheapskate,
didn't want to pay up.

570
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,770
So she blew them up.
And then everybody got to know who

571
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:33,750
throwed zillow's Zillow as a fucking
hilarious instagram page.

572
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,640
Well we don't need to see what football
part is like.

573
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:41,160
Let let people do some googling.
Leave the man alone.

574
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,810
He liked getting his ass

575
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,410
wrong with that.
She's got a popular snapchat too,

576
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,320
but she's hilarious.
She's hilarious.

577
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,210
She's actually been a guest on your
mom's house.

578
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:53,360
Do you ever listen to your mom's house?
I've been on it.

579
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,850
You haven't listened?
Well you listened to the one that you

580
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,370
were on cause you were in it.
You were involved.

581
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,650
You had to be less than right.
So one,

582
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,170
me too.
I've listened to a couple of their clips

583
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,450
though online.
Their fucking shit is hilarious.

584
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,220
They're so funny.
Together they've been pumping up their

585
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,250
youtube channels so they got all their
new podcasts just like we've been doing.

586
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,550
And some clips up there too.
Still killing it out.

587
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,590
Tom Is killing it on the road too.
He's killing it.

588
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,140
It's so nice.
So nice to see a guy who was that

589
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,090
talented.
Just get recognized,

590
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,790
you know.
[inaudible] he's doing dope,

591
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,660
man.
I'm happy for him.

592
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,270
Yeah,
he's a funny fucking dude,

593
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,430
man.
I give him just watching night.

594
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,480
He's just having fun.
Like,

595
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,700
yeah,
you can make anything fun man.

596
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,860
Like you don't want to get up in the
morning to do that shit.

597
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,960
That shit is tiring and he's just,
I,

598
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,850
I'm going to figure out a way to do this
shit.

599
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,270
Yeah,
they're brutal.

600
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,270
Those,
those are the most brutal.

601
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,000
What's also brutal because you know that
you're going to have to like figure out

602
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,580
a way to be awake at eight o'clock for
the show.

603
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,710
Like you can't be sleepy,
you know?

604
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,390
So you know,
you only got like two or three hours

605
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,700
sleep before he got up for this thing
because most of the time,

606
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,970
most comics don't go to bed til like one
or two get up at six,

607
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,340
do this radio thing bleary-eyed and most
of the time it's socks and yeah.

608
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,390
And then you got to kind of be phony to
sometimes,

609
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:07,950
cause you're,
you're like with a bunch of phony

610
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,070
people.
So it's like this is a great way to not

611
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:13,830
be phony and make fun of this phony
situation.

612
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,150
Yeah.
But Tom is,

613
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,960
he's figured it out.
I never figured it out.

614
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,150
Right.
I would just go and do them.

615
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,330
Like that guy in the blue shirt full of
shit.

616
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,490
Yeah.
They suppose or at least the girl was

617
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,570
like,
I don't get it.

618
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,850
And she nervously said it but she said
it.

619
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,620
Yeah.
And then she takes another thing she

620
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:33,621
reacted to like the correct way but
still with a nice morning TV personality

621
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,170
person way.
But at least she was like more honest.

622
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,260
The guy was like,
well that's good to know them.

623
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,250
What the thing that he doesn't even
understand.

624
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,950
Well what he's doing is what they do.

625
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,390
It's that way of talking that you know
that there's a bunch of different fake

626
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,890
ways of talking to people.
Just slide right into like a strip club

627
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:58,470
Dj.
That's one right.

628
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,360
Top 40 Dj.
That's one coming up next.

629
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,570
All right.
And you know there's a,

630
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:06,870
there's a way of talking that is exactly
the same and they all,

631
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,720
they all replicated.
Those are two like real big ones.

632
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,980
Yeah.
Newspaper Voice.

633
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,590
Newsman voice.
So News.

634
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

635
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,430
There's a way of talking.
What makes people think,

636
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,300
and there's like subtle variations that
even like today's pros use,

637
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,640
there's a style of communication,
lets you know they mean business,

638
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,830
right?
This is very serious.

639
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,440
Very,
very serious.

640
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,180
Yeah.
So these morning guys,

641
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,190
they're like,
they have like Ryan to crest posters up

642
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:40,170
all over their house and he's the God.
He's the God of that style that Ryan

643
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,110
seacrest nailed it.
He nailed it.

644
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:44,050
It life.
All he did was [inaudible] name is

645
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,240
talent.
All he does is talk smooth and look

646
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,110
great.
Keeps his hair quaffed like literally

647
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,800
guys made hundreds of millions of
dollars by talking smooth and looking

648
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:56,440
great.
It's it just being that guy.

649
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,360
Alright,
way to go Janet.

650
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,830
Alright.
Likes everything next to good.

651
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,230
Yeah.
Next two collars.

652
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,660
It's all you have to do.
Just never get negative.

653
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,150
Let it all roll off your back.
When you go home,

654
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,590
you scream into a pillow case.

655
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,370
Ah,

656
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,570
what is this?
Who wants to dress like Ryan's?

657
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,750
He crest a lot of people in New York
magazine.

658
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:17,690
What are you showing me here?
But he's,

659
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,360
he's got a clover popular clothing line
and then of course it does quote.

660
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,990
Did you hear about what happened with
all senior and or Sinead O'connor?

661
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,190
No.
Somebody told me on the way up I saw

662
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:35,191
like a photo of him like on a newsfeed
what she's accusing him of given Prince

663
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,030
Percocet,
prince dying of an overdose.

664
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,470
Sinead O'connor is accusing Arsenio Hall
of doing that.

665
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,290
Why would she do that?
Is that true?

666
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,610
First of all,
just because you gave someone a fucking

667
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,040
Percocet,
like a lot of people take percosets and

668
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,320
there's nothing wrong with them.
They're going to be okay,

669
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,090
but she called the feds and said,
I'll call the feds and you better get

670
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:05,740
your house in order because they're
coming for you.

671
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,500
Like she's basically blaming him for
prince's death.

672
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,870
That's so crazy.
First of all,

673
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,960
he had an addiction to pain pills.
Hall has denied the heinous accusations

674
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,390
and lawsuit.
Despicable fabricated lies.

675
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,810
That's awful.
It's awful and a whole bunch of ways

676
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:25,930
like it's awful that prince was addicted
to pills.

677
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,280
Right.
I didn't expect that.

678
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,500
I guess he was addicted to pills because
of his hips.

679
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,220
Apparently his hips just fucked up from
all those years of spinning around and

680
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,490
throwing kicks and fucking doing this
hip throw away,

681
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,770
you know,
and he would do those shows.

682
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,720
Man,
he was super active and he was always

683
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:45,370
just dropping down and do whole splits.
Like that's probably not the best way to

684
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,680
treat your body.
Like a lot of that stuff was super

685
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,890
impressive because it was like real
explosive and now he had spin around

686
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,050
with his guitar and dropped down and do
the splits.

687
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,080
It's like wwe moves
and she has like those wrestlers and

688
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,380
shit.
They go hook too.

689
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,340
When I'm Dave Chappelle had that whole
bit about prince being a really good

690
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:06,280
basketball player with Charlie Murphy.
It makes sense.

691
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,770
Like of course he is looking at how fast
he is,

692
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,500
like how well he moves when he dances on
stage.

693
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:14,440
Yeah.
But I guess that Shit just played wreck

694
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:15,910
havoc on his legs.
Yeah,

695
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,210
that motherfucker was electric man.
Like I was like after he died I was

696
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:23,500
watching some concert footage and it's
like you makes you feel like you're

697
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,880
there.
He puts on a show man.

698
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,610
Yeah,
he was one of the greats have stopped

699
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,450
one of the all time greats.
I mean when it comes to music,

700
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,350
I mean we were talking about this a on a
recent podcast about a,

701
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,990
I want to be your lover and when that
song came out I was like,

702
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,040
well who is this guy?
It

703
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,460
just,
it just had this completely new sort of

704
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,461
feel to it where you were hoping like I
hope that this this key,

705
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,620
like I remember there's a bunch of
artists that when they came out like

706
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:56,090
Terence Trent Darby was one of them.
He was one of them where he came out and

707
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:59,810
his songs were so cool and I was like,
I hope this guy figures this out.

708
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,050
I hope this guy keeps going because some
of these guys,

709
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,540
they'll,
they'll come out with some really cool

710
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,590
songs and a really cool thing and then
it goes away,

711
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,710
which is crazy,
but he's talking about guns and roses

712
00:33:11,711 --> 00:33:14,260
last night because they were one of the
groups that,

713
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,750
all right,
this is going to be around for a long

714
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,920
time for sure.
They,

715
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,270
the next new rolling stones or whatever.
And it says like they just,

716
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,510
they just,
it's more,

717
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,800
it's more of a shock that they didn't
last and that then if they did right,

718
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,180
you know?
Yeah.

719
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,560
And terrorist training job,
he like,

720
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,850
yeah,
he was.

721
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,500
He's one of those short things back
then.

722
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:37,600
You're like,
some people you heard,

723
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,460
you're like,
there are a one hit wonder and like,

724
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:40,780
no,
this person is going to be,

725
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,363
yeah.

726
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,630
Sinead O'connor too.
She's one of them.

727
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
Yeah.
That bitch was so fucking in is so

728
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,590
fucking talented that you go,
well,

729
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:53,810
where's her body of work?
Why doesn't she have a hundred albums

730
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,550
out?
Why did she have a million hits?

731
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,810
She's so good when she's on,
you know,

732
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,710
like the early shit when she first came
out you like,

733
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,200
Whoa,
she's,

734
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,660
she's a storm.
Like an electric storm.

735
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,730
Like Jesus Christ,
she was good.

736
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,810
She might be like sensitive or something
happened to her probably getting turned

737
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,460
off from the business or something.
Well,

738
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,470
do you remember when she tore up that
picture of the pope?

739
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,930
Right.
That was a big problem.

740
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,200
I think she wasn't ready for that
negativity that came with that,

741
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,780
that opinion.
That was like 20 years ahead of time.

742
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,400
Yeah,
I know,

743
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,420
man.
She was right.

744
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,770
Isn't that crazy?
She was right.

745
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:32,300
Yeah.
If she did that shit today,

746
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,070
people would support her and cheer for
her.

747
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,830
She's a very brave person in that
regard.

748
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:37,820
Then if she did it today,
they'd be like,

749
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:38,910
she's a hack.
Yeah.

750
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,870
Then she did it too soon.
It's too original.

751
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,350
Too soon.
There was this kid a long time ago that

752
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:52,790
had an MTV music video and people were
saying that this kid is the future of

753
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:56,530
rock and roll.
He was like 19 years old on the um,

754
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,030
he had a song called beat,
so lonely,

755
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,990
fine,
fine.

756
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,370
Who fucking sings that?
But this dude was like a bad ass

757
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:07,370
guitarist and he was like 19 years old
and it was one of those things where

758
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,540
they were hyping them up.
Yeah.

759
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,080
Charlie sexton.
So if we play this,

760
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,490
it will probably get us kicked off
youtube.

761
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,060
Right.
Played for the audio for people who

762
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,290
this.
Anyway,

763
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,440
this guy was really young and he was
this good looking johnny like s like a

764
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Johnny Depp who does a lot of speed.
It was like this good looking young,

765
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,640
talented guitarist.
And what is it?

766
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,230
What year does it say down there,
Jeremy?

767
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,690
If you scroll down.
Yeah.

768
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:38,400
Okay.
So this is my senior year in high school

769
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,270
and this guy came out and there was this
crazy black and white music video.

770
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,160
This is the days of MTV,
you know,

771
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,420
so he's walking down this black and
whites treme and inbetween him walk over

772
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,290
this cool look and earrings and his
fucking fonzie leather jacket on.

773
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,940
You see the producer sliding up the
dials on the mixing board and all these

774
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,941
neon signs and you know,
it was so stylish and produced and so

775
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:11,361
obviously contrived,
but as a 15 what does I 17 I guess.

776
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,470
Yeah,
it's a 17 year old kid watching this.

777
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,030
I remember thinking,
Whoa,

778
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,670
like this guy is a,
it's not that much older than me.

779
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,400
And he's like smoking cigarettes,
hanging out with these rockers

780
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,280
with,
it's not playing in any of this song

781
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,810
yet.
It's just the,

782
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,460
but he like,
his singing is kind of interesting too,

783
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,020
but they put so much effort into this.
It was,

784
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,280
it was one of those things.
It was like,

785
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,500
well they're for sure going to force
feed us this guy

786
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,920
like
present rockstars and make videos like

787
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,450
this now.
Like oh shit.

788
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,240
Yeah,
that's true versions of this that aren't

789
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:57,830
as good.

790
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,340
This is a pretty good song.
People get mad at me right now.

791
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,770
No,
I'm telling you,

792
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:06,440
I've really liked this song,
especially when it came out when I was

793
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:10,400
17 and I thought this fucking guy was
going to be giant.

794
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:12,890
He had all the right pieces.
He didn't have tattoos back then cause

795
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:14,660
dude didn't have tattoos.
But if he,

796
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,880
if it was today,
he would have tattoos all over his hands

797
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:19,430
and shit.
He had some shit on written on his neck,

798
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,620
but he's got all the right bracelets,

799
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,200
his hair like his bracelet,
his hair looks perfect.

800
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,540
So there was,
I want him to listen to this show and

801
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,820
call it something.
Where is he now?

802
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,390
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe it's like a giant country star.

803
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,000
There's country stars that you don't
even know about that I'm like fucking

804
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:40,930
hundreds of millions of sales.
But I just saw that when you show the

805
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:42,460
image of me,
I realize how high I'm on.

806
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,020
Slow down,
bitch.

807
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,620
Shit,
I'm getting high.

808
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,440
You got to in this room we hotbox Ian
saying it's kind of adversity.

809
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,400
Anybody tells you you can't get hot box
is a fucking liar too,

810
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,320
by the way.
I can tell you that right now.

811
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,520
Somebody trying to tell me the other day
that hotboxing isn't real.

812
00:38:03,521 --> 00:38:05,140
I was like,
what are you talking about?

813
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:06,430
It's 100% real

814
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,960
breathing in weed.
In a room with his weed.

815
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,880
Smoking weed.
Yeah.

816
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,580
I mean it's not as effective as taking a
hit,

817
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,490
but it's pretty close.
Have you stand there long enough and

818
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,780
it's,
the room is like,

819
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,530
like if this is a lot of weed going
around and the room is small and it's

820
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,200
intense and it's in the air,
that's all you're going to breathe in

821
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:28,350
all your breathing.
It might be more than taking a few hits

822
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,390
if when out in the street with some
friends.

823
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:30,760
Did

824
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,860
I ever tell you about when I was a judge
for the cannabis club?

825
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,770
Cannabis Cup.
Cannabis Cup?

826
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,950
Yeah.
I judged the Cannabis Cup one year and

827
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:41,220
they would hand you,
you know how like um,

828
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,860
old people that I've liked hip injuries,
they carry around a lot of pills.

829
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,450
They'll have like a Monday,
Tuesday,

830
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:47,450
Wednesday,
Thursday,

831
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,450
Friday,
Saturday when I was little seven tray

832
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,030
things.
This is what they gave you and it was

833
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:56,800
filled with weed and they were handing
out pipes and lighters and edibles and

834
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,610
it was so ridiculous.
The idea that anybody got judged,

835
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,690
which is so ridiculous because it was me
and a bunch of other people who are

836
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,990
judges like people from the local
cannabis community and I think there was

837
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:12,991
some wrappers in there as well.
But by the time your on pot number two

838
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,250
like who knows what's happening.

839
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,290
Exactly.
How do you know if three is affecting

840
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:23,420
you?
It's affecting you or five or one is

841
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,770
don't,
you don't have any idea.

842
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:30,210
You have to do that.
Each one for a day you do one and then

843
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,190
you'd come back the next day,
do the other one.

844
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,380
And that still might not be enough time.

845
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,570
I think it's 100% right.
And then you also would have to deal

846
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:39,430
with the fact that if you did it on
Monday,

847
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,780
Tuesday,
well if you did it everyday like that,

848
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,550
your body would get accustomed to
getting high.

849
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,730
Yeah.
So you probably get less high as the

850
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,940
week goes on,
but some people say that they're like

851
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,200
different.
You get accustomed.

852
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:50,770
Different strength.
That's Joey Diaz though.

853
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,240
Joey Diaz.
Listen dog.

854
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:55,840
I smoked different shit every day.
I don't want these motherfuckers getting

855
00:39:55,841 --> 00:40:00,841
used to me like he used to meet,
he thinks you get used to certain kinds

856
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:03,760
of weeds and they don't fact they don't
affect you anymore.

857
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,580
So you got to try new shit.
He might,

858
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,590
he might be on to something though.
I think he's right.

859
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,220
Yeah,
I think he's right too in some sort of a

860
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:15,630
way.
For sure was like sativas versus in

861
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:17,410
because there's definitely a different
feeling.

862
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,900
Right?
So what were some of the strains here

863
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:21,190
you can get out of the story.
You've just,

864
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,230
you can try it.
Just smoke one for a week,

865
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,540
just get a different one.
You're like,

866
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:26,490
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

867
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,710
You can get cheaper weed instead of
smoking all the top shelf stuff.

868
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,670
What's,
what's fucking me up.

869
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,780
No Sativa or this is a sativa.
Yeah,

870
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,010
this is,
I'll tell you what it's called.

871
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,340
They labeled,
these are all from la speed.

872
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:41,950
We'd la speed weeds.
The way to go,

873
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,630
ladies and gentlemen,
if you're in Los Angeles,

874
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,500
Los Angeles is the most ridiculous thing
in the world because they're trying to

875
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:51,170
stop that and they're,
they're trying to stop it and some weird

876
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:55,450
there some sort of a zoning way.
Like what they're trying to say is

877
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:59,740
because he's delivering it like where he
selling it becomes a place of business.

878
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,140
So it has to be zoned in a certain way.

879
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:05,840
Like this is the argument,
which is ridiculous because how would

880
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,890
fast food restaurants deliver?
Like how a domino's deliver,

881
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,680
cause these places aren't zoned for
being restaurants.

882
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,990
Like if someone just shows up at your
house with a pizza,

883
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,320
like your house doesn't have to be zoned
for being a restaurant for him to show

884
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,290
up at your house with a pizza.
But if someone shows up at your house

885
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,950
selling weed and you live next to a
school,

886
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,750
right,
it becomes problematic.

887
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,150
It's interesting.
It's an interesting argument.

888
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,130
It's going to go away because it's
silly,

889
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,650
but um,
it's going to cost a lot of people some

890
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:35,870
money and probably Gino from lsp weed,
it's going to cost him.

891
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:36,250
So

892
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,980
this,
it seems like something the city makes

893
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:39,060
up to try to make some money.

894
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,150
Yeah,
probably,

895
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,240
well maybe it might be someone who is
anti weed who is at the,

896
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:44,160
at the top,
but I haven't,

897
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,870
I have some friends that are not pot
smokers.

898
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,600
Don't like pot,
don't believe in pot and they're,

899
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,820
you know,
older than me and they,

900
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:56,821
they'll still hang on to some of these
silly ideas about pot and they'll go,

901
00:41:56,911 --> 00:41:58,710
well you are different,
you know,

902
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,960
to me I go,
oh,

903
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:02,790
I'm different.
Like what are you talking about that I'm

904
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,380
like,
90% of potheads are like me.

905
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,130
Like it's the ones who stand out are the
ones that are the outliers.

906
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,710
It's the ones with the dirty fee and the
fucking,

907
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:14,860
the macrame clothes and you know,
playing fucking,

908
00:42:14,861 --> 00:42:18,430
what is that thing that you've kicked
the ball with your foot hacky sack.

909
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,260
Yeah.

910
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,970
It's funny.
It's like when you belong to a group,

911
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,220
there's always an annoying section of
that group that makes you not want to

912
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:29,520
belong to that group of customers.
That's where the black people or gay

913
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:30,720
people,
a certain type of gay people,

914
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:35,670
like other gay people like can't stand
because it might give gay people a bad

915
00:42:35,671 --> 00:42:40,671
look and they say same thing with weed
and then then somebody who's against

916
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:43,170
that thing completely meets you.
Like I've been,

917
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,810
you know like when I was a teenager or
white people got,

918
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,360
you're different than other black guys,
which was an insult for sure.

919
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,840
That's like in the social justice
warrior handbook or how not to talk to

920
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:55,800
black guys.
Exactly.

921
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,980
It's,
it's almost as bad as saying,

922
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:01,110
Nigga,
but you're telling me I'd rather you

923
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:05,460
call me nigger at that point
because now you're telling me I'm not

924
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,910
black enough.
Right.

925
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm saying right.
And first of all,

926
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,130
you don't know any other black people
were working at Burger King.

927
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,820
I'm the first one you met,
so you're only listing.

928
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,020
The only thing you know about black
people is what you see on the news.

929
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,780
So then you and you meet me and you
don't feel threatened.

930
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,880
Then you're like,
you're not like other black guys,

931
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:23,760
but I'm the only black person you know.
You live in a all white neighborhood.

932
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:25,710
I'm working in an all white neighborhood
burger king.

933
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,570
That's hilarious.

934
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,330
True.
That's why one of the reasons why New

935
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,630
York City is such a good place to live
because everybody integrates,

936
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:34,830
right?
Because New York City,

937
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,140
everybody's on the subway,
everybody's walking on the street and

938
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:38,370
everybody's around.
Everybody.

939
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,110
One of the weird things about la in
general is that it's a car culture and

940
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,010
you were in your little isolated box and
you drive to your little isolated

941
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:51,420
community and then you go back and forth
from work to wherever you hang out and

942
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:55,080
those are your spots and you don't
interact with other people like face to

943
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:57,090
face,
person to person on a daily basis.

944
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,950
Just the best thing about New York.

945
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,600
Yeah.
Cause that trey,

946
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:01,920
man,
everybody's on that track.

947
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,240
All kinds of people,
because even if you're rich enough to

948
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,240
take,
take a taxi,

949
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,260
it's traffic up there.
The train is still the fastest place.

950
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,500
Fastest way to get somewhere.
The only way it's mixed,

951
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:16,850
man.
It's good.

952
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,590
It's V it's super important too,
because one of the things that I think

953
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,680
everybody who I know who used to be
poor,

954
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,570
we,
Ron White and I were talking about this

955
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:28,010
the other night,
like when,

956
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,720
when you're,
when you haven't made it,

957
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,793
when you're,
when you're,

958
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,280
you always feel like it's never gonna
happen,

959
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,210
right?
You always feel like it's completely out

960
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,290
of touch.
Like,

961
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,630
I'm poor.
I'm always going to be poor.

962
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:41,580
This fucking struggles never gonna go
away.

963
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,420
But when you're around people who used
to be poor too,

964
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,060
but they figured out how to do it,
you go,

965
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,950
oh,
they're just a fucking person.

966
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,460
You know?
And when you see some dude and he's on

967
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:57,450
some corner office and some giant ass
building and he's a ceo of that company,

968
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,340
you can't imagine that at one point in
that guy's life he was fucked up.

969
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,950
Like at one point in his life,
he's depressed and lost and failing in

970
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:07,470
school and couldn't figure it out.

971
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:07,980
Right.
You know,

972
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,160
and was wondering about his future,
but almost everybody has lows.

973
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,070
What's everybody has almost every
successful person that I've ever met had

974
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:20,820
some crazy adversity early on.
They figured their way through that and

975
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:24,090
then they figured out how to become
successful parsley even because of that.

976
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,610
So when you're on like a train and
everybody's all together,

977
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,940
then I think it's the one of the best
sort of ways to keep that separation

978
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:37,550
that us and them separation with like
the classes especially because that's a

979
00:45:39,211 --> 00:45:44,211
real fucking mindset of rich people and
a real mindset of poor people that

980
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,490
they're just,
there's two different groups of us,

981
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,940
but it's so stupid.
It's not it,

982
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:53,940
it's just a bunch of people and they're
on the same journey that you're on in a

983
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:57,060
different direction.
Just maybe a little bit further down the

984
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:57,894
road,
right.

985
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,240
Or maybe they didn't stop as many times
as you did.

986
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,900
Maybe they didn't get flat tires.
Maybe they didn't have as many potholes

987
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:05,250
in the road,
but they're all,

988
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,500
we're all just on this fucking same
thing.

989
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:10,080
We're all just people.
And so when you look at some dude,

990
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,140
you know and you're poor and you got
holes in your sneakers and some guys get

991
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:17,370
a rolex on and he's wearing this
expensive suit and he's got cuff links

992
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:20,310
and he's checking his newspaper and
Reading The Wall Street Journal and you

993
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:23,100
look at is expensive shoes like this
motherfucker's got some money,

994
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:24,840
man.
How the hell did he do that?

995
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,750
And I'm here a loser.
He just did it.

996
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,630
He's just,
he's just a person just like,

997
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,690
right.
You don't,

998
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,140
you don't know.
He never look at it as a origin story.

999
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,990
Yeah.
Just look straight at Batman doing doing

1000
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:37,040
this shit.
Exactly.

1001
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,270
You know,
see what he had to go through too.

1002
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,010
You know.
It's a good point and learn all that

1003
00:46:40,011 --> 00:46:41,750
shit to way to put it.
And you want to,

1004
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,730
you want to get there.
Yeah.

1005
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:45,470
You want to get there,
but it seems like it's impossible.

1006
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,090
Yeah.
Speaking of getting there,

1007
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:49,370
I tried to watch soccer last night.
Oh yeah.

1008
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:52,850
I was going to bring that up.
People tweeted me that you're watching

1009
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,580
soccer.
I might invite you to a game on Sunday

1010
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,770
at the,
I got the galaxy,

1011
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:58,400
this is mother's Day.
Mother's Day.

1012
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,410
Oh,
shit happen.

1013
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,160
I can't do it.
But yeah.

1014
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,300
What happened?
Why?

1015
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,770
Well,
it was at the store and uh,

1016
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,910
we were hanging out in the secret
comedians bar and soccer was on,

1017
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,830
so we just started watching it.
Just started watching that shit.

1018
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,810
Who had that on?
Ryan White was watching it.

1019
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:17,410
I was watching that.
Some of the employees were watching it.

1020
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,110
Yeah.
Um,

1021
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,570
who else was in there with us?
Tony was watching it at one point,

1022
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,620
but I started getting upset if these
dudes getting slapped and going down,

1023
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:27,560
like that guy hit with a media.
I didn't like that.

1024
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,820
I'm like,
I just support this kind of nonsense.

1025
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,560
You watching a really good game.
Yeah.

1026
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,150
Yeah.
You were really watching a really good

1027
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:34,871
game.
Yeah,

1028
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:36,520
it was amazing.
Like skill wise,

1029
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,740
bye and Munich and the red,
they're the best German team and this is

1030
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:44,340
a champion's league game so I didn't
know how to explain it.

1031
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:49,230
Champions League is square,
the four best teams in each league in

1032
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:54,231
each country like playing a tournament
to to be the best club team in Europe.

1033
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,740
So Byron is is like the number one team
in Germany.

1034
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,830
Athletical they're like number two,
number three right now.

1035
00:48:01,831 --> 00:48:03,990
They actually in number that number two
spot right now,

1036
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:08,730
but last year they finished maybe second
or third at the end there they have less

1037
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:14,030
money but their coaches are ex Argentina
player and he figured out a system where

1038
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,840
they just hustle.
They just out hustle you,

1039
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,110
you get the ball and there's three
motherfuckers on you and you're going to

1040
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:25,890
cough it up and they're going to get it.
And they all score one or two goals game

1041
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,130
and that's enough.
But you know,

1042
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:32,610
and buying is just so really skilled
that they might be able to,

1043
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,870
they beat most teams,
but athletics is just so disciplined

1044
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,410
that you know,
they,

1045
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:42,030
they knocked them out and they're,
they're going to the Champions League

1046
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:45,930
final versus Real Madrid.
So there's two Spanish teams in the

1047
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:49,020
champion's league final and both of them
are from the same city.

1048
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:52,650
So it's like the Lakers versus the
clippers for like the best.

1049
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,420
The,
the championship of w w what,

1050
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,370
what are we in like the up North America

1051
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,170
blip when we do it in North America,
we call it the world championships.

1052
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,570
We call it the what the NBA is the world
championship.

1053
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,413
Yeah,
yeah,

1054
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,230
yeah.
Like just cause it's all the best

1055
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:10,130
players in the world,
right?

1056
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:10,911
Yeah.
No,

1057
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,540
I understand.
But like when they do it in the World

1058
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,100
Cup,
it actually is the world is the world.

1059
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:17,540
Yeah.
It is the world because there's not

1060
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:21,500
really any competition coming over from
Europe trying to play against the

1061
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:22,550
Lakers.
Right.

1062
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,520
It's just not really going to happen.
They're not going to have a team that

1063
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:27,800
they develop overseas that can compete
with an la,

1064
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,410
like basketball has this thing where I
think they have like all the North

1065
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,320
American Dab a tournament where all the
like Brazil and,

1066
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,650
and like all the,
we in North America,

1067
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,860
all the North American teams.
So it's really asset.

1068
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,050
Listen man,
you were born in another country just

1069
00:49:46,051 --> 00:49:46,980
been hot,
boxed.

1070
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,780
I don't know what the fuck is that

1071
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,470
just be hot.
Hotbox so,

1072
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,103
so yeah,
like,

1073
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,930
like all the countries play around this
area,

1074
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,300
around this area,
play against each other.

1075
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:03,210
And I guess America normally wins.
But this is,

1076
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,830
this is,
this is,

1077
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,910
this is a big tournament man.
Yeah.

1078
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,510
This is the,

1079
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,980
the actual whole world.
I know.

1080
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,810
That's what I want.
What I was thinking like are there any

1081
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:15,700
sports with the United States competes
with the whole world and does well in

1082
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:16,451
soccer?
No.

1083
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,250
In any other sport.
Yeah.

1084
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,230
Well,
it just say the difference in this too

1085
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:22,120
is what you're thinking.
I guess maybe World Cup,

1086
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:24,370
his team teams for countries,
right.

1087
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:25,220
This is,
uh,

1088
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,040
teams for professional clubs.
Teams are owned and that like,

1089
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,950
so these teams wouldn't necessarily play
the United States.

1090
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,160
They would play like the Columbus crew
or the good la Galaxy.

1091
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,630
They're not on the same skill level.
So it would be a really bad game when

1092
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,180
someone says like Manchester United,
that's a club.

1093
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,220
It's a club that's like the Yankees,
the Yankees in soccer in England.

1094
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:51,230
But when you would think of,
so they would play against a bunch of

1095
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:52,450
other different,
they also,

1096
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,030
there's Real Madrid basketball team and
they wouldn't want to play against like

1097
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:59,120
any NBA team cause they would get
destroyed the same way they would beat

1098
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:02,990
our soccer teams.
But the United States play Spain and

1099
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:05,960
like World Cup type competition.
And we also have something like that

1100
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,210
where it's a conch,
a calf and it's like United States

1101
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:11,810
versus Mexico versus some of the smaller
a Latin American country.

1102
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,590
What I was getting at was is there a
sport where the United States is

1103
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:19,070
competitive in a world stage?

1104
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,280
Like a sport?
Whereas yeah,

1105
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,600
like basketball we're usually like,
yeah,

1106
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:25,550
but we don't,
the world doesn't play basketball.

1107
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,010
The problem with us being competitive at
basketball.

1108
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,320
It's like someone over here being a
cricket champion.

1109
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,340
Nobody gives a fuck if you go to Greece
or Turkey or Spain,

1110
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,150
they have,
they have their version of the MBA,

1111
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,130
right?
They have their version of the NBA,

1112
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,780
but the those teams and those plays are
not as good as ours and they come from

1113
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:47,060
all different countries and then when
you,

1114
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,800
when it's time for you to play for your
country,

1115
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,650
you're still not as good as American and
it,

1116
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:53,960
and,
and that's when in the Olympics they

1117
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:55,790
have a world championship for
basketball,

1118
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:56,690
for real,
I think.

1119
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:00,380
And they have the Olympics,
which is like the one that everybody

1120
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:03,350
pays attention to the Moose.
That's where all the countries get

1121
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:06,260
together and play basketball.
But isn't it fascinating that

1122
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:11,500
there's a clear winner as far as like
who is the best still when,

1123
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:14,650
what is basketball really?
It's moving your feet,

1124
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,320
which everybody knows how to do.
Throwing a ball,

1125
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,400
which most people know how to do
dribbling and then learning how to get

1126
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:23,620
super awesome at all of those skills.
Right.

1127
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,760
That doesn't seem like,
it's not like something where someone

1128
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:32,050
has to teach you some master strategist
who's like the greatest snow world has

1129
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:33,940
to teach you.
Like it's almost like a form of

1130
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:35,200
expression,
right?

1131
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,750
It's like why are Americans so much
better at it?

1132
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,730
I think,
I don't know.

1133
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,350
It's like in soccer Brazil,
like I've been trying to ask myself the

1134
00:52:44,351 --> 00:52:46,200
saint cause why is Brazil so good at
soccer?

1135
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,570
They love it.
You know,

1136
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,350
they,
they but it's a lot of countries around

1137
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:52,680
the world love it,
but they have like five world cup

1138
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:54,240
championships.
Well maybe six.

1139
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,163
Germany's good.
Yeah.

1140
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:59,760
Zyl has a great history of soccer,
like with Palae of course.

1141
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,620
But they also have a great history of
like nationalism and competitive

1142
00:53:04,621 --> 00:53:07,110
athletics.
Like thinking about how many Brazilian

1143
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:10,320
mma champions they are.
I mean there's so many.

1144
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,220
Brazil,
Roger,

1145
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,150
Gracie,
just one,

1146
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:15,180
one fc last night.
So there's a Brazilian champion.

1147
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,700
Like there's so many Brazilian
champions.

1148
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:22,701
He choked out some dude in one FC,
which is the Asia version of the UFC.

1149
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,870
Right?
It's just getting bigger and bigger.

1150
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:29,871
This a bunch of like really big
organizations overseas now there that

1151
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:34,080
are starting to build up momentum.
But if you look at like martial arts

1152
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:37,050
champions from Brazil,
Jesus Christ,

1153
00:53:37,051 --> 00:53:39,900
there's so many of them,
so many in the UFC,

1154
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:42,990
so many former champions,
so many elite high level fighters.

1155
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Like there's a card next weekend in
Brazil and it's all like the killers of

1156
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:53,691
the killer of people,
like in Brazilian champions in Vitor

1157
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,210
Belfort versus Jocker Ray Anderson
Silva's fighting Uriah Hall.

1158
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,280
Oh my God.
It's incredible.

1159
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:02,130
There's so,
there's so much super high level talent

1160
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:03,750
that came out of Brazil,
Brazil,

1161
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,010
Uriah Faber.
Yeah,

1162
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:05,701
you're right.
No,

1163
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,800
you mean Ryan Hall.
Oh,

1164
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:07,410
okay.
You're right.

1165
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,990
Halls black.
He's from Jamaica,

1166
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:10,830
I believe.
Oh,

1167
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,170
that big monster do too.
Oh yeah.

1168
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,790
Robot dark.
It's cold.

1169
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,580
Fucking lightning fast.
He's one of my favorites.

1170
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,520
That dude is,
he's such a nice guy too.

1171
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:22,260
That's the thing about in the him,
he like,

1172
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,480
he,
he made some like really heartfelt

1173
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:28,380
statement once after one of his fights.
Uh,

1174
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,510
you know about people getting along.
And I was like,

1175
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,900
this guy is like legit.
Like this is really him.

1176
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:36,630
He's such a nice guy.
That's almost been one of the things

1177
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:39,840
that held him back.
Like Dana White did criticized him of it

1178
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:43,290
and he said he's so talented but he's
almost too nice for fighting.

1179
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:44,903
I don't think that's true.

1180
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,260
I think he's just needs more fights and,
but he's got a big one with Anderson

1181
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,000
Silva.
It's a big like crossroads fight.

1182
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:54,230
It shows where Anderson's at.
Cause if Anderson can get past Uriah,

1183
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,120
who's one of the best 185 pounders alive
right now.

1184
00:54:57,121 --> 00:54:58,770
You're right.
Is a lightening fast.

1185
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:02,400
Reiker I'm picturing your riot and he
feels bigger than,

1186
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,490
and this,
no,

1187
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,420
he's more muscular for sure.
He's built way better.

1188
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,370
He's,
he's probably faster,

1189
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,230
which is crazy.
But you know,

1190
00:55:10,231 --> 00:55:12,060
this is,
we're talking about Anderson Silva at 40

1191
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:14,490
years old versus Anderson Silva at like
34.

1192
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,070
But uriah is,
um,

1193
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,430
he's like got traditional martial arts
skills at a super,

1194
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:22,560
super high level.
Like he does a lot of stuff like

1195
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:26,790
spinning back kicks and wheel kicks and
knocks guys out with them in real high

1196
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,250
level.
Guys like he hit gay garden was saucy.

1197
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,850
There's Uriah,
he hit gay guy who saucy with a spinning

1198
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:34,170
back kick to the face.

1199
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,200
And it was a fight that we were calling
for fight companion.

1200
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,790
And my thoughts on him,
I was like,

1201
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:43,680
I'm telling you this guy can do things
in these explosive movements and I'm,

1202
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,310
I'm like,
I'm so used to seeing people move.

1203
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,860
You know what I'm so used to seeing the
way people throw kicks and the way

1204
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:52,680
people throw punches when someone's
movements stand out,

1205
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,514
like,
Ooh,

1206
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,120
Jesus Christ.
Like they've got it honed down to uh,

1207
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,110
a razor's edge with just lightening
precision.

1208
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,270
It just really stands out.
And that's your riot hall.

1209
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:05,740
Uriah Hall has these movements.
Occasionally we'll,

1210
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:07,710
he'll just drop a right hand on
someone's channy.

1211
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:08,970
You just go,
whoa.

1212
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,680
There's like that guy was not moving
like that by the time that punch got to

1213
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:15,240
him.
But he had no idea that punch was

1214
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,074
coming.
I mean,

1215
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,320
his,
his ability to close the distance with a

1216
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:21,150
shot,
it's so fucking scary.

1217
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,540
So it's an interesting fight in that
regard and I don't think it has,

1218
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:29,120
does it have their age there?
Why are they hiring the age will be a

1219
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:32,770
little girls kind of shit.
Is that show your fucking age?

1220
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:33,780
Well that's great.
How,

1221
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,980
how,
why would they have all these different

1222
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:37,570
things?
I was looking for height too.

1223
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,381
Oh,
okay.

1224
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:41,020
So this is one,
this is the stats.

1225
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:43,780
They have the reach and they have the
weight and then they have the height.

1226
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,180
I was always amazed how Anderson Silva's
body does not match his record.

1227
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,000
Well,
the Anderson Silva when he was in his

1228
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,980
prime,
looked a little bit better than that,

1229
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,570
but he's,
uh,

1230
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:59,710
his body is a really good body for
fighting because in fighting,

1231
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,340
like say a guy like uriah hall might be
able to punch 10 or 15% harder than

1232
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,210
Anderson.
Like who knows?

1233
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,070
I mean,
he hits really fucking hard,

1234
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,980
let's say Ken,
but if Anderson hits him,

1235
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,110
the 90% that Anderson can come up with
is just as good.

1236
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:22,150
The clean shots are the most important
thing and it doesn't take like a giant

1237
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:23,880
bomb to knock you out.
Right?

1238
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,580
A giant bomb can knock you out,
but it doesn't take a giant bomb to

1239
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:29,590
knock you out.
What it takes is a shot you don't see

1240
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:34,591
common and a perfectly placed shot and
Anderson is the master at perfectly play

1241
00:57:35,511 --> 00:57:37,360
shots.
He's the master.

1242
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:40,600
He's the ultimate sniper.
Out of all the guys that have ever

1243
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:43,450
fought in the UFC,
he impresses me the most with his

1244
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:48,070
ability to land these highlight reel
shots on people.

1245
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:52,600
Highlight reel with James Irvin.
He caught James Irvin's kick and just

1246
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:56,860
caved his face in with a punch.
The guy threw a kick anish and caught it

1247
00:57:56,861 --> 00:58:00,550
and bub boom.
You can see the dude had never been here

1248
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:03,010
like that before.
He goes down and Anderson just uncorked

1249
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:03,870
a couple more on them.

1250
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,370
It opens him up.
When he fought vetoer,

1251
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:10,410
he front kicked Vitorin the face.
It was like the perfect front kick knock

1252
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:14,530
out and it was the first ever front kick
knock out in the,

1253
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,080
in the history of the UFC.
Nobody had ever done it before and he

1254
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:20,680
did it in a high level world
championship fight against Vitor

1255
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,980
Belfort.
It's crazy because it's,

1256
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,880
it's the first kick you learn in martial
arts.

1257
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,640
It's like the first kick,
you learn how to do a front kick and

1258
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,470
nobody,
everybody goes at that shit doesn't

1259
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,190
work.
You got to go with the Brown house.

1260
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,540
Anderson lands it right on his face and
this one's a free ass dude.

1261
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,450
You think he's a,
is he back?

1262
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,570
He's 40.
So whatever back is,

1263
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,050
he's not going to be the same back.
Um,

1264
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,720
but if you look at a guy like Bernard
Hopkins,

1265
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,140
Bernard Hopkins,
who's an incredibly skillful technical

1266
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:53,410
boxer,
it's still at this day.

1267
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,360
Like there's a video of him working out
the other day.

1268
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,760
He was hitting mitts.
He looks fucking great.

1269
00:58:57,761 --> 00:58:59,890
He's 50 years old.
He looks fucking great.

1270
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:03,880
Like Bernard Hopkins Right now at 50
years old could get in the ring and

1271
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:07,780
school solid.
50% of the professional light

1272
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,330
heavyweights in the world would look
ugly.

1273
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,030
Gold them.
You hold the shit out of you,

1274
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,000
hold the Shit Out of you,
Jab your fucking face off.

1275
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,690
You know,
moving weird ways up or you know,

1276
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,920
step on your toes,
upset your balance Mug and the corner.

1277
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:23,330
Yeah.
Hit you with like short,

1278
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,400
short,
hard punches while he's clenching you,

1279
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,890
annoy you and getting your head get you
out of your game or a bomb you out.

1280
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:33,000
Like he did Felix Trinidad,
that Philly's trend.

1281
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:35,330
Dad Fight.
He put on a show with Felix Trinidad.

1282
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,380
I was always a big Bernard Hopkins Fan.
So when he fought Trinidad and fucked

1283
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:41,330
him up for me,
it was like I knew it.

1284
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,030
I was surprised.
I thought the Felix was the truth,

1285
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,250
you know,
while he was for a moment.

1286
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,910
But I don't think he,
I don't want to say,

1287
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,900
I don't think he respected Bernard.
I don't think he knew how good Bernard

1288
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:56,360
really was.
I think he was doing so well and

1289
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:59,420
Trinidad was such a world beater and
just such a tough dude.

1290
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,670
I just,
I think he thought he could get through

1291
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:02,520
anything.
I think,

1292
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:03,920
you know,
he was one of those guys that,

1293
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,940
you know,
I can,

1294
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,160
I'm going to get through everybody.
Everybody,

1295
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:07,730
I mean,
he's been to war before he's been

1296
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:09,680
tagged.
Come about knock guys out.

1297
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,310
But Bernard was on,
on nother level that night.

1298
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,170
Yeah.
I've never seen anybody like Bernard

1299
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,200
cause so it's not traditional boxing
like somebody who does that.

1300
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,210
It doesn't get as far as him.
Right?

1301
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:25,370
Like I've never seen somebody and do it
that much.

1302
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:28,700
Well he's a master.
He's a real master.

1303
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,290
If you watch his footwork and in the in
the ring it's always measured.

1304
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,350
It's always under control.
He always knows exactly what he's doing

1305
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:37,970
and what he doesn't know exactly what
he's doing.

1306
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,610
He resets,
he's not whinging anything.

1307
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:44,690
He's not taking any stupid chances.
What was that dead dude he beat for the

1308
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:48,290
title at 49 years of age was his fucking
young stud.

1309
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,320
This guy was like 32 years old,
some Russian dude,

1310
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,870
bad motherfucker.
And he dropped him.

1311
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:58,460
Bernard dropped him at 49 years of age
and people like God and then he fought

1312
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:01,220
Kovalev and that was the fight that
showed.

1313
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:04,970
There's a difference between the highest
of the high level right now.

1314
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And we're,
Bernard is right now with his life being

1315
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,970
49 years old cause Coleville that was
just too much for him.

1316
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,900
And Bernard went into a shell and just
fought real defensively and tried to

1317
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:16,910
survive,
but Kovalev was opening up on him.

1318
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,910
Kovalev it's fucking scary.
That guy's the real deal.

1319
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,660
It's not a bad ass fucking Russians.
He's days.

1320
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,960
I know.
It must be tougher than rush her.

1321
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:28,340
Right?
It's got to be tough.

1322
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,030
It's going to be tough on Russia.
They getting all the boxes like this is

1323
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,490
like the sport where like a lot of
sports,

1324
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,370
a lot of poor people come out and they
get to the top of it.

1325
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,020
You could tell where poor,
where the poorest people are based on

1326
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:46,730
who's the best boxers in the world.
Like Russia must be rough right now.

1327
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,430
That's a real good point.
You know?

1328
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,090
That's how it always worked in America
too.

1329
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:55,070
It's like that's why Jews were a lot of
boxers in the early days of the early

1330
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,880
part of the 12th century when Jewish
slappy Maxie Rosenbloom.

1331
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,600
I was a dude.
You could not have that as a box name

1332
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:06,680
right now.
You could be silly.

1333
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,540
It's silly,
but nobody would take you serious.

1334
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,720
Slappy maxims.
One of the top featherweight in the UFC.

1335
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:12,830
Andre Fili,
his,

1336
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:15,060
his nickname,
his Andre Touchy feely and

1337
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,100
he's a fucking weird ass name.
He's

1338
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,360
a fun dude though.
He's a fun,

1339
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,240
yeah,
it's fun with it.

1340
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,840
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

1341
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,351
Yeah,
man,

1342
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:26,070
it's,
um,

1343
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,320
it's interesting how that APP works that
way.

1344
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:29,580
It's,
and then it was the Italians.

1345
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:31,770
There was a lot of Italians like rocky
Marciano,

1346
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:33,420
rocky Graziano.
There's a lot of,

1347
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,280
you know,
I'm from Irish.

1348
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,320
Yeah,
yeah.

1349
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,310
A lot of Irish,
a lot of immigrants.

1350
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:41,820
It's immigrants that are poor.
People that need to learn how to fight

1351
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:44,310
to survive.
Literally fight to survive.

1352
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,750
You know?
That's one of the reasons why these

1353
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:47,640
Russians are so fucking tough,
man.

1354
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,700
They're coming from a harder place.
It's a harder world.

1355
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,650
And you know,
they're just like Coleville Lev is a

1356
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:56,550
straight up killer.
He's seated in his eyes when he's in the

1357
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:57,900
rankings,
scared as shit.

1358
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,940
He's just gonna fuck you up.
You know?

1359
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,840
And then the Gennady Golovkin he's
another one.

1360
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:06,780
Everybody's scared of that fucking what
the what weight class?

1361
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,400
I haven't watched boxing.
He's won 60.

1362
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,920
I used to be my thing,
but he's a middleweight champ.

1363
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,730
He fucks everybody up and everybody sees
a hundred percent undefeated and he's

1364
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:17,160
knocked everyone out.
I think he had one fight,

1365
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:19,530
the one the distance or a couple,
maybe a couple of fights and went the

1366
01:03:19,531 --> 01:03:22,020
distance,
but he's on some ridiculous knockout

1367
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:24,510
streak in a row.
I should know that for short.

1368
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:26,730
Pull that up.
Gennady Golovkin triple g,

1369
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,460
just a triple g record.
I'm just impressed.

1370
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:33,600
You can say his name so smoothly while
he's got a second name that I can't,

1371
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,820
if there's a triple g,
it's [inaudible] something,

1372
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:38,340
something,
something Golovkin the middle one.

1373
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:42,330
I don't even try with that,
but he's,

1374
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,650
he's a fucking assassin mad.
His name sounds like when you fall

1375
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:51,651
asleep on your keyboard and then you
wake up and to see a bunch of letters or

1376
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:54,330
the other.

1377
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,940
All chaos.
Okay.

1378
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,470
Unanimous decision.
There we go.

1379
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:03,670
And that's way back in 2008 he had a
unanimous decision win,

1380
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:05,670
but he's got a couple of you,
man.

1381
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,770
You know what I was decisions three
there that I say,

1382
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,070
so he's on a streak of like how many,
how many cables in a row?

1383
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,001
One,
two,

1384
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:12,691
three,
four,

1385
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,411
five,
six,

1386
01:04:13,411 --> 01:04:14,041
seven,
eight,

1387
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:18,940
nine,
10 1112 there's a lot 21 kaos no.

1388
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,590
What's funny about this chart like to
see the flags from different countries

1389
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:24,600
that people he's knocked out.
Yeah.

1390
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,473
It's funny,
right?

1391
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,470
You know,
knocked out a lot of people from a lot

1392
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:30,990
of places.
He's so next level.

1393
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,600
He fought dominick wade and his last
fight.

1394
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,340
Jesus Christ,
man.

1395
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:37,410
Hey,
fuck that dude up.

1396
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,650
He's so next level.
So dangerous man.

1397
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,420
At one point in the fight he dropped his
hands and he was letting Wade Punch him.

1398
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,110
Oh Shit.

1399
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,500
He was just moving his head as wade was
punching him and then he uncorked bombs

1400
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:51,390
on him.
He's a terrifying guy.

1401
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,510
Can you looks like a little cutie pie?
I give it.

1402
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:56,060
See what he looks like.
No,

1403
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,500
go to go to a picture of him.
Look at him.

1404
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,680
He's a cutie
baby.

1405
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:05,220
He's a baby face assassin.
He's like the real baby faced assassin.

1406
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,290
Like that guy looks like a straight up
qt.

1407
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,030
It's like a handsome young man.
Innocent as a handsome young man with

1408
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:15,600
fine manners.
He dresses rails well dress almost a

1409
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:17,860
mine.
Just like a mime kind of French.

1410
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,400
Meanwhile,

1411
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,790
that dude is probably a direct
descendant of the [inaudible] goal.

1412
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,370
That's probably what it is.
Like no bullshit.

1413
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:29,490
Russians like Russia was occupied by the
Mongols for 200 years,

1414
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,600
and a lot of these guys like Russell
Salon provide knockoff who's going to be

1415
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,490
on the podcast soon with [inaudible]
curse on.

1416
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,510
Yeah,
they're gonna come on together.

1417
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,760
That should be fun.
That fucking dude grew up in like

1418
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:42,640
Siberia.
He was eating raw moose.

1419
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,520
He ate raw meat until he was like 25
years old.

1420
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:48,160
He had never had cooked meat.
His family,

1421
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:53,161
Raw Moose is Jesus Christ providing a
cough is a fucking,

1422
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,980
and now he looks like he ate ramen
Moose.

1423
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,220
Yeah,
he did.

1424
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,400
But I mean,
this is a guy who is a another one,

1425
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:03,670
probably a direct descendant of the
Mongols.

1426
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,840
There was so many fucking super
warriors.

1427
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:11,530
It came out of that DNA.
And you look at a guy like providing a

1428
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:11,890
cough.

1429
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:15,850
I mean,
he just screams like ancient warrior

1430
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:18,340
DNA.
I mean,

1431
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,700
to look at him,
look at his face and the way he fights.

1432
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,690
You got to hit that dude with a fucking
crowbar to hurt him.

1433
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:31,110
He engages in wars with these people.
I got to get back into boxing that Lucas

1434
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,920
[inaudible] fight was insane.
Providing the coughing.

1435
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,120
My Tsa just teed off on each other and
you just,

1436
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:41,410
TSA is a brutal knockout puncher and
when he was hitting,

1437
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,000
providing a cough,
you were like,

1438
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:48,001
how was he absorbing these shots?
He's absorbed shots at Matisa was able

1439
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:50,410
to put everybody else away with like
look at that shot.

1440
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,930
Boom.
Matissa like it's a weird,

1441
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,660
like you look at the guy and you say,
okay,

1442
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,840
obviously it looks like he's in shape.
He looks athletic but he doesn't look

1443
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:00,430
like a big power puncher.
Right?

1444
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,710
Like if you look at him,
he's not like,

1445
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,950
he's not built like Marvin Hagler,
Mike Tyson or something like that.

1446
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,930
He's a more smooth and it's,
it's,

1447
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,150
it just shows you that punching power is
a really weird thing.

1448
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,630
And it's not saying that Matisa is in
any way unfit.

1449
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:18,010
He's very fit,
very strong,

1450
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:21,610
very good athlete.
But his punching power is almost just

1451
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:25,060
like skeletal.
It like comes from his frame.

1452
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:26,740
And some sort of a strange way,
and this is,

1453
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,510
there's a bunch of guys that are like
that.

1454
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:30,280
This is kidney,
UFC,

1455
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:34,510
his name's Mike MacDonald and he's like
that like go to Mike McDonald.

1456
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,260
This kid is a murderous puncher,
but if you look at him,

1457
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,490
you,
you look,

1458
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,790
he looks like a no,
like a regular kid,

1459
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,630
like a regular like athlete and some
people you expect them,

1460
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:47,800
when you look at them body,
you're like,

1461
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,420
this person is probably going to hit
hard.

1462
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,240
This kid and I don't,
he's a sweet face,

1463
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,200
goofy face.
Ziff he'd get a picture of his whole

1464
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,460
body just standing there.

1465
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,680
You'd get a sense of like,
it means obviously a good athlete,

1466
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:05,110
but you're like right.
There was good example.

1467
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,560
He's obviously get out,
but his punching power is disturbing.

1468
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,170
It's disturbing.
Lucky bloke,

1469
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:15,070
he fucking cracks guys with shots and
you see the look on their face and like,

1470
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:19,070
what in the fuck?
What is going on with this dude's hands?

1471
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,750
He just hits so fucking hard and with so
much precision.

1472
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,630
He's nasty on the ground too.
He's a real threat.

1473
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:31,310
This kid and he's super young.
I think he's only like 23 yeah.

1474
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:34,250
You already fought for the title.
He lost a brow and a crazy fight.

1475
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:37,190
But a fight where it really got here
really got tested,

1476
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:41,110
really showed what he's capable of the,
but the body thing,

1477
01:08:41,111 --> 01:08:43,250
it's very strange,
but it makes a person,

1478
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,310
you never know.
Yeah.

1479
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,960
It's weird.
Like punching power is different than

1480
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:49,940
almost any other kind of athletic power.

1481
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,750
Like you don't see it coming.
Like if you see someone who has a big

1482
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:57,050
ass and fucking giant quads and they
were on the starting block,

1483
01:08:57,051 --> 01:08:59,330
like I bet that fucking dude can ride,
you know?

1484
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:02,960
But you see a guy like Mcdonald's and
you wouldn't necessarily go,

1485
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:07,890
I bet that guy can fucking punch.
Where's Uriah hall that both murderers

1486
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:08,870
punches.
But you're right hall,

1487
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,380
you see it and you let go.
Obviously that guy can punch.

1488
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,220
Look at him.
You'd be most surprised if he couldn't.

1489
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,350
Yeah.
And there are guys like that too,

1490
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,810
which is weird.
There's posters you'll be able to,

1491
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,070
you know?
Yeah.

1492
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,150
It's like seeing a seven foot center,
you know,

1493
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,200
like nobody like daisy sanders in the
NBA.

1494
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,390
Like,

1495
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,730
oh,
he's seven feet and they sucked from the

1496
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:30,820
data with drafted.
But every team year after year,

1497
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,860
we'll still put them on the team because
he's seven feet.

1498
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:37,090
Maybe this is the year,
12 years in when he's going to do the

1499
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:37,440
seventh

1500
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,330
foot ship and he'd never do it.
But they make all this money because

1501
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,160
they built like this.
They should be able to do seven foot

1502
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:45,970
shit or,
or people are built like there's

1503
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:47,610
supposed to be able to hit and they just
can't.

1504
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,860
So do they get a guy like that and they
say,

1505
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:50,520
well,
we're gonna,

1506
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,270
we're gonna take him in and then we're
going to get our coaches on him.

1507
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,650
We're going to show this guy had reached
its full potential.

1508
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,270
And then they just don't through the
season and say,

1509
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,180
oh,
I see why the other train teams dropped

1510
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:03,740
him and we stuck putting on the bench.
You get stuck with him on the bench.

1511
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,390
We're bringing me once in a while with
the guy that big.

1512
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:08,400
Is it just difficult to move their body?
Right?

1513
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:12,430
They say that,
but like Shaq did it.

1514
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,880
Shaq was,
his movement was amazing.

1515
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:21,090
Like almost small forward like,
well,

1516
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:25,810
some of the shit that he used to do and
I came along Jeewan moved well and uh,

1517
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,300
they was Robinson movie.
Well there was a lot of,

1518
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:29,360
there's a lot there.
There was some,

1519
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,670
there's some,
there's some,

1520
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,073
some,
uh,

1521
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,130
some tea.
Like,

1522
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:34,870
I don't know,
there's,

1523
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:36,850
there's,
there's a lot of centers that could

1524
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,880
move.
So when they say it's tough to move your

1525
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,360
body,
I don't get it.

1526
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,840
It is,
it is rare.

1527
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,830
Like good centers are rare.
So I guess maybe it is,

1528
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:50,820
but when you see the ones that do it,
it makes you wonder,

1529
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,730
it makes you look down on the people
that can't like him.

1530
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,130
I'm seven feet.
I'm thinking I could do some stuff,

1531
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,620
I could be decent enough.
But there's some guys that are seven

1532
01:10:59,621 --> 01:11:03,340
feet and they really don't do anything
except be seven feet.

1533
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,680
Hmm.
Now is it a benefit just having the big

1534
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:11,430
guy there because they can do things and
block people and get in the way and make

1535
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:14,310
it difficult for the other team to,
to use their offense?

1536
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,791
Yeah.
It's,

1537
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:17,060
it's a mentality.
It's like they always say you can't

1538
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:18,350
teach height.
Okay,

1539
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,440
that makes sense.
And then it was like the eighties and

1540
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:25,730
the nineties was like the center game.
So everybody just felt more secure with

1541
01:11:25,731 --> 01:11:26,690
a center,
you know?

1542
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:28,870
Right.
So they would plan their strategy around

1543
01:11:28,871 --> 01:11:29,830
the,
the tall guy,

1544
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:30,761
the tall guy.
Yeah.

1545
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:32,890
Because he couldn't get the ball above
people.

1546
01:11:32,891 --> 01:11:35,680
He has more like,
especially the way that they're throwing

1547
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:38,800
the ball down at people instead of like
up and down.

1548
01:11:38,801 --> 01:11:41,020
Right.
He could probably do some stuff as far

1549
01:11:41,021 --> 01:11:44,280
as I get in the way,
get his physical body to block people,

1550
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,300
but sometimes they're not even good
enough to do that.

1551
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,280
And then they have to get rid of her for
real.

1552
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,160
Like I said,
let's get this guy.

1553
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,970
He'll do the least and then they don't
even do the least.

1554
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:55,990
Do you think

1555
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,280
that's because they're lazy?
Um,

1556
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,000
because it was always easy for them
cause they were always so big.

1557
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:03,280
And so like as throughout their career
they were,

1558
01:12:03,281 --> 01:12:04,390
oh,
they always had a giant height

1559
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:05,090
advantage.

1560
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:09,620
Being transgender.
Like you're five foot four person born

1561
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:12,380
in the 74 person's body.
You know what I'm saying?

1562
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:16,040
Like like you're not supposed to be
there.

1563
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,570
He's supposed to be doing something
else.

1564
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:20,540
It just got stuck with this basketball
frame.

1565
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,310
Like some people just can't do it.

1566
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:26,350
So some people they got stuck with a
basketball frame but they don't have a

1567
01:12:26,351 --> 01:12:28,780
basketball mind or heart or heart.
Yeah,

1568
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,560
you have to like want to move your body
in very difficult ways.

1569
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:34,270
Right.
Because I want have met like one of the

1570
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,490
things that you notice about fighters in
particular,

1571
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,280
like um,
you ever seen that guy a chocolate tito

1572
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:40,300
fight?
No.

1573
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,080
Self believes flyweight what way does he
champion?

1574
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,780
I watched him fight the other day.
Awesome boxer,

1575
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:50,530
amazing counter fighter,
but so light and so small like mighty

1576
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:53,170
mouse in the UFC.
It's probably a better example because

1577
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:57,370
mighty mouse fights at 125 pounds and
he's the best in the world.

1578
01:12:57,371 --> 01:13:00,160
Like no one can fuck with it.
Did Not just the best in the world at

1579
01:13:00,161 --> 01:13:02,110
one 25.
He's the best in the world.

1580
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,760
Hands down.
There's no argument anymore.

1581
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:05,790
After his last fight where he destroyed
Henry Hutto.

1582
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,770
Everybody just lifts her hands up and
go.

1583
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,890
He's the best,
he's the best,

1584
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:14,040
but he's 125 pounds and he way he moves.
I always wonder my cocoon,

1585
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:18,520
a 200 pound guy move like that.
Could it two 55 pound guy move like

1586
01:13:18,521 --> 01:13:21,820
that?
Is it even possible like can we get like

1587
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:24,820
when you look at the,
the super athletes that are in the nfl

1588
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:27,640
and I think we can all agree the most
explosive,

1589
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,740
best athletes are in the NFL.
Right?

1590
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,510
Agreed.
Pretty close.

1591
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:35,920
I mean I think there's probably some
really high level guys in mma at this

1592
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:38,650
point,
but I think that overall the most

1593
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:40,690
explosive high level athletes are in
the,

1594
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,500
in the NFL.
If you can get one of those nfl top

1595
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:47,470
guys,
could you teach him to move like mighty

1596
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:51,400
mouse if you started with him at a young
age or is it a gravity thing?

1597
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:56,500
Is it that the 125 pound guy,
he can just do stuff with his joints and

1598
01:13:56,501 --> 01:14:01,501
his movement that the 260 pound guy just
physically his body can't keep up.

1599
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,110
You know,
you know what the issue is.

1600
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:08,070
It's like if you're little,
you know your little from your little

1601
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,930
from you,
from your young person,

1602
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,610
so you,
you live little,

1603
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:15,130
you move little right and you act
little.

1604
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:20,250
If you're big then you know you're big
and there's certain things you just

1605
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:25,780
don't gravitate to doing because it
doesn't fit your size of your big.

1606
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:30,250
So you see it's crazy.
You almost have to convince hypnotize a

1607
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:35,251
big dude that's your little and make
them like live little move like a little

1608
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,620
person,
like a little person like and get used

1609
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:41,170
to it and then it becomes natural like
mighty mouse moves.

1610
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:43,030
Like I'm little.
If I,

1611
01:14:43,031 --> 01:14:45,700
if I,
he fights like if he's fighting a bully

1612
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:48,670
in high school,
like I can't let that guy grabbed me.

1613
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:52,550
I got to keep moving like a big guys
like let this motherfucker grabbed me,

1614
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:55,270
you know what I'm saying?
I want you to grab me.

1615
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,710
So you fight,
they fight big.

1616
01:14:56,711 --> 01:14:57,700
It's like,
yeah,

1617
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:02,260
it's just a mentality.
That's an excellent way of putting it.

1618
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,450
That's an actual,
I think you're totally right.

1619
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:08,440
I think you're totally right because we
all like do things according to just our

1620
01:15:08,441 --> 01:15:09,590
physical makeup,
you know?

1621
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,473
Sure.
Yeah.

1622
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,450
But I wonder if you could get a guy at a
young age,

1623
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,810
like do you know the story of marvel
renovation and Todd Marinovich,

1624
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,750
todd Marinovich,
todd Marinovich who was a famous

1625
01:15:20,751 --> 01:15:25,190
football player and his dad marve was a
famous strength and conditioning coach

1626
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,630
and,
and a coach,

1627
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,630
a football coach.
So his dad took todd from the time it

1628
01:15:29,631 --> 01:15:32,720
was really little.
I had a meeting only healthy food,

1629
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:34,670
no sugar,
working out like crazy.

1630
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:38,390
Put them through all the drills and
turned him into this like super athlete.

1631
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:41,810
But he rebelled because it was just like
too much pressure and work.

1632
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,550
They didn't want to do it.
Who's doing it for his dad?

1633
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,620
Then he bounced.
We want to quit any went drugs and

1634
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:46,490
unhealthy.
Yeah.

1635
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:49,190
Drugs unhealthy became an artist or
maybe it's healthy now,

1636
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:49,911
I think,
hopefully.

1637
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:50,810
Right.
But it's interesting.

1638
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,250
It's a,
it's an interesting thing.

1639
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:57,250
Like this guy grabbed his young son from
the time he was a baby and had him doing

1640
01:15:57,321 --> 01:16:02,210
any strength drills and can coordination
drills like raised him with the idea of

1641
01:16:02,211 --> 01:16:04,490
turning them into this and the results
were amazing.

1642
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,610
So you wonder,
like if someone could take a guy like a

1643
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:12,170
Herschel Walker for Herschel Walker is
one of the perfect example.

1644
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:14,140
Yeah,
one of the best examples because

1645
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,930
Herschel actually fought mma Herschel,
but he felt like a big man.

1646
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:21,410
He fucked dudes up to it.
He did it in his late forties.

1647
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:24,520
He was legitimately a threat or good.
Um,

1648
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,550
he was very good for the class that he
was fighting in,

1649
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:33,580
but he was fairly recent to mma,
but along a lifelong martial artists

1650
01:16:34,401 --> 01:16:37,250
like Hershel Walker,
even back in the days when he was in the

1651
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:39,860
NFL,
had some sort of a black belt in

1652
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,170
something.
You look at him,

1653
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:41,810
man.

1654
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,210
I think in that picture he was like 47.
Jesus Christ.

1655
01:16:45,211 --> 01:16:48,170
Say he always looked young and gooden
and shaping.

1656
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:50,480
I don't understand what's going on.
I mean,

1657
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:55,481
that shit doesn't even make any sense
because he looks like he's as big as he

1658
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:58,130
was when he was playing professional
football.

1659
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,500
Who lied to bear heads.
Yeah,

1660
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,710
I'll kill you with my bare hands and
said,

1661
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,520
hey,
he's on top of this dude ground and

1662
01:17:04,521 --> 01:17:08,090
pounded them.
And on top of that he trained at a world

1663
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:13,091
class gym and he went to Aka and he
trained in American kickboxing

1664
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:15,260
association,
which is where that's tyron woodley,

1665
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:16,720
bro.
Don't get racist.

1666
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,410
Ami Dairy.
Just mixing up black man.

1667
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,960
Yeah.
You're mixing black people together.

1668
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,990
Jamie,
dare you google.

1669
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,360
It's Google.
It's not Jamie's Google,

1670
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:27,570
sorry.
Google's racists.

1671
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:30,020
But Herschel Walker when he was,
um,

1672
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,950
when he was training was training with
Cain Velasquez when Kane was the champ

1673
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,380
or if it came,
wasn't a champion,

1674
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:37,490
was one of the best and world.

1675
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,800
I don't,
I'm pretty sure he was a champ though.

1676
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,320
And he was training with Daniel Cormier,
I believe,

1677
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:44,660
was it there at the time?
Luke rockhold.

1678
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:47,300
Kyle Kingsbury.
I mean he's training with like,

1679
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:51,320
John Fitch was there.
He's trained with like legit worldclass

1680
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,510
mixed martial artists,
legit guys.

1681
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:59,020
And he was just fucking doing it like a
real pro athlete would do it.

1682
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,490
He wasn't doing it like,
Hey,

1683
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:04,250
I'm a celebrity former football player.
I'm just going to kind of,

1684
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,490
I'm going to take a fight like a Jose
can say call might.

1685
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,110
Do you know what I mean?
Like you ever see,

1686
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,000
I saw Jose psychos like celebrity boxing
matches and shit.

1687
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,081
It's like,
come on.

1688
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:13,760
It's like kind of,
he kind of barely did.

1689
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:18,560
Not Herschel Herschel like when at it
like a real professional martial artists

1690
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,650
and strike force had him fight a few
times.

1691
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,300
He did that Olympic bobsled stuff for
awhile to Africans.

1692
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,140
Right.
He just stays out too.

1693
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,060
But he's an unbelievable athlete,
right?

1694
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,070
Like he's,
he's a rare Bo Jackson type athletes.

1695
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:37,190
An outlier.
An outlier amongst professional

1696
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:38,024
outliers.
Yeah.

1697
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,030
So if you could take a Herschel Walker
and train him,

1698
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:45,050
like get him to a guy like Matt Hume who
trained mighty mouse and train him from

1699
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:48,590
the time he's a young man,
like 1514 years old.

1700
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,390
Fuck yeah,
he can do it.

1701
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,910
He could do it.
It's him back in the day.

1702
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:54,230
Yeah.
Handsome bastard.

1703
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:57,850
Rocking a strong,
strong gold chains getting bitches and

1704
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:01,610
bitches shown scars off Google Vogue.
I heard something like,

1705
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:06,400
I forgot how much,
how many pushups he does a day or

1706
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,390
something and saying,
yeah,

1707
01:19:07,391 --> 01:19:09,620
something saying that he still does it.
Yeah.

1708
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:14,720
Well I guess if you just keep doing it,
you know your body stays like that.

1709
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:17,330
It just requires unbelievable
discipline.

1710
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,970
Skip days.
He's also real weird man.

1711
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:25,580
He has um,
what's called trauma induced multiple

1712
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:27,860
personality disorder.
Oh Shit.

1713
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,800
Believe that's how he describes it.
But Trauma,

1714
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,470
I'm not sure they're mean.
They mean head trauma.

1715
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:38,710
I think it's more like childhood trauma,
but I'm sure head trauma doesn't help.

1716
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,550
Yeah,
because for sure there was some head

1717
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:44,181
trauma.
I mean,

1718
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,700
he was one of the greatest football
players of all time.

1719
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,331
Right.
I mean,

1720
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:48,200
think about,
I mean,

1721
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,720
if you made a list,
and I'm not a football fan,

1722
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:54,920
but if I know you and you never got
arrested and he never raped anybody,

1723
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,290
he must be pretty fucking awesome.
You know what I mean?

1724
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,890
Like if it wasn't some giant controversy
where you're involved in like a ray rice

1725
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:02,720
type situation and the murderer or
something like that.

1726
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,820
If it wasn't that,
and I hear about you,

1727
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,190
he was so good that the cowboys traded
him

1728
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:12,150
for a completely new football team that
won three superbowls.

1729
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,950
That's how good he was.
That's incredible.

1730
01:20:15,951 --> 01:20:17,730
It's incredible.
That's incredible.

1731
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:20,370
Like it was crazy when they were going
to trade horse or walk and it's like

1732
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:21,510
you're going to treat it Herschel
Walker,

1733
01:20:21,511 --> 01:20:25,110
but they got a brand new team and a set
of young players that ended up being

1734
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,270
like their,
their franchise.

1735
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:28,140
But he,
you know,

1736
01:20:28,141 --> 01:20:30,420
that's how good he was at.
Think you get all those players.

1737
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:31,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1738
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:33,000
It's,
it's always,

1739
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:38,060
to me as someone who analyzes athletics,
it's always so confusing and,

1740
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,280
and,
and interesting when I see someone who

1741
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:43,650
is just so much better than everybody
else,

1742
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:45,960
right?
Like how the fuck is he so much better?

1743
01:20:45,961 --> 01:20:47,110
Like what is it?
Right?

1744
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:49,860
This is,
this is a soccer thing.

1745
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,350
I'm going to tell you to stop the thing.
So,

1746
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:55,270
so you have the NBA,
right?

1747
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:56,390
Right.
And that's the,

1748
01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:01,290
that the NBA is the basketball league of
America and England,

1749
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:05,100
the top league,
the soccer version of Mbas called the

1750
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:08,220
premise ship,
right premiership premiere ship here.

1751
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,760
So there's this team named Lester.
Now the premiership works different than

1752
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:15,090
the NBA,
the NBA,

1753
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,170
all the teams stay the same every year
in soccer.

1754
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:21,420
The bottom three tickets,
20 teams in the league,

1755
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:26,421
and the bottom three would go down if
we'd go down to the league below at the

1756
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,630
end of the year.
Like if you have those least amount of

1757
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:34,890
points that the team three teams or at
least go down and there's a league below

1758
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:38,730
where the teams that first finished
first,

1759
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:43,731
second and third come up.
So that's important because lester

1760
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,920
is a team last year that almost got
relegated to the league below.

1761
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,740
So they almost got relegated.
It was like everybody's like this team

1762
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,110
is going down to the lower division,
so they,

1763
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,610
they want to maybe five or six games in
a row towards the end of the season and

1764
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:00,300
stayed up.

1765
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,300
Right.
But they're on a low budget team.

1766
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,050
They keep the same players and they had
to fire the coach for,

1767
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:10,680
cause his son did something and they got
this other guy named cloudy or rainy

1768
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:13,240
area,
an old Italian coach that used to coach

1769
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:15,780
and England would want at the top teams
but he never won anything.

1770
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:19,590
He only came second.
So then all year he's coaching Leicester

1771
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,730
and they're winning.
You know,

1772
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:25,110
they went in but at the beginning of
every soccer season you always the lower

1773
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:27,440
teams always when a little,
and then there's the,

1774
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:30,900
the the championship like stages of the
season,

1775
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:32,830
like the,
the second part of season,

1776
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:37,430
the third and like the final forthwith
team starts slipping or less.

1777
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,680
That doesn't slip.
They start with all the players are

1778
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:45,681
players from like cast off teams and
teams play is that no team ever wanted

1779
01:22:46,741 --> 01:22:47,574
to buy.

1780
01:22:47,790 --> 01:22:52,080
And then so then they get into like the
last seven,

1781
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:53,400
eight games in a season.
Everybody's like,

1782
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:54,780
Hey,
they're going to start losing.

1783
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:57,480
And the team behind them spurs is going
to catch them.

1784
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:01,320
But these motherfuckers like,
they,

1785
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,800
they gel together in a style that I've
never before.

1786
01:23:05,801 --> 01:23:08,590
Like they're very defensive.
And,

1787
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,330
but they will,
they'll attack you really if they have

1788
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:13,180
these two forwards.
Like if you kick the ball out to them,

1789
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,420
they're fast and then they'll score and
then they'll just shut the whole shit

1790
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:18,090
down.
Like you ain't going nowhere.

1791
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:20,830
Don't matter who the fuck you are.
You are not going nowhere.

1792
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:23,410
And on Thursday,
no,

1793
01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:26,170
on Monday,
this team,

1794
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,960
5,000 to one won the premiership.

1795
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,090
Whoa.
5,000 to one one.

1796
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,240
The fucking killer shit is fucking
crazy.

1797
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:39,830
All kinds of people had little bets that
they won like 50,000 on 10 bucks or 10

1798
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:44,360
pounds or euro or whatever,
but it costs bookmakers $15 million.

1799
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:47,510
Whoa.
Because like it's empowered.

1800
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,460
It's like the most impossible sports
story.

1801
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,050
Wow.
That's incredible.

1802
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,940
I love hearing shit like that.
But you,

1803
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:55,340
as you were talking,
I started getting discouraged because it

1804
01:23:55,341 --> 01:23:56,990
was like,
I dunno about the soccer project.

1805
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,700
Soccer project seems like it's going to
cost me a lot of paying attention.

1806
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,080
The top no,
you know what you do.

1807
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,880
Just just pick a team.
Well,

1808
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:09,500
I'm going to hit you a good team to my
mentor sort of brought you into mma.

1809
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,260
Do a bunch of fights.
Right?

1810
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:13,760
I want you to be my mentor and get me
into soccer.

1811
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,200
All right.
Cause it seems like if I'm going to

1812
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:17,930
follow some shit and you fall some shit,
the whole world follows,

1813
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:18,260
right?

1814
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:22,700
Like what is like everybody loves the
NFL in the United States and I'm sure

1815
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:25,450
it's awesome,
but if I'm going to fall,

1816
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,250
so I'm going to try to follow soccer.
I'm going to give it a shot right now.

1817
01:24:28,251 --> 01:24:31,640
Americans going crazy.
What the fuck is joe rubbing all this

1818
01:24:31,641 --> 01:24:36,641
goddamn bullshit black lives matter.
All of a sudden he's fucking following

1819
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:39,080
soccer.
Don't worry.

1820
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:41,990
There's black lives matter in soccer too
that there's too many countries are

1821
01:24:41,991 --> 01:24:43,950
racist as shit.
They,

1822
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:44,810
they,
they,

1823
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:48,900
they monkey chants to the black players
base.

1824
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,280
There's a lot of fascists and do when
they broadcast that shit,

1825
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,160
they bring it up.
They'll bring it up and they all like

1826
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:58,850
the ref was stopped the game.
Sometimes the players or stop the game,

1827
01:24:58,851 --> 01:25:03,170
they'll get those people out or they'll
ban that team and the next time they

1828
01:25:03,171 --> 01:25:04,520
have to play it like a real game.

1829
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:07,790
Like,
imagine the Lakers playing San Antonio

1830
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:12,320
Spurs in an empty stadium because they
was racist chance the last time the game

1831
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:14,810
was played at the lake.
And so they just say you have a black,

1832
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:18,060
you have a blackout game where none of
the fans can come was punished.

1833
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,090
They do shit like that.
Ooh,

1834
01:25:20,091 --> 01:25:22,520
I liked that.
I liked that idea.

1835
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:23,870
Blackout game.
Yeah.

1836
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:25,220
Fuck it.
Well then,

1837
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:26,150
but then people are like,
yeah,

1838
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:29,460
made them black.
Hope to gain like build up monkey shit.

1839
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:33,040
Everybody doesn't learn.
No.

1840
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,390
There's a lot of people that just want
to fucking flip over the board.

1841
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:36,740
Yeah.
They don't want to actually play the

1842
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:39,290
game.
They want to flip over the board or get

1843
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,460
some type of attention from it.
Liking it.

1844
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,980
Yeah.
Well it's like we were talking about

1845
01:25:42,981 --> 01:25:46,010
before with people don't feel like we're
all the same.

1846
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,010
You feel like those people over there
playing that game,

1847
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,510
those are just people,
man,

1848
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:54,470
it's their dream to do this and they
figured out how to do it.

1849
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:57,500
Like you can't be angry at them.
You should be inspired.

1850
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,230
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
You know,

1851
01:26:00,231 --> 01:26:02,750
like just being,
don't be a fucking asshole.

1852
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,100
But people also get so

1853
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,980
attached to one team versus the other.
That's another,

1854
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,690
yeah.
That's another thing that giant problem

1855
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,160
like sports cause it brings people
together.

1856
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:13,100
But then at that point it also separates
people too much.

1857
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,480
Oh yeah.
People have,

1858
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,810
there's riots regularly at games,
right.

1859
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:21,620
I mean if you looked at all the games
that are played between teams all over

1860
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:23,300
the world,
they have respect now.

1861
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:25,150
They fight in the town.
Yeah.

1862
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,510
Outside the stadium and they throw
bottles and shit from the bars and all

1863
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:30,860
that shit.
Or The town fountain.

1864
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:34,340
They fight over teams.
It's stupid.

1865
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:35,870
So fucking dumb.
It's dumb.

1866
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:36,770
It's dumb.
And it's,

1867
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:40,070
it's hard to believe that that's like a
common occurrence with football,

1868
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,200
with soccer,
with baseball.

1869
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,030
Right.
There's always like fights in the

1870
01:26:44,031 --> 01:26:47,330
parking lots with the Lakers.
I heard some terrible stories about some

1871
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:49,580
guy was wearing the wrong,
it was written wrong.

1872
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,600
Basketball team shirt and he's with his
son and these guys at the Lakers Games

1873
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:56,180
beat the fuck out of him.
Caled him knocked him out.

1874
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:59,940
His head bounced off.
The concrete was in a coma for weeks is

1875
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,450
there was this kid that happened.
I just beat the fuck out of him cause he

1876
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:04,670
had the wrong shirt.
I haven't to a dude at the dodgers game

1877
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:06,860
like a while ago when the mccourts he
used to own the team.

1878
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:09,200
Maybe that's what I'm talking about.
Is that what I'm talking about?

1879
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:10,310
Probably,
yeah.

1880
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:12,040
We're raiders.
The raiders,

1881
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,180
raiders,
raiders,

1882
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,980
Raider fans might knock you out too.
Why Raider fans?

1883
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:18,980
Comments like why is that a thing?
Because everybody was worried about the

1884
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:21,530
raiders came to Los Angeles that we
would have a bunch of concept.

1885
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,450
The game there was a big issue.

1886
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,350
It's just been their culture and
everybody just identified with it and

1887
01:27:26,351 --> 01:27:27,880
accepted it and said this is who we are.

1888
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,990
Is it because of rappers started taking
on the raider hats and started wearing

1889
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:33,450
raider hats in the 80s is that what it
was that what brought it around?

1890
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:37,270
Nah,
they were like that from,

1891
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,190
I dunno,
like it,

1892
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:44,580
it's like there's some teams in Italy
that the fans are just bass hall

1893
01:27:44,931 --> 01:27:47,860
fascists and then they,
that's,

1894
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:49,690
that's some of the culture.
I,

1895
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:50,440
I,
it's,

1896
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,630
it's hard to tell,
but the rate seemed like they've been

1897
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:55,720
through,
they've gone through all the routes to

1898
01:27:55,721 --> 01:27:57,970
have that type of fan base.
You know what I mean?

1899
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,910
Coming up in Oakland.
So even when they moved to La and

1900
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:04,690
rappers and started joining them and
then now they're back in Oakland,

1901
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,220
it's like,
I dunno,

1902
01:28:06,221 --> 01:28:08,500
it's just,
it's just the had the right temperature

1903
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:12,010
for four ignorance.
Well,

1904
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:13,120
amongst their,
some of their friends.

1905
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:17,480
I think there's something going on with
people to where we want to be united by

1906
01:28:17,481 --> 01:28:20,570
a common cause,
even if that common causes terrible.

1907
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,640
Yeah.
I think that's one of the things that's

1908
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:24,500
going on with trump.
Like what?

1909
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:26,870
And I see some of these people that are
like trump supporters.

1910
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:28,340
I'm like,
are you really?

1911
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:32,270
Or are you just in a gang?
Because it seems like a lot of them are

1912
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,550
in a cunt gang.
Like they're wearing sunglasses are

1913
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:36,080
being dicks.
They're walking up there,

1914
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:38,990
they're honking at these people that
have Bernie Sanders signs.

1915
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:42,260
If you've seen this,
and I forget what city it was in a where

1916
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:46,010
Bernie Sanders wound up winning and
trump was,

1917
01:28:46,011 --> 01:28:48,440
but was a big one that he won recently.
It was Indiana,

1918
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,920
Indiana.
So he's driving by and these,

1919
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:54,110
uh,
Mexican Americans are on one side of the

1920
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:56,840
road and they're fucking screaming at
this guy was in a,

1921
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,730
uh,
Donald Trump supporting truck and

1922
01:28:58,731 --> 01:29:00,650
they're screaming shit in hurling,
you know,

1923
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,250
insults back and forth at each other.

1924
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,960
And I'm watching this,
I'm going,

1925
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:05,550
what,
what are we seeing in here?

1926
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:09,750
Like we see in gangs form?
Cause it seems like they're not really

1927
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:13,080
talking about trump's policies.
They're not talking about his

1928
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,240
credentials,
they're not talking about his,

1929
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,870
his ability to lead and the way he
carries himself.

1930
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,170
It's almost like he's their guy.
Like he,

1931
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,970
they decide this is my guy I know was
changed their mind.

1932
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:25,620
Yeah.
This is the guy for Douche bags.

1933
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,870
And then,
you know,

1934
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:27,703
it's,
it's,

1935
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,140
it's discerning to people.
It's concerning because it makes you

1936
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:33,720
think like,
there's so many of us,

1937
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:36,510
so many of us that when something can
unite us,

1938
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,370
even if you're getting an ice in a bad
way,

1939
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,410
like the fucking heaven's gate cult,
well,

1940
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:43,790
they all cut their legs off and fucking
purple sneakers on.

1941
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:46,230
A lot of them did.
They got castrated themselves.

1942
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:48,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1943
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:50,550
It was part of what that guy wanted
people to do and he had,

1944
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,740
well,
he was gay and he didn't like being gay

1945
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:54,990
and he was trying to free himself from
his sexuality,

1946
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:59,610
but at least one or two of his other
like big people in that group also

1947
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:01,890
castrated themselves.
They couldn't just do the film,

1948
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:06,891
like the Yakuza does this wrong with it.
They do a joint at a time.

1949
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:09,630
Whenever you fuck up,
it's okay.

1950
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,880
Joined at a time chunk.
Do you remember that?

1951
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,700
Uh,
trump painting I showed you a few weeks

1952
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,680
ago that someone paying and with like a
small Dick,

1953
01:30:17,010 --> 01:30:20,280
the girl who painted it got attacked by
some trump supporters and like they

1954
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:23,320
punched in the face and yelled trump
2016 and random the,

1955
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,720
that's what she's claiming.
I mean,

1956
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:26,160
I don't know if it was on tape or
anything,

1957
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:27,840
but yeah.
Well you don't,

1958
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,390
oh my God.
Oh my God.

1959
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:33,150
It happened in here and I'll shiners.
They found her where she lived.

1960
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:36,510
It's based off of some facebook
information and found her and she came

1961
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,920
outside.
Jesus.

1962
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:39,420
That's what she's claiming though too.
I mean,

1963
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,920
it could be,
it might not be true,

1964
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:42,450
but I don't know.
I want to say,

1965
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:45,240
but even it probably is,
but it's hard to tell and it's

1966
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:47,160
unfortunate that you even have to say
that,

1967
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,260
but she does have tattoos on her face,

1968
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,220
you know?
I mean,

1969
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:55,070
who knows?
Um,

1970
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:59,070
I would like to believe would be more
happy if she made it up,

1971
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,180
but ultimately you got to kind of have
to believe someone like that.

1972
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,830
That's sad because that was a cool
painting.

1973
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,420
They shouldn't be so angry.
Why would they be so angry if trump was

1974
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:10,470
cool,
he'd buy that Shit.

1975
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,150
You know,
like your mom and joke.

1976
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:12,871
Yeah,
yeah,

1977
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:13,880
exactly.
Yeah.

1978
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:16,380
Did you see the recent thing that he has
on,

1979
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:16,950
on his,
uh,

1980
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,020
on his twitter?
I retweeted it yesterday.

1981
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:22,530
I was like eating a Taco bowl.
I love Mexicans.

1982
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,270
I know Hispanics,
Hispanics here.

1983
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,610
He's out of his fucking mind.
Like this is mad.

1984
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:28,440
He doesn't care.
He's flaunting it.

1985
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:31,650
Yeah.
It's almost like he's reaching out and

1986
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:36,651
tuning into the frequency of those,
those kind of guys like these and

1987
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,640
they're out there.
The thing is,

1988
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:43,410
I'm not opposed to someone like him
trying it out cause it happy.

1989
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:46,380
Cinco de Mayo Best Taco bowls are made
in trump tower grille.

1990
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,400
I love Hispanics.
Like what the fuck?

1991
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:55,170
I love Hispanics and he's got that evil
old school.

1992
01:31:55,200 --> 01:32:00,200
The man look and someone pointed out,
if you click on the picture that there's

1993
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:05,641
a photo of his ex wife,
Marla maples in a bikini in the lower

1994
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:08,440
corner of a magazine.
He's eating his fucking lunch on.

1995
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:13,330
I could wonder if he just eats like he
has the news clippings of his,

1996
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:17,350
his victims,
any piles it on his desk and that's how

1997
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:19,780
he eats.
Why else would you be eating on top of a

1998
01:32:19,781 --> 01:32:23,200
pile of papers?
Those are trophies like he's a trophy

1999
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:26,140
hunter instead of it's,
it's probably all people.

2000
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:31,141
He's burned in business deals and
facteau and smashed find competition.

2001
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,510
Well,
it's like his favorite stories of

2002
01:32:34,511 --> 01:32:35,770
people.
He's crushed,

2003
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,970
crushed you enemies have dumb driven
before you and hear the laminations up

2004
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:40,780
to women.

2005
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,690
That's what he's doing.
He's,

2006
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:46,810
he's eating dinner on a pile of skulls.
They're just print.

2007
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,820
What is bent films up?
What is,

2008
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:52,600
I'm fucking American Lapel Pin.
American flag.

2009
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:54,490
Lapel Pin.
It's kind of hilarious.

2010
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,690
I'm so torn because as a person who
thinks that the system that we have is

2011
01:32:58,691 --> 01:33:01,390
so fucking absurd and it needs to
change,

2012
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,490
this is one of the best ways to get it
to change.

2013
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,830
This is proof that you're right about
that.

2014
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:06,551
Yeah.
Well,

2015
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:10,360
it just shows you like you can't have a
popularity contest to run the

2016
01:33:10,361 --> 01:33:11,140
government.
Right?

2017
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,780
It should be more than that.
It shouldn't be this easy,

2018
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,360
and it shouldn't be an electoral
college.

2019
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:19,600
And delegates shouldn't be able to
decide who they're gonna vote for

2020
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,350
despite what the state votes for.
They shouldn't be super delegates.

2021
01:33:23,351 --> 01:33:27,610
All this is craziness.
We have an antiquated nonsensical system

2022
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:30,040
that was developed back when people
wrote with feathers.

2023
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,260
Well,
you'd have to really fucking think about

2024
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:35,320
that.
And for whatever dumb ass reason,

2025
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:38,950
we continue to use the same thing and
anytime anybody talks about reforming it

2026
01:33:38,951 --> 01:33:42,010
or changing it or updating it or coming
out with new models,

2027
01:33:42,011 --> 01:33:43,160
everybody freaks the fuck out.
Right?

2028
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:46,870
Like it's some sacred fucking scroll
that Jesus wrote.

2029
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,050
We found a clay pot,
they did everything right.

2030
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:51,640
Can we update this?
It's stupid as fuck.

2031
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,060
And the only reason why it's in place at
all like this electoral college and

2032
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:58,840
representative government is because you
couldn't talk directly to the leaders,

2033
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:00,250
right?
You couldn't talk to record.

2034
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:03,640
The government was too hard.
But we have all these new tools in place

2035
01:34:03,641 --> 01:34:06,730
and the idea that we're not using them,
like we're not using the internet,

2036
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:10,540
we're not using social media,
we're not using our instantaneous

2037
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:14,320
ability to communicate with each other
to find out what we actually want as as

2038
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:18,430
a collective group B.
The fact that that's an also we should

2039
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:19,480
agree with.

2040
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,200
There should be like parameters where
things can't get past.

2041
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,840
There should be like parameters where
we're all agree.

2042
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:29,230
Okay.
We cannot set aside any rules or or

2043
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:33,310
create any laws that intentionally
victimize certain segments of the

2044
01:34:33,311 --> 01:34:34,160
population.
Right.

2045
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:35,920
We all agree on that.
Yeah.

2046
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:38,050
Like we make a new constitution type
thing.

2047
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,820
We all agree on that.
Everyone agrees on that.

2048
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:40,271
Right?
Right.

2049
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:42,460
So when anything comes up,
when anything comes up,

2050
01:34:42,461 --> 01:34:45,640
whether it's about gay marriage or
whether it's about fucking whatever it

2051
01:34:45,641 --> 01:34:47,320
is,
you look at that and you go,

2052
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:50,770
okay,
is this a law that would victimize

2053
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,620
intentionally certain aspects of our
population?

2054
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,910
And if so,
we can't do it.

2055
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,890
Especially if they're not doing anything
to anybody else.

2056
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,100
Right.
We should have like rules like

2057
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,530
that.
Like we could update and make a real

2058
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:04,690
simple new constitution that would be
way better and we'd keep most of this

2059
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:07,340
shit and original most of the ideas of
freedom of speech,

2060
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:11,720
but update it to,
to represent what we're dealing with

2061
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:15,380
today.
Because what's free speeches today is

2062
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:17,690
very different than standing on a box

2063
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,220
and yelling into a courtyard without a
microphone.

2064
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:23,700
Cause that's what people were doing,
writing something down and not being

2065
01:35:23,701 --> 01:35:26,220
worried about being killed for it.
We all agree on that kind of stuff,

2066
01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:27,810
but we should figure out like

2067
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,490
how,
what,

2068
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:31,720
what are these?
How many of these laws are good?

2069
01:35:31,721 --> 01:35:33,520
How many does the laws make?
Any fucking sense?

2070
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,560
How many of those laws are just,
we just have,

2071
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:39,310
cause they've been around forever and he
examines them to just have some really

2072
01:35:39,311 --> 01:35:43,420
smart people making some really bad laws
on purpose.

2073
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,810
Like it,
like when you said talking about laws

2074
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,250
that does affect a certain segment,
not making laws that affect a certain

2075
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:54,610
segment of society.
Like the ones that we have now that

2076
01:35:54,611 --> 01:35:55,420
exist,
that does,

2077
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:58,180
that does hurt segments of society was
done on purpose,

2078
01:35:58,181 --> 01:36:01,630
but they've just done so slickly yeah.
It's just,

2079
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:07,620
it's just tough to get,
it's just some bad people in the wrong

2080
01:36:08,771 --> 01:36:09,760
places right now.

2081
01:36:10,150 --> 01:36:12,070
Yeah.
Well there's just too much money

2082
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:14,160
involved in making decisions.
Right?

2083
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:18,070
That's the big issue.
The big issue is there's all these

2084
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:23,280
gigantic groups of people with immense
amounts of money and they can gain more

2085
01:36:24,251 --> 01:36:27,790
money by influence people's decision
making that are in judgment or that are

2086
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:30,520
in positions of power.
And that's our real problem.

2087
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,610
A real problem is these giant groups of
people call them whenever you want.

2088
01:36:33,611 --> 01:36:35,950
Calm corporations column,
you know,

2089
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,750
whatever calm the banks,
call them,

2090
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:41,230
whatever it is.
They have the ability to influence the

2091
01:36:41,231 --> 01:36:45,160
decision making of the people that are
in power and whether it's through fear,

2092
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,050
intimidation,
manipulation,

2093
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,990
or straight up bribing.
There's a system that's in place.

2094
01:36:49,991 --> 01:36:53,860
It's very difficult to buck.
That's why I find it intriguing.

2095
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:57,010
If Donald Trump gets in,
I don't find it intriguing because I

2096
01:36:57,011 --> 01:37:01,690
like what he's saying and that I like is
this crazy character who's doing what I

2097
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:06,100
find intriguing is it doesn't seem to
fucking matter who the president is in

2098
01:37:06,101 --> 01:37:07,720
any way other than socially.

2099
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,460
Like socially,
it seems to matter.

2100
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:11,080
Like,
I think one of the best things about

2101
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:16,081
having Obama in office was that he was a
guy who was pretty liberal on most

2102
01:37:17,111 --> 01:37:21,190
things as opposed to like the eight
years that we had a deal with like scary

2103
01:37:21,191 --> 01:37:26,191
conservative Bush and Donald Rumsfeld
and John Ashcroft.

2104
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,610
They were scary people.
Like John Ashcroft covered the breast of

2105
01:37:30,611 --> 01:37:32,200
a statue.
Um,

2106
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:33,820
was it in the White House?
No,

2107
01:37:33,821 --> 01:37:35,420
not the White House.
Was it at the Pentagon?

2108
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,030
No,
Wah Wah.

2109
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:41,320
I forget what the statute was,
but they put a drape over the breasts of

2110
01:37:41,321 --> 01:37:43,180
a,
of a statue that had been exposed

2111
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:46,450
forever.
Ashcroft was a guy went after Tommy

2112
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:49,990
Chong and a,
because Tommy Chung's son was selling

2113
01:37:49,991 --> 01:37:54,340
bongs and so he went after Tommy Chong
saying that if you don't go to jail,

2114
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:57,300
I'm going to put your whole in jail.
So Tommy Chong had a wine up there was

2115
01:37:57,301 --> 01:38:01,500
all Ashcroft daily operation.
Nice dreams is what they were doing.

2116
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:05,130
It was a sting operation.
Justice Department covers partially nude

2117
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:08,250
statues because of Ashcroft.
He was a scary,

2118
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:09,084
scary guy.

2119
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,340
And these are the,
this is an example of the people wrong

2120
01:38:12,341 --> 01:38:15,940
people in the,
in the places where they shouldn't be

2121
01:38:15,941 --> 01:38:17,350
because they're out of control.

2122
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:21,570
Well,
it also heightened our suspicions of a

2123
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:26,070
conspiracy theories and hysteria in this
country because we saw like really

2124
01:38:26,071 --> 01:38:27,840
dangerous people that were running the
show.

2125
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:31,110
Like a guy like him,
his fucking dangerous like Rumsfeld to

2126
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,510
push aspartame.
Like that's how it,

2127
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,610
aspartame is legal.
It all came out of Rumsfeld.

2128
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:37,710
Like he's,
he was one of those directly responsible

2129
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,190
for making aspartame illegal and,
and avoiding all the information that

2130
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:43,650
pointed to the fact that it's probably
like super fucking bad.

2131
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:46,920
[inaudible] his this fucker that we
didn't do anything about it.

2132
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,170
No,
we just like wrote it out.

2133
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,750
Well we had to what?
We didn't know what we even could do

2134
01:38:52,751 --> 01:38:54,280
then.
It would be really interesting to see

2135
01:38:54,281 --> 01:38:57,070
what would happen if the Bush
administration was,

2136
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,520
uh,
in office today with the current ability

2137
01:39:00,521 --> 01:39:05,320
to communicate about things because
that's where it's really crazy from 2000

2138
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,210
to 2016 is a different world.
It's a different world and towards the

2139
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:13,690
end of the Bush administration became
more and more preposterous or people

2140
01:39:13,691 --> 01:39:16,900
like what in the fuck is going on to the
point where they went out stealing

2141
01:39:16,901 --> 01:39:18,790
money.
Remember when they went out and gas

2142
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:21,550
prices went up to like fucking five
bucks a gallon and everybody's like,

2143
01:39:21,551 --> 01:39:22,850
what the fuck is going on?
Right.

2144
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,140
It just felt like they went out stealing
money.

2145
01:39:26,141 --> 01:39:26,974
They just like,
look,

2146
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:30,160
before Obama comes into office,
we just going to suck as much money out

2147
01:39:30,161 --> 01:39:31,540
of this bitch as we can.
Well,

2148
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:33,550
let's just go hard,
you know,

2149
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:34,990
just ridiculous.

2150
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,530
What is money?
It's a good question.

2151
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:39,060
You know what?
His money and then,

2152
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:43,350
and then the money that we lost during
the recession,

2153
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,690
it wasn't burnt in a fire.
It wasn't like,

2154
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:49,260
like that money went somewhere,
so where the fuck is that money that

2155
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:51,030
they had to get more money to replace
that money.

2156
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:55,800
Like somebody has that money and
spending that money so it's not like it

2157
01:39:55,801 --> 01:39:57,840
went to a vacuum.
It will never come back.

2158
01:39:57,841 --> 01:40:02,841
It's like so w it's just so
they never teach you in school,

2159
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,670
so you don't know.
You don't think about it.

2160
01:40:05,671 --> 01:40:06,504
But where the fuck,

2161
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,330
well,
it's Voodoo.

2162
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:09,070
It's agreed upon Voodoo.
Yeah,

2163
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:11,410
it's agreed upon Voodoo.
I mean that's really what it is.

2164
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,630
We have all the same amount of stuff,
right?

2165
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:16,720
We have the same amount of minerals.
We have the same amount of raw materials

2166
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:20,470
or the same amount of people.
We have the same amount of land.

2167
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,260
We have all the same stuff,
but somehow there's no money.

2168
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,790
Right.
Whereas two months ago,

2169
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,620
everybody was rolling in dough.
Right.

2170
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,810
That's a sign of someone fucking,
yeah.

2171
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:29,741
He's like,
man,

2172
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:32,830
I don't know what happened.
We lost all the guy is crazy.

2173
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,920
Y'all take care and we're real.
Sorry.

2174
01:40:35,921 --> 01:40:38,140
Worked out this way.
We gotta get going.

2175
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,240
The recession was one of the craziest
things.

2176
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:43,780
Like there's like it came on new and
said what broke all the money's gone and

2177
01:40:43,781 --> 01:40:47,770
everybody just started acting broke.
Everybody was just like broken laying

2178
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:50,890
off people that able broke y'all and
it's like,

2179
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:53,110
and then they say it's,
things are getting better.

2180
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,040
Yeah.

2181
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,130
I could feel it getting better.
Getting better.

2182
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:01,900
I saw something that said that the
150,000 jobs were added to the economy,

2183
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:05,260
but unemployment stayed the same.
The same rate,

2184
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:09,190
but they added 150,000 jobs.
Like what is the rate base don?

2185
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,550
And then someone else told me that the
rate is not based on people stop

2186
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:15,310
looking.
The rate is only based on people claim

2187
01:41:15,311 --> 01:41:18,430
unemployment.
Like there's way more unemployment than

2188
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,030
that.
It's just good looking.

2189
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:25,420
Meanwhile,
easiest time to live our everybody

2190
01:41:25,421 --> 01:41:26,930
bitching about shit.
Like it's just,

2191
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:31,090
you can take some dude from the
depression and put them in America today

2192
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:33,240
and he'd be like,
what the fuck are you complaining about?

2193
01:41:33,241 --> 01:41:35,490
The no soup lines.
No one's starving it.

2194
01:41:35,491 --> 01:41:38,860
Look how big everybody is.
There would be like everybody in the

2195
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,240
depression days,
they were like 110 pounds.

2196
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,330
Dudes were tiny.
They'd be like seeing all these giant

2197
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:45,490
people,
Mcdonald's fucking falling out of their

2198
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:46,750
pockets,
put all the food.

2199
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:49,270
These fucking people app or you got to
do is wait by a garbage can.

2200
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,460
Yeah.
Poor people are fat today.

2201
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:55,690
And I'm crazy that it's true,
right?

2202
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,710
I mean back then you were starving.
You were terrified.

2203
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:02,710
People,
people like legitimately were worried

2204
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:04,540
about not having something to eat.
Right.

2205
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:08,500
I read this book about this guy named
Danny Mcgroarty.

2206
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,800
Danny mcgurty is like a,
a famous depression era pool hustler who

2207
01:42:14,171 --> 01:42:18,940
traveled across the country during like
the darkest days of the depression and

2208
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:22,900
would hustle from town to town and
gamble with guys and make money like

2209
01:42:22,901 --> 01:42:26,490
barely get by,
but was an alcoholic and just wrote,

2210
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:29,800
wrote a bunch of crazy stories about all
his times.

2211
01:42:29,801 --> 01:42:32,800
But there was times where he's begging
people for food.

2212
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,680
Like he was starving,
he just showed up at someone's house and

2213
01:42:35,681 --> 01:42:38,190
was begging them for food and the guy
comes out and gives him a bowl,

2214
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,310
sausages and shit.

2215
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:44,310
And you realize like there were times in
this country and by the way back then,

2216
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,480
no one was telling them everything's
going to be okay.

2217
01:42:46,481 --> 01:42:49,450
There was no oprah on TV.
There was no positive thing.

2218
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,790
You know,
there was no mind coaches,

2219
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,620
you know,
on late night infomercials,

2220
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:56,830
I'm going to give you the tools to
achieve your greatness.

2221
01:42:57,130 --> 01:42:59,950
It was none of that.
They were just almost animalistic

2222
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:03,040
traveling around in box cars.
And this,

2223
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:05,440
uh,
this book was really intense man because

2224
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:09,790
in this guy was talking like Kinda with
shame about how he had broken down a

2225
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:12,460
couple of times and was just asking
people for food.

2226
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:13,803
You know,
that's like,

2227
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:16,060
he goes,
I didn't have any other options.

2228
01:43:16,061 --> 01:43:18,640
I had to beg people for food.
And you realize like,

2229
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,480
yeah,
that's,

2230
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,510
that's a different time than today
because people are just out there doing

2231
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:23,110
that.

2232
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:23,841
Well,
you know,

2233
01:43:23,841 --> 01:43:26,950
this is way more charity today than ever
before.

2234
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:30,430
But I think also we understand that a
lot of the people that we're seeing that

2235
01:43:30,431 --> 01:43:32,530
around on the street corners and you
know,

2236
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,720
begging,
they have mental problems.

2237
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:37,310
Yeah.
I mean I'm sure they did back then too.

2238
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:42,820
But I think back then they were probably
more people who are like legitimately

2239
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:46,420
yeah.
And it didn't have the information,

2240
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:49,450
didn't understand like where are all the
jobs where it's going,

2241
01:43:49,451 --> 01:43:50,710
what's,
what's the economy?

2242
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:52,900
What does that,
you can google it you like.

2243
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:56,870
So if you were a 35 year old man who was
essentially illiterate and you were a

2244
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:59,420
labor your whole life and then also in
the jobs dried up,

2245
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:04,370
you had no grasp of why or how to fix it
or who was going to change it.

2246
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,360
So any politician has stood up and
started yelling things about immigrants

2247
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:10,190
or about,
I mean that's essentially what happened

2248
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:13,790
to Hitler.
Hitler rose to power because Germany was

2249
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:17,360
in a bad economic place and this guy
came along and said,

2250
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:18,950
these mother fuckers are ruining it for
us.

2251
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:19,784
And everybody was like,

2252
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,263
yeah,

2253
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,550
they all just jumped on.
He was so charismatic too.

2254
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:30,050
That's another scary thing about a guy
that's really charismatic that can unite

2255
01:44:30,051 --> 01:44:32,000
people for a cause,
even if it's

2256
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,070
bad one.
You know what's crazy about,

2257
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:36,290
I went to a,
what they call it,

2258
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:38,510
like a opera.
What's the thing that they have the

2259
01:44:38,511 --> 01:44:40,910
conductor.
So opera as an opera,

2260
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:43,200
music symphony,
the symphony and uh,

2261
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,780
the thing when they have doctor
[inaudible] saying,

2262
01:44:47,310 --> 01:44:48,710
yeah,
I'm hot orchestra,

2263
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,940
I'm hot box.
I don't even know if I'm saying that

2264
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:54,980
right.
Hot Box and drill hotboxing is real

2265
01:44:54,981 --> 01:44:56,800
y'all.
It's a lot of people don't believe.

2266
01:44:56,950 --> 01:45:01,950
And I was watching the conductor and uh,
it was a lot of Jewish people there and

2267
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:04,850
you know,
the conductor is doing this shit and if

2268
01:45:04,851 --> 01:45:08,780
you turn off the music is,
looks like you're watching Hitler.

2269
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:10,880
Really?
Yeah.

2270
01:45:10,881 --> 01:45:15,200
Because the conductor has the same
motions as Hitler,

2271
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:17,750
you know,
at a,

2272
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:20,210
at an opera,
like the way he's directing the band.

2273
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:21,710
Someone should make a split screen.
Yeah.

2274
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:24,260
Yeah.
Hitler was really animated,

2275
01:45:24,261 --> 01:45:24,891
right?
Yeah.

2276
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:29,630
He's really animated and moving this up.
It's been an interesting,

2277
01:45:29,631 --> 01:45:32,900
when you stop and think about that is
that we don't like that from a

2278
01:45:32,901 --> 01:45:34,700
president.
We don't like it.

2279
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:39,020
And it's one of the things that sank.
Howard Dean said Howard Dean got caught

2280
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:40,310
screaming,
remember that?

2281
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,180
Well,
and it was August.

2282
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:43,770
Ah,
yeah.

2283
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,020
And it was over.
It was over.

2284
01:45:45,021 --> 01:45:46,070
It was like a bad thing.

2285
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:48,820
Yeah.
We don't want anyone yelling.

2286
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:54,270
We don't want anyone is
when you see Hitler in those speeches,

2287
01:45:54,911 --> 01:45:59,430
that fucking dynamic way of talking,
that scares the shit out of everybody.

2288
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:01,280
That was,
that was good for back then.

2289
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,020
You could,
you could reach people back then cause

2290
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:05,210
people,
he's like expressing the anger.

2291
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:07,180
Yeah,
that everybody was feeling well

2292
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:11,110
in a way that's where people have a
legitimate beef without trump is

2293
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:15,280
behaving because although it might be
effective in getting people to pay

2294
01:46:15,281 --> 01:46:17,740
attention to them,
it's very dangerous in the doors.

2295
01:46:17,741 --> 01:46:20,320
It opens up as far as like getting
people to unite like,

2296
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,570
like the Shitty said.
And I was on the phone with the

2297
01:46:22,571 --> 01:46:26,950
president of Mexico and he said,
who you think is going to pay for that

2298
01:46:26,951 --> 01:46:27,850
wall?
And I said,

2299
01:46:27,851 --> 01:46:30,100
you're going to pay for it.
We're not going to pay for it.

2300
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:33,460
Oh yes you are.
And the fence just got 10 feet taller

2301
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:37,000
and the whole audience cheers.
Like that's like a f I'm paraphrasing,

2302
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,130
it's too fucked up a speech.
But the,

2303
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:41,920
the,
the idea that he would like yell that

2304
01:46:41,921 --> 01:46:43,930
out.
The fence just got taller.

2305
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,990
So you're going to make a fence taller
than it needs to be.

2306
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:50,310
So the,
you spite this person like is this,

2307
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,570
is this a normal behavior pattern for a
leader of the greatest army the world

2308
01:46:54,571 --> 01:46:55,600
has ever known?
Right.

2309
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:56,640
And seems crazy.
Yeah.

2310
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,513
Plus in a,
in a,

2311
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:01,390
especially in a world where we're
Mexicans who smuggle stuff across the

2312
01:47:01,391 --> 01:47:03,190
board of build tunnels.
Yeah.

2313
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:07,000
Including they snubbed muggles smuggle
people through on the tunnel.

2314
01:47:07,001 --> 01:47:10,360
So good luck building your wall.
Your wall will never affect anything.

2315
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,580
Yeah.
But they don't go over,

2316
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:16,090
they don't go over like they have all
these secret tunnels like every,

2317
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:20,110
every documentary or even Scicaro,
you know,

2318
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,750
it's just all tunnels.
And apparently that's real too.

2319
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,810
Yeah.
And your president is talking about

2320
01:47:25,811 --> 01:47:26,680
building a wall.
He,

2321
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:30,490
he sounds dumb as shit you're president
to be.

2322
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:32,680
How are you going to find all those
tunnels?

2323
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,220
Yeah.
Do you know how much square right

2324
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,520
miles you're dealing with and how deep
they go in?

2325
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:39,790
Especially when you look at like the
guys got out El Chapo,

2326
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,170
they went a mile in.

2327
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,400
Yeah.
A mile on the ground from my thing is

2328
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:45,690
underground.
Everything's on the ground.

2329
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:50,430
Like the construction noise that you'll
make it to build a wall,

2330
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,950
helps them to dig tunnels.
Yeah.

2331
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:56,530
The time the San at the same time,
you're just smothering the sound.

2332
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:00,300
They like the best tunnel builders ever.
Yeah.

2333
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,080
If you really think about this tunnel
builders in the game,

2334
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,930
who's built more secret tunnels in
Mexican drug dealers,

2335
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:09,390
fucking nobody about is this El Chapo is
tunnel.

2336
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,990
I was looking at that,
but I just typed in generic tunnel for

2337
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:14,790
drug tunnels.
Yeah,

2338
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:15,900
there's a ton of them,
man.

2339
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:17,790
They just keep digging them,
but it's,

2340
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,450
it's so fascinating that there's this
border,

2341
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:26,340
we have this line and if you get to dig
a hole and pop out on the other side,

2342
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,650
[inaudible] sell drugs pop out on the
other side.

2343
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,160
It's Hilarious,
but it's so weird.

2344
01:48:32,161 --> 01:48:35,340
Like what a weird fucking thing that
we've done.

2345
01:48:35,341 --> 01:48:40,341
We've made lines on the ground of the
earth that you can't cross and there's

2346
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:43,710
no difference between the people on
either side other than the fact that

2347
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,380
they speak different languages,
but they're just people and there's a

2348
01:48:46,381 --> 01:48:49,620
lot of each people on the other side.
My fucking parents live in Mexico,

2349
01:48:49,621 --> 01:48:50,060
man.

2350
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:50,893
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2351
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,120
Oh yeah.
And then he did tell me that

2352
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,290
Mexicans live in America.
Yeah.

2353
01:48:54,291 --> 01:48:55,970
You know,
a lot of my friends are from Mac.

2354
01:48:55,971 --> 01:48:58,160
I know a lot of people from Mexico a
lot.

2355
01:48:58,370 --> 01:49:02,540
Like I know I probably know 20 or 30
people who were born in Mexico.

2356
01:49:02,541 --> 01:49:03,980
So we integrated,
right?

2357
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:08,420
Obviously there's no difference between
us other than than culture and language.

2358
01:49:08,421 --> 01:49:11,060
Right.
But we still have this crazy line,

2359
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,890
like you can't come over and you guys
are fucked.

2360
01:49:12,891 --> 01:49:13,790
Your listen,
listen,

2361
01:49:13,791 --> 01:49:14,570
listen,
listen.

2362
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:17,030
You were born into a worse system than
us.

2363
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:19,550
We can't let you over here.
I know you want to get better,

2364
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:20,780
but fuck off.
Fuck you.

2365
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:22,550
No.
If you get better over on this side,

2366
01:49:22,551 --> 01:49:23,810
if you're born at Phoenix,
oh,

2367
01:49:23,811 --> 01:49:26,720
you missed it by a mile.
If you landed in Phoenix,

2368
01:49:26,721 --> 01:49:28,430
if you came out of your mother's Pussy
and Phoenix,

2369
01:49:28,431 --> 01:49:29,750
your goal,
dude,

2370
01:49:29,751 --> 01:49:31,760
didn't you get fucking Medicare and all
that good shit.

2371
01:49:31,761 --> 01:49:35,450
You in the obamacare.
But if you're born a mile the other way,

2372
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:36,490
flux Ville.
Yeah.

2373
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,080
What?
That's so crazy.

2374
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:43,640
That doesn't make like logically I
understand there's a limited amount of

2375
01:49:43,641 --> 01:49:45,770
resources.
I understand there's gotta be some

2376
01:49:45,771 --> 01:49:47,770
pragmatic decisions.
Very unfortunate,

2377
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:50,370
but we'll really have to do is help Max
go get back on their feet up,

2378
01:49:50,371 --> 01:49:50,530
up,
up,

2379
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:51,363
up.

2380
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,900
But really what it should be is it
should be no Mexico.

2381
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,060
There should be no United States.
It should be no Canada.

2382
01:49:58,090 --> 01:49:59,520
There should be the planet earth.
Right?

2383
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:03,190
That's really what it should be.
If these ideas are fucking stupid,

2384
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,720
they're like soccer clubs.

2385
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,170
Whoa,
whoa.

2386
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,170
We're like little soccer.
Well,

2387
01:50:07,171 --> 01:50:10,980
those things make sense.
No,

2388
01:50:10,981 --> 01:50:13,130
but I'm 1000% with you.
It's like it's all,

2389
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:16,530
there's enough resources in the world.
If everybody shares him,

2390
01:50:16,531 --> 01:50:17,470
wait.
Right.

2391
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,280
For everything to be fine.
All right.

2392
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:22,520
Well both you and I are a direct result
of immigration,

2393
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:25,730
right?
My parents were the first generation

2394
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:28,790
they came from,
or they were born in America,

2395
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:30,260
but their parents,
my grandparents.

2396
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:31,460
Is that how it works?
What's the first?

2397
01:50:31,461 --> 01:50:32,570
I'm third generation.
Right?

2398
01:50:32,571 --> 01:50:35,510
Because my parents were second
generation because my grandparents were

2399
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:37,940
first generation Americans when they
moved to America.

2400
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,550
They weren't born in America.
How's it work?

2401
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,960
No.
So my parents were born here is the

2402
01:50:42,961 --> 01:50:43,940
first,
first generation.

2403
01:50:43,941 --> 01:50:46,280
So I'm second generation,
so I'm second generation.

2404
01:50:46,281 --> 01:50:48,590
So just two generations ago,
you know,

2405
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:52,250
I'm all of my family in Ireland.
All of them,

2406
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:52,940
right?
Everyone,

2407
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:55,970
my grandfather on my father's side came
from Ireland.

2408
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:57,260
My father,
uh,

2409
01:50:57,261 --> 01:50:59,960
or my grandmother on my father's side
came from Italy.

2410
01:51:00,230 --> 01:51:02,810
My grandmother and my grandfather on my
mother's side came from Italy.

2411
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:05,480
Everybody came from another country all
during the same time period.

2412
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:08,030
So they were all like immigrants that
came over here.

2413
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:11,930
And this is the,
this is why the United States is so

2414
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:14,210
interesting because there's so many
different kinds of people here,

2415
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:16,910
but there's just too many of us since
two.

2416
01:51:16,911 --> 01:51:19,300
Awesome.
This experiment was too bad ass

2417
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,660
Mexico.
I don't know what happened in Mexico.

2418
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,480
You know what went wrong?
They got cut off.

2419
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,940
Is that what it has?
I know people don't want to share,

2420
01:51:28,941 --> 01:51:30,680
man.
People just want mine.

2421
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:32,440
Yeah.
Oh Man.

2422
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:37,780
I wonder how much of what Mexico is
right now is a direct result of the

2423
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:42,110
Spanish invasions.
I wonder when something happens,

2424
01:51:42,111 --> 01:51:46,610
like during like the Aztec days and
there's some crazy takeover and that

2425
01:51:46,611 --> 01:51:50,820
Spanish language gets introduced to s to
Central America and,

2426
01:51:50,821 --> 01:51:52,340
and,
and even North America.

2427
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:54,560
I mean,
most of Camp California will we call

2428
01:51:54,561 --> 01:51:59,561
California used to be Mexico.
So I wonder like what impact that had

2429
01:51:59,721 --> 01:52:03,530
because when you find out the atrocities
that were committed with,

2430
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:04,550
with the,
uh,

2431
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:07,250
the Aztecs and the,
um,

2432
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:10,460
the invaders and the introduction of
horse backs,

2433
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,680
I mean,
people riding horseback,

2434
01:52:12,710 --> 01:52:15,680
that was all during Cortez,
right?

2435
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,760
And the people before him was all the
Europeans that had brought over horses.

2436
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:23,990
Just think about all that chaos that
happened and they changed the language

2437
01:52:23,991 --> 01:52:25,550
of the country.
I mean,

2438
01:52:25,551 --> 01:52:30,551
the biggest maintain Mexico was
essentially native Americans.

2439
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,460
That's why like the Mayans,
they really resemble like a lot of

2440
01:52:34,461 --> 01:52:35,570
native Americans.
What we,

2441
01:52:35,571 --> 01:52:38,150
what we think of as native Americans.
And when you look at,

2442
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:41,390
there's like a bunch of different styles
of Mexican,

2443
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:44,780
like their appearance.
You've got like your Canelo Alvarez,

2444
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,280
you've got like,
who's real,

2445
01:52:46,281 --> 01:52:47,750
he's an outlier.
He's a rare one.

2446
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:51,950
But you've got like Oscar de la Hoya.
He's that like handsome Spaniard version

2447
01:52:51,951 --> 01:52:53,030
of Mexico.
Right.

2448
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:58,510
And then you got like real brown looking
dudes that look like native Americans

2449
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:04,540
that are also Mexican that are like
really dark and you go with that guy

2450
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:06,350
looks like a mirror.
I'm American Indian.

2451
01:53:06,351 --> 01:53:08,840
What we consider a native American
because this is like,

2452
01:53:08,841 --> 01:53:09,860
that's what it is.

2453
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:12,920
It's,
they were introduced like the Spanish

2454
01:53:12,921 --> 01:53:17,921
language and all these different people
from Europe interbred with all the

2455
01:53:18,021 --> 01:53:21,770
people that are here and they created,
what is Mexico hilarious picture.

2456
01:53:21,771 --> 01:53:25,010
Cause it's like who drew that?
He didn't even look like that.

2457
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:28,520
Like those,
those are hot instagram trick chicks.

2458
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:32,800
Who drew this version of that?
Those supposed to,

2459
01:53:32,801 --> 01:53:35,000
some of them are supposed to be men.
Oh for real?

2460
01:53:35,001 --> 01:53:36,560
Yeah.
They're just covering their decks.

2461
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:40,730
Some of them are supposed to be men.
See that one's got his a transgender.

2462
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,900
What's going on in this photo?
Well I think these people,

2463
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:46,700
like native Americans,
you stay,

2464
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:48,600
keep their hair long.
I mean that's what it's depicting.

2465
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:51,470
You know,
when you think of native Americans and

2466
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:53,210
you think of like cowboys versus
Indians,

2467
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,330
they all have long hair.
Right?

2468
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:57,200
Well,
I think that that's what these people

2469
01:53:57,201 --> 01:54:02,201
were encountering back then and I mean
it was a fucking genocide man.

2470
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:05,690
I mean it was essentially just a
slaughter fest.

2471
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,750
They killed so many fucking people.
They stole gold.

2472
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:11,570
They came over on horseback.
They were considered gods.

2473
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:16,070
Nobody knew what it was to ride a horse.
He never imagined a guy comes over for

2474
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:16,904
the first time.
They,

2475
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:19,580
they land in a boat,
they get off the boat and they have

2476
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:22,640
horses and swords and they start fucking
shopping everybody up.

2477
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:25,310
They probably had horses,
right,

2478
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:27,230
and had seen horses or maybe,
no,

2479
01:54:27,231 --> 01:54:29,840
no they didn't.
They didn't even have American horses

2480
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:32,960
were introduced.
Horses were introduced to North American

2481
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:34,550
by the European there.
What?

2482
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:37,790
By the Europeans?
There was horses in North America

2483
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:40,250
millions of years ago,
but they went extinct.

2484
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:42,680
I'm pretty sure I'm almost positive of
this.

2485
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:46,820
If there was a type of horse that lived
like in the pleistocene or something

2486
01:54:46,821 --> 01:54:49,370
like that and they went,
they went extinct.

2487
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,330
But when it,
yeah,

2488
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:51,163
find that out.

2489
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:55,280
That's an interesting when is when we're
horses first introduced to North

2490
01:54:55,281 --> 01:54:58,010
America,
but horses being wild,

2491
01:54:58,011 --> 01:55:02,720
like wild horses is a,
a relatively recent phenomenon like over

2492
01:55:02,721 --> 01:55:04,340
the last few hundred years.
Gosh,

2493
01:55:04,341 --> 01:55:06,940
American with Columbus in 1493 there you
go.

2494
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:12,490
Is second voice voyage to America,
Spanish horses representing e Taleb

2495
01:55:13,610 --> 01:55:14,120
Bowel.
Hmm.

2496
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:17,240
Kabbalists Cabela's,
Cabela's or brought back to North

2497
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:19,640
America first and the Virgin Islands.
And in 15,

2498
01:55:19,641 --> 01:55:22,340
19,
they were reintroduced to the con on the

2499
01:55:22,341 --> 01:55:24,200
continent in Monterrey,
Mexico.

2500
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:26,930
Uh,
from where they radiated through the

2501
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:28,760
American great plains.
Hmm.

2502
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:29,893
Yeah.
See Man,

2503
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:32,690
I feel bad for the horse.
He's just being on a boat that long.

2504
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:34,071
Yeah,
no shit.

2505
01:55:34,071 --> 01:55:35,490
Right.
I wonder how many of them survived.

2506
01:55:35,491 --> 01:55:36,680
Yeah,
that's a long ass trip.

2507
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:40,040
I wonder how they did that because that
was months and months at sea you had to

2508
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:43,100
have the right amount of food.
People getting scurvy and shit.

2509
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:46,440
I bet it's probably easier to bring hay
than it is to bring anything.

2510
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:50,590
You know when you think about it,
hey you can stack it up nice and dense,

2511
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:54,930
but horses eat a lot of fucking,
hey you have to clean up after them and

2512
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:59,340
they on the over the place that makes
the boat trip even worse than I imagined

2513
01:55:59,341 --> 01:56:01,830
it in the first place because boss is on
board,

2514
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,340
they're going to get off the boat and
they haven't run or walk through it all

2515
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:07,440
and months.
Their legs are going to be all fucked

2516
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:08,274
up.
Yeah.

2517
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:11,190
I was just thinking,
I was looking for a picture but at a

2518
01:56:11,191 --> 01:56:13,470
representation of it,
cause they're in Columbus where I'm

2519
01:56:13,471 --> 01:56:14,250
from,
there's a,

2520
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:16,800
they have a replica of the Santa Maria,
which is one of those boats.

2521
01:56:17,010 --> 01:56:21,810
It's not very big at all.
20 or 30 people could like comfortably

2522
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:25,500
just be on it for a long period of time.
So I don't know where the hell you would

2523
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:27,000
put animals to.
Where is it?

2524
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,770
It's on the river.
Whoa.

2525
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,020
Like grand right in downtown Columbus.
How big is it?

2526
01:56:31,021 --> 01:56:32,310
Like if you had to guess,
pretty big.

2527
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:36,460
How many feet long?
60 50 60 that's it.

2528
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,320
I,
I,

2529
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,380
I'm trying to guess in my head.
I don't want to yards.

2530
01:56:39,890 --> 01:56:41,970
It's not that big.
I'll pull a picture of it.

2531
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:43,710
That's insane.
That's 20 yards.

2532
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:45,990
That's crazy.
That's like what you shoot when you're

2533
01:56:45,991 --> 01:56:47,940
practicing with a boat.
A tune it in.

2534
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:50,880
That's great for you.
Start backing up those little things.

2535
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:52,200
Change the world.
Wow.

2536
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:56,700
So much like if the scale of those
things to how much they changed the

2537
01:56:56,701 --> 01:56:58,620
world,
it's fucking crazy.

2538
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:00,020
That's nothing.
That's nothing.

2539
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:00,933
I do think that is

2540
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:03,100
nothing that's small as fuck.
Dude,

2541
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,250
that's so interesting.
Ian,

2542
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,790
what you,
the way you just explained that,

2543
01:57:06,791 --> 01:57:08,920
that's such a,
that's like a nuclear three of those,

2544
01:57:08,950 --> 01:57:12,100
three of those fucking a man.
Boy,

2545
01:57:12,101 --> 01:57:14,800
you just nailed it.
You just nailed it.

2546
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:18,850
Those things change the world.
Three of those fucking things change.

2547
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,390
I mean change everything,
but those three were like the seed that

2548
01:57:22,391 --> 01:57:27,391
planted North America.
They came over hand explosion and it

2549
01:57:27,610 --> 01:57:31,750
became the empire state building and the
fucking Seattle Tower.

2550
01:57:31,751 --> 01:57:33,930
What's that?
Tower evil.

2551
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,120
The space needle.
The space needle brought lots of murder.

2552
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:38,200
Well,
diseases,

2553
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:39,910
lots of disease.
Genocide,

2554
01:57:39,911 --> 01:57:40,721
rape.
Yeah.

2555
01:57:40,721 --> 01:57:43,270
All sorts of groovy shit.
It's crazy.

2556
01:57:43,271 --> 01:57:45,450
It's crazy when you think about phones
and I,

2557
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:47,550
well eventually eventually turns into
iphone.

2558
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:49,180
Yeah.
I wonder if my phones would have existed

2559
01:57:49,181 --> 01:57:50,920
if we just stayed in Europe.
Probably not.

2560
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:51,970
See that's what a think.

2561
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,050
One of the things that I think is really
important about like having an asshole

2562
01:57:56,290 --> 01:58:01,000
as a president for a brief brief for us,
we have a chance to rethink this whole

2563
01:58:01,001 --> 01:58:04,360
thing is I think,
I think we have to get outraged before

2564
01:58:04,361 --> 01:58:07,590
things change and we have to realize
that the system is just fucking retard.

2565
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:09,730
And maybe he does too.
Maybe look,

2566
01:58:09,850 --> 01:58:11,710
let's,
let's give him the benefit of the doubt,

2567
01:58:11,711 --> 01:58:12,860
right?
You're talking about a guy,

2568
01:58:12,861 --> 01:58:15,880
he's obviously incredibly wealthy and
obviously incredibly successful.

2569
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:21,240
Maybe he is sick of it all himself.
Maybe he is one of the guys who's

2570
01:58:21,251 --> 01:58:22,540
actually contributed.
I mean,

2571
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:23,351
look,
he,

2572
01:58:23,351 --> 01:58:26,080
that fucking guy paid hillary to come to
his wedding.

2573
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,030
Okay.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

2574
01:58:28,031 --> 01:58:29,980
It's all it took and she showed up.
I mean,

2575
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,960
this is a guy that's been deep,
deep,

2576
01:58:31,961 --> 01:58:33,400
deep in the system,
handed out money,

2577
01:58:33,401 --> 01:58:35,470
these motherfuckers.
And then finally he went,

2578
01:58:35,471 --> 01:58:36,340
fuck you.

2579
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,750
He went,
fuck you.

2580
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:40,000
I'm going to run this thing.
And they're like,

2581
01:58:40,001 --> 01:58:42,130
there's no way.
There's way Donald Trump,

2582
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:44,110
we've looked at the numbers.
Impossible.

2583
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,330
Everybody else dropped out.
They've all given up.

2584
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:48,050
I mean,
Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton a

2585
01:58:48,051 --> 01:58:48,940
neck and neck,
right?

2586
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:51,400
Except for in delicates where she is,
uh,

2587
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,800
quite a bit above him,
but she still doesn't have enough to

2588
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:55,920
win.
Like it's close enough to,

2589
01:58:55,921 --> 01:58:57,190
it's like,
it's weird.

2590
01:58:57,370 --> 01:59:00,760
It's like weirdly close where you'll
have to look at it and you need people.

2591
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:02,790
Bernie doesn't stand a chance.
Uh,

2592
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,190
mathematically he's already eliminated.
But then people say,

2593
01:59:06,191 --> 01:59:08,020
well,
what if Hillary gets indited for one of

2594
01:59:08,021 --> 01:59:09,710
the two criminal investigations?
Sir,

2595
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:13,840
she's currently involved with,
what if people find out about this

2596
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:15,940
fucking email thing,
but it's even worse than we thought.

2597
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,730
What if people find out this?
What if they find out that what if

2598
01:59:18,731 --> 01:59:19,390
there's some dirt?

2599
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:20,780
What if this isn't this?
It's,

2600
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:23,020
it's fucking exhausting.
It's exhausting.

2601
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,310
But meanwhile,
this fucking trump guy is sitting pretty

2602
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:32,430
just waiting for whoever gets most beat
up by this fucking campaign on the

2603
01:59:34,211 --> 01:59:36,100
democratic side.
They're beating the shit out of each

2604
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:38,020
other,
so they're going to come through it.

2605
01:59:38,021 --> 01:59:40,120
Whoever's going to come through,
it's going to be all fucked up.

2606
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:42,140
It's going to have,
it's like having a,

2607
01:59:42,141 --> 01:59:45,460
an mma tournament.
One guy wins by a quick knockout in the

2608
01:59:45,461 --> 01:59:46,250
first round,
the other way.

2609
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:51,250
It goes through a three round war.
Trump just ran through someone Anderson

2610
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:56,610
Silva Style and so now,
so now like Hillary and fucking Bernie

2611
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:58,890
Sanders,
like micky ward at Touro Goddy,

2612
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:03,130
he's beating the shit out of each other
and we have to wait to see who emerges.

2613
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:05,500
Why don't screen strange,
strange time.

2614
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:08,300
It's crazy man.
Like,

2615
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:10,340
like you said it and I've been thinking
it.

2616
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,800
You said it last week,
I think when it was at the show about

2617
02:00:12,801 --> 02:00:16,550
you're more afraid of crews then.
Then he scares the shit out of me and

2618
02:00:16,551 --> 02:00:17,570
I'm glad he's out.
Yeah,

2619
02:00:17,571 --> 02:00:18,210
I'm glad he,
he,

2620
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:21,410
he would have been the worst choice.
And trump,

2621
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:26,770
I have a feeling if he could fool people
and do this just to win that he might

2622
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:31,730
actually just be doing it just to win.
That's when you become a different

2623
02:00:31,731 --> 02:00:32,580
person.
That's our hope.

2624
02:00:33,470 --> 02:00:35,900
That's our hope.
But if he did become a different person,

2625
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:39,350
I wouldn't even be surprised cause it's,
it's Kinda almost typical him.

2626
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,490
Right.
You know what I mean?

2627
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:41,651
Yeah.
I don't know,

2628
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:43,330
man.
I don't have any interaction with them.

2629
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:46,300
But I do know that Jeff Ross work with
them on the roast and he said he was

2630
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:49,720
very nice and very reasonable.
And one of the things that Jeff Ross

2631
02:00:49,721 --> 02:00:50,620
said is,
hey,

2632
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:53,440
when when the camera turns to you and
you're not laughing,

2633
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:56,800
it kind of looks bad.
Like you should just enjoy it.

2634
02:00:57,070 --> 02:01:00,040
Like don't be upset that these guys are
making funny it just laugh along.

2635
02:01:00,041 --> 02:01:01,750
It'd be great for you.
And he said,

2636
02:01:01,751 --> 02:01:02,561
trump thought about it.
He goes,

2637
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:03,280
you know what?
You're right.

2638
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,980
You're right.
Like he's not an asshole all the time.

2639
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:09,340
Character is definitely their character.
It's like a wrestling character.

2640
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:11,310
Wwe style.
Yeah,

2641
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:12,144
exactly.
Golly,

2642
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,260
it's a wwe character.
I just,

2643
02:01:14,261 --> 02:01:15,640
I don't know him,
you know,

2644
02:01:15,641 --> 02:01:18,730
I don't buy any of this.
I don't buy Ryan seacrest's.

2645
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:20,800
I don't know that guy.
I don't know Donald Trump.

2646
02:01:20,860 --> 02:01:22,810
I mean,
I would like to get high with Ryan

2647
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:24,730
seacrest.
Find what's really going on in there.

2648
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,800
I don't know.
Tell him to come on.

2649
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,130
What you see what's in,
what's in his hand at cell phone.

2650
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:31,630
Oh,
he's going to shave his head.

2651
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,910
Is that what it is?
The shaver.

2652
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:38,950
But Vince Mcmahon areas as if it's like
someone's gonna be like,

2653
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:43,460
are they shaved?
Vince Mcmahon's head space was more

2654
02:01:43,461 --> 02:01:45,890
fearful than somebody's about to get
beheaded by Isis.

2655
02:01:46,010 --> 02:01:48,890
Is that Bobby Lashley?
That's Bobby Lashley,

2656
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:50,600
right.
Bobby Lashley is,

2657
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:55,601
I'm fighting MMA now.
He has to fight and like these weird

2658
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:58,010
Indian casinos,
so they don't test them.

2659
02:01:58,380 --> 02:01:59,040
No.
Shit.

2660
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:03,690
That's hilarious.
So there's a rumor going around Joe.

2661
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:06,220
Uh,
I saw something the other day that a

2662
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:09,690
floyd mayweather,
his team has been trademarking like

2663
02:02:09,691 --> 02:02:12,810
floyd 50 or something like that,
saying that like he might be coming out

2664
02:02:12,811 --> 02:02:14,010
of retirement.
Right.

2665
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:19,070
I heard about this rumor hit today that
has potential opponent might be connor

2666
02:02:19,351 --> 02:02:21,420
mcgregor.
Oh my God.

2667
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:25,050
Had a boxing match at t mobile arena in
Vegas.

2668
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:27,920
Oh my God.
Um,

2669
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:30,720
I think conor mcgregor is a very good
mma fighter.

2670
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:34,890
I think if conor mcgregor and floyd
mayweather fight in mma,

2671
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,730
conor mcgregor will fuck him up.
He will fuck him up.

2672
02:02:38,910 --> 02:02:40,890
Floyd.
We'll get the shit kicked out of him.

2673
02:02:40,891 --> 02:02:45,000
He will kick his fucking body senseless.
He will kick his legs.

2674
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,390
Floyd will be debilitated inside of one
round,

2675
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:50,520
100%.
And if connor decides to take him to the

2676
02:02:50,521 --> 02:02:53,100
ground,
I guarantee you floyd mayweather,

2677
02:02:53,430 --> 02:02:56,400
conner's no worldclass wrestler,
he's no ncaa champion.

2678
02:02:56,401 --> 02:03:00,050
He's an Olympic gold medalist.
Guarantee you floyd mayweather cannot

2679
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:02,730
stop him from taking them to the ground.
And if connor gets him to the ground,

2680
02:03:02,731 --> 02:03:06,690
he's going to mount them and cave his
fucking face in or choke him or break

2681
02:03:06,691 --> 02:03:11,310
his arm or do whatever he wants to do.
But in a boxing match,

2682
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:16,870
I can't imagine highlight world were
floyd mayweather.

2683
02:03:16,870 --> 02:03:19,440
It doesn't fuck him up in a boxing
match.

2684
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:24,060
I think floyd mayweather is arguably the
greatest boxer of all time.

2685
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:27,150
If you look at his accomplishments,
who he's been able to beat,

2686
02:03:27,151 --> 02:03:31,680
how he shuts everyone's offense down.
He's a more boring version of what a lot

2687
02:03:31,681 --> 02:03:35,550
of Bernard Hopkins does,
and he does it in a more slick,

2688
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:40,640
skillful way with rapid reflexes,
and he relies on speed and movement and

2689
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:41,970
just a deep,
deep,

2690
02:03:41,971 --> 02:03:45,360
deep understanding of boxing.
He's just so much better.

2691
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,390
And if people don't know,
if you think you're really good and then

2692
02:03:48,391 --> 02:03:50,100
you get in there and you box a guy like
that,

2693
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,380
he will fucking expose the shit out of
you.

2694
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:55,320
He will expose the shit out of you.
It's just,

2695
02:03:55,321 --> 02:03:56,730
it's a different animal,
man.

2696
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,391
I mean,
who knows,

2697
02:03:57,391 --> 02:03:58,230
man?
Look,

2698
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:01,680
one of the things we know about connor
is he has a ridiculous belief in himself

2699
02:04:01,681 --> 02:04:03,210
and he has unbelievable power.

2700
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:08,340
One of the things we know about floyd is
he's 39 I think is that old.

2701
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:12,810
Yeah.
So when a guy turns 39 you never know.

2702
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:13,321
I mean,
there's a,

2703
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:17,040
for every guy like Bernard Hopkins,
there's a bunch of guys who the wheels

2704
02:04:17,041 --> 02:04:19,980
just fall off and all of a sudden they
can't take a punch anymore and they

2705
02:04:19,981 --> 02:04:21,960
can't fight anymore.
They don't move good anymore.

2706
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:27,480
But I can't imagine a world where he's
not light years past connor with boxing

2707
02:04:27,481 --> 02:04:28,314
skill,
I could just,

2708
02:04:28,350 --> 02:04:30,540
it's there nothing.
These guys are thinking about money.

2709
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,280
Oh yeah.
More than,

2710
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:35,340
more than like a result.
The money will be giant.

2711
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:37,830
They'd probably,
and they probably out a way,

2712
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:39,840
we're both of them don't lose or
something like that.

2713
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:42,360
I don't think they're going to do that.
I think they're going to really fight.

2714
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:43,321
Hmm.
I don't,

2715
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:45,150
I don't,
I can't imagine that in either one of

2716
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:48,720
them would be willing to negotiate with
the other one while thinking that they

2717
02:04:48,721 --> 02:04:49,950
might get double crossed.

2718
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:51,510
You know like,
Nah,

2719
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:54,600
I don't buy that because remember what
Victor Ortiz and mayweather,

2720
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:59,370
when Victor Ortiz was doing some dirty
shit to mayweather and Victor Ortiz

2721
02:04:59,371 --> 02:05:02,580
apologized and floyd mayweather just
step to him and sucker punched him in

2722
02:05:02,581 --> 02:05:03,660
the face.
And Klm.

2723
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,910
Do you remember that?
Watch this here.

2724
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:07,170
Pull.
Pull that up because it's kind of

2725
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:12,171
hilarious cause like there's no deals
being made and not in this world.

2726
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:16,920
This is the world of competitive.
I'm only saying that because why should

2727
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:21,060
the MMA guy watch this?
Victoria [inaudible] gets warned because

2728
02:05:21,061 --> 02:05:25,590
he kept like headbutting and like
getting really dirty and so he goes to

2729
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,910
touch hands.
Look at this.

2730
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,260
Boom Bang.
He goes to touch hands like Yo,

2731
02:05:31,261 --> 02:05:31,951
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2732
02:05:31,951 --> 02:05:33,630
I'm sorry.
Bing Bang.

2733
02:05:33,870 --> 02:05:36,960
Ah,
I mean it's hilarious.

2734
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:40,890
That's the real world of boxing.
Mayweather just knocked him the fuck

2735
02:05:40,891 --> 02:05:42,180
out.
He just,

2736
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:45,540
he thought they were going to like touch
gloves and be buddies and then get back

2737
02:05:45,541 --> 02:05:48,000
after it and maybe where there's like
bitch pop.

2738
02:05:48,030 --> 02:05:50,430
He hit him with a left hook.
They never saw a common straight right

2739
02:05:50,431 --> 02:05:51,720
hand.
That's a wrap.

2740
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:57,320
And I just think that the skill level in
straight boxing that floyd mayweather

2741
02:05:58,351 --> 02:06:00,720
has,
it's very difficult to understand why

2742
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:01,560
you're just looking at,
look,

2743
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:04,530
he's touching them here.
Look at this being bitch.

2744
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:09,660
He even had a bitch lips or is looking
at the rest face like bitch even it's

2745
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:12,480
like even said bitch Bam.
Yeah,

2746
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,300
look at this bank June.
Hey,

2747
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:16,710
what is he doing?
Boom,

2748
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:20,880
that's a wrap.
And that was a wrap for Victoria teases

2749
02:06:20,881 --> 02:06:22,050
career.
Really essentially.

2750
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,840
Is there,
is there another fight to bring floyd

2751
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:27,110
out of retirement that is short
Pacquiao.

2752
02:06:27,111 --> 02:06:29,470
Pacquiao was the big fight,
especially since packet.

2753
02:06:29,471 --> 02:06:33,600
I'll just beat Timothy Bradley if
Pacquiao decided to,

2754
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:34,680
you know,
really ramp it up.

2755
02:06:34,681 --> 02:06:37,920
I think he still can get a lot of people
excited about them.

2756
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,510
You know,
he had a shoulder injury,

2757
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,550
he had a shoulder repaired,
but obviously it was great.

2758
02:06:41,551 --> 02:06:43,580
And the Bradley fight,
he looked awesome and the Bradley fight,

2759
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:45,690
he's a beast.
I think that could be a real fight,

2760
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:49,620
but I also think that floyd mayweather
versus connor would generate insane

2761
02:06:49,621 --> 02:06:51,360
amounts of money.
Insane.

2762
02:06:51,361 --> 02:06:55,470
But just be fun to watch the 24 seven
they would make great tv.

2763
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:56,760
Who knows?
Man,

2764
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:59,220
who fucking knows.
I don't think so though.

2765
02:06:59,221 --> 02:07:02,310
I don't think he can.
I would imagine unless the UFC is

2766
02:07:02,311 --> 02:07:04,510
involved at have to let them out of
contract.

2767
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:06,750
Exactly.
And I don't,

2768
02:07:06,751 --> 02:07:09,810
I can't imagine that they would be
willing to do that and I can't imagine

2769
02:07:09,811 --> 02:07:12,000
that they would let him fight.
Floyd Mayweather,

2770
02:07:12,360 --> 02:07:16,320
like Dana and Lorenzo and frank are
serious boxing fanatics.

2771
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:19,440
They know a lot about boxing.
Could there be a cross promotion?

2772
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:20,190
Oh Man.

2773
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:21,500
I said I'm waiting.
Like have the fight on it.

2774
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,910
You can get a piece could happen,
but I wouldn't throw a fighter to the

2775
02:07:25,911 --> 02:07:27,750
lions like that.
Like I just,

2776
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,420
I just don't look,
I could be wrong.

2777
02:07:30,910 --> 02:07:32,610
I'm,
I'm no fucking

2778
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:36,400
clairvoyant.
I don't really know what's going to

2779
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:39,850
happen in a fight.
But I think mayweather is a ghost.

2780
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:42,940
I think you go to punch where mayweather
is and it may,

2781
02:07:42,941 --> 02:07:46,810
well there's not there anymore and he's
popping you a jabs and slowly getting

2782
02:07:46,811 --> 02:07:49,660
you frustrated and setting traps.
And the next thing you know,

2783
02:07:49,661 --> 02:07:52,000
he's uncorking shots on you.
Who the fuck knows?

2784
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:54,430
But who knows?
Maybe conor Mcgregor,

2785
02:07:54,431 --> 02:07:57,580
if you went to straight boxing,
would be even more successful than he

2786
02:07:57,581 --> 02:08:01,660
has as an MMA fighter because his best
knockouts where with punches,

2787
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:04,450
I mean his left hand is a fucking
piston.

2788
02:08:04,451 --> 02:08:07,480
He has a nasty lefthand,
he fucks a lot of guys up.

2789
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:12,630
But is he fucking guys up that are just
not at the level of boxing as say a

2790
02:08:12,641 --> 02:08:16,840
Timothy Bradley or uh,
my Donna or you know,

2791
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:20,370
wineman male marcus,
the guys who use though and the,

2792
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:24,730
and the and they're distracted by
training other types of things.

2793
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:25,481
Yes.
Right,

2794
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:25,920
right,
right.

2795
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,000
For the ground game for Muay Thai,
it's,

2796
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,370
it's like it's,
it's,

2797
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:35,080
it's uh,
maybe whether it's just focus on hands.

2798
02:08:35,110 --> 02:08:36,310
Yes,
exactly.

2799
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:39,040
And he's a master at it.
Like a straight up master.

2800
02:08:39,540 --> 02:08:41,320
I'm in an MMA fight.
It wouldn't even be close.

2801
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:42,640
Right.
It would not even be close.

2802
02:08:42,641 --> 02:08:45,110
Connor would kick his body apart before
it may,

2803
02:08:45,111 --> 02:08:48,220
whether they even got close to him.
I think his understanding of the

2804
02:08:48,221 --> 02:08:49,500
distance,
there's no way maybe,

2805
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,010
maybe they would understand the
distance.

2806
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,530
Connor would hit him with spinning back
kick to the body,

2807
02:08:53,531 --> 02:08:55,810
may with a crumble.
Connor would need them in the body in

2808
02:08:55,811 --> 02:08:56,290
the clinch.

2809
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:57,670
It would be awful.
He would kill him.

2810
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:01,420
He would kill them in an MMA fight.
He's much bigger to kind of really

2811
02:09:01,421 --> 02:09:03,850
struggles to get done in one 45.
He's a big fuck,

2812
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:06,280
you know?
So I just think in the MMA fight it

2813
02:09:06,281 --> 02:09:09,670
would be disastrous for me whether,
but it could be equally disastrous in a

2814
02:09:09,671 --> 02:09:11,210
boxing fight.
Have comical way.

2815
02:09:11,211 --> 02:09:13,840
Yeah.
The only thing that makes me think that

2816
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:17,740
maybe connor could survive as he's a
fucking super dangerous punch or just

2817
02:09:17,741 --> 02:09:20,130
like my Donna was or my don is over
though.

2818
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,180
Even though my dad is a worldclass
boxer,

2819
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:23,590
my don is the guy who beat,
uh,

2820
02:09:23,591 --> 02:09:26,860
Adrian broner.
My Donna's a serious vicious p power

2821
02:09:26,861 --> 02:09:30,610
puncher and he's real aggressive and
wild makes me think like,

2822
02:09:30,611 --> 02:09:33,450
maybe like if,
if he,

2823
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:36,450
if connor went straight into boxing,
maybe he could have been a worldclass

2824
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:36,940
boxer.

2825
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:38,680
Maybe could have been,
you know,

2826
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:42,190
some,
some real ricky Hatton type challenger

2827
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,370
entirely possible.
But even ricky Hatton got fucked up.

2828
02:09:45,371 --> 02:09:49,300
I may weatherman when Ricky Hatton was
ricky Hatton when he was in his prime.

2829
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:51,850
I don't think rick and he hadn't,
should have quit after that fight.

2830
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:53,860
A man.
He likes to do blow.

2831
02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:56,110
Yeah,
I'm wanting to get fat.

2832
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:58,570
It was having a party defendant duplo
well,

2833
02:09:58,571 --> 02:09:59,021
he,
uh,

2834
02:09:59,021 --> 02:10:02,170
he did have one comeback fight and just
didn't like how he performed and I think

2835
02:10:02,171 --> 02:10:04,960
he actually wound up winning,
but he decided that it was over,

2836
02:10:05,050 --> 02:10:08,260
that he lost it.
I think I'm got to beat out of him.

2837
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:10,990
It could be that,
but it also could be,

2838
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:12,760
we'll pack you.
I'll really fucked him up.

2839
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:14,250
Pankey out.
Hurt him bad.

2840
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:16,070
We're pack out,
knocked him out and he knocked them

2841
02:10:16,071 --> 02:10:17,050
dead.
What?

2842
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:18,010
Mayweather.
Fucked him up.

2843
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,960
But when packout fucked him up,
it was like,

2844
02:10:19,961 --> 02:10:22,280
whoa.
That was a bad knock out man.

2845
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:26,140
He's got those gigantic tree trunk legs
those spring.

2846
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,350
He's got a calf.
His calf muscles are like four by four

2847
02:10:29,351 --> 02:10:30,460
springs.
He just,

2848
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:34,670
he just jumps at you and uncorked left
hand on your chin.

2849
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:37,820
And when he did that to Ricky Hatton,
he just went to sleep.

2850
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:41,200
Yeah.
That's like the second I British like

2851
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:44,950
hope that that happened to like cleaning
up in Europe and then they came out

2852
02:10:44,951 --> 02:10:47,830
here.
We have a prince knows any Mohamad

2853
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:48,730
Mohamad yeah,
yeah.

2854
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:54,950
I seen my Hammad got exposed by um,
the fuck is his name?

2855
02:10:56,980 --> 02:11:01,670
A guy who was in a series of wars with
a,

2856
02:11:01,870 --> 02:11:03,150
it wasn't pernell.
Whitaker was,

2857
02:11:03,151 --> 02:11:03,381
no,
no,

2858
02:11:03,381 --> 02:11:04,030
no,
no.

2859
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,230
Who is it?
Mexican gentlemen.

2860
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:06,390
Marcos Berrera.
Oh,

2861
02:11:06,410 --> 02:11:08,000
okay.
Marcos Antonio.

2862
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:09,820
Berrera yeah,
yeah.

2863
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,410
That's what it was.
And uh,

2864
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:14,560
he exposed him,
he showed that fundamental boxing at the

2865
02:11:14,561 --> 02:11:18,730
highest level is going to beat that
crazy jumping in wild shit.

2866
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:21,400
Like wild shit didn't work on the top
level guys.

2867
02:11:21,910 --> 02:11:23,680
And so he got kind of exposed in that
fight.

2868
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:25,413
But

2869
02:11:25,830 --> 02:11:30,180
you know what man,
boxing is so it's so specialized and the

2870
02:11:30,181 --> 02:11:32,940
guys that are really good and the
really,

2871
02:11:32,941 --> 02:11:34,410
really good guys,
it's,

2872
02:11:34,590 --> 02:11:36,180
they're underrated.
How good they are.

2873
02:11:36,181 --> 02:11:38,670
And like as a person who's watching it
from the outside,

2874
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:41,250
you don't understand how good a guy like
mayweather is.

2875
02:11:41,251 --> 02:11:44,670
I think unless you're there with him
while he's doing his stuff.

2876
02:11:45,150 --> 02:11:48,450
Like I bet if a guy's boxing him,
I bet that's when you get a real

2877
02:11:48,451 --> 02:11:48,720
understood

2878
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:51,270
standing of how good he is.
And he's disciplined too.

2879
02:11:51,271 --> 02:11:53,790
He's more disciplined.
Any acts on the outside like,

2880
02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:56,850
like uh,
when I used to hang out with Kevin Hart

2881
02:11:56,851 --> 02:11:59,200
a little bit,
he used to hang out with mayweather and

2882
02:11:59,210 --> 02:12:00,970
said they'd be partying in the middle of
the pause.

2883
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:03,600
I gotta go and it's like three in the
morning.

2884
02:12:03,601 --> 02:12:05,940
I've got to go to road work and they
just go run.

2885
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:08,230
Yeah.
And bring the car and then run it.

2886
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:09,290
And jeans.
Yeah.

2887
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:11,040
Just says,
just follow me.

2888
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,590
And he goes running.
Yeah.

2889
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:16,830
Well he's in tremendous shape always.
But apparently now he's a,

2890
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:18,610
he's a little heavy.
I'm,

2891
02:12:18,611 --> 02:12:19,390
who knows,
man.

2892
02:12:19,390 --> 02:12:21,700
I mean if enough money gets thrown in
the UFC is direction,

2893
02:12:21,701 --> 02:12:23,620
the UFC might look at it this way.
Here's a,

2894
02:12:23,650 --> 02:12:26,380
here's a pragmatic way of looking at it.
We can still make a lot of money with

2895
02:12:26,381 --> 02:12:27,320
conor Mcgregor,
right?

2896
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:30,130
Still make a lot of money with conor
mcgregor in an MMA fight.

2897
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:33,340
We can still make a lot of money if
connor rematches,

2898
02:12:33,341 --> 02:12:34,660
Nate Diaz,
which uh,

2899
02:12:34,661 --> 02:12:36,610
I hear they're trying to make happen as
well.

2900
02:12:36,611 --> 02:12:41,611
That's what the rumor been.
But is he going to beat the best guys in

2901
02:12:41,861 --> 02:12:45,190
the world now after Nate Diaz boxed them
up and choked him out?

2902
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:49,090
Like are is that going to happen again?
And if that does happen again,

2903
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:52,450
how much will that deflate his value on
the open market?

2904
02:12:52,451 --> 02:12:55,840
If you're playing a game of chess now
looking at as terms of a guys career as

2905
02:12:55,841 --> 02:12:58,840
an MMA fighter,
but looking at it as a game of financial

2906
02:12:58,841 --> 02:13:00,880
chess,
how do you move your piece?

2907
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:02,081
You might say,
look,

2908
02:13:02,081 --> 02:13:03,690
the amount of money that you can make
with the main,

2909
02:13:03,691 --> 02:13:06,520
where their fight is off the charts,
right?

2910
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:09,730
Right off the charts.
So you're talking about like a 3 million

2911
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,550
paper view by or something crazy.
So you do that,

2912
02:13:12,940 --> 02:13:16,420
you move that up and you take that
chance and he gets boxed up by

2913
02:13:16,421 --> 02:13:17,630
mayweather.
And,

2914
02:13:17,631 --> 02:13:19,960
uh,
maybe survives if he survives and loses

2915
02:13:19,961 --> 02:13:22,270
it fucking decision.
And he goes back and he says,

2916
02:13:22,271 --> 02:13:23,670
uh,
all respect to mayweather,

2917
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:25,840
going back to mma,
you know,

2918
02:13:25,841 --> 02:13:27,400
it just,
I didn't understand his hands.

2919
02:13:27,401 --> 02:13:30,190
Now it's a learning experience,
you know,

2920
02:13:30,191 --> 02:13:32,460
and he has this great conference.
If he could survive,

2921
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,030
he's not diminished too much and they,
whether it's not like a murderous

2922
02:13:36,031 --> 02:13:38,580
puncher,
he's not like a Canelo Alvarez or

2923
02:13:38,581 --> 02:13:41,910
Gennady Golovkin Lufkin Golovkin is a
bad fight for him.

2924
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:45,510
Someone like that's a bad fight for him,
a murderous puncher because most likely

2925
02:13:45,511 --> 02:13:46,344
they're going to take them out.

2926
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:48,480
But May,
whether it's very possible he's going to

2927
02:13:48,481 --> 02:13:51,000
get to the decision.
39 is perfect age.

2928
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:53,070
It's good angel it.
Look,

2929
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:54,690
if I was in his corner,
I would say,

2930
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,070
look,
this can be done.

2931
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,380
This can be done.
And it feels like Mcgregor wants to get

2932
02:13:58,381 --> 02:14:03,381
paid because he quit threatened to quit
because he wants to get paid more money.

2933
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:04,850
No,
no,

2934
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:07,470
no.
He really didn't threaten to quit.

2935
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:10,230
He didn't want to do as he did want to
do any of the press conferences.

2936
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:11,070
So he,
he made,

2937
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:13,260
he called the UFC bluff.
He said,

2938
02:14:13,261 --> 02:14:15,570
you're not going to remove me from the
car and I'm fucking conor Mcgregor.

2939
02:14:15,571 --> 02:14:17,010
I call the shots.
And the UFC is like,

2940
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:18,180
oh,
okay,

2941
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:21,120
well we're going to cancel your fight so
take care.

2942
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:22,161
And you know,
they,

2943
02:14:22,161 --> 02:14:24,810
they had like a long break where they
weren't even talking back and forth to

2944
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:25,830
each other and Dana was like,
nope,

2945
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:26,723
I haven't talked to him.

2946
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:28,330
He's not off I zone in the fight
anymore.

2947
02:14:28,331 --> 02:14:30,780
He wasn't the press conference.
We're just going to move on with the UFC

2948
02:14:30,781 --> 02:14:34,530
200 and you know,
UFC 200 is about the sport in their

2949
02:14:34,531 --> 02:14:35,720
eyes.
It's all about sport.

2950
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:37,380
It's,
well it's also,

2951
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:40,800
it's an honor to be on that card.
It's a historical car.

2952
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:45,510
Just like UFC 100 was a historical card.
UFC 200 is an absolutely historical card

2953
02:14:45,690 --> 02:14:48,600
and at one guy can't hold it up.
It doesn't matter if you conor mcgregor

2954
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:51,720
or Ronda Rousey or it doesn't matter
what kind of a superstar you are.

2955
02:14:51,740 --> 02:14:54,330
You can't hold up the UFC 200 cars and
you have to do the press.

2956
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,400
So that was their position.
They took a stand.

2957
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:59,470
And so now he's in this position where
he's got to figure out what the fuck is

2958
02:14:59,530 --> 02:15:01,050
gonna do.
He's gonna Fight Mayweather.

2959
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:02,400
If that,
I don't know.

2960
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,630
He can,
he,

2961
02:15:03,631 --> 02:15:05,700
I believe he would need the UFC.
His blessing.

2962
02:15:05,701 --> 02:15:07,590
I don't see another one.
I don't see a world.

2963
02:15:07,591 --> 02:15:10,590
I can't imagine a world in which he
doesn't need the UFC is blessing.

2964
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:13,080
What's Rousey's playing?
What's she doing now?

2965
02:15:13,470 --> 02:15:14,910
You'd have to talk to her.
Um,

2966
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:16,690
kind of a thing.
I think the,

2967
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,590
the type of champion that she was as
good as she was,

2968
02:15:19,591 --> 02:15:21,460
as much as she dominated,
um,

2969
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:23,460
I can't imagine that she's not going to
do it again.

2970
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,200
Right.
I can't imagine that one fight.

2971
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:29,160
We'll set her back that much,
but she also has massive amounts of

2972
02:15:29,161 --> 02:15:32,430
distractions.
She has a huge career in movies.

2973
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:37,320
She's doing giant movies.
She's wanted for commercials and this

2974
02:15:37,321 --> 02:15:38,700
and that,
and she's got two book.

2975
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,520
Oh,
fuck yeah,

2976
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,530
man.
She's a superstar.

2977
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:45,060
She's a superstar.
But does it haunt her that a girl that

2978
02:15:45,061 --> 02:15:47,850
she beat twice,
Misha tate has the belt,

2979
02:15:47,851 --> 02:15:50,530
but he's the champion right now and was
talking shit about her yesterday.

2980
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:55,530
Um,
I think,

2981
02:15:56,280 --> 02:16:00,390
I think Rhonda obviously had a bad fight
with Holly Holm.

2982
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:04,500
Holly Holm obviously had a great fight
with Ronda and I think Holly Holm has a

2983
02:16:04,501 --> 02:16:07,980
great style for Rhonda if Rhonda fights
that way.

2984
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:11,580
But if Rhonda doesn't fight that way,
if she fights the way that meesha

2985
02:16:11,581 --> 02:16:13,920
fought,
she stays on the outside and she fights

2986
02:16:13,921 --> 02:16:18,120
a little more strategic and she uses
more movement and she incorporates a

2987
02:16:18,121 --> 02:16:20,850
bunch of different types of takedowns.
Ron does a champion,

2988
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:26,000
she's an elite athlete and she's one of
the best expressions of judo we've ever

2989
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:30,520
seen in all of MMA.
Her judo is spectacular if she focuses

2990
02:16:30,521 --> 02:16:32,770
on that aspect,
on the grappling aspect,

2991
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:37,771
that judo aspect take downs more than
trying to outstand up Holly Holm,

2992
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:40,060
which I,
it looked like she did in the first

2993
02:16:40,061 --> 02:16:41,920
place,
but in her defense she said she got

2994
02:16:41,921 --> 02:16:44,440
rocked by a big punch early in the first
fight.

2995
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:47,590
So it's very difficult to say how much
that that had an effect on her cause she

2996
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:52,090
did get car wracked by holly like early
in the fight so she could have been out

2997
02:16:52,091 --> 02:16:54,730
of it and not able to stick to our game
plan,

2998
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:57,400
whatever it might've been.
It's entirely possible when you get

2999
02:16:57,401 --> 02:17:00,130
cracked like that everything goes out
the window.

3000
02:17:00,131 --> 02:17:03,040
You never know.
So it's normally only person knows is

3001
02:17:03,041 --> 02:17:04,810
the person who got hit.
You know,

3002
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:08,110
cause if we see it like Aldo,
when Aldo fight mcgregor you just got

3003
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:10,900
knocked out because is obvious.
We saw in front of us his body stopped

3004
02:17:10,901 --> 02:17:14,740
working but Rhonda could got real close
to that and we didn't even see it.

3005
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,300
She could a blang she dropped one in on
her and Rhonda could have been just out

3006
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:21,850
of it like drunk not knowing what she's
doing.

3007
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:26,320
Like literally looking at life through
like a hole in a shoe box that his

3008
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:27,840
entire po entirely possible.

3009
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:32,110
So if they fight again and Rhonda
managers to not get hit like that,

3010
02:17:32,111 --> 02:17:37,111
she fights a little bit more strategic.
I could see Rhonda absolutely making a

3011
02:17:37,601 --> 02:17:39,790
go at the title again.
Absolutely.

3012
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,320
Absolutely.
Being a champion.

3013
02:17:41,321 --> 02:17:42,580
Again,
she's one of the best in the world,

3014
02:17:42,610 --> 02:17:46,240
no doubt about it,
but it's a matter of what does she want?

3015
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:50,410
What does she want to do with her time?
What d one dedicate herself the way she

3016
02:17:50,411 --> 02:17:52,390
dedicated herself when she was tearing
up the division.

3017
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:55,420
It's,
it's a very difficult thing to maintain

3018
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:58,840
and especially difficult when you have
the massive amount of distractions that

3019
02:17:58,841 --> 02:18:02,410
she has so much Hollywood in her life,
so much Hollywood and money,

3020
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:03,850
so much money,
so much.

3021
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:05,740
You know,
you want to take care of your life and

3022
02:18:05,741 --> 02:18:08,350
you've got that.
I think she's the sets the thing too.

3023
02:18:08,351 --> 02:18:10,120
I also think she's taken care of man.

3024
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:12,880
I mean Ron has got to be worth millions
of dollars.

3025
02:18:12,881 --> 02:18:15,640
Yeah.
I mean if she just lives fairly frugally

3026
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:17,410
and she does,
she's good.

3027
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:19,480
I mean,
she's not buying gold underwear or

3028
02:18:19,481 --> 02:18:20,680
anything like that,
you know what I'm saying?

3029
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:22,720
If she's,
she's pretty set.

3030
02:18:22,721 --> 02:18:25,090
If she wants to just be set and be a
normal person.

3031
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:28,180
But I got to imagine that fire probably
still burns.

3032
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:29,830
I just,
I can't imagine it doesn't,

3033
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:32,380
right.
I would think that the intelligent way

3034
02:18:32,381 --> 02:18:34,600
to do it though would be to have a warm
up fight.

3035
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:36,430
That's what I would think,
you know,

3036
02:18:36,431 --> 02:18:38,920
and people would say,
oh she should just go right into the

3037
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:41,240
title fight.
Cause what if she loses it?

3038
02:18:41,290 --> 02:18:43,990
Boxing is a reason why boxing has warm
up fights.

3039
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:46,300
They're smart.
If they were there already figured it

3040
02:18:46,301 --> 02:18:47,021
out.
We're up.

3041
02:18:47,021 --> 02:18:48,700
Fights are good for two things.
First of all,

3042
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:49,540
the name warm up.

3043
02:18:49,540 --> 02:18:52,180
It really does warm me up.
It gets you back to competition.

3044
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:54,850
And we saw with John Jones when Jon
Jones recently fought,

3045
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:56,800
um,
when he fought Osp,

3046
02:18:56,801 --> 02:19:00,370
we supposed to fight Daniel cormier and
he felt himself and he said it and he

3047
02:19:00,371 --> 02:19:02,200
just couldn't pull the trigger.
He was kind of fun,

3048
02:19:02,201 --> 02:19:04,270
kind of rusty in there.
It's because he had been out for a long

3049
02:19:04,271 --> 02:19:07,960
time,
more than a year with a guy that's

3050
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:10,650
trying to get back at it.
You know,

3051
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:13,570
I think it was critical for him to have
a tough fight against a guy like

3052
02:19:13,670 --> 02:19:16,810
[inaudible] who,
who's a world class number six ranked

3053
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,740
light heavyweight,
get done under the belt as a warmup

3054
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:21,190
fight,
then fight Daniel cormier and then we're

3055
02:19:21,191 --> 02:19:23,140
going to see what's up.
And I think for Rhonda,

3056
02:19:23,141 --> 02:19:24,850
it's probably a good idea for her to do
that.

3057
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:29,851
To fight like a top 10 contender,
a tough girl like a Jessica I or someone

3058
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:30,500
like that.

3059
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,680
Give that girl a chance.
Give Jessica or Raquel Pennington,

3060
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:35,870
give her a chance,
give her a chance to prove what she can

3061
02:19:35,871 --> 02:19:40,310
do and maybe even upset Rhonda,
give Rhonda a chance to get her feet

3062
02:19:40,311 --> 02:19:41,510
wet,
get back to competition,

3063
02:19:41,511 --> 02:19:44,420
but not be fighting for the title.
So who knows?

3064
02:19:44,570 --> 02:19:46,040
Who knows what she's going to decide to
do,

3065
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:47,120
but she's,
again,

3066
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:49,100
she's said no matter what she wants to
do,

3067
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:50,660
it's a matter of what she wants to do
with their legacy.

3068
02:19:50,661 --> 02:19:52,610
Right.
It's not a matter of like a financial

3069
02:19:52,611 --> 02:19:55,910
decision.
I don't think at this point in kind of

3070
02:19:55,911 --> 02:19:57,380
like,
like,

3071
02:19:57,460 --> 02:19:59,570
like I'm thinking,
I'm con if I'm caught,

3072
02:19:59,571 --> 02:20:02,690
I'm like,
I got to work on my ground game hundred

3073
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:04,190
percent.
It is he doing it?

3074
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:05,031
I'm sure.
Yeah.

3075
02:20:05,031 --> 02:20:07,910
There's pictures of him.
He has a brown belt apparently down he's

3076
02:20:07,911 --> 02:20:09,160
training the,
the,

3077
02:20:09,161 --> 02:20:10,790
the real issue is,
um,

3078
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:14,660
uh,
it's a long road to develop those kinds

3079
02:20:14,661 --> 02:20:16,010
of skills at a high level.

3080
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:19,520
You have to be in,
you might look good with a few moves,

3081
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:21,130
like every blue belt,
like some,

3082
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:23,360
some blue belts have like one nasty
armbar.

3083
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:26,930
Like there's like these dudes that do
like a certain technique and they,

3084
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:28,930
they hone that shit down to razor
sharpness.

3085
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:33,380
But if you can avoid that,
how much else does he have?

3086
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:35,870
So it's,
it's like having an argument with

3087
02:20:35,871 --> 02:20:37,820
someone.
If someone doesn't have a good

3088
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:40,040
vocabulary and you have an argument with
him,

3089
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,390
they might say one thing.
Yeah,

3090
02:20:41,391 --> 02:20:44,990
well you're fucking stupid.
And it might work on some people,

3091
02:20:45,050 --> 02:20:46,070
but you're like,
I'm stupid.

3092
02:20:46,071 --> 02:20:48,050
What about you dummy?
And then he started talking to that

3093
02:20:48,051 --> 02:20:49,580
person.
You start talking with a lot of

3094
02:20:49,581 --> 02:20:51,860
different words,
having a lot of good points,

3095
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:54,950
saying a lot of things that you know
that they can argue against and then he

3096
02:20:54,951 --> 02:20:55,940
starts stunning them.

3097
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:57,740
Right?
That's what a good argument is with two

3098
02:20:57,741 --> 02:20:58,730
people.
Well,

3099
02:20:58,731 --> 02:21:01,670
if an MMA fighter only has like one or
two moves,

3100
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:04,790
we only have a few things.
You're not going to win an argument with

3101
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:08,480
someone is verbally skilled.
Jujitsu is like that in a lot of ways.

3102
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:12,950
Like someone can have a fairly good
vocabulary and a fairly good

3103
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:17,330
understanding of the world,
but if you were in some sort of a debate

3104
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:21,710
with like Richard Dawkins about science,
like you're going to get fucked up.

3105
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:24,050
You know,
if you debate Christopher hitchens while

3106
02:21:24,051 --> 02:21:27,590
he's alive or Sam Harris about religion,
you're going to get fucked up.

3107
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,330
They have more tools,
more weapons,

3108
02:21:29,331 --> 02:21:32,060
more understanding.
That's the same way with Jujitsu.

3109
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:33,830
It's funny,
I like he said,

3110
02:21:33,831 --> 02:21:34,551
Richard,
what's his name?

3111
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:35,610
Richard what?
Richard Dawkins.

3112
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:38,240
He's on a debate team.
He turns a team.

3113
02:21:38,330 --> 02:21:39,163
You're about to fuck

3114
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:43,780
the scientists.
They have no idea about the realm of

3115
02:21:43,781 --> 02:21:46,470
vocabulary.
It's about to rain on their motherfucker

3116
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:49,810
tones
and they just pound them out.

3117
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:52,360
It wouldn't be,
they'd be like clergy,

3118
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,750
clergy been,
they're always debating clergymen,

3119
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:58,290
rabbis,
and all these crazy people that

3120
02:21:58,430 --> 02:22:00,100
ancillary.
It'll leave ancient shit.

3121
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:02,350
Listen man,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

3122
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:04,060
Ian Edwards.
Yeah,

3123
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:06,580
so we're going to do some soccer games,
man.

3124
02:22:06,581 --> 02:22:08,380
You're going to owe you the world of
soccer.

3125
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:10,330
Oh yeah.
He's going to introduce it to me.

3126
02:22:10,570 --> 02:22:12,280
Let me know.
It's very exciting.

3127
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,630
It's fun.
It's funny.

3128
02:22:13,631 --> 02:22:16,990
Do I know what you're gonna do?
What am I going to come and then you're

3129
02:22:16,991 --> 02:22:20,930
going to talk shit.
Well,

3130
02:22:20,950 --> 02:22:22,240
I'll tell you what you,
you people,

3131
02:22:22,241 --> 02:22:24,310
I'm telling you right now,
you go stop falling down when people

3132
02:22:24,311 --> 02:22:25,230
slap you.
Nope.

3133
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:26,190
Nobody likes that.

3134
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,330
Nobody.
Nobody likes.

3135
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:29,100
They shouldn't do it.
You shouldn't do it.

3136
02:22:29,150 --> 02:22:31,950
It's an MBA now too.
He's in the NBA now.

3137
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:34,290
I don't want to hear this,
but it's just shitty.

3138
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:35,790
Like I,
I've never liked it,

3139
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:40,010
but people do it to get the free kick or
the penalty or to get the other person's

3140
02:22:40,011 --> 02:22:41,820
sent off.
It's become a part of the game.

3141
02:22:41,821 --> 02:22:44,210
It's unfortunate.
So let's just get that out the way

3142
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,260
before you're coming because that's,
you're going to see that.

3143
02:22:46,261 --> 02:22:48,330
But besides that,
it's,

3144
02:22:48,331 --> 02:22:49,890
it's a,
it's a man's game.

3145
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:50,570
Yeah.
I mean,

3146
02:22:50,570 --> 02:22:53,740
get the fuck out here.
When Raquel Pennington choked down,

3147
02:22:53,741 --> 02:22:55,870
Ashley,
Evan Smith and blood was pouring down

3148
02:22:55,871 --> 02:22:59,050
her face and she strangled or
unconscious with one second to go with a

3149
02:22:59,051 --> 02:23:01,480
bulldog choke in the first round.
That's a girl,

3150
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:05,710
135 pound girl.
And you get smacked of running down the

3151
02:23:05,711 --> 02:23:06,370
field.
Like,

3152
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:07,780
oh,
this is bullshit.

3153
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:10,190
They hold their mouth.
They roll around like a

3154
02:23:10,250 --> 02:23:11,083
baby.
Yeah.

3155
02:23:11,090 --> 02:23:12,810
And women.
And when you watch women's soccer,

3156
02:23:12,890 --> 02:23:13,910
women don't do that.

3157
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:18,440
Women don't do that.
Women do not take dies and get smashed.

3158
02:23:18,441 --> 02:23:21,680
Someone needs to start a campaign.
Maybe we can help and maybe your

3159
02:23:21,681 --> 02:23:22,670
podcast,
because you have a,

3160
02:23:22,690 --> 02:23:24,870
a suburb.
What is your podcast?

3161
02:23:24,871 --> 02:23:26,120
Tell them soccer,
comic rant.

3162
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,650
Soccer.
Comic rent.

3163
02:23:27,651 --> 02:23:29,240
Maybe we can help.
Maybe we can help.

3164
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:31,160
Alright,
go home.

3165
02:23:31,161 --> 02:23:32,870
You fucks.
Or if you are home,

3166
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:34,720
go to sleep or do what it.
Don't listen to me.

3167
02:23:34,730 --> 02:23:36,530
Do whatever you fucking want to do.
Much love everybody.

3168
02:23:36,950 --> 02:23:39,140
Uh,
Ian Edwards comic on twitter.

3169
02:23:39,170 --> 02:23:44,170
Ian Edwards comic on Instagram.
What else was comedian.com boom.

3170
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:45,350
See?
Yeah.
