1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,680
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,930
I think it would change
the consciousness period.

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:07,890
I think human beings would develop a
completely different sense of reality

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:08,520
itself,

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,430
completely different cells of
our perspective in the universe.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,590
I think it's terms that
I didn't mind expanding.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,350
I didn't get one.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,630
Probably took a small dose.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,830
How much do I need to take?

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,200
Five grams usually in darkness.

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,580
If you can get an isolation tank,

12
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,414
go that way.

13
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,063
Don't be a pussy.

14
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,400
If you're talking about mushrooms
and you haven't gotten the big route.

15
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,373
I haven't,

16
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,240
you know,

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,750
you've dipped your toes in the water.

18
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,980
You haven't jumped into the ocean.

19
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,480
Can I tell you my mushroom story?

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,400
It's pretty funny.

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
Yeah.

22
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,780
With some friends we went camping,

23
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,790
we were doing mushrooms and uh,

24
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,460
we're all standing in this lake in Idaho,

25
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:41,910
uh,

26
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,170
with some redneck families camping all
around us and we're like two gay guys and

27
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,250
straight go straight.

28
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,380
Couple and were just tripping out of
our minds are mushrooms that we're

29
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:49,681
standing.

30
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,770
It's like in these fish are nibbling
or the hairs on her legs and we're all

31
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:52,980
like,

32
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,813
whoa.

33
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,810
And then suddenly there's a boat going
back and forth in front of us that has

34
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,440
dare the drug resistance education logo,

35
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,140
that's the police boat that's going
back and forth in front of us.

36
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,290
And then a prop airplane
comes right at us.

37
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,180
We're like standing there
and this airplane is like,

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,680
we see it in the sky,

39
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:11,970
it's getting lower and lower.

40
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,530
It's pointed right at us.

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,870
It comes over right at us at the boat.

42
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:16,704
And we were all like,

43
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,700
are we see?

44
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,890
Are you seeing each other?

45
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,280
And then the airplane went right over
our heads and we all shit ourselves.

46
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,540
We were terrified.

47
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,160
We look how with the fucking disappeared
like right behind us on this little

48
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,760
rise.

49
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,090
And we're like,

50
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,930
what the fuck?

51
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,960
And we ran up there thinking it was
going to be a plane crash and there is a

52
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,961
runway we didn't see because we've come
down to the beach sideways and along the

53
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:39,511
sand.

54
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,340
And there was an airport right there.

55
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,770
But there was this moment
where like we're tripping,

56
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,990
the fish are eating us the
dare boats going like this,

57
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:46,930
which is making us paranoid.

58
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:50,810
And now here comes the plane for our
heads and have done mushroom sentence and

59
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,450
maybe that's why.

60
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,871
Yeah,

61
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,910
that's probably a bad
place to do mushrooms.

62
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,911
Set and setting is one of
the most important thing
as well where you were on a

63
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,690
boat with a fucking dare boat going by
and a plane flying and you're at a runway

64
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:04,830
and we had no idea.

65
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,000
We were standing at the foot of a runner.

66
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,420
Yeah,

67
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,450
you can smoke pot and do Jujitsu
with no problem whatsoever.

68
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,493
No problem.

69
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,401
Small pot.

70
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,510
And you're very coordinated.

71
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,830
Smoke Pot and something drops.

72
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,610
You catch it.

73
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,110
Like your reflex is everything.

74
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:17,430
They're all there and it lasts.

75
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,760
You're not used to it if you're not
used to it all you're thinking of.

76
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,440
I remember when I first
started getting high,

77
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,810
joey started making fun of me because we,

78
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,250
I forget what we did.

79
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:26,460
We.

80
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,790
Oh,

81
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,720
I remember we went to um,

82
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,250
the fucking Sunday brunch
at a house of Blues.

83
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,690
Remember they had that Gospel Brunch
and then that Gospel brunch chest,

84
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,870
that's how we all went over there.

85
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,260
We all went over there and
we were toasted to the gills.

86
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,320
It was like one of the first weekends
I ever got high and Joey d is like,

87
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,170
look at this fucking
rookie and I was going,

88
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I can't believe a high.

89
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:47,301
Um,

90
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,630
right now this is ridiculous.

91
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,523
I can't,

92
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,550
I have to sit here.

93
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,750
I wasn't used to it.

94
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,820
I didn't know how to deal with it,

95
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,100
but if I was the same high right now,

96
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,380
I'd be fine because I know what that is.

97
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,280
It's,

98
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,920
it's what you're doing is when you're
too high and you're paranoid and you're

99
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:03,754
frozen,

100
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,100
you're frozen because you
don't know what it is.

101
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't know what,

102
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,640
what comes next because
this is going to get worse.

103
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm not going to get more crazy.

104
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,133
It was,

105
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,061
oh my God,

106
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,290
how long is this going to last?

107
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,850
But when you're used to being high,

108
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm just high dude.

109
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,573
Relax.

110
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,473
Everything's fine.

111
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,530
You know what it is.

112
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,180
He knows the worst it gets,

113
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,661
you know,

114
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,470
the best it gets.

115
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,850
You felt the full,

116
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,520
the full range of the effects.

117
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,960
But you were laughing at me.

118
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,794
I'll never forget.

119
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,300
He like,

120
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,491
look,

121
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,570
it is fucking rookie.

122
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,650
I agree with what you first get high.

123
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,660
You get so enjoyably agree
and joy like the symbolic,

124
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich is
fucking Philemon and your mouth and you

125
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,900
eat it with a bag of chips
when your senses right.

126
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,140
Yet I just said it's.

127
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,830
It's so you don't even breathe.

128
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:00,660
You're just chewing like I have a
giggling like I love to giggle pro.

129
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,230
A couple of weeks ago I had a cookie
and I was sitting there as so fucking

130
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,890
stoned at 8:00 at night and
I kept thinking to myself,

131
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,950
this is the same cookie KCC case of eight.

132
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,090
It was the weekend.

133
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,500
It was the week that he was
busy that he went ms dot.

134
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,390
He died or something.

135
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,340
I felt so bad.

136
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,930
I grew up on fucking Casey case,

137
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,420
but then there was traffic.

138
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,840
I was watching the news that day.

139
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,980
There was traffic on the four,

140
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:23,461
oh five.

141
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:23,821
And I'm like,

142
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,654
oh my God,

143
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,430
this traffic on the four or five,

144
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:26,930
they'll listen.

145
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,350
They said that the cause of the traffic
was at the president of Israel was the

146
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,390
four or and I have with thinking about
was the president of Israel knows about

147
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:38,424
these cookies.

148
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,830
Cookie Casey case of he's covered
to la to get these cookies.

149
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,950
That's how I was.

150
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,450
I kept giggling at the
thought of my thoughts.

151
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,710
That's hilarious.

152
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,390
Was happy and I love that.

153
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,130
I love still giggling.

154
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,540
That's what I miss the most
about being stolen to Gill's.

155
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,443
Go to a diner.

156
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,603
The waitress,

157
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,230
just gay boy.

158
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,650
You just fucking.

159
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,010
You can't control yourself like this.

160
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,870
All that shit.

161
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,880
The simple pleasures.

162
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,240
Even before,

163
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,680
like I surprised myself that I became
a world champion and kickboxing.

164
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,570
I just wanted to fight to validate my
coaching and I just kept winning fights

165
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,171
like,

166
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:18,321
oh,

167
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:19,520
I guess I'm all right at this,

168
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,460
but at the end of the day
I'm still the biggest fan.

169
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,330
Like I,

170
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,780
I,

171
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,400
you're going to have to
kick me out of here today.

172
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,810
I could just keep.

173
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,200
You want to look at more fights.

174
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,190
Like I can watch it till the
cows come home with a man

175
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,520
that's,

176
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,811
you know,

177
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:37,790
that's why I don't watch other sports
because I think we're in the coolest

178
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,240
sport.

179
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,730
There's,

180
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,111
you know what?

181
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,450
The two oldest sports on
the planet are wrestling?

182
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,150
No fighting and runners.

183
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,213
Oh,

184
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,430
either run.

185
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,710
Not The be food or run to get your food,

186
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,670
rather fight not to be food fight.

187
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,260
They're the two most
primal things you can do.

188
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,590
Yeah.

189
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,550
Especially fighting.

190
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,923
I mean,

191
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,790
that's what this kinda kind of,

192
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,350
um,

193
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:00,771
it's uh,

194
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,180
cicero quote on my arm,

195
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,520
the best protector of
the sheep is the wolf.

196
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:08,540
I believe that some people in there
wolves and some people are sheep.

197
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,171
You know,

198
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,430
people love fighting there.

199
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,061
The wolves,

200
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:11,900
they're the protector,

201
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,010
so you know,

202
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,480
and it's Kinda like training days,

203
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,030
talking about it takes a wolf,

204
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:17,270
the,

205
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,781
a wolf.

206
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,080
But like fighting is dude,

207
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,060
it's the most primal thing.

208
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,870
I'm still miss that.

209
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,050
That dude wants to kick my ass.

210
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,060
I got to kick his ass.

211
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,140
It's,

212
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,730
it's the most nerve wracking.

213
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,863
It's like a.

214
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,640
all right.

215
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,200
So I was a little experimental when I
was a child and teenager after I lost my

216
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,034
sister,

217
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,430
I saw about 25 or 26
grateful dead concerts.

218
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,990
And I,

219
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,400
I'll use this analogy.

220
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,960
I'd say that I'm

221
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,400
fighting your first fight if
you've never done it before,

222
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,890
it's like taking acid.

223
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,700
Either find yourself or lose yourself.

224
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,810
I've seen people are the baddest
ass person on the planet,

225
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,910
they're the best fighter in the gym and
they go to the fight and they just melt

226
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:05,511
like butter.

227
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,500
They're just can't,

228
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:07,810
you know,

229
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,050
it's like they trip out,

230
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,890
you know,

231
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,723
and I.

232
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,820
that's what I love about fighting you
gotta take who you are in that in the gym

233
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,170
and you're a God in front of 20 people
and I'll do it in front of 20,000 people

234
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,460
or in a local show,

235
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,410
do it in front of 2100 people.

236
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,250
It still,

237
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,960
I love that vortex,

238
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:30,030
that rush of improving ground,

239
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,690
true proven ground.

240
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,200
An exposure of truth like nothing else
because that's what I think it's like

241
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,240
I've seen so many people lose themselves.
